risk appetite,Meeting next week to discuss Glasgow's 2026 Commonwealth Games bid,2024-09-15,2024-09-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj8pe2180o,"A meeting will be held next week about Glasgow's bid to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games.  The Scottish government confirmed it would discuss the proposal with Commonwealth Games Australia.  Australian authorities have promised ""a multi-million pound investment"" to help finalise Glasgow's offer to rescue the 2026 Games. It comes after the Australian state of Victoria withdrew as hosts last year due to rising costs. A Scottish government spokesman said talks were ""ongoing"" but no decision had been taken. They added: ""As part of these discussions, the health secretary will meet with Commonwealth Games Australia next week."" Glasgow hosted the Games in 2014, but the 2026 event would be scaled down after years of difficulty for the competition.  It would feature between 10 and 13 sports, compared to 18 in 2014. Earlier this week, it emerged that the UK government offered £2.3m to help cover safety and security costs associated with the privately-funded event, but asked the Scottish government to match that figure. However, Holyrood politicians remain concerned by what cabinet minister Neil Gray called the ""reputational risk and financial risk"" of the bid. Gray stressed that this would not be a replica of the 2014 games.  ""This is a smaller version, with fewer sports over fewer sites, so therefore there is a reputation risk as well as financial risk,"" he said. Commonwealth Games Australia have offered to bridge any shortfall.  They have told both their Scottish counterparts and the Scottish government that they are prepared to invest some of the compensation they received when the Australian state of Victoria cancelled its plans. Commonwealth Games Australia's president, Ben Houston, said: ""We appreciate that the model is different and that that creates perceived financial and reputational challenges, but we have every confidence in the model."" Commonwealth Games Scotland - who are behind the Glasgow bid - have already welcomed the offer. In a statement released earlier this week they said the Australians' ""willingness to invest, to further alleviate concerns of perceived financial and reputational risk, shows the high regard on which our cost-effective proposal is held within the global sport and events community."" To save money only four venues would be used – including Scotstoun Stadium and the Tollcross International Swimming Centre. However, Glasgow City Council is currently trying to manage budget cuts, raising questions over whether there is an appetite among people in the city to host the event again."
risk appetite,UK government offers to share financial risk for Glasgow Games,2024-09-15,2024-09-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2x01ex48no,"The UK government has offered to share the financial risk for Glasgow's Commonwealth Games bid in 2026. However, it has rejected a request by the Scottish government to underwrite the entire cost of the Games. BBC Scotland has seen a letter from UK sports minister Stephanie Peacock to the Scottish health secretary Neil Gray which outlines her backing for ""an additional contribution of up to £2.3m"" to be provided for the event. She then states it would be her ""strong preference"" that the Scottish government match that figure, which would help cover any increase in safety and security costs if terror threat levels rise before the games. According to the letter, Gray told the UK government in August that Glasgow hosting the Games would be ""contingent on the UK government providing a full, uncapped underwrite of financial risk connected to the event"". In her response, Peacock writes that the ""justification for your request... is less clear"" and that the UK government ""cannot commit to fully underwriting the risk for an event the Scottish government has committed to host"". She added an underwrite had not been requested by Commonwealth Games Scotland and that around £27m is already earmarked as a contingency fund.  Peacock's letter also stated none of the proposed funding could be used ""to enhance the concept or ambition of the Games"", seemingly in response to a  suggestion from Neil Gray that some of the extra money could go towards bolstering the stripped-back event. Gray told BBC Scotland News that he would ""leave no stone unturned"" to fund the Games but reiterated previous comments that there was both a ""reputational risk and a financial risk"" to the bid. He said: ""We've set out very clearly that there cannot be a financial risk - we do not have that cover, particularly in an in-year position when the Games are being held, because we do not have the same opportunity, as the UK government does, to vary our budget in-year. We would have to find savings elsewhere."" He added that this Friday would not be a cut-off point for a final decision being made but that ""time was of the essence"" regarding the proposal, which he described as ""very ambitious"".  The first minister John Swinney previously told newspapers that public funds would not be used on the Games. Glasgow hosted the Games in 2014, but the 2026 event would be scaled down after years of difficulty for the competition. It would feature between 10-13 sports, instead of the 18 that took place in the 2014 edition. Victoria in Australia was originally slated to host but pulled out in 2023 due to financial issues. Organisers have since scrambled to find a replacement, with Glasgow suggested earlier this year. Commonwealth Games Scotland previously stated their proposal would involve ""no significant ask of public funds"" and that to save money only four venues would be used – including Scotstoun Stadium and the swimming pool at Tollcross. However, Glasgow City Council is currently trying to manage budget cuts, raising questions over whether there is an appetite among people in the city to host the event again.  Last month, Commonwealth Games Scotland warned that it would be a ""a travesty"" if the competition was not hosted in Scotland, saying turning down the opportunity  could also impact the future of high-performance sport in the country.

risk appetite,'Small number' of hepatitis A cases probed in Lanarkshire,2024-09-15,2024-09-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0rx278lkdo,"NHS Lanarkshire is investigating ""a small number"" of confirmed cases of hepatitis A in the Cumbernauld area. Two of the cases are children - one who attends a local school and another who attends a local nursery. Hepatitis A is a viral infection which leads to inflammation of the liver and can cause mild to severe illness.  It is usually spread by poor hygiene after using the toilet, especially in young children or people who do not maintain good personal hygiene. But it can also be spread through contaminated food. Staff and children at the school and nursery, as well as their close family members and people they live with, are being strongly encouraged to receive the hepatitis A vaccine. Dr Alison Smith-Palmer, consultant in public health, said: “We are working with the school and the nursery and we are in regular contact with the cases and their families.  ""To protect patient confidentiality, we will not be providing any further information about the school, nursery or any of the cases. “We are strongly recommending that the staff and children who attend the school and nursery and their close family members, those who live in the same household, receive the hepatitis A vaccine.” Symptoms of acute hepatitis A disease include a flu-like illness, loss of appetite, nausea, fever, diarrhoea, dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pains, and/or jaundice. Dr Smith-Palmer added: “As a precautionary measure, we are offering the vaccine to not only the children and staff who attend or work at the school or nursery, but also their close family members. “Good hand hygiene is important in reducing the risk of spread of the virus.”"
risk appetite,Manx import ban continues amid UK bluetongue cases,2024-09-15,2024-08-30,Rebecca Brahde,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rx12pg65no,"A ban on the importation of livestock to the Isle of Man will remain in place amid new cases of the bluetongue virus in the UK, the government's chief vet has said.  Livestock imports were suspended in November 2023 following an initial outbreak of the virus, which was the first since 2007. Amy Beckett said that by continuing to ""restrict the import of susceptible animals"" from the UK, it would ""significantly reduce the risk"" of a Manx outbreak. Four cases of bluetongue, which can cause infertility and breeding problems in animals and can be fatal, were confirmed in Norfolk and Suffolk this week. The cases are the first in the UK since March and livestock transportation around affected farms has been halted. The Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture said bluetongue did not affect people or food safety, meaning that animal products were safe to consume. Dr Beckett said it was important for farmers to ""monitor their animals frequently for signs such as lameness, lesions in and around the mouth, and a loss of appetite"" and report any concerns to the department ""immediately"". The import ban applies to animals classified as a ruminant, which includes cows, sheep, goats and deer, and restricts the import of their germinal products such as semen and embryos. Those looking to import those products must contact the department ""to ensure they comply with the requirements"", Dr Beckett said. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

risk appetite,"Ozempic could delay ageing, researchers suggest",2024-09-15,2024-08-31,Sam Hancock,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce81j919gdjo,"A drug used to treat Type 2 diabetes and obesity could also slow down the process of ageing, researchers believe. Semaglutide, better known as Ozempic, ""has far-reaching benefits beyond what we initially imagined,"" Prof Harlan Krumholz, from the Yale School of Medicine, said following the publication of several new studies. They found that the drug could be used to treat a wide range of illnesses linked to heart failure, arthritis, Alzheimer's and even cancer. ""It wouldn't surprise me that improving people's health this way actually slows down the ageing process,"" Prof Krumholz was quoted on Friday as telling the European Society of Cardiology Conference 2024, where the studies were presented. The new data has been published in a number of medical journals, including the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), which Prof Krumholz edits. ""These ground-breaking medications are poised to revolutionise cardiovascular care and could dramatically enhance cardiovascular health,"" he said. The studies - part of the Select trial - tracked more than 17,600 people, aged 45 or older, as they were given either 2.4 mg of semaglutide or a placebo for more than three years.  Participants were obese or overweight and had cardiovascular disease but not diabetes. Those who took the drug died at a lower rate from all causes, including cardiovascular issues and Covid-19, researchers found. People using the weight-loss drug were just as likely to catch Covid but they were less likely to die from it, with 2.6% dying among those on semaglutide compared with 3.1% on the placebo. And while women experienced fewer major adverse cardiovascular events, the drug ""consistently reduced the risk"" of adverse cardiovascular outcomes regardless of sex. It also improved heart failure symptoms and cut levels of inflammation in the body regardless of whether or not people lost weight. Dr Benjamin Scirica, lead author of one of the studies and a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the findings ""reinforce that overweight and obesity increases the risk of death due to many etiologies"". But, he told the PA news agency, this ""can be modified with potent incretin-based therapies like semaglutide"". The medication is a prescription drug offered by the NHS, which supresses appetite and is sold under the brand names Wegovy - used to treat obesity - and Ozempic, for diabetes. It comes in the form of an injection and mimics the hormone GLP-1, making people feel fuller and less hungry. Experts have warned in the past that the drug is not a quick fix or a replacement for eating well and exercising, and should only be offered under medical supervision. Like any medication, there can be side effects and risks - the most common being nausea, an upset stomach, bloating and gas."
risk appetite,Nurses working in fear: BBC visits mpox epicentre,2024-09-15,2024-09-10,Simi Jolaoso,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gen21ln7go,"Medical staff on the front line of the battle against mpox in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have told the BBC they are desperate for vaccines to arrive so they can stem the rate of new infections. At a treatment centre in South Kivu province that the BBC visited in the epicentre of the outbreak, they say more patients are arriving every day - especially babies - and there is a shortage of essential equipment. Mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - is a highly contagious disease and has killed at least 635 people in DR Congo this year. Even though 200,000 vaccines, donated by the European Commission, were flown into the capital, Kinshasa, last week, they are yet to be transported across this vast country - and it could be several weeks before they reach South Kivu. “We've learned from social media that the vaccine is already available,” Emmanuel Fikiri, a nurse working at the clinic that has been turned into a specialist centre to tackle the virus, told the BBC. He said this was the first time he had treated patients with mpox and every day he feared catching it and passing it on to his own children - aged seven, five and one. “You saw how I touched the patients because that's my job as a nurse. So, we're asking the government to help us by first giving us the vaccines.” The reason it will take time to transport the vaccines is that they need to be stored at a precise temperature  - below freezing - to maintain their potency, plus they need to be sent to rural areas of South Kivu, like Kamituga, Kavumu and Lwiro, where the outbreak is rife. The lack of infrastructure and bad roads mean that helicopters could possibly be used to drop some of the vaccines, which will further drive up costs in a country that is already struggling financially. At the community clinic, Dr Pacifique Karanzo appeared fatigued and downbeat having been rushed off his feet all morning. Although he wore a face shield, I could see the sweat running down his face. He said he was saddened to see patients sharing beds. “You will even see that the patients are sleeping on the floor,” he told me, clearly exasperated. “The only support we have already had is a little medicine for the patients and water. As far as other challenges are concerned, there's still no staff motivation.” Another problem, he said, was that there was not enough personal protective equipment [PPE] for the medics. “We try to do what we can to look after the sick and not put ourselves at risk either. We're not spared from disease.” As you enter Lwiro community hospital, which is about an hour’s drive north of South Kivu’s main city of Bukavu, two main things hit you. First the resounding and loud cries of babies. The second is the stench - a mix of urine and stagnant water. The clinic is running out of clean water, meaning they have to ration what they have in the small jerrycans underneath their beds. Within the last three weeks, the clinic, which usually treats about 80 patients a month, has been inundated with nearly 200 patients - who are getting younger. “It’s sad to see my firstborn suffering from this strange disease. I have a lot of pain in my heart,” 18-year-old Faraja Rukara said. Her son, Murhula, is currently the youngest mpox case at the clinic - at only four weeks old.  This is the first time she, like many others here, have encountered mpox, which is caused by a virus in the same family as smallpox. The disease causes a loss of appetite, leaving many of the children malnourished. In an adjacent room, several women and children - nearly 20 - were crammed inside, sharing only seven beds and two mattresses that were laid on the floor. The hospital’s first mpox case did recover - 10-month-old Amenipa Kabuya. But not long after being discharged, her mother, Yvette Kabuya, returned as she too has fallen ill with mpox. Witnessing what the disease does to the body - the painful puss-filled lesions, the fever and the weight loss - means people are keen for the vaccines - unusual in an area that has witnessed vaccine hesitancy in the past. Beatrice Kachera, 50, gently caressed the cheek of her three-year-old granddaughter who she had rushed here in a panic: “I just saw the child get sick, I didn’t even know the name of the disease. “We can't wait for children and even adults to die. Bring on the vaccines,” she told the BBC. But some fear the ongoing armed conflict in eastern DR Congo between the army and several armed groups, most notably the M23 rebels, is not going to make this easy. ""The conflict is having a profound effect on the vaccination programme in general,” Dr Gaston Bulambo, head of North Kivu Provincial Health Division, told the BBC. “It's not just vaccination against mpox, but all vaccination programmes are suffering because of difficulties in getting vaccines to health zones. This is due to the insecurity."" South Kivu’s governor, who hails from Lwiro himself, told the BBC the intense fighting was driving many from their homes to his province, which was exacerbating the spread of the disease. “We are accommodating thousands of IDPs [internally displaced people], and still struggling with many issues,” Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki said. “Most of the money is being injected in tackling the war which is going on, to buy military equipment, to feed the military,” he said. “The country is losing a lot of money in trying to address this war, rather than injecting [this money] into social development including the health sector.” However, the governor believed that the rebel groups would not disrupt vaccine deliveries as mpox was also affecting people in the areas they controlled. He said the government was doing its best to get medics what they need: “In the next two days, I am going to Lwiro myself. I will deliver definitely what is available in terms of urgent assistance for the population, until the government in Kinshasa can offer more support.” The authorities say vaccinations will begin in October, with children under the age of 17, as well as those who have been in close contact with infected patients, first in line. Governor Purusi Sadiki is convinced the outbreak in his province will be contained: “It’s a matter of political will. I am confident that we will succeed.” It is a sentiment not yet shared by exhausted medics, like Dr Karanzo, at Lwiro hospital - but they are at least heartened that mpox awareness appears to be growing in their region. People appear to be coming to the clinic as soon as they get symptoms rather than first going to traditional healers, which means the hospital is yet to experience an mpox fatality. Yet with 5,049 confirmed cases since the start of the year in DR Congo, the clinic’s staff say speed is of the essence - only with a combination of vaccines, medicine and other supplies to allow for better hygiene, will the outbreak be curbed.

risk appetite,Actors demand action over 'disgusting' explicit video game scenes,2024-09-15,2024-08-16,Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23l4ml51jmo,"Performers working in the games industry have spoken of their distress at being asked to work on explicit content without notice, including a scene featuring a sexual assault. Sex scenes are common in modern games - and are often made by filming human actors who are then digitised into game characters. But performers have told the BBC a culture of secrecy around projects - where scripts are often not shared until the last moment - means they frequently do not know in advance that scenes may involve intimate acts. They describe feeling ""shaken"" and ""upset"" after acting them out. Performing arts union Equity is demanding action from the industry - it has published guides on minimum pay, and working conditions in games, including on intimate or explicit scenes. Jessica Jefferies is a professional casting director, who works mainly in video games and enjoys the medium. Prior to that she was a motion capture performer - part of a small group who worked regularly for studios used by game developers. Dressed in a skin-tight body suit, covered in markers, motion capture performers act-out the movements of characters in games on a large unfurnished set, where their motions are recorded digitally. She said performers were often left in the dark about the nature of the game, or the scene, by developers. ""We'd get an email or a call from a studio saying we need you on these days for a shoot,"" she said.  ""That was all the information we'd get."" Ms Jefferies told the BBC she was once asked to act out a scene with a male performer involving a sexual assault with no prior warning. ""I turned up and was told what I would be filming would be a graphic rape scene,"" she said.  ""This act could be watched for as long or as little time as the player wanted through a window, and then a player would be able to shoot this character in the head. ""It was just purely gratuitous in my opinion."" She refused to act out the ""disgusting"" scene - which was made worse as she was the only female on set. ""There's no nudity involved, but its still an act and there's an intimacy in that act and also a violence in this situation,"" she said.  ""So yes there may be a layer of Lycra between us, but you are still there and still having to truly immerse yourself in this scene."" In the end her concerns were listened to and the scene was not recorded. But it reinforces her belief that performers should know in advance about explicit scenes so they don't have to ""kick up a fuss"" on set or feel pressure to do something which makes them feel uncomfortable. Ms Jefferies was consulted by Equity in the development of their guidance which requires that when recording explicit or intimate scenes: She argues giving actors more information will help them deliver better performances and argues ""there is an appetite for change"". Ms Jefferies stresses the guidelines are not trying to put boundaries on storytelling. In the ten years since that incident there have also been major improvements, she says - and ""these guidelines are just to bring it even more in line with the best practices in the film and TV industry"". She says the studios she now works with are generally very open to being educated on good practices, and agree that treating people well leads to better performances. One voice actor and Equity member who supports the guidelines, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told the BBC of problems she had encountered.  She ""absolutely loves the industry"" but argues the limited information shared with actors before a performance needs to change. ""We have to sign NDAs [non-disclosure agreements], we're told almost nothing,"" she said.  In one recording for a major game she first learned it was explicit only when she turned up for work.  ""This was actually a full-on sex scene,"" she said.  ""I had to [vocally] match the scene and through the glass in the booth was the entire team, all male, watching me. ""It was excruciating... at that stage I had been in the games industry a while, and I had never felt so shaken"". She compared the experience to unexpectedly being required to perform for a premium rate phone-sex line.  ""What upset me so much about the situation is I was put on the spot, nobody thought to ask me if I was ok with it, and nobody checked to see if I was ok afterwards,"" she said. And as a freelancer, she feared being labelled as a troublemaker by refusing.  ""Nobody has to justify why they're not hiring you,"" she said. Like Ms Jefferies, she wants games to move closer to standards in film and TV. Rhiannon Bevan of game news site The Gamer has covered the steps last year's gaming blockbuster Baldur's Gate 3 took in dealing with explicit scenes as an example of a modern game ""getting it right"". She says games are increasingly taking explicit scenes seriously ""and not just using them for titillation"". But it came with the risk that performers may not be comfortable with the work. Baldur's Gate 3 addressed this by employing intimacy co-ordinators - dedicated members of staff tasked with ensuring the well-being of performers in explicit scenes. Its developer used one intimacy co-ordinator to look after performers voicing intimate scenes, while another looked after those who were also miming actions to be digitised into the game. As well as intimate scenes, the Equity guidelines also cover the overuse of NDAs, safety during motion and performance capture, avoiding harmful vocal stress for artists and the protections around the use of artificial intelligence. AI use is one of the key issues behind a continuing strike by games performers in the US. UKIE, the trade body for the games industry, did not respond directly to the issue of the treatment of performers working on explicit material, but said in relation to Equity's guidelines that its focus ""remains on fostering a supportive environment for all stakeholders in the UK video game sector, ensuring it remains the best place to create, play, and sell video games""."
risk appetite,Daisy Ridley reveals Graves' disease diagnosis,2024-09-15,2024-08-07,Ian Youngs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0rl8kpvz2o,"Actress Daisy Ridley has spoken for the first time about being diagnosed with Graves' disease, an autoimmune condition that mainly affects young and middle-aged women. Ridley, 32, known for playing Rey in the later Star Wars films, initially put symptoms including a racing heart rate, weight loss, fatigue and hand tremors down to the effects of making a recent film. ""I thought, well, I’ve just played a really stressful role, presumably that’s why I feel poorly,"" she told Women's Health.  But she was then diagnosed after a doctor suggested it could be Graves', which he told her often makes people feel ""tired but wired"". Ridley realised she had been feeling particularly irritable, she said. ""It was funny. I was like, oh, I just thought I was annoyed at the world, but turns out everything is functioning so quickly, you can’t chill out."" She told the magazine that women should not be prepared to accept feeling unwell. ""We all read the stats about women being undiagnosed or underdiagnosed and [it's about] sort of coming to terms with saying, 'I really, actually don't feel good' and not going, 'I'm fine, I’m fine, I’m fine, I’m fine.' ""It’s just normalised to not feel good."" Graves' disease is related to an overactive thyroid and is ""much less severe than what a lot of people go through"", Ridley said. But she added: ""Even if you can deal with it, you shouldn’t have to. If there’s a problem, you shouldn’t have to just [suffer through it]."" After getting her diagnosis almost a year ago and making other lifestyle and diet changes, she said she became aware of the difference they had made. ""I didn’t realise how bad I felt before,"" she said. ""Then I looked back and thought, How did I do that?"" The British actress is known for appearing in Star Wars films including The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, as well as the recent dramas Magpie and Young Woman and The Sea. Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition where your immune system produces antibodies that cause the thyroid to produce too much thyroid hormone, according to the NHS. About 80% of people with an overactive thyroid gland have it. The cause is unknown, but it mostly affects young or middle-aged women and often runs in families. Smoking can also increase your risk of getting it. Symptoms can include: In 2011, US rapper Missy Elliott, then 39, said she had it, and that it had made her hair fall out and shut down her nervous system."
risk appetite,Pharmacists warn over fake weight-loss jabs,2024-09-15,2024-08-05,André Rhoden-Paul,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qeee33883o,"Pharmacists have warned people not to buy fake weight-loss jabs online as a shortage of Ozempic is expected to stretch into next year.  The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) suggested there could be a possible ""explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online"" as a result. Weight-loss injections have been popularised with celebrity endorsements and before and after pictures online, but fake versions can be dangerous. Ozempic is a brand of semaglutides which help people with type 2 diabetes regulate their blood sugar levels, but are increasingly being prescribed for weight loss in some countries. Currently there is a shortage of Ozempic due to high demand and some doctors prescribing off-label, as it is not licensed for weight loss.  While Ozempic, available on the NHS, helps people with type 2 diabetes, its ability to suppress appetite has led to people using it to lose weight.  This has led to a shortage of the drug as well as an increase in counterfeit jabs.  Wegovy, another brand of semaglutide, is licensed for weight management and is also available on the NHS.  The NPA, which represents 5,000 independent community pharmacies across the UK, is urging people to speak to a pharmacist or GP instead of buying medicines online from sellers who are not registered or regulated in the UK.  It also warned the shortage of Ozempic, made by pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, is likely to continue into next year.  NPA chairman Nick Kaye said: “Pharmacists remain deeply concerned that the current medicine shortages crisis could lead to an explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online. “Stocks of Ozempic are very depleted in community pharmacy in the UK and it is important that these remain prioritised for those in the most clinical need. “Given the precarious state of supply of this and other vital medication, there is a much greater risk of people looking to order in supplies from disreputable online vendors."" Last year the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reported a very small number of people being hospitalised, including for hypoglycaemic shock and coma, after using potentially fake pens.   In January, the Department of Health and Social Care told healthcare providers not to prescribe the drugs off-label for weight loss and said existing stock must be reserved for patients with type 2 diabetes.  It said the supply issues were being caused by increased demand and off-label use.  ""We don’t know how prevalent off-label prescribing is but we do know [it happens],"" Mr Kaye said.  He suggested people can check to see if an online provider is registered by the General Pharmaceutical Council or Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We strongly advise the public not to buy regulated medicines from unauthorised online retailers or beauty salons as they could be dangerous."" It added the MHRA would continue to take action against those unlawfully trading in medicines, and said that the government was trying to tackle the obesity crisis by shifting the focus from treatment to prevention.

risk appetite,Me-ow! Kenyan feline lovers fret over cat-tax plan,2024-09-15,2024-08-02,Basillioh Rukanga,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4wgddkey2o,"Feline lovers in Kenya’s capital have been twitching over the threat of what is perceived as a “cat tax” - and any talk of tax in the East African nation raises the hackles. The proposal comes via the Nairobi City County which wants all cats to be registered by their owners – which some are moaning is a “cat-astrophe”. It would require cat owners in Nairobi to purchase an annual licence - costing 200 Kenyan shillings ($1.50; £1.20) along with proof that the animal has had a rabies vaccination. Not only that, but “purrents” - as cat owners are known - would need to take responsibility for their furry friend’s behaviour, and we all know that a cat does not take direction well. According to the city’s Animal Control and Welfare Bill, they would have to ensure their pets do not ""scream or cry in a manner that disturbs the peace"" of residents. They would also be required to confine cats on heat. The proposed legislation is aimed at improving cat welfare, but some jaundiced city residents need convincing. Kenyans recently forced the government to withdraw a finance bill introducing a raft of contentious taxes - and this plan by Nairobi county is seen by some as part of the government’s appetite for raising more revenue. “First taxes on period products, now taxing cat owners. Leave my pussy alone!” Khadijah M Farah said on X, referencing the now-dropped finance bill. Some Kenyans are also raising questions about how enforceable it is, given the high population of stray or feral cats. The city's feline population - lions in the Nairobi National Park excluded - is not known, but they are ubiquitous: prowling on streets, lounging in shops, and foraging at rubbish tips and restaurants. Yowling from various cats in different registers can often punctuate the hush of night, especially during mating season. Naomi Mutua, who with more than a dozen cats calls herself Nairobi’s ""mother of cats"", told the BBC the county authorities should have checked with cat owners, rescue organisations and veterinary groups before coming up with the draft law. She runs a Facebook group of about 25,000 cat lovers and says the introduction of mandatory rabies vaccinations is a good thing but queries how it will be achieved in reality. About 2,000 Kenyans die every year from rabies caused by dog or cat bites, according to the health ministry. And Ms Mutua says the first premise of any new law should start with improving “standards of care that are lacking”. She wonders whether confining a cat on heat would be “restricting them from their natural behaviour”. A public consultation is being organised by the county - to begin this Friday. City residents will be able to give their views about the bill - which may inform further amendments to be considered by the county assembly. For the head of the Kenya Society for the Protection and Care of Animals (KSPCA), Emma Ngugi, the draft legislation is a welcome move given that animal welfare in the city is a “huge problem”. But licences, she feels, are probably not the answer as people may not want to claim ownership of cats. Some people may end up throwing out their cats if they are forced to pay for them, which would defeat the purpose of the bill. “If you introduce what is essentially a tax on cats, then it's going to be even harder for organisations like us working in communities to get people to take responsibility,” she told the BBC. Ms Ngugi also points out that there is already legislation on dog ownership that is ignored as most people do not bother to get licences for them - even those who can afford to do so. Under the proposed bill, cat owners who fail to comply with the licensing and welfare standards would be guilty of an offence and liable to penalties including jail terms. Yet many people are scoffing at the idea of anyone checking up. “Nairobi cats are restless. You cannot own Nairobi cats,” a panellist said on a youth TV show over the weekend. But the KSPCA director says “the overpopulation of cats"" is a big issue, with rabid ones posing a risk to human health and the environment. She would prefer low-cost veterinary services to be introduced for those who can pay and mass sterilisation campaigns for stray cats and dogs - as the cost of sterilising a cat, for instance, can be the equivalent of a month's wages for some Kenyans. “That’s a proven methodology from all over the world, and it works,” she says. In the meantime the bill has got many talking excitedly on the subject, even prompting one Nairobi resident to poetry. In his “ode to cats in Kenya” on X, Innocent Ouko ends his verse with the words: “Seems like we're in a cat-ch 22 situation.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

risk appetite,Weight-loss drug approved for heart problems in UK,2024-09-15,2024-07-23,Sophie Hutchinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p24dlx36no,"Weight-loss treatment Wegovy has been approved by the UK's medicines regulator, for reducing the risk of serious heart problems in overweight and obese people. Wegovy contains the drug semaglutide, which is already prescribed on the NHS to help some people with a body-mass index (BMI) above 26 lose weight. And it now becomes the first anti-obesity drug to be used to control heart attacks and strokes in people with established heart problems and a similar BMI. A trial of 17,600 people suggested weekly semaglutide injections for up to five years reduced major cardiovascular events by 20%. The trial was sponsored by the drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. ""This treatment option that prevents heart disease and strokes is an important step forward in tackling the serious health consequences of obesity,"" Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency innovative-medicines deputy director Shirley Hopper said. “As with all medicines, we will keep its safety under close review.’’ The drug works as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).  This intestinal hormone is released after eating and typically makes people feel fuller.  Like all medication, semaglutide comes with side-effects and risks, including nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. British Heart Foundation chief scientific and medical officer Prof Bryan Williams said: “Nearly-two thirds of adults in England are living with excess weight or obesity.  ""Those that also have an established cardiovascular disease live with a very high risk that a serious event like a heart attack or stroke could happen. “Several recent studies have shown us that semaglutide is an effective tool that can improve the quality of life for those with cardiovascular disease, including by lowering the risk of serious cardiac events."""
risk appetite,Are fermented foods actually good for our health?,2024-09-15,2024-07-20,Jessica Bradley,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240719-are-fermented-foods-actually-good-for-you,"While humans have been eating fermented foods since ancient times, researchers are only starting to unravel some of the biggest questions about their health benefits. Kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha are very different foods, but they all have one crucial thing in common: they're fermented. Humans have used fermentation throughout history to preserve food. ""Every culture has their own fermented foods,"" says Gabriel Vinderola, associate professor of microbiology at the National University of Litora in Argentina. ""Now, fermentation is spreading. There are thousands of different types, and they're produced in a more industrial way."" Producing fermented foods on an industrial scale – rather than just in our kitchens – has its benefits and downsides. Despite fermentation eliminating the need for chemical preservatives, researchers at Kings College London recently found additives in almost one third of the fermented food products they tested from UK supermarkets. These additives – including salt, sugar and artificial sweeteners – are within legal guidelines. But it does mean that some are technically classified as ultra-processed. So are fermented foods actually good for our health, or just another ultra-processed food we should be avoiding? One consequence of fermenting foods is that it can change the bioavailability of nutrients in certain foods – which means how much our bodies are able to absorb and benefit from the nutrients in a particular food. It's only very recently that we've begun to understand the potential health benefits of fermentation. In the West, the recent rising interest around fermented foods can be partly traced to the growing awareness of the link between our gut microbiomes and overall health – and how our diets contribute to this. What is fermented food? Fermented foods are produced through controlled microbial growth, or fermentation, the breakdown of carbohydrates such as starch and sugar by using bacteria and yeast. The fermentation process has many variables, such as the bacteria used, and the environmental conditions, which means there are thousands of different types of fermented foods. Some of the most well-known include kimchi, kombucha, sauerkraut, tempeh and yoghurt. ""The process of fermentation can produce new bioactive compounds, such as organic acids and different peptides that have different effects on our health,"" says Paul Cotter, senior principal research officer at Teagasc Food Research Centre in Ireland, the country’s national agriculture and food body. Some fermented foods have been shown to be more nutrient-dense compared to their non-fermented counterparts, and some contain probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health. Fermented food can be split into two groups: those containing live bacteria, and those with bacteria that died during production, such as some breads, beer and wine. During fermentation, microbes usually feed from the sugar in a food, and this sugar fuels all of their biochemical reactions, Vinderola says. ""Then it will start releasing things – such as lactic acid, which is anti-inflammatory – that weren't present in the food before. It can also cut amino acid chains to release small fractions that can benefit our guts."" Live bacteria in fermented foods can become transient or even permanent members of the gut mircrobiota when eaten, which can bring health benefits and also help to reduce the abundance of detrimental bacteria by competing against them. Even if the fermented food doesn't have any live bacteria, it's still associated with some health benefits, Vinderola says. Before they die, the microbes produce health-promoting molecules, such as peptides, he says. These health benefits don’t necessarily outweigh other characteristics of certain fermented foods and drinks, however. Sourdough, for example, still contains prebiotics after the heating process, which can be beneficial for our gut microbiomes. Can fermented foods improve gut health? Generally, our gut health is of concern among scientists. Many adults in the US, for example, don't eat enough fibre, and research has found that most people report experiencing at least one digestive symptom, such as flatulence or abdominal bloating. Fermented foods can reduce or remove some compounds that can cause gastrointestinal issues in some people, including so-called ""Fodmaps"" (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols). These sugars aren't completely digested or absorbed in our intestines, and can cause stretching of the intestinal wall, which can cause pain and discomfort to some. Doctors sometimes advise people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms to eat a diet low in Fodmaps. The fermentation process can also reduce or remove gluten from some foods, too, which is beneficial to those with celiac disease, another gut problem. In recent decades, there have been mounting concerns among scientists that modern lifestyles may affect our immune system by altering the diversity of our microbes. ""Our diets are generally low in fibre and we have a lot of antibiotics and stress, and we don't sleep well. And these factors will all impoverish the microbes in our bodies,"" says Vinderola. In principle, fermented foods could change that. ""The main role of fermented foods is that they can give you live microbes. These microbes get into the gut, and train your immune cells how to control inflammation,"" says Vinderola. Low-grade inflammation is an issue because inflammatory compounds can spread through the body via the bloodstream, reaching the brain, heart or liver, for example. This can cause chronic conditions, Vinderola says. Consuming more microbes may train the immune system to better differentiate between good and bad bugs, says Cotter. When our immune systems struggle to do this, it can increase the risk of developing auto-immune diseases, he adds, such as inflammatory bowel disease. In one recent study, researchers found eating sauerkraut – finely cut, fermented raw cabbage – could potentially have a substantial anti-inflammatory impact. How so? Claudia Stäubert at the University of Leipzig in Germany and colleagues found that sauerkraut increases the concentration of lactic acid bacteria-derived metabolites in the bloodstream. This can activate a receptor called HCA3, which informs the immune system that foreign substances are in the body. Stäubert has since confirmed through her research that sauerkraut, through the action of HCA3, is anti-inflammatory. ""This means the immune system is less activated, which is good,"" she says. ""A bad immune system overreacts, which can cause autoimmune diseases, so it's good to eat fermented foods to train the immune system to be less responsive,"" she says. It's possible fermented food might benefit mental wellbeing, although the research here is tentative. In one 2023 study, participants were divided into two groups – one made up of those who consumed plant-based fermented foods at least three times a week, and those who didn't. The researchers analysed and compared their microbiomes and other nutrients in their guts and found that those who ate fermented foods had more bacterial diversity and higher amounts of short chain fatty acids, which are produced by bacteria, than those who didn't. ""The most important finding was that small chemicals in the gut were very different between the consumers and non-consumers (of fermented foods),"" says one of the study's co-authors Andres Gomez, assistant professor of microbiomics at the University of Minnesota. More like this: In another small study with the same participants, Gomez and colleagues found that self-reported mental health scores were more consistent across the regular consumers of fermented food, while the non-consumers had more fluctuating mood reports. These results have yet to published, however. Gomez has a study – not yet published – comparing the effects of organic versus conventional fermented foods in the gut. He says he found a link between fermented food consumption and the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, especially with organic foods. ""This is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that makes you feel calm, and could be a remedy against anxiety and depression,"" he says. In another yet-to-be-published study, Gomez fed mice a Western diet high in sugar and fat, and then carried out several lab tests to confirm that the mice had developed depression. He then fed half of them kombucha, and found that the symptoms improved, possibly via changes in the microbiome, compared to the mice who didn't eat kombucha. Gomez has found in his research that fermented foods can produce metabolites known to help treat obesity. While this has been more widely studied, it's not clear yet what mechanisms are behind this effect. However, one explanation is that some of the nutrients in fermented food can contain metabolites that help to regulate our appetites via appetite-related neurotransmitters in the body. There may be several different mechanisms behind the relationship between fermented food consumption and obesity risk, researchers conclude in a 2023 review. But while studies so far look promising, they say there is a long way to go to understanding this. Like many areas of health, researchers are now asking how fermented foods can be personalised to help people with individual health concerns. ""We and other labs are taking a deep dive on specific fermented foods to learn more about how we can make them even better at enhancing health benefits,"" says Cotter. For example, Cotter has found that some versions of kefir are better at controlling cholesterol, whereas others are good at addressing anxiety and stress through the gut brain axis. ""The challenge here is that someone making fermented products at home won't know which version they have, and it might not be the right version for their particular needs,"" he says. ""There's an opportunity for more research to go down the personalised fermented route so you can harness the right microbes for your specific needs."" And while the Kings College London analysis of fermented foods in UK supermarkets found inconsistencies across the nutritional content of different brands of fermented foods, researchers are hoping their work can help improve the content of commercially available fermented foods. For example, in the future, a better understanding of which microbes are present in different versions of fermented foods could help producers of fermented foods retain these bacteria when scaling up production. ""This has been a problem in the past,"" Cotter says. ""People make fermented foods at home via a natural process and there are typically lots of microorganisms present. When produced on a larger scale, there's usually simplification, and they only use a few microorganisms for quality control reasons, but they may lose some health benefits along the way."" Some fermented foods also contain amines, which occur when amino acids are broken down by certain bacteria. People who are sensitive to histamine, along with other amines, may experience headaches as result of eating fermented foods high in these byproducts.  Some mass-produced fermented products, such as ready-made kombucha soft drinks and teas, can also be high in sugar. And although the probiotic bacteria in fermented foods can prevent the growth of harmful microbes, there is still a risk of food poisoning bacteria in unpasteurised foods. Contaminated kimchi, for example, was associated with two large Escherichia coli outbreaks in South Korea during 2013 and 2014. There's very little research looking at which specific fermented foods might be the healthiest. This is because each fermented food has a different bacterial profile, depending on exactly how it was made. ""Probiotics and prebiotics are specific microbes that can be studied in clinical trials, but we don't know which microbes are in any one specific fermented food,"" Vinderola says. ""Fermented foods have a complex community of microbes that may change from one kombucha to another."" The most researched fermented food is yoghurt, Vinderola says, which is always made up of two specific types of bacteria, no matter where it's made in the world (Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus). This makes it easy to build on previous research to form a reliable evidence base. ""However, with kefir, for example, you'll get different results in different parts of the world because it will contain different bacteria, so it's difficult to compare results and build an evidence base,"" Vinderola says. Given these gaps in our knowledge, should we be eating more fermented foods? Yes, says Cotter – but he advises introducing them gradually into your diet. ""I'd suggest buying 10 fermented foods and gradually introducing them into your diet to see which your body agrees with,"" he says. ""And take a note of what you've eaten and how you feel afterwards."" This is because it can sometimes take a few days for our guts to become accustomed to certain fermented foods, and, in rare cases, it can cause a minor allergic reaction. Gomez has found that those who've been eating fermented foods across their whole lifetime may have a permanent healthy advantage in their gut microbiome. He noted that, among the participants in his study on fermented food and mental health, one was from Korea, while the others were from the US – and this participant had gut bacteria associated with kimchi. ""The US participants probably started consuming fermented foods later in life, whereas Koreans eat a lot of kimchi, and the Korean participant was probably eating this since he was a child,"" Gomez says. These findings led Gomez to wonder if there are permanent effects of consuming fermented foods over a long period of time. ""But this doesn't mean you can't still enjoy the benefits of fermented foods,"" he says of those who only start eating them later in life. Whichever fermented foods you want to try, Vinderola advises eating it regularly. ""Getting any health benefits depends on how frequently you eat it,"" he says. ""You should eat it regularly, because the immune system needs constant stimulation."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."
risk appetite,Weekly round-up: Five stories you may have missed,2024-09-15,2024-07-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1xj2e55yno,"A story about eating invasive crayfish to prevent the species from damaging rivers was among our most read articles this week in Berkshire. A variety of local issues were featured on the BBC News website, BBC Radio Berkshire and South Today. We have picked five of them to keep you up to date. One of the last surviving British servicemen to take part in the D-Day landings has died at the age of 98. George Winter, from Arborfield, Berkshire, served in the Royal Navy between 1943 and 1947 - having initially volunteered as a 17-year-old. He was one of about 150,000 allied troops who took part in the Normandy Landings on 6 June 1944 - serving as a quartermaster on a minesweeper. A long-serving BBC radio presenter said it ""feels surreal that it’s come to an end"", as she quits after 18 years at the same station. Sarah Walker presented an emotional final show on BBC Radio Berkshire. She said she had been ""blown away by the all the lovely messages"" she received from listeners. A man who harvests an invasive species of crayfish thinks eating them could prevent damage to rivers. Andrew Leech catches North American signal crayfish from the River Kennet in Thatcham. But a law change by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) means he can no longer sell live crayfish. A leisure centre is set to undergo a multimillion-pound refurbishment. The revamp of Northcroft Leisure Centre in Newbury, Berkshire, is expected to cost about £4.6m. Funded by West Berkshire Council, changes will include a larger gym, a new cycle studio and a cafe. Thames Valley Police (TVP) said it rejected nearly a fifth more potential officers in the last financial year than it did in the year before. It said there was “change in risk appetite” after cases involving former Metropolitan Police officers Wayne Couzens and David Carrick, both jailed for life last year. It also said the increased rejections could be attributed to “the quality of candidates” applying to join TVP."
risk appetite,Force rejecting more potential police officers,2024-09-15,2024-07-14,Nathan Briant,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckrg4z0gy5yo,"Thames Valley Police (TVP) said it rejected nearly a fifth more potential officers in the last financial year than it did in the year before. It said there was “change in risk appetite” after cases involving former Metropolitan Police officers Wayne Couzens and David Carrick, both jailed for life last year. It also said the increased rejections could be attributed to “the quality of candidates” applying to join TVP. A report by the force’s head of vetting and force security said 267 applications were rejected in 2022/23 but that number climbed to 319 in 2023/24. Sue Murphy said another “concerning issue” was the 41% increase in the number of candidates who were withdrawing from vetting. She said “very often” TVP staff will have “carried out a full process, only for a candidate to withdraw”, frequently because they have got another job. In 2022/23, TVP saw 382 applicants withdraw but 538 did in 2023/24. TVP employs about 5,000 officers in Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire and a similar number of staff in other supporting roles. In 2022/23, the force said 251 officers left, along with another 53 student officers between April and mid-July 2023. His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said last year that meant TVP lost significant experience and put pressure on training and vetting departments. It estimated it cost about £80,000 to replace an officer who resigned after a year’s service. Thames Valley’s police and crime commissioner Matthew Barber said it was “encouraging” that officers who commit misconduct are often reported by their own colleagues. He told the Thames Valley Police and Crime Panel on Friday that it reflected a “culture where people won’t tolerate poor behaviour and they know they will be listened to” if they report it.

risk appetite,What does 'Stalin' attack on Sturgeon's SNP mean for Swinney?,2024-09-15,2024-07-09,Lynsey Bews,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevwdy7llrlo,"It is an excoriating attack. Jim Sillars' description of Nicola Sturgeon as ""Stalin's wee sister"", running the SNP as a ""leadership cult"", will leave no one in any doubt of who he blames for its general election drubbing. Mr Sillars is a veteran of the party who has long questioned the leadership's approach, particularly its strategy for achieving independence. In an open letter to party members, the former deputy leader of the SNP also described John Swinney's current leadership as ""a busted flush"", and called for the ""tarnished old guard to step aside"". Dismissing the idea for a period of reflection, he wrote: ""It should be repentance, because 4 July was inevitable given how the Sturgeon/Swinney era misled the movement, lost its common sense in government, promoted marginal issues as national priorities while the real priorities of the people such as education, housing, NHS, infrastructure, were notable only for the staggering level of incompetence with which they were dealt with."" For those who follow Scottish politics closely, his critique will come as no surprise. But the brutal tone of his letter has upped the ante, as the SNP rakes over the coals of its first electoral defeat in more than a decade. The party returned just nine MPs, down from 48 in 2019, with a complete wipe-out across the central belt. The result was worse than many members had feared - and the ballots were still being counted when the inevitable fallout began. Joanna Cherry, ousted from her Edinburgh seat, was among the first to point the finger of blame at Nicola Sturgeon, calling on her to apologise. In the past she's been an outspoken critic, most notably of the former first minister's pursuit of gender recognition reforms, and the centralisation of power among a few key figures at the top of the party. At the weekend she told Sky News that voters had become ""disillusioned"" with the SNP over its failure to progress the case for independence. She also told The Guardian newspaper that John Swinney - taking over after a turbulent year under Humza Yousaf - had failed to steady the ship, adding ""the ship has gone down"". While Ms Cherry didn't explicitly call on Mr Swinney to resign, former cabinet secretary Alex Neil argues the first minister's position has become untenable after just two months in the job. He has called for the Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes and the Westminster leader Stephen Flynn to take over at the top of the SNP. This is hardly surprising given his backing for Ms Forbes during last year's leadership contest. So, with the blame game intensifying, is Mr Swinney at risk of becoming another casualty of the election? In short, there seems next to no chance of that happening. Indeed there appears to be no appetite among senior SNP figures for another change at the top. As former Westminster leader Iain Blackford told the Sunday Mail newspaper: ""There isn't really anybody else, so he's the man for it"". If the SNP's elected politicians are content with Mr Swinney's leadership, what about the party's grassroots? Mr Sillars' letter also calls on the broader SNP membership to repent. ""You got so used to not thinking for yourselves that you allowed the party to be hollowed out intellectually,"" he told them. The former deputy leader continued: ""Time to take back the power of the party."" Popularity among the membership was one of the reasons Mr Swinney was seen as the obvious choice for leader just a couple of months ago. And there are no signs his standing among the grassroots is withering yet. Still, there are plenty of questions for the party to address in this stormy post-Sturgeon era. And it will have to be quick to find answers, with a Holyrood election looming in 2026."
risk appetite,'Postal vote chaos' and Trump has 'broad immunity',2024-09-15,2024-07-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g4rvp767o,"The build-up to the election leads many of Tuesday's front pages. In an interview with the Times, Sir Keir Starmer says a large Labour majority would mean a stronger mandate to deliver what he calls ""difficult changes"".  He goes on to say people would feel ""materially better off"" and public services would be ""working again"" after a Labour government with a five-year term. Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch warns readers of the Daily Express that voting for Reform UK could wipe out hundreds of Tory MPs - in return for what she describes as a ""few inexperienced Reform candidates"". The paper says Reform is promising to be the ""real opposition"" in parliament on Friday morning. The Daily Mail says Britain's depleted military capability has left the armed forces unable to defend the country properly. That claim is based on an assessment by Rob Johnson, who led a government team that spent two years assessing the country's readiness for war. It concluded that Britain would rapidly run out of ammunition, be unable to stop missile attacks, and that the RAF and Navy are short of aircraft and ships. The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, has told the Guardian that the election is a once-in-a-lifetime event that could reshape the political landscape for decades. Sir Ed also tells the paper that his campaign - which has been marked by unorthodox photo opportunities - has led to more awareness of his party's policies. The Daily Telegraph leads on a report that postal ballots haven't been delivered on time in 90 constituencies. Its editorial says ""this is simply not good enough"" and that ""even at this 11th hour, efforts should be made to ensure that everyone who wants to vote and who registered on time should be able to do so"". Writing in the Daily Mirror, former prime minister Gordon Brown urges voters to consider child poverty - and Labour's focus on tackling the issue - a priority on Thursday. He describes the hardship faced by millions of children as ""a stain on the soul of our country"" and a ""scar on our conscience unless something is done"". Another former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has spoken to the i, saying he believes Sir Keir Starmer will ""crush dissent"" within the party if he secures a large majority. He says he sees ""no appetite for diversity by the Labour leadership"" and that its approach could lead to a ""fool's paradise of agreement"". Mr Corbyn also says the optimism surrounding any victory this week would quickly disappear unless left-wing policies are delivered. ""Supreme Court hands Trump broad immunity over actions as president"" is the headline in the Financial Times. The paper says the ruling is likely to delay Trump's trial on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 US election and that - if elected - he could instruct officials to dismiss the case. Emma Raducanu, punching the air in her winning return to Wimbledon, is the image on numerous front pages. The Times says she drew inspiration from England's footballers by grinding out a result.

risk appetite,"Highland Council: 24,000 new homes needed over next 10 years",2024-09-15,2024-06-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g498zp33o,"Highland Council says the area needs an extra 24,000 houses over the next 10 years. New homes are needed to address a long-standing shortage of affordable homes. But there is now also an urgent need to have accommodation available for people filling an expected 8,400 jobs to be created by the new Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport. The council said under the current rate of building it would take over 20 years to reach the required number of new homes.  It said about £2.8bn of extra investment was needed to accelerate the construction programme. Highland, along with other Scottish local authorities, has been highlighting local housing issues.  It follows the Scottish government declaring a national housing emergency in May, which was designed to formally recognise problems with the wider housing system. Highland councillors have agreed steps should be taken to develop a housing challenge action plan by the end of this year. In a report, council officials have set out potential solutions to meeting the 10-year target. Officers said the local authority's contribution to the cost was manageable within ""anticipated, planned budgets"". The report said: ""Importantly, the challenge of building this number of houses in 10 years, can be met if a number of strategic objectives are achieved."" The council has built an average of more than 500 affordable properties annually over the last 10 years. Officials have suggested a number of possible ways of raising funds. These include having the council's £365m housing debt written off to free up investment which could be put towards increasing the number of affordable homes. They said a significant element of the debt was historical, inherited from former district councils before local government reorganisations in the 1990s. It is associated with housebuilding programmes to meet demand from the hydro-electric and North Sea oil and gas industries. Highland Council wrote to the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove in May to request a meeting to discuss the UK government partially writing off the debt.  A similar letter has been sent to deputy leader of the Labour Party, Angela Raynor. Highland Council has also been exploring how it might attract investment from pension funds. The report said: ""Pension fund managers are very keen to invest in housing, it is a low risk, long term sustainable investment and there are various models currently on the market which are worth further consideration.  ""Officers have had initial discussions with one private sector pension investor to understand their investment approach and appetite, and further follow up discussions are planned."" The green freeport itself could be another source of funding.  The Highlands' freeport was announced last January, and a Japanese subsea cables company already has plans to open factory there. Freeports are special economic zones able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs to help them attract businesses to set up in their areas. Highland Council said the Inverness and Cromarty Firth freeports' non-domestic rates concession could generate an estimated £550m over 25 years. But officials said there could be competing demands for the investment to be used for roads and schools."
risk appetite,How to stay well this Glastonbury Festival,2024-09-15,2024-06-24,Sarah Turnnidge & PA Media,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87762d5vz5o,"With just days to go until gates open, thousands of people across the country are preparing to head to one of the biggest festivals in the world.  But among the sparkly outfits and sleeping bags, there are a few essentials Glastonbury Festival-goers should bear in mind to stay well during their stay on the farm.  While tens of thousands of people descend on Worthy Farm each year without incident, the experience is not without its hazards.  So here is a quick rundown of some simple things you can do to prevent some of the pain of a five-day party.  As Brits, there are few pleasures in life that top basking in the sunshine with a cold beer at a festival, but doctors have urged festival-goers to drink plenty of water over the five-day event. ""Being outdoors in the heat can be physically demanding, especially if you're on your feet, dancing,"" says Nick Higginson, CEO of Phoenix Health & Safety.  ""If you combine this with drinking alcohol, it can easily lead to exhaustion."" He recommended packing a large reusable bottle to refill between sets, with hundreds of free water points available around the site.   Thousands of attendees are excited to see amazing performances from the likes of Dua Lipa and Shania Twain, however, the thumping bass during these sets could lead to tinnitus. ""Prolonged exposure to loud music can permanently damage the delicate structures of the inner ear, and cause hearing loss and tinnitus,"" explained Hannah Samuels, an audiologist at Boots Hearingcare. She suggests using hearing protection - ear plugs of muffs - ""as these lower the level of sound, but still enable you to hear everything - and it can often sound better, too"". Glastonbury Festival has warned people not to bring illegal substances to the event, with a statement on its site saying: ""The dealing in or use of illegal drugs is not condoned by the festival and drug enforcement laws are as applicable on the festival site as anywhere else in the country – you risk being evicted from the site if found with them.""  Medical and welfare services are available on site, which festival attendees are encouraged to access immediately if they fall ill. A joint release published by Somerset Council and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) included a list of potential signs of overdose to be aware of, which include:  Busy festivals like Glastonbury are breeding grounds for bacteria, but Dr Adam Staten, clinical director at One Day Tests and NHS GP, advises campers to keep their feet as clean as possible. ""Athlete's foot is caused by a fungal infection which thrives in moist conditions,"" explains Dr Staten.

risk appetite,"This city is worried about immigration, but who has the solution?",2024-09-15,2024-06-25,Ed Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw00yg9z0dgo,"Mike and Graham have been collecting bins for four decades between them. Their patch includes Peterborough’s Lincoln Road, where Lithuanian restaurants vie for space with job agencies advertising new positions in Polish. “It seems like every nationality lives here,” says Graham. “I don’t see much integration, they keep themselves to themselves.” “They don’t respect our country,” he says. Over a quarter of Peterborough’s population is foreign-born, well above the almost 17% average for England and Wales. A sense of disquiet over the change that can accompany immigration is hardly new, but it is what Graham says next that is perhaps more revealing. I ask if he’d stop further immigration. “You can’t stop it,” says Graham. “You’d have an empty hospital.” If Graham is struggling to live with immigration, he’s also of the view that the country currently depends on it. The BBC’s Your Voice, Your Vote project has heard from thousands of you about concerns over immigration. We spent several days in Peterborough talking to people about it, and again and again I heard concerns about social cohesion and pressure on public services caused by immigration - and not just from those who were born in the UK. Net migration to the UK rose significantly after Brexit, peaking at 764,000 in 2022, and was an estimated 685,000 in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics. An Ipsos survey of 3,000 people in February found 52% of people wanted immigration to be reduced. Migration has been a high-profile issue in the campaign and there have been bad-tempered clashes between politicians offering very different visions of an issue that regularly tracks as one of the most important for voters.  On the outskirts of Peterborough we visited the Ortons Shopping Centre, a busy place where discount stores mix with independent shops. Sarah works for the NHS. She was born in the city and raised her children here. Immigration, she says, has made the city grow very quickly. “We don’t have the resources for everybody,” she tells me. She reels off a list of pressure points: “The hospital, it’s hard to get accommodation in the city now, especially social housing and school places.” Her grandchildren, she says, have struggled to get a place in the schools closest to them. These sound like common issues in most towns. “I don't think it's all down to immigration,” Sarah admits, “but I think it has had a major impact on them.” We found Emma waiting with her son and toddler daughter buying fish and chips. Immigration is a big issue for her in this election. She is on the council house waiting list, and gets housing benefit, but because of high private rental prices she has to top it up by hundreds of pounds every month. “The new houses that were built were given to all the foreigners that were coming in,” she says. In the past year, Peterborough council has bought 40 homes to be used by Afghan and Ukrainian refugees.  “It’s not fair, I’ve always worked my life,” she says. “I don’t like it, it makes me angry.” Peterborough council says the demand for social housing exceeds supply, and that is prioritising those with the highest needs. The homes were bought for legal refugees, it points out, who have the right to live and work in the country. These are hard choices for councils. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economics research institute, says Peterborough receives less funding for local services (that’s bin collections and adult and children’s care) and public health (drug and alcohol abuse) than it should do according to need. Places with growing populations can often find themselves falling victim to funding formulas from central government that do not take account of their recent growth. Haji moved here as child about 50 years ago from Pakistan, and we met him in a traditional Pakistani sweet shop, where for £7 you can get a box full of treats. “We worked hard,” he says reflecting on his and his family’s contribution to Britain. “We paid our taxes, National Insurance contributions, the hospital, education system.” He pauses before adding “everything was brilliant”, with the emphasis on the was. He says he is concerned about migration. “I think it is too much, to be honest, the country has too much on its plate.” “People who don't contribute towards the system, I think they don't have the right to live here.” The ONS says the increase in net migration is mostly down to non-EU citizens coming on work and study visas.  This is a key challenge for the Conservative and Labour parties who say they will bring down net migration: many of the people who come to the UK come to work. That Ipsos research on attitudes to migration also showed little appetite for reducing the numbers of medics, care workers, fruit pickers, teachers, labourers or lorry drivers coming to the UK to work. Significant numbers of people settle in London and the South East, but Peterborough is attractive because it is well connected by road and rail, and newcomers work in food packing and logistics jobs - the city is part of a transport, logistics and warehousing triangle that’s grown significantly in the past decade or so, mostly down to online shopping. Care is also a sector with big demand for workers. PJ Care, which provides specialist neurological care for adults, says it has hired more than 32 people from overseas, and its recruitment manager tells me they would struggle without them. One of their employees is Rejoice, from Malawi. She says she’s thriving, excelling at her job - but still, she’s worried about her future, “When you look at the news, it makes you feel scared. What will become of me?” She’s watching the general election debate closely, as all parties pitch their plans on immigration. They have very different approaches. Rejoice is here on a work visa, with her husband and two children. She is one of 70,000 carers who came to work in England from abroad in 2022-2023, up from 10,000 in 2020-2021, according to industry body Skills for Care. It says about a third of the care workforce in Peterborough comes from abroad, and the demand for workers is expected to continue as the population ages. She works full-time and pays taxes, but is keen to point out that she can’t claim some benefits, like free childcare. But Rejoice says she feels vital: “This country needs people like me, someone that can put their heart out there and help someone from the heart, giving their all. “If we were to remove every migrant worker from this country, I think there would be a collapse in the health care system in this country.” Set against this picture is a very public debate about small boats and illegal migration. Home Office figures show that in the 12 months until March, 38,000 people entered the UK illegally, the vast majority on small boats from France. In conversations on the streets, there is not much distinction made between legal and illegal migration. Just off Lincoln Road we are welcomed inside Peterborough Asylum and Refugee Community Association (Parca), which has been running for three decades. Asylum seekers Adil and Mohammed are having English lessons, and their English is very good. Both fled war in Sudan and describe a desperate journey to reach the UK, taking a small boat from Libya to Italy. Adil says 300 people left on the boat, but only 200 people arrived.  “One hundred people dead,” he says quietly. “Women, children, young boys.” It’s hard to even imagine what that was like. Why make another risky journey from Calais to the UK? Adil says it was because he believed he would not get any support in France. Parca was set up by Moez Nathu, who was a refugee before finding sanctuary in Peterborough. He says migrants believe that when they get to the UK, “you get five-star hotels to sleep, you’ll get feeding by Home Office”.  While he wants refugees to be supported, he says it creates an impression that people arriving here will have an easy life. The answer, he believes, is to allow asylum seekers to work almost as soon as they arrive, sending a message that if you come to the UK, you will be expected to work. There were 69,298 asylum applications for the year ending March 2024, relating to relating to 86,719 people. But the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision is higher - 86,460 cases, relating to 118,329 people. And government figures from the same time said there were 104,517 individuals in receipt of asylum support, of which 34% were in hotel accommodation. Just outside Parca, we find Irena delivering parcels. She’s originally from Latvia and says she works up to 60 hours a week. I jokingly ask what she would do if she were the next prime minister. “I would close the borders!” she says. It’s not the answer we expected. Irena arrived here 15 years ago, when the UK was part of the EU, and she’s now a British citizen and planning to vote in the general election. It becomes clear her issue is illegal immigration. “I don't understand why France doesn't close the borders, why they let people risk their lives and cross the channel. If they say the first safe country is OK, why do you pass several safe countries and then England in the end. Why?” Does she see any conflict between her own journey and her views now? “I'm working. I'm all the time working,” she says, adding that she never asked the state for anything. Close by we speak to two men inside an eastern European cafe, they are from Peterborough and believe the change here has been for the better. They both point enthusiastically at the restaurants that line Lincoln Road. All of this, they say, would not have happened without immigration. Rania Alia cofounded Helping Empower Lives in Peterborough. She’s originally from Egypt and is passionate about supporting the most vulnerable here and helping them settle in Britain. She points to wider forces: “If you don’t want the refugee to come to this country, stop the war, make peace.” And what of the argument that the country cannot cope with so many people arriving here? “I do not think the asylum, or refugee, is the reason for the crisis we are having,” before adding: “We have this because of Covid, the cost of living is getting very high - refugees don’t cause these problems.” Rania is a reminder that by no means everyone in Peterborough feels the same about immigration, and what we did hear again and again were questions of what people saw as fairness - be it from Emma, who can’t get a council house, or from Rejoice who works, pays taxes but doesn’t always feel appreciated. And for many we spoke to in the city, who were uneasy about the surge in net migration, there was also a widespread understanding that the services they rely on, from health to having parcels delivered, were dependent on the very same people coming from abroad. The challenge for the parties is to convince voters that after long periods of large-scale migration, they have a credible plan to address the issues and concerns of voters. And then for whoever wins the keys to No 10, the next challenge will be to deliver that vision.

risk appetite,Is the capsaicin in chilli peppers poisonous?,2024-09-15,2024-06-24,Jessica Brown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240621-capsaicin-the-kick-from-your-chilli-can-have-side-effects,"Ramen noodles have been banned in some European countries for containing too much of the chilli extract capsaicin. Can it really be a danger to health? A South Korean brand of instant ramen made headlines recently when Denmark’s food agency recalled some flavours of the product due to the risk they may cause “acute poisoning”. Another story to make headlines recently was the case of a teenager in the United States with underlying health conditions who reportedly died after taking part in a spicy food challenge. The cause of these concerns is capsaicin, the active component of chilli peppers that gives them their hot taste. But are the Danish authorities right to be so cautious? Is it really possible to eat so much capsaicin that it can poison you? Capsaicin is a compound that gives chillis their hot taste and the burning feeling we can get when we eat them. It is one of a family of compounds called capsaicinoids. Although around 23 different capsaicinoids have been found in chilli peppers, the most potent of these is capsaicin – although it has a similar level of pungency as a similar molecule called dihydrocapsaicin, which is generally found in lower concentrations in chilli peppers. The UK's Food Standards Agency doesn't permit food producers to add pure capsaicin to foods, as it would be considered unsafe. But there are no limits on how much can be used when it is naturally present in chilli extract. Denmark isn't the first country to warn against eating food containing high levels of capsaicin. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany (BfR) has also warned against excessive consumption of capsaicin. Capsaicinoids can induce a painful sensation and inflammation due to activating a pain receptor called TRPV. This can cause several symptoms. Specifically, human studies show that eating high doses of capsaicinoids may cause heartburn, reflux, nausea, diarrhoea and pain in the abdomen and chest, says the BfR. It may also cause circulatory symptoms such as cold sweats, changes in blood pressure or dizziness at high doses, it adds. But there is not yet enough data to clarify at what dose this occurs at. ""Due to the numerous factors influencing the individual perception of pungency and pain and the limited data available regarding a dose-response relationship of capsaicinoids, no general recommendations can be made for consumers with health restrictions,"" says a BfR spokesperson. However, based on the data from human studies, BfR adds, it can be estimated that an intake of 0.5 to 1mg or more of capsaicinoids can lead to mild undesirable effects, such as sense of warmth, pressure in the upper abdomen or heartburn. ""At intake levels in the range of 170 mg, pronounced adverse effects can occur. A case of hospitalisation of a patient after ingestion of approximately 600mg of capsaicinoids has been reported,"" BfR says. The 27-year-old patient in question, who had been taking part in a chilli eating competition in Berlin, Germany, consumed four Bhut Jolokia chilli peppers and a variety of other spicy food. The Bhut Jolokia variety, or ""ghost pepper"" is estimated to rate at around 1-1.2 million SHUs on the Scoville Scale for measuring the spiciness of substances, making it among the world's hottest chilli peppers. (For comparison, Tabasco red sauce measures around 2,500-5,000 SHUs). Around two-and-a-half hours after eating the spicy food, however, the man began to feel abdominal pains and severe swelling of his stomach, and later that evening took himself to the emergency department at the Helios Hospital Berlin-Buch. Doctors were unable to find anything else wrong and administered some painkillers which offered some temporary respite. Around 12 hours after eating the chillis the man vomited and slowly began improving. But it's not just eating capsaicin that can cause symptoms. ""In the short term, capsaicin can cause irritation, discomfort and pain,"" says Christian Moro, associate professor of science and medicine at Bond University in Australia. ""If it gets into the eye, it can really hurt, and induce blurry vision. If inhaled, it can cause prolonged coughing, and even stimulate a flare-up of illnesses such as asthma."" But the symptoms that eating capsaicin can lead to are nothing to worry about, says Moro. ""Capsaicin activates our nerves and this is what makes it feel like your body is burning, but it's just a sensation, and not actually doing us any harm,"" he says. The BfR says high doses of capsaicin can cause ""serious poisonings"" in children, but that the dosage that can lead to these symptoms is unknown. Some estimates put the lethal dose of capsaicin in humans to be around 500-5,000mg per kg of body weight. This would equate to around 35,000mg of capsaisin in someone weighing 70kg (11st or 154lbs). In 100g (3.5oz) of Jalapeno peppers contains around 15mg of capsaisin while the same quantity of Scotch Bonnet peppers contains around 260mg. The Bhut Jolokia contains around 4,000mg for every 100g of fresh chilli pepper. However, there are no known reported cases capsaicin overdoses in humans, Moro says. One 10-year-old review, The Two Faces of Capsaicin, details lab experiments with rodents that linked capsaicin to signs of cancer in the stomach and liver, and human studies where the effects of capsaicin have been found to cause gastric ""microbleeding"", but points to other studies that have shown none of these symptoms. Another umbrella review from 2022, which analysed 11 systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, concluded that the health effects ­– both good and bad – of spicy foods and chili peppers are uncertain, and the evidence they were able to draw from wasn’t good quality. ""I've been asked many times 'will eating superhot chilli peppers kill you?'. The answer, like most things in life, is 'yes and no',"" says Paul Bosland, regents professor of plant and environmental sciences at New Mexico State University and one of the world's foremost experts on chilli peppers. ""Chilli peppers can indeed cause death, but most people's bodies would falter long before they reached that point.” In other words, our bodies would expel the capsaicin-containing food before we could consume enough for a lethal dose. ""One would have to keep eating extremely hot chilli peppers, past the point of sweating, shaking, vomiting, and maybe feeling like passing out. So, it’s safe to say super-hot chilli peppers won’t kill you,"" he says. Like many other foods and drinks, how one person’s body reacts to capsaicin will be different to the next, and that can depend on several factors. Consuming capsaicin can cause difference responses in different people, the BfR says – for example, children or people who rarely eat spicy food may be more sensitive than people who regularly consume them. One study found that capsaicin may be an irritant in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but not in healthy volunteers. Researchers fed 20 people with IBS, and 38 healthy people without IBS, either a normal diet, a spicy meal, or a standard meal with 2g of chilli in capsules. In healthy volunteers, the spicy meals and meals with chilli capsules only caused mild abdominal discomfort, but induced significant levels of abdominal pain and burning in those with IBS. In addition, people with existing gastrointestinal problems such as reflux diseases may react more to the intake of capsaicinoids in the gastrointestinal tract, the BfR says, and could also pose a risk for people with cardiovascular diseases, due to the observed circulatory symptoms associated with consuming high amounts. The effects of eating chillis may also be influenced by how accustomed someone is to eating spicy food, Bosland says ""Every human has a different level of tolerance to the capsaicinoids, so what may seem extremely hot to one person can seem medium to another,"" says Bosland. Not only this, but we can become accustomed to the heat profile of certain chillis if we eat them regularly, he adds. One Tawainese study, for example, found that regularly exposure to capsaicin could reduce the symptoms of heartburn as the body becomes more tolerant of it. ""Once I had two chilli pepper scientists – one from China and one from India – visiting my laboratory,"" says Bosland. ""I took them to lunch, and as we ate our enchiladas, the scientist from China stated that when he visited India the food seemed hotter than in China."" ""The scientist from India said, 'I experienced the same reaction when I visited China!'"" While both scientists came from countries known for their spicy food, each thought the other had hotter dishes, Bosland says. Throughout history, chillies have been used as a health remedy, and modern medicine has its uses for capsaicin, too. Chilli extracts are used in the formulation of many medicines, including topical products for pain relief, migraines, headaches and psoriasis. Capsaicin has even been suggested by researchers as a drug for gastric cancer prevention and therapy. As well as the concerns around capsaicin’s potential adverse effects, numerous studies have found that regularly consuming capsaicin may also have some health benefits, due to its antioxidant and health-promoting compounds, Moro says.  More like this: • Why some of us like it hot • Are there benefits to eating turmeric? • Can some foods fill you up for longer? Studies have linked regular capsaicin consumption to contributing to lowering the risk, or slowing the progression, of conditions including high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. And while it's sometimes thought to cause gastric ulcers, there’s evidence to suggest consuming capsaicin can actually help to prevent and heal them.  ""Reaching for the chilli also means we’re less likely to reach for salt, so is an excellent, healthy salt alternative in many meals,"" Moro says. While there are some concerns around high levels of capsaicin causing adverse reactions in some people, there's no evidence to suggest that a sensible amount of chillies in our diet will cause us any harm beyond a burning sensation. On the contrary, there's lots of evidence to suggest it may actually be beneficial to have some capsaicin in our diets. But one mystery remains: is it China or India that has the hotter food? The answer, we suspect, will remain hotly debated. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  "
risk appetite,Top doctor alarmed by weight-loss drug misuse,2024-09-15,2024-06-14,Philippa Roxby,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nnj0wrl49o,"NHS England's medical director says he is alarmed by reports that people are using weight-loss drugs as ""a quick fix"" to lose a few pounds and get ""beach-body ready"" this summer. Professor Stephen Powis said the side-effects of the drugs could be dangerous, and they needed to be used under medical supervision. Interest in Wegovy, for treating obesity, surged after studies suggested users could lose over 10% of their body weight. Drug treatments are now seen as an important tool in tackling obesity. Wegovy, a weight-loss injection, can be prescribed on the NHS in England to people at the top end of the obesity range through specialist weight management clinics. It contains the drug semaglutide, which makes people feel full and reduces their appetite. Another anti-obesity drug called Mounjaro could be recommended for NHS use soon. Semaglutide is also contained in the type 2 diabetes treatment Ozempic. It has not been approved for helping people who are obese to lose weight - yet there is huge demand for the medication, creating a shortage for diabetes patients. Many online pharmacies are selling semaglutide injections for between £100 and £200, but they make few checks on the weight or underlying health of the person buying them. A recent BBC investigation found an online black market in sales of semaglutide without prescription, which doctors said could put people's health at risk. The investigation also found the drug being offered in beauty salons in London and Manchester. In a speech at the NHS Confederation conference on Thursday, Professor Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said the drugs had clinical benefits, but he was alarmed to hear reports of them being ""inappropriately used"". ""These are powerful medications that have side-effects and complications - and can in certain circumstances, be dangerous,"" he said. ""So, they need to be used under medical supervision. They are absolutely not quick fixes for those who are otherwise healthy, who just want to lose a few pounds."" Prof Powis also said: ""We know these new drugs will be a powerful part of our arsenal dealing with obesity – but they should not be abused.  “Drugs including Ozempic and Wegovy should only be used by people prescribed them for obesity or diabetes – I’m worried about reports that people are misusing them – they are not intended as a quick fix for people trying to get beach-body ready."" The medications can cause side-effects such as nausea, bloating and vomiting, but for some people there can be more dangerous complications. Dr Vicky Price, an acute physician and president-elect of the Society for Acute Medicine, said these included ""serious, life-threatening complications, including inflammation of the pancreas gland and alterations in blood salt levels"". She and her colleagues are concerned about the growing numbers of patients they're seeing with complications from taking weight-loss drugs they have bought online. The Royal College of GPs said it was ""highly concerning"" that patients were using semaglutide - under the brand name Ozempic - for purposes the drug is not licensed for, and without clinical supervision. ""It can be a genuine threat to patient safety - and potentially contributes to supply shortages, for those who could really benefit from them,"" said chair Professor Kamila Hawthorne. ""We would encourage patients to take caution when accessing medicine online, and only use outlets that follow GMC (General Medical Council) remote prescribing guidelines, and have been approved by the CQC (Care Quality Commission)."" Prof Hawthorne said it was never recommended to use prescription medication, without a prescription: ""In many cases people might not actually be getting what they think they are, which is really dangerous."""
risk appetite,Stage-four cancer patient hails drug 'lifeline',2024-09-15,2024-06-10,Aileen Moynagh,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9ww1087zd1o,"A terminally ill woman who has lived longer than doctors predicted has said she has been given a lifeline thanks to a new treatment. Christine Campbell, from Dundonald, was diagnosed with stage-four high-grade ovarian cancer three years ago. In July 2023, she was told her cancer was terminal and she had less than a year to live.  Now, almost a year later, she has started treatment with a drug called Avastin. It has been available in Northern Ireland for a few years but this is Christine's first time having it prescribed. Also known as bevacizumab, the drug is a targeted treatment that stops the cancer from growing blood vessels, preventing it from getting bigger. In 2021, the 58-year-old was experiencing the symptoms of ovarian cancer: bloating, tiredness, loss of appetite. But the condition went undiagnosed for five months because she said she could not get a face-to-face GP appointment. Christine was diagnosed as an emergency patient after a red-flagged gynae consultation, which she said ""basically saved my life"". ""It took me a long time to change my mindset and go: 'This is my new normal, this is how my life is going to be going forward.' And I could choose what I wanted to do with that,"" she said. When Christine was told her cancer was terminal, she said it was as if ""somebody slammed me into a wall and all the life, and the breath was knocked out of me"". ""I felt the world was unfair,"" she said. ""I'm a mother, I'm a daughter, I'm a sister, I'm a niece, I'm an aunt, I'm Christine. I'm not just cancer."" So she made the choice to use her voice and became ""more determined"" to raise awareness around ovarian cancer.  ""People don't have to be in a position of power to make changes, but if I can influence that change in some way, that's what I will continue to do."" But she admits to feeling like she's living on borrowed time.  ""There is a joy in getting up every day and being able to do something, but also when you go to bed at night, you think is that a day closer to me running out of time,"" she said. ""It is quite difficult to deal with that sometimes."" When Christine was given her terminal diagnosis, she asked how long she could expect. ""I know it's a guesstimate. ""I know nothing is ever written in stone and everybody's cancer journey is unique. ""I always held on to that little bit of hope that I would be the one to buck the trend."" She added: ""I'm very much someone who tries to be positive and have some hope, but there are dark days."" According to the NI Cancer Registry, on average 200 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Northern Ireland each year. About 11% of those diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer survive for five years or more. ""Even if I hadn't got that less than 12 months diagnosis, there was still that ticking time bomb of I probably did have less than five years,"" she said. But Christine is still here and still fighting. She does ""think of timeframes"" when it comes to something as innocuous as buying theatre tickets for the coming months but that doesn't stop her mapping out things to enjoy with family and friends - even if it's not too far ahead.  ""Some might say I'm stubborn, but I just feel determined and I've still things to do,"" she added. ""For quite a while, I was afraid to look to the future. I don't mean five or 10 years down the line. The future to me was a month or two down the line. ""Now I've put that aside, because it allows me to live and to get on with my life as best I can."" Christine's new Avastin treatment began at the start of June. It was not available to her when she was diagnosed last year.  She said she's hopeful but also anxious about potential side effects.  ""Some of them can be quite serious, but I'm willing to take that risk at this moment in time. ""It still allows me some element of control over my treatment as well, because if I feel that I can't tolerate the treatment, I then have to look at do I want quality of life over quantity of life. ""Again, that's a very difficult decision to make."" This treatment will potentially give Christine more time and she is holding on to that hope. After surpassing her last prognosis, she hasn't been given another one - and she's content with that.  ""The not knowing this time what the final diagnosis will be let's me concentrate on being me, doing things that I enjoy and not putting things off,"" she said. And part of being Christine, she said, is advocating for all those with ovarian cancer for as long as she can.  Symptoms of ovarian cancer include frequently (roughly 12 or more times a month) having: Other symptoms of ovarian cancer can include:"
risk appetite,Five ways Michael Mosley made us healthier,2024-09-15,2024-06-10,Philippa Roxby,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wwv0405wyo,"TV and podcast presenter Michael Mosley was best known for offering tips on simple ways to improve our health and wellbeing, backed up by science - everything from when to exercise and what to eat to how to get more sleep. He was often the guinea pig - willing to try out anything before recommending it to others (swallowing tapeworms and trying psychedelic drugs, for example). ""Michael wanted to look at whatever would help people live better, healthier lives,"" says his former co-presenter on Trust me I'm a Doctor, Dr Saleyha Ahsan. ""Something that wasn't a fad, that they could keep going at and which they didn't feel guilty about."" We pick out his top five health hacks: He popularised the idea of intermittent fasting - eating normally on five days a week and much less than usual on the other two, in order to lose weight and boost your health. It's called the 5:2 diet, and it sparked huge interest when his Horizon TV programme Eat, Fast and Live Longer was broadcast more than 10 years ago. Wanting to reverse his type 2 diabetes, he stuck to the diet for five weeks, eating fewer than 600 calories on fasting days, with a light breakfast and dinner and plenty of water and herbal tea in between. During that time, he lost nearly a stone and his blood markers, including glucose and cholesterol, improved. The notion of fasting to cut calories got the nation talking and spawned fasting recipes, calorie-restricted menus and even a book. To make it even easier, he challenged people to simply try staying away from food for 12 hours a day, between 8pm and 8am, for example - something called time-restricted eating.  Doing the recommended amount of exercise each week is a challenge for many. ""When do I find the time?"" is the frequent complaint. Dr Mosley's Just One Thing podcast researched the concept of ""exercise snacking"" - doing a few minutes of physical activity whenever possible, rather than scheduling one long gym session that might not happen. For those with busy lives, he suggested shunning the lift and running up the stairs instead, and going for brisk walks, particularly first thing in the morning. ""We live at the top of a steep hill - I always cycle down to the town for the shopping and push myself hard on the way back,"" he said on the podcast, illustrating how to make exercise an integral part of his daily routine. He also investigated the more controversial concept of high-intensity interval training, or HIIT - short bursts of intense exercise with periods of recovery in between - as a way of maximising workout time. Dr Mosley was fascinated by how cold temperatures could be harnessed to help our health and wellbeing. He investigated the benefits of everything from taking cold showers to exercising in the cold and sleeping in a cool bedroom. In interviews, he revealed how he liked to turn the heating down at home. ""I live in an old house which is expensive to heat - so we pile on layers of clothes and keep the thermostat at about 15 degrees,"" he said, adding that his wife was less keen on the arrangement. He discovered that turning the thermostat down by just a few degrees could improve fat and blood-sugar metabolism, boost your mood, and might even protect against type 2 diabetes. When he went for a jog on a chilly day, he found out how exercising in colder weather can allow you to go further than on a hot day, enabling you to work harder, for longer, with less effort. And he was also a fan of taking cold showers (like motivational speaker and extreme athlete Wim Hoff), admitting he started every morning in a warm shower and turned it to cold for around 30-to-40 seconds. The body's reaction to being immersed in cold water - the cold shock response - forces up the heart rate and makes you breathe more quickly, which is thought to be beneficial in short bursts. ""It's the best simple exercise you can do,"" said Dr Mosley in a recent interview. What was he talking about? Squats, press-ups and planks. These are resistance exercises, working some of the biggest muscles in the body. When muscles are tensed and held still, as these exercises demand, research suggests there is a sudden rush of blood when you relax, which can reduce blood pressure. As they are potentially better than doing crunches or sit-ups for the core muscles, he would do squats every morning - before his cold shower, of course.  Most of us know what we should be doing to eat healthily - eating plenty of fruit and vegetables and cutting back on fatty and sugar-laden foods being the primary objectives. But are there hidden health benefits in some foods? Thanks to Dr Mosley, we learned it's potentially better to cook tomatoes than eat them raw. Tomatoes contain a powerful antioxidant, called lycopine, which helps the body fight off damaging chemicals, and cooking the red fruit lets the good stuff out and into the body. And when it comes to beetroot, he concluded it was best to buy it raw and bake it, or drink the juice to enjoy this nitrate-rich purple veg. Mosley looked at the merits of fermented foods, such as yoghurt, kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut, and found they helped introduce live microbes into the gut and could improve the body's immune system and reduce inflammation. But he wasn't against eating the odd bit of chocolate, particularly when it was dark - much healthier than the milky version, according to studies. One unexpected discovery he made was that eating pasta cold is healthier than eating it hot. When cold, it was found to act more like fibre and less like a starchy carbohydrate. In a small trial in hungry people, eating cold pasta led to a smaller spike in blood glucose and insulin than eating freshly boiled pasta. Some of his health drives didn't catch on, however - including consuming blood because of its nutritious properties and eating parasites to reduce appetite."
risk appetite,"Rise in fraud and scam complaints, report says",2024-09-15,2024-06-06,George Thorpe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gg7dwlz3xo,"Banking fraud and scam complaints in the Channel Islands have more than quadrupled in a year, a report has said. The Channel Islands Financial Ombudsman (CIFO), which handles complaints about financial services, published its 2023 annual report detailing the complaints it dealt with in Jersey and Guernsey. The report said overall there were 562 complaints about financial services in 2023, up from 500 in 2022. Of those, 22 complaints were specifically about fraud and scams, compared with five in 2022. Cases investigated by CIFO in 2023 included a ""romance scammer"" taking £120,000 from a man and a fraudster who pretended to be a cryptocurrency investor taking £17,750 from someone. The watchdog said the level of fraud and scam complaints were ""high"" across the islands, with an ""increasing level of sophistication"" about the scams reported. Along with scams, CIFO said it also noticed a rise in banking complaints where accounts were reportedly blocked ""due to suspected fraudulent activity"". It added there were cases where banks did not give customers a reason for why their accounts had been shut down. ""Bank account closures were also prevalent and arose where customers were not locally resident or where a change in the bank's risk appetite had occurred,"" the report said. ""In some cases, banks were simply not providing a reason to their customers for closing their accounts."" CIFO's annual report said it was able to close 343 cases in 2023, an increase on the 309 cases closed in 2022. It said 67% of cases it dealt with were resolved without needing a final decision from the ombudsman. The report said 48% of complaints CIFO received in 2023 were closed within the month they were received. Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

risk appetite,NHS computer issues linked to patient harm,2024-09-15,2024-05-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nn0vl2e78o,"A BBC News investigation has heard claims of a “cover up” of the scale of problems with NHS IT systems - used to manage patients’ medical records. IT system failures have been linked to the deaths of three patients and more than 100 instances of serious harm at NHS hospital trusts in England, BBC News has found. A Freedom of Information request also found 200,000 medical letters had gone unsent due to widespread problems with NHS computer systems. Nearly half of hospital trusts with electronic patient systems reported issues that could affect patients. NHS England says it has invested £900m over the past two years to help introduce new and improved systems. Introducing computerised records and making the NHS paperless is a government priority in England. The aim is for everyone's health information to be accessible to GPs, hospitals and care homes at the touch of a button. But there have been numerous false starts. The latest deadline, set by the Department of Health and Social Care, is now 2026. Some hospital trusts have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on new electronic patient record (EPR) systems, but BBC News has discovered many are experiencing major problems with how they work. Separate to our FOI investigation, coroners have highlighted the role that hospital IT systems have played in the deaths of some patients. Twenty-two-year-old Darnell Smith's case is one example.  “He was our rock, you know. He had a big personality. Words can’t really explain how much he was to us…” says Erroll Smith of his son, Darnell. Darnell had sickle cell disease, cerebral palsy and was non-verbal. He was admitted to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, in Sheffield, with a cough and cold-like symptoms and a reduced appetite, in November 2022. He should have had his vital signs – heart rate, blood pressure and temperature - checked by staff every hour for a minimum of six hours - but there were no checks for more than 12. Staff were not aware of Darnell’s particular needs because his personal care plan was not easily visible in the hospital's computerised records, a coroner later concluded. His father told BBC News: “For me, the IT system should be set up in a way where you have to see it… you know - it just doesn't allow you to move any further until you've read what you're supposed to read.” Several hours after his care plan came to light, Darnell was admitted to critical care and was put on a ventilator the next morning. He died from pneumonia two weeks later. Following an inquest, the coroner warned of a “real risk of further deaths” if doctors couldn’t access important information about patients’ care needs. Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Trust has apologised for the care Darnell received. They say they have already made changes to limit the chances of this happening again and a new IT system is being introduced this year. In September, we reported that more than 24,000 letters from Newcastle hospitals had not been sent from their EPR system and more than 400,000 letters had got lost in computer systems at hospitals in Nottingham. A Freedom of Information request sent to all acute hospital trusts in England, of which 116 responded, found that these were not isolated incidents: The failure by hospitals to send out letters to GPs and patients could mean anything from an appointment to a cancer diagnosis or change of medication being missed. The Royal College of GPs said it was shocked and surprised by the findings. “Now that we know there is a problem, it is crazy not to do something quickly in order to save lives and keep people safe,” said Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the college. Separately, a number of clinicians contacted BBC News about electronic patient record systems. None of them wanted to be named because of fears over speaking out. Some of their concerns about the computer systems include: Professor Joe McDonald, a former NHS clinical leader, says the financial costs of the systems are huge - but there are also worrying costs for patients. “The thing about paper is when you make a mistake you make them one at a time,” he said. “With electronic patient record systems, it gives you the opportunity unfortunately to make the same mistake thousands of times.” Prof McDonald says the current roll-out of electronic patient records across trusts is “a broken jigsaw” because very few are able to connect with each other, making information sharing a real challenge.  He also believes there are echoes of the Horizon scandal at the Post Office. “There is undoubtedly a culture of cover-up in the NHS and nowhere is that stronger than in the health IT sector,"" he added.  “It’s not safe. It’s really not safe."" When 31-year-old Emily Harkleroad collapsed in December 2022, she was taken to A&E at University Hospital of North Durham, where a blood clot on her lung, known as a pulmonary embolism, was diagnosed. But there were errors and delays in giving Emily the blood-thinning treatment she urgently needed. She died the following morning. A coroner's report found that Ms Harkleroad’s death could have been prevented. A new computer system, installed just months earlier, did not clearly identify which patients were the most critically ill and needed to be prioritised by senior doctors, an inquest heard. Clinicians had previously raised concerns about the system. The coroner called on the hospital trust and software supplier Cerner, now owned by Oracle, to take action to prevent future deaths. Oracle told BBC News: ""We extend our condolences to the family of the deceased and others bereaved.  ""While there is no suggestion that software was at fault in this case, we continue to work closely with our NHS partners to implement successful programmes that help them deliver the safest and most effective care for the 16 million citizens our systems support in the UK.” County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust told BBC News it was taking the coroner’s report extremely seriously. Through our Freedom of Information request, the BBC has also learned that more than 2,000 incidents of potential patient harm at the Durham trust have been connected to the new IT system, and three other serious incidents. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said the coroners' findings for Emily's and Darnell's deaths were ""shocking and deeply worrying"". “It’s essential that our members and their colleagues have access to reliable technology and effective systems that they can trust, and that don’t risk patient safety,"" said president Dr Adrian Boyle. Systems should be designed with clinicians' input and there should be the ability to make urgent adaptations if problems are identified, he added. “This is a ticking time bomb,” said Clive Flashman, from the Patient Safety Learning organisation. “If you look at the sorts of serious issues that are coming out around the country where patients are being harmed, in some cases dying, as a result of these systems not working properly, I would imagine there are tens of thousands of these that are happening that probably never get discussed.""  NHS England said electronic patient record systems had been shown to improve safety and care for patients, by helping clinicians detect those at risk from conditions such as sepsis. “The NHS has invested nearly £900m over the past two years to help local organisations introduce new and improved systems, so they are no longer relying on paper records or patchwork systems – which carry far greater risks to safety, care delays, and patient privacy,"" said Professor Erika Denton, national medical director for transformation at NHS England. “However, like any system, it’s essential that they are introduced and operated to high standards, and NHS England is working closely with trusts to review any concerns raised and provide additional support and guidance on the safe use of their systems where required.”"
risk appetite,Half of players using snus would like to stop - study,2024-09-15,2024-05-28,Ben Collins,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c100p6572n4o,"The PFA is aware that ""snus use is becoming more prevalent"" in professional football in the UK Almost one in five male professional players who took part in a new survey are using snus, nicotine pouches or both - and nearly half would like to stop using snus within 12 months. The study by Loughborough University, commissioned by the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), also identified that two out of five players had tried the pouches at least once. The report suggests the actual usage figures are ""likely"" to be higher because players may not want to disclose they use snus even in an anonymous survey, which was the first research on its specific use in football. As many as 628 male players, based at either Premier League or EFL clubs, were surveyed - as well as 51 Women's Super League players. Of the male respondents, 18% said they currently use snus while 42% said they had tried the substance at least once. The figures for female players were 22% and 39% respectively. Nearly half of the men (48%) indicated a desire to quit using snus in the next year, but just 9% in the WSL. Interviews were also conducted with 16 professional club performance and medical staff. Snus is a tobacco product in a sachet, similar to a small tea bag, which is placed under the lip and releases nicotine into the bloodstream. It is illegal to be sold in the United Kingdom but not against the law to use, while tobacco-free nicotine pouches are legal. Most players used nicotine pouches rather than tobacco-based snus. However, they often referred to nicotine pouches using the term 'snus'.  Snus use a concern, says ex-England keeper James 'Several' players seeking help for snus addiction Of the 45 men and 11 women that perceived a performance benefit from using snus, 29% and 55% respectively cited improved mental readiness as the key benefit. Of the 84 men and 11 women who replied as to whether they had experienced certain effects, 56% and 36% respectively said snus had helped them relax. It is used most commonly after training and after matches, with one of the performance and medical staff saying players used snus as a ""coping mechanism"". The survey found the pouches are also used as an appetite suppressant, and that users often started using the products in a bid to fit in with other often more senior team-mates. For male players, 56% gave this as a reason, rising to 73% among women. The report noted that a review of available evidence suggests snus use is associated with an increased risk of oesophagus and pancreatic cancer in comparison to non-smokers, and to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There is also strong evidence of an association between snus use and mouth lesions. A majority of male players (58%) and more than three-quarters of female players (86%) in the study said they had not previously received any education about snus. In March 2023, the PFA said a growing number of players were using snus with some receiving help for addiction. More than half of the male users in the survey (53%) and almost three-quarters of the female users (73%) reported elements of nicotine dependence - such as cravings and using without awareness or intention - while withdrawal symptoms reported included anxiety, irritability and restlessness. Nearly two-thirds of the male respondents (62%) in the survey said they sourced snus products from a shop while just over half the women (55%) purchased them online. The report also highlights the risk of an adverse anti-doping finding if products have been contaminated. It adds that club bans had not been effective in deterring use, and recommends personalised, external support - avoiding stigmatising those seeking help. ""This is an important piece of work that will help players, clubs and medical staff make informed decisions about snus use,"" said Dr Michael Bennett, the PFA's director of player wellbeing. ""Importantly, these findings tell us that while a lot of players appear to be looking to substances like snus as a coping mechanism to handle the growing demands of the game, many are not fully aware of its effects and addictive qualities."" Dr Daniel Read, lead researcher and lecturer at the Institute for Sport Business, Loughborough University London, added: ""The findings show that snus and tobacco-free nicotine pouch use among professional footballers is higher than typically seen in the UK general population and players often use these products to relax and manage stress.""

risk appetite,Cows in the US have bird flu - is it inching closer to humans?,2024-09-15,2024-05-22,David Aaronovitch,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clee5685w19o,"The H5N1 strain of avian flu has been around since 1996, but until now it has been largely confined to animals. But it has now jumped to cattle in America and some think it means we are inching towards eventual human-to-human infection, with potentially serious consequences. H5N1 first appeared in geese in wet markets in Guangdong, China. Since then there have been various outbreaks around the world where chickens and wild birds have become infected. But as Covid was ravaging the human world, H5N1 began to spread quickly, killing millions of birds – both reared and wild – and affecting seal and sea lion populations around the globe. The virus has also appeared in a mink farm in Spain and polar bears in the Arctic. The question we were asking was where would it go next? A few weeks back we got our answer. In March, farmers in Texas and Kansas started reporting that their cows had low appetites and were producing less milk. Tests came back positive for H5N1. And this was not just individual cases brought on by chance contamination: the cows were infecting each other. Since March, H5N1 has been confirmed in dairy cattle in nine US states. Scientists are still trying to establish how the virus is being spread. “Right now it seems like the milking equipment may be one of the ways,” says Dr Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health “Scientists are finding very high levels of virus in milk. And so that's why the milking equipment seems like it might be playing a role.” She adds that the spread of the virus between states seems to be down to the movement of infected cows across state lines. The Briefing Room: Avian Flu  Avian flu is evolving but what risk does it pose to us? David Aaronovich investigates for The Briefing Room.  Listen now on BBC Sounds Reporting and surveillance of cattle movement in the US is poor compared with the UK and Europe where the BSE outbreaks of the mid-nineties led to all cows having to be tagged. Science journalist Kai Kupferschmidt says that in an ideal world, we’d know how many cows were asymptomatic carriers and speed up our capacity to test for antibodies in the blood. “We really should know a little bit more and have a bit more data,” he adds. In March, a dairy farm worker in Texas began displaying symptoms after direct and close contact with sick cows. After treatment he made a full recovery. Tests on the virus showed it had mutated to be better adapted to mammalian cells. Dr Rivers says that specific mutation has not been detected elsewhere, so it could be that the virus only mutated in that case. “As long as that human didn't pass the virus on to other humans, then it's sort of a dead end situation,” she says. So we aren’t there yet, and perhaps not even close. But Kai Kupferschmidt says that while he doubts we’ll be in a H5N1 pandemic next week or next month, the virus is inching closer to humans. “The reason we are not in a pandemic has nothing to do with us humans reacting appropriately in this situation,” he says. “I think it's only because the virus, so far, seems pretty bad at infecting humans. So in some ways we are at the mercy of this virus‘ capabilities to change.” And here’s the problem - we’re giving H5N1 a pretty good environment within which to mutate and if that goes on long enough, it’s very possible that the virus will hit on a combination that makes it well suited for humans. Transmission from animals to humans is very rare. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that from 2003 to 2024 there were 889 known human cases of H5N1 in 23 countries. A little over half of those cases have resulted in death but many more cases will have gone undetected and the fatality rate are likely to be far lower. There have been no reported cases of H5N1 in cows in the UK. Professor Ian Brown, who leads the avian virology group at The Pirbright Institute says the UK – like Europe - has very strong animal health systems that are designed to track and monitor changes in disease traits. He says: “If something like milk drop, which has been reported in these cattle, was substantive, changes in that that wouldn't have gone under the radar of recognition, and would probably have been followed up.” Given that, and in the wake of Covid, you may be wondering about vaccine preparedness. The WHO meets twice a year to discuss emerging strains of influenza virus and I was extremely relieved when Prof Brown told me that initial data indicates that there already candidate vaccines to match the strains in cattle in the US. It's a paradox, but just as we have helped create the circumstances in which viruses like to mutate and spread, we’ve simultaneously become far better in tracking them and developing defences against them.

risk appetite,Naples sits on a monster that could consume it,2024-09-15,2024-05-21,Richard Fisher,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240321-the-risk-of-volcano-eruption-in-naples-vesuvius-campi-flegrei,"Beneath one of Italy's most densely populated cities, there is danger brewing. Naples is a city that moves at more than one pace. At the fastest speed, you have the chaos of the day-to-day: cars and motorbikes hurtling through the Italian city's streets like blood cells within a vein. Then there is a slower evolution, that of human history. This is a metropolis still shaped by decisions made hundreds of years ago: networks of narrow alleyways that no city-planner would ever design today; modern offices and hotels pressed against Roman ruins and centuries-old villas. What's less obvious is that Naples also has a geological pace – and it's this one that holds the most power. Mostly it runs at a barely perceptible creep, but every so often, it accelerates into catastrophe: an eruption of fire and rock that disrupts all other timescales in the city. The volcanoes of Naples keep a different time to human beings – evolving over decades, centuries or even millennia – so it can be easy to assume they are static. This is far from the truth. Vesuvius is the best-known, most famous for destroying Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79AD. It towers above the city. But there are other subterranean threats here, and some of them have far more bottled force. In fact, one of these colossal volcanoes is showing worrying signs that it is about to erupt – and there are hundreds of thousands of people living right on top of it. To find out what it's like to live and work alongside these monsters, I recently visited Naples to make a film for the BBC, speaking to the geologists who study and watch them 24-hours a day. I discovered a city creeping towards disaster, but no-one can say for sure when or where it will happen. One of the last times Naples experienced a major volcanic event was exactly 80 years ago this week. In mid-March 1944, during World War Two, caches of magma and gas that had been slowly building beneath Vesuvius suddenly began to erupt. A US military doctor, Leander Powers, who was stationed in Italy at the time, described what he saw: ""While we were just finishing supper, someone called to say there were huge red streams of lava flowing down the sides of Mount Vesuvius…we could see a glow in the sky. All during the night and Sunday there were quakes of the earth with tremendous roars – similar to thunder... The windows rattled, and the entire building vibrated."" The following day, events escalated: ""The roars became more frequent and grumbled like a lion's roar,"" Powers wrote. ""Streams of fire were shooting thousands of feet into the air, and the countryside was lit up for miles around. Oft times the entire top of the mountain looked as if it were a blazing inferno."" Naples shakes On 20 May 2024, homes were evacuated and schools closed after a flurry of 160 earthquakes in the Naples region. One was recorded at a magnitude of 4.4 near the town of Pozzuoli, which sits on Campi Flegrei. It was the strongest in the region for 40 years. The earthquakes are due to an increase in seismic activity caused by gases or magma below – but it remains unknown whether it signals a potential eruption.  A news report from the time shows astonishing footage of the giant ash cloud, turbulent lava flows, and collapsing buildings. More than 20 people died. Today, Vesuvius is far quieter, and that catastrophic event in 1944 is beginning to fade from collective memory as older generations pass away. Nowadays, the summit is a tourist attraction with coaches ferrying people to the top, and souvenir stalls selling fridge magnets made from solidified lava. I came to follow a group of artists and scientists who were climbing to the summit of Vesuvius on a field trip, as part of a festival called Volcanic Attitude.  Vesuvius is not like a normal mountain. Usually when you reach a summit, you look out to the surrounding view, but here, the eye is drawn inwards, to a giant crater. When the writer Joseph Addison came here in the 1700s, he called it a ""dreadful vault"". When I peered over the fence, however, I saw only shattered rock and a few clouds of sulphurous smoke. It was a sublime experience to encounter an entity with the magnitude and power to destroy me, but fortunately there was no sign of its past fury.  Nonetheless, Vesuvius remains active, and one day, it will blow again. On the way up, the geologist Giovanni Macedonio of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), who was guiding our party, pointed out the ruined topography of past eruptions. When Vesuvius goes off, he explained, it won't be a trickle. In the past, entire hillsides have been blown to pieces. Beneath Naples, the African tectonic plate is colliding and descending beneath Europe, creating a more combustible mixture of magma and gas than volcanoes in places like Iceland or Hawaii. ""Here we have very violent eruptions,"" Macedonio explained in a talk at the summit. ""In terms of energy we're talking about several nuclear bombs. With the difference that with nuclear explosions, the energy is released in less than a millisecond, here that energy is released over several days. But when we calculate the energy in these events, we're looking at tens, hundreds or even thousands of Hiroshimas.""  Anticipating that threat, Naples officials have organised the city into zones: those in the ""red zone"" must evacuate if the threat level rises high enough. Each of these neighbourhoods is twinned with a canton elsewhere in Italy, which will take in people fleeing disaster. Navigating Naples' chaotic traffic and jammed streets, it's difficult to imagine how that might happen in practice. One geologist I spoke to during my trip suggested that, if a warning came, it might well be quicker to walk to safety than try to drive. Later that day, I visited the observatory where geologists keep tabs on Vesuvius and the other volcanoes of Campania, 24-hours a day. Once housed on the slopes of Vesuvius itself, the monitoring station now operates from a nondescript office block not far from the city centre. Inside, though, it looks like a space mission control room, with multiple screens across two walls, showing seismological graphs, maps and cameras focused on venting gases far away. It was here I saw hints of a far bigger volcanic threat than Vesuvius, which geologists are currently keeping a close eye on. Outside the building, you might not know it's there, but here on a giant screen you can see evidence of its presence: a map of the city covered with swarms of coloured dots. They are tremors caused by magma and gases shifting deep underground, and in recent years they have been felt frequently across Naples. On 20 May 2024, the area was shaken by 160 earthquakes, including one with a magnitude of 4.4, the strongest to hit the region in 40 years. The cause? Beneath the city – and indeed most of the bay – there's an enormous ""caldera"", a type of volcanic crater that collapsed after a violent eruption thousands of years ago. It's called the Campi Flegrei (Phlegraean Fields), and it is 12-15km wide (7.5-9.5 miles). Unlike Vesuvius, it has no visible cone, and so goes largely unnoticed day-to-day, but with so many people living on top of it, it's considered one of the most dangerous in Europe. One eruption attributed to it 39,000 years ago was so big that some of the material ended up in Siberia. While making our film, I toured this monster with the geologist Vincenzo Morra of the University of Naples Federico II, who lives and works on the volcano, within Naples' red zone. He picked me up from the train station on his scooter, and as we zipped in between busy traffic, I realised that he probably has a higher appetite for risk than me. ""People aren't really aware that we're walking on a volcano on a daily basis, that we're inside a volcano,"" he told me. A third of the caldera is submerged underwater but the remaining two-thirds are under people's homes and businesses. It's difficult to see the full extent of Campi Flegrei – it's too big to take in unless you're flying above the bay. But we stopped off at one part of it: a place called the Solfatara, where Morra showed me a white, steaming sulphurous landscape, like the surface of an alien world. It used to be open to tourists intrigued by its hydrothermal sights and smells, he explained, but a few years ago it was closed when three members of a family fell into a crater there and asphyxiated. Many people assume that the Solfatara is the volcano, but it's actually only one portion. Various other sites in the area are also part of Campi Flegrei, from the hill Monte Nuovo where there was an eruption in the 1500s, to the Grotta del Cane (Cave of Dogs), which used to be a macabre tourist attraction due to the dense volcanic CO2 collecting on its floor. In the 1800s, people would lead dogs into the cave where they'd drop unconscious due to the fumes (if standing, human visitors were unaffected).  This widespread distribution of volcanic effusions, however, means that it's unclear where any future activity might take place. ""The eruptions migrate over time, so we'll never know where, nor when of course, there'll be the next eruption,"" says Morra. ""And that of course makes the Campi Flegrei more dangerous than Vesuvius."" One evening, I had dinner in the port town of Pozzuoli, a Naples suburb near the centre of the Campi Flegrei caldera, with Christopher Kilburn, a volcanologist at University College London in the UK. He is not a resident, but through spending time here, he has developed a strong affinity to the city and its residents. As children played and people ate al fresco in the July sun, we discussed the chilling prospect of a looming eruption.  At the time, Kilburn and his colleagues had just published a paper about Campi Flegrei that is uncomfortable to read. Using a new model of the caldera, it suggests that an eruption could happen in the foreseeable future. Lately, the volcano has been rumbling and expanding in a way that has Kilburn and other geologists debating the causes. Over the centuries, magmatic and gaseous changes deep within Campi Flegrei have caused Pozzuoli and the surrounding area to continually rise and fall. That's the reason the Roman settlement of Baiae is now submerged in the bay. Yet in recent decades, the ground beneath Pozzuoli has been doing some unusual things. Between 1969-1972 and 1982-1984, it uplifted in rapid bursts. Altogether since the 50s, the uplift adds up to more than 4m (13ft). You can see the consequences at the town's water-line: officials have had to install a second set of moorings in the harbour after the first row rose out of reach of the boats. ""The question is, were these caused by pulses of magma or gas? We don't know,"" says Kilburn. Fortunately, no eruptions followed – and if it was magma, it would have solidified by now. However, what is clear is that the caldera has started to act differently over the past decade or so: there's been a period of sustained subsidence followed by much slower uplift. Kilburn and colleagues interpret this to mean that the volcano is doing something new. If the previous uplifts were benign magmatic intrusions, then this would suggest the recent changes could be gas, he says. And if so, that could mean the volcano is essentially inflating, creating new gaps for magma to push through – and potentially reach the surface. ""The crust today is not in the state it was 40-50 years ago,"" he says. ""Whether there's an imminent eruption or not, it's unusual that a volcano does this."" Kilburn acknowledges that other researchers have different interpretations, and the authorities are not ready to raise the threat level yet. Predicting volcanoes in Naples can be a political – and controversial – affair. After all, claiming an eruption might be imminent creates fear in the public, and calling an evacuation can have severe economic consequences. Not to mention raising a ""cry wolf"" problem if it turns out wrong. More like this:  The official line from the operators of the Vesuvius observatory is that an eruption is not imminent. Some Italian geologists speaking in a private capacity go further, claiming there's no reason to worry. Others, like Kilburn, say prudence and preparation is advisable given the recent changes in the data. ""The fundamental problem we have is that we can't see what is happening down there,"" says Kilburn. Despite decades of close study, there is still no technology capable of peering with enough clarity into the bowels of volcanoes like Campi Flegrei. A drilling project was once proposed, but it was shelved after some raised fears of triggering an eruption. When it comes, it's possible that Campi Flegrei will give the citizens of Naples a warning. We only have one eruption in historic records to go on – in 1538 – and that did show itself before it blew. ""Supposedly, there was an uplift of several metres within 48 hours. There's always the hope that we'll get that sort of warning again,"" says Kilburn. However, Campi Flegrei, Vesuvius and all the other volcanoes in this region are evolving on a timescale all of their own. When they accelerate into catastrophe, it could be tomorrow – it could be decades or perhaps even centuries – but one thing is far more certain: the creep towards that day is inevitable. *Richard Fisher is a senior journalist for BBC.com and the author of The Long View: Why We Need to Transform How the World Sees Time.

risk appetite,Weight loss jab 'could reduce heart attack risk',2024-09-15,2024-05-14,Thomas Mackintosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd188m73vn1o,"Obesity jabs could cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes in people even if they fail to lose much weight, according to an analysis of a study funded by a drug manufacturer. Researchers looked at semaglutide - a prescription drug offered by the NHS - that supresses appetite and is sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic. They said the weekly shots could also benefit the cardiovascular health of millions of adults. The latest results are not in a journal yet but have been showcased at a conference. Prof John Deanfield, who led the work, said semaglutide could have a positive impact on blood sugar, blood pressure or inflammation, as well as direct effects on the heart muscle and vessels. The study, run by University College London (UCL) with 17,604 over-44s from 41 countries, had already shown heart benefits. Now, some data from the same Select trial, funded by Novo Nordisk, suggests there are benefits irrespective of a person's starting weight and how much they lose. Speaking ahead of presenting the study at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Italy, Prof Deanfield said the findings had ""important clinical implications"". He said it was an important discovery - likening it to when cholesterol-fighting tablets called statins were introduced in the 1990s. ""We finally figured out that there was a drug class that would change the biology of this disease to benefit a lot of people. That was a major breakthrough and it's transformed cardiology practice.   ""We now have this class of drugs which could equally transform many chronic diseases of ageing,"" he claimed. Wegovy has the same ingredient as Ozempic - a diabetes medicine said to be Hollywood's ""skinny jab"" of choice. However, experts have previously warned it is not a quick fix or a replacement for eating well and exercising, and should only be offered under medical supervision. Common side effects include nausea or an upset stomach, bloating and gas. And people may put weight back on once they stop the treatment, trials suggest. Semaglutide mimics the hormone GLP-1, which makes people feel fuller and less hungry. It must be prescribed by a doctor - to  overweight or obese patients, who then inject themselves once a week, using pre-filled pens. The analysis examined the amount of time before patients suffered major cardiovascular events - such as heart attack or stroke - or whether they developed heart failure. After 20 weeks on the drug, 62% of patients had lost more than 5% of their bodyweight compared with 10% in a placebo group. However, the risk reduction of heart attacks, stroke or heart failure was similar in patients who lost more than 5% of their bodyweight and in those who lost less than 5%, or gained weight. Prof Deanfield said: ""Around half of the patients that I see in my cardiovascular practice have levels of weight equivalent to those in the Select trial and are likely to derive benefit."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Deanfield said the drug has a “potentially important place” in the treatment for obesity. “There are many people living overweight or with obesity, who have struggled to improve their weight, and these drugs, for that reason alone, produce an important clinical opportunity,"" he said.  “But these are drugs that will also improve their background medical problems. That really is quite exciting."" However, Prof Rameen Shakur, an expert in cardiovascular medicine at the University of Brighton, who was not involved in the research, said caution was needed.  ""We are unclear on the mechanism and biological process by which semaglutide might reduce cardiac mortality per se.   ""I don’t think it is commercially realistic to put whole populations on a medical therapy until you know how the biological system works.    ""Interestingly, there remains a risk of pancreatitis and some rare thyroid cancers which is often not stated and this should also be monitored during the course of patient use."""
risk appetite,Have Iran-Israel missile strikes changed the Middle East?,2024-09-15,2024-04-27,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68900571,"News in the Middle East moves fast. One moment it is all about unprecedented missile and drone attacks between Iran and Israel. The next the headlines return to the fighting and suffering in Gaza. But policymakers, analysts and military leaders are still absorbing the extraordinary exchange of fire just days ago between two old adversaries, one that arguably came a small technological failure away from triggering a devastating international conflict. It is worth considering how close they came to the edge and how deep the abyss that lay before them. This was the first time Iran and Israel had attacked each other directly. Some analysts say the Iranian attack was the largest combined missile and drone assault ever - bigger than anything Russia has levelled against Ukraine. It was certainly the first external bombardment of Israel since Saddam Hussein's Scud missiles in 1991.  Most of the 300-plus Iranian drones and missiles were shot down or failed en route. But I watched from our office in Jerusalem as the night sky was lit up by Israeli air defences trying to bring down the ballistic missiles flying overhead. All it would have taken is for one GPS guidance system to fail for a missile to land in an urban area at huge civilian cost.  ""I don't think people realise how close we were that weekend,"" one senior Western security official told me. ""It could have been a very different story."" Yet some in the West think positives can be drawn from the attack on 13 April and Israel's limited retaliation last week. They argue it was a huge intelligence success to predict the Iranian strike, that the defence of Israel was an outstanding example of allied military cooperation, and that both Iran and Israel learned how to climb down the escalatory ladder.  Let's take the intelligence operation first. I am told the US learned about Iran's plans on the Wednesday morning before the attack on Saturday evening. And crucially, they discovered the scale of Iran's ambition.  ""We got wind that Iran's response would be at the top end of expectations,"" said one high-level Western source. ""And that was a bit of a shock. But it helped galvanise the international response.""  Crucially, it helped the US persuade some countries in the Gulf to join in Israel's defence, including Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Their fear - once they were aware of the scale of Iran's plans - was the risk of an escalatory regional war if Israel had no choice but to retaliate hard. So a mixture of good intelligence gathering and private Iranian signalling (which the US denies took place) gave Israel and its allies time to prepare.  The roles played by Jordan and Saudi Arabia are still not fully clear. Jordan has admitted shooting down Iranian drones in self-defence to protect its sovereignty. It is understood Jordan also allowed Israeli warplanes some access to its airspace. The Saudis are thought to have provided information to the US and kept an eye on any threat from Iranian-backed armed groups in Yemen.  The key point is it worked. The US, British, French, Jordanian and Saudi militaries showed they could operate together on collective air defence.  ""It was an extraordinarily successful tactical operation,"" said the security source. ""The intelligence cued it up, we had sight of the whole area and we worked together. No other group of nations can do that in the world."" Some have also argued this could be the start of a new regional alliance against Iran.  To others, though, that is a typical security and military perspective, one that celebrates technological success while missing the bigger political picture. The more pessimistic analysts argue that if Iran wanted to inflict significant damage on Israel, it could have refrained from giving advance warning, broadened its targets, launched a second wave of attacks - or even ordered Hezbollah to mount a large attack from Lebanon.  Emile Hokayem from the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank said the operation revealed how much Israel had to rely on allies for its defence. He also wondered whether Israel would have enough air defence missiles needed for a higher intensity conflict.  ""As we've seen in the war between Ukraine and Russia, it matters how much of the good stuff you have in stock,"" he said.  Mr Hokayem also dismissed the idea this crisis marked the beginning of a new regional military alliance.  ""We're not at the cusp of a new era,"" he said. ""Arab states have cooperated because primarily they want to avoid a regional confrontation. And they want to demonstrate they're good partners to their western allies. It's also simply a matter of national sovereignty. They don't want stuff flying and exploding in their skies."" The second claim by optimists is that Iran and Israel have learned from this experience. They say both countries - for once - communicated their intentions accurately; they realised they could de-escalate without losing face; and they both had a scare that will re-establish mutual deterrence.  Iran may have attacked Israel but it warned allies of its intent and signalled early it was a one-off. Israel showed it could retaliate modestly, targeting air defences in central Iran and using a small attack to signal a bigger capability, namely that it could hit Iran where and when it wanted.  I am told Iran may even have been tipped off about Israel's retaliation. Certainly Iran signalled from a very early stage it did not intend to respond to Israel's counter-attack.  Both sides certainly will have learned military lessons. ""The attack probably helped Iran identify the relative strengths and the weaknesses of the Israeli air defence system,"" said the Institute for the Study of War. Israel and the US will also have a greater understanding of Iran's tactical strategies.  The counter-argument is that both Iran and Israel broke a taboo, that direct attack is now an easier option.  In an essay for Foreign Affairs, Afshon Ostovar from the Foreign Policy Research Institute says the scale of Iran's attack shows it is no longer convinced by a policy of restraint.  ""The notion that Iran intentionally launched a weak attack does not stand up to scrutiny,"" he writes. ""Iran hoped to land an impressive blow against Israel."" Mr Hokayem challenges the idea Iran and Israel have learned to understand each other. He cites Israel's failure to realise the consequences of its decision to kill several elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commanders in Iran's consulate in Damascus. ""These two countries don't talk to each other. Instead, they just signal through military posturing and third parties. These things can go badly quite quickly. Wrongly reading the other side's intentions - or risk appetite - is a feature rather than a bug in the relationship."" There is also scepticism either side have re-established deterrence. Amos Harel, defence analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said: ""The two countries breached the previous rules of the game, with limited costs… the balance of deterrence between the two countries (is) unsettled.""  Perhaps the key lesson learned by many in this crisis was just how close the region had come to full scale war.  ""It was just a huge relief,"" one Western diplomat told me. ""It could have gone so differently."""
risk appetite,The scavengers stalking the world's cities,2024-09-15,2024-04-24,BBC Future Planet Team,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240423-the-scavengers-stalking-the-worlds-cities,"From ibis to hyenas, a surprising variety of scavengers have been drawn to urban life. Here's how they're thriving in cities across the globe. On the road to Cape Point Nature Reserve, on the outskirts of the South African city of Cape Town, each day people must run the gauntlet of a gang with a habit of ""car-jacking"".  The culprits are notorious – perhaps known as much for the occasional vehicle break-in, as they are for their potently smelly breath. They are, in fact, baboons. And they have taken to life among people with surprising zeal. Further into the city, marauding troops of the primates have learned to raid bins and even invade homes, in the search for an easy meal. The scavengers have become so prolific, there is now a 24-hour baboon hotline, where residents can report offences, as well as welfare concerns.  Of course, baboons are not the only wildlife that has been drawn to humanity's urban sprawl. Across the planet, the original inhabitants of areas now occupied by cities have been standing their ground and learning to thrive, alongside millions of people. Here are some of the extraordinary transformations that have been unfolding.   Each night, as dusk settles over cities throughout Europe, red foxes emerge from their hiding places and begin stalking the streets. Sometimes they saunter confidently along, mingling seamlessly with human pedestrians. Occasionally it's just possible to glimpse the whip of a fluffy tail, as one dives into a bin. These adaptable omnivores will forage for wild foods such as berries and insects, supplementing this with freshly-caught pigeons and scraps found in rubbish.  There are at least ten different kinds of ""true"" fox scattered throughout the planet, from the strange bat-eared fennec fox, to the charismatic Tibetan sand fox. And they have been living among people for millennia – in 1991, researchers unearthed the ancient bones of an individual in Argentina, which recent research has revealed may have been a pet. Today, foxes are thriving in urban areas, with 18 per square kilometre (45 per square mile) in London alone. They're also found in cities in the US, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Coyotes have become ubiquitous in US cities in recent decades. The canines are opportunistic scavengers; they will eat whatever is available, including mice, rabbits, frogs, lizards and food waste extracted from people's bins. A 2022 study analysing the diet of coyotes in New York City found that they consumed large mammals such as deer and raccoons as well as human foods such as chicken, pork and beef. Their flexible diets make them highly adept at urban living. But scientists warn that their consumption of junk food may pose a risk to humans, as urban coyotes tend to carry more parasites and have unhealthier microbiomes – a trait which has been linked to aggressive behaviour.  Many a stroll in a seaside town has been derailed by a passing seagull's brazen food grab. In coastal cities, it can feel like these birds are ruthless opportunists, invading towns in order to pilfer the rich pickings of picnics, barbecues, and even firmly gripped street-food snacks. In fact, it is we who have been invading the birds' habitat. Declining fish stocks and loss of their natural habitat are thought to have contributed to city gulls' search for food elsewhere, including cities and landfills.  ""Over time, they'll build a repertoire of quite skilled behaviours which enables them to liberate food either from your bins or from humans directly,"" Paul Graham of the University of Sussex in the UK tells BBC News. ""I think we need to learn how to live with them."" Next time your food is snatched by a voracious gull, perhaps consider whether we snatched their fish first. Read about the fascinating plight of the city gull in this story by Anthony King. Although reclusive by nature, the lure of suburban life is bringing wild pigs into the lamplight. From the hills of Hong Kong to the beaches of Mediterranean Marbella, where once feral pigs rooted through soil and leaf litter, now they rummage through rubbish. In Berlin, they doze in paddling pools. In Spain, a pair snatched the Colombian pop star Shakira's bag. And, wherever they are, run-ins with local authorities or culling teams are often soon to follow. In the US, where boar are non-native, they are also considered an invasive pest. With populations counted at around six million and rising, at least 35 states now report wild pig populations. The result is an estimated annual $2.5bn (£2.1bn) in damage to US crops, such as peanuts and corn. But just because they are invasive, doesn't necessarily mean their impacts are all bad. In fact, new research is exploring the ways in which their rooting noses and pawing hooves might actually have benefits for local ecosystems; off-setting the grip of dominant plants and potentially mimicking the effects of ancient mega-fauna.    Read more from BBC Future in this article by India Bourke about the divisive presence of North America's wild boar. Hyenas are the infamous villains of the animal kingdom. But these scavengers are not all bad. Hyenas provide significant health and economic benefits to the African cities they stalk, according to a 2021 study by the University of Michigan. Collectively, hyenas remove 207 tonnes (456,000lb) of animal carcass waste annually in Mekelle, northern Ethiopia, preventing an estimated five infections of anthrax and bovine tuberculosis among residents and 140 infections in cattle, sheep and goats annually. In the city of Harar in eastern Ethiopia, the animals even venture inside the city's walls at night, where they feed on scraps and entrails left out by the city's butchers. Small openings in the city's 13th Century walls – known as hyena gates – allow the animals to pass through freely.  Communities on the fringes of Ethiopian cities value hyenas as they ""understand the sanitation services they provide,"" Chinmay Sonawane, a biologist from Stanford University in California, tells BBC Future.  Read more about why we should value scavengers in this article by Isabelle Gerretsen. The animals can often be seen snuffling through reeking piles of rubbish on the outskirts of Kotdwar, a city in the Uttarakhand district of northern India. They probe the waste with their noses, occasionally pausing to gulp down any tasty morsels they discover. But these creatures are not rats or feral dogs feasting on the discarded spoils of human habitation – they are among the biggest land animals on the planet, Asian elephants. Kotdwar – a rapidly growing city of estimated to have 45,000 people living there – sits on the fringes of the forest habitats where the elephants are normally found. As human urban populations have grown close to the forests, it has presented the elephants with some novel and surprising sources for food. One study of elephant dung found in and around the forests of Uttarakhand found tell-tale signs that the animals have been foraging in human rubbish dumps for food. And it appears that elephants living near Kotdwar have particularly taken to this dumpster-diving lifestyle. Sadly, all samples of their dung from around Kotdwar held plastic packaging, bags, food containers and even disposable cutlery that they had eaten while seeking out leftover food, according to the researchers from the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. It is a habit that has also been observed among Asian elephants in Sri Lanka, where garbage dumps provide an easy food source for the animals. One study of elephants feeding on waste at a dump in southern Sri Lanka found the animals were in""better body condition"" than those that did not forage from human rubbish. But there have also been reports of elephants dying after eating large amounts of plastic waste at dumps. There are also concerns that, as human urban populations grow in areas where wild elephants are normally found, the risk of dangerous encounters between our species will increase. Human-elephant conflicts can often have fatal results for both sides. Since ancient times, vultures have been viewed as symbols of bad luck and harbingers of death. But these scavenging birds, which exclusively eat the carcasses of dead animals, play a vital role in preventing pathogens from spreading to humans and wildlife and contaminants from leaching into the environment. Vultures are disappearing at an alarming rate in South Asia and Africa. Widespread poisoning by the veterinary painkiller diclofenac in the 1990s and 2000s led to a 99% decline in the populations of India's three most common vulture species. This has now stopped due to a ban on the use of the drug. In Africa, many vultures are killed because of religious beliefs, with their heads sold as good luck charms or ground up and used in traditional medicines.  In the US, you're more likely to be killed by a bee than a bear, but incidents of bears encroaching on human areas are becoming more common. Or, is it the other way around? Grizzly bears used to inhabit most of the western US, while black bears were common in forested areas throughout the country. Today, 2,000 grizzlies occupy just 6% of their historical range, while 300,000 black bears live in 50% of theirs. They're highly intelligent and inquisitive creatures, and their powerful noses and voracious appetite mean they'll go to great lengths to find food. Most bear conflicts happen when human food – like rubbish, dog food, or fruit trees – is readily available. Bears have been captured on camera breaking into homes to steal food, earning one 500lb (226kg) bear burglar the moniker ""Hank the Tank"". Although bear hunting is still permitted in some states, government wildlife agencies are educating the public how to peacefully coexist with bears. With plump white bodies and long leathery necks and feet, the Australian white ibis is sometimes described as graceful and elegant – at least when it is in its natural wetland habitat. In Australia's cities, it is a different matter. The ""bin chicken"" or ""tip turkey"", as the bird is often not-so-affectionately named, can often be found loitering around sewage treatment plants or pecking through rubbish. But though urban communities of this bird tend to be viewed more as pests than national treasures, research suggests that they might provide a vital reservoir of genetic diversity that could help to replenish wild populations elsewhere.   Wasps enjoy a reputation as the perennial picnic party pooper, winging in to gorge on jam sandwiches, fruit salad and other treats. But their sweet tooth may be overplayed; in the wild they will feed on carrion just as happily as they will on rotting fruit. In areas where European wasps have made a relatively recent entrance – such as in Australia and New Zealand – scientists have been able to observe their dramatic impact on other scavenging species. A 2020 study, conducted in Australia, showed that wasps quickly arrived to feed on fresh carcasses and aggressively attacked competing blowflies – to the point where the flies were not able to lay eggs. Larger vertebrate scavengers such as dingoes were also attacked. And there is evidence that wasps are adapting to city life at a genetic level, too. As temperatures rise due to global climate change, one recent study found that hotter urban areas with less vegetation tend to be home to smaller wasps. This may provide an evolutionary advantage because their lighter bodies need to use less energy to stay in the air.

risk appetite,'I'm lucky I'm still here' - chef Sat Bains,2024-09-15,2024-04-20,By Jude Winter,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68849509,"A chef has described how he overhauled his lifestyle after surviving a ""widow-maker heart attack"". Sat Bains, who has a Michelin-starred restaurant in Nottingham, suffered a heart attack three years ago. The ""widow-maker"" heart attack is considered one of the deadliest, and occurs when the left anterior descending (LAD) artery leaving the heart becomes completely blocked. Mr Bains said: ""I had to relearn everything that I thought I knew."" But he added: ""Since it happened, I've been on an incredibly life-changing, mental and physical journey.""  Aged in his 50s, Mr Bains said he ""knew his cholesterol was an issue"" and, as a gym-goer, following a keto diet, he was sure he was healthy. After feeling chest pain during a workout, the pain then spread to his arm and jaw during a walk around Wollaton Park with his wife. He dialled 999, and was sent to Nottingham's City Hospital for an emergency operation. After 10 days at the hospital, Mr Bains was discharged, weighing 17kg (2st 9lb) lighter than when he arrived. On the heart attack, he said: ""I'd ruptured one artery, and blocked most of the others, so just two or three millilitres of blood were pumping through one artery. I just didn't think it would happen to me. ""The doctor told my wife Amanda, you're very lucky because he should have died this morning. It was that close."" After leaving hospital, Mr Bains said he struggled to walk, had no appetite, and realised he needed to overhaul his diet and lifestyle. He said he still eats red meat - just not as often - and has swapped out his 200g bars of Dairy Milk to a ""couple of Freddos a week"". He thanked all the staff at City Hospital who cared for him. ""I feel very lucky that I'm still here - and I intend to make the most of it - and that means making sure I maintain a healthy lifestyle,"" he said. Jacob Chacko, consultant cardiac surgeon at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ""Despite the name, widow-makers can affect both men and women, with common risk factors including smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease.""

risk appetite,'AI helps me to make wine for younger drinkers',2024-09-15,2024-04-17,By Stav Dimitropoulos and Will Smale,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68788080,"Kara Maraden is in charge of rather a lot of vineyards. The director of viticulture at large US wine firm Foley Family Farms, she is responsible for more than 5,200 acres (2,000 hectares) of vines, scattered across 1,000 miles of California and Oregon. She obviously cannot be everywhere at once, but thanks to AI technology, Ms Maraden can remotely check on the water requirements of individual vineyards from her laptop. ""I can go online and see what irrigations are needed down in Santa Barbara, 300 miles away,"" says Mr Maraden, who is based in Napa, north west of San Francisco. While judging the water requirements of the vines would previously have been done by human judgement and calculation, Foley now uses sensors made by Tule Technologies, a California-based irrigation company. The sensors, which look like mini weather stations, are placed across the vineyards. They measure moisture levels, temperatures, wind speeds, and other environmental variables. All this data is then fed into Tule's AI software system, which has been trained to calculate how much moisture will evaporate from both the soil and the vines under different weather conditions. The AI then determines how much irrigation the vines need and when, and informs the vineyard managers via an app notification.  ""We're always boots on the ground,"" adds Ms Maraden. ""But the data helps us make informed decisions based on science, as opposed to just feelings. Feelings aren't bad, but we like to use data."" Foley Family Farms, together with its similarly named sister firm Foley Family Wines, produce US wines under 23 different brands. Ms Maraden says that the AI irrigation sensors ""have improved grape quality and consistency"". Tom Shapland, chief executive of Tule, says that another benefit of the sensors is that they can help overcome labour shortages. ""The AI provides a watchful eye in the vineyard 24/7."" Tule also makes an AI-powered app called Tule Vision, which can determine the thirstiness of vines after the human user records a few minutes' video of them. The AI was trained with hundreds of images of vines under varying water needs. Other providers of AI-powered vineyard monitoring equipment include US tech giant Cisco, and smaller firms Ceres Imaging and Bloomfield AI. Read more stories on artificial intelligence Once grapes for winemaking are harvested, they are taken into the winery for fermentation. Here too, AI is now getting involved. California-based tech firm Tastry makes an AI-powered app that helps winemakers make wine that a large number of consumers will like. The software does this by analysing a wine's chemical makeup, and quickly comparing it to a database of the taste preferences of 248 million US wine drinkers. Tastry tests for everything from a wine's sugar levels, to acidity and tannins. The latter are bitter and astringent compounds that come from grape skins, seeds and stems. The idea is that Tastry can help winemakers better blend final wines from numerous base wines, varying the percentage of each until a popular taste profile is achieved. Alexandre Remy, managing partner and winemaker at Atlas Wine Company, a California-based wine brand, describes Tastry as his ""GPS system"". ""If I want to create my red blend, I choose from 10 different vineyards,"" says Mr Remy. ""This is where AI really shines. It helps me determine my goal, whether I want to appeal to a younger crowd, or perhaps a crowd that prefers a competitor's wine. ""I can input my parameters into the system, and it will offer blend suggestions based on that."" Monika Christmann is a professor of enology - the science of winemaking - at Hochschule Geisenheim University in Germany. She says that wineries with big volumes, and which need consistency year after year, might find AI particularly useful. Yet she also cautions that the interaction between different wine components is difficult to predict, and not yet fully understood by AI. For wine traditionalists, the use of AI in winemaking, be it in the vineyard or the winery, is an anathema. They argue that it destroys the artisanry that can make wine so special. ""No algorithm can truly understand the complex interplay between climate, soil, and grape varieties that gives wine its subtlety and character,"" says Jonathan Kleeman, executive head sommelier at UK restaurant business Tom Sellers Story Group. ""Nor can it appreciate the aesthetics of balance, structure and aroma that distinguish an exceptional vintage. Wine speak of minerality, acidity or fruitiness is meaningless to a machine. True vintners trust their palate, not [computer] processors."" Tom Ashworth, chief executive of wine retailer Yapp Brothers, says that if he was making wine he wouldn't use AI. ""To what extent the winemaker allows AI to take over decision-making - replacing hundreds of years of experience - I guess depends on the risk-appetite of the domaine, and the accuracy of the AI itself. ""Currently, I wouldn't handover the decision making on key processes in vinification to AI, any more than I would let AI run customer services un-supervised."" Back in California, Ms Maraden counters that AI is about helping human winemakers, and not replacing them. ""We are boots on the ground, we ourselves are always in the vineyard,"" she says. ""What AI is really about [in wine] is making more informed decisions based on science."""
risk appetite,SCO summit : Why peace talks are not on Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s agenda in India,2024-09-15,2023-05-03,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65409483,"Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is in Goa to participate in a conference of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation - the first Pakistani foreign minister to visit India since 2011. Hina Rabbani Khar met her Indian counterpart SM Krishna in Delhi 12 years ago, but circumstances were different then. India and Pakistan were experiencing a limited thaw, and trying to boost trade. Pakistan's relationship with the US was in a crisis. ""The diplomatic moment back then was ripe for attempts at rapprochement. It's a different story today,"" Michael Kugelman of The Wilson Centre, an American think-tank, says. The countries have fought three wars since they became independent nations in 1947. All but one were over Kashmir. In 2019, India launched strikes in Pakistani territory following a militant attack on Indian troops in Kashmir. After the attacks, the two countries had come ""close"" to a nuclear war, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in his recent memoir. But a new border truce concluded in 2021 has kept things under control. When India accidentally fired a supersonic missile into Pakistan last year, Islamabad issued a statement condemning the launch, without escalating the incident into a serious crisis. ""But this isn't to say the relationship is in a safe place. It's always on tenterhooks, even at the best of times,"" says Mr Kugelman. ""Today, it would only take one trigger, one provocation, to take the two sides back up the escalatory ladder."" Not surprisingly, expectations from Mr Bhutto Zardari's visit to the popular beach destination of Goa are low. Before landing in India, he said his visit was ""focussed exclusively on the SCO"" and that he looked forward to ""constructive discussions with my counterparts from friendly countries"".  Mr Bhutto Zardari's  visit underlines, ""most of all that both India and Pakistan attach great significance to the interface with the Shanghai Cooperation Council (SCO),"" says TCA Raghavan, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan.  The SCO, founded in 2001 to discuss security and economic matters in Central Asia, is led by China, a key Pakistani ally, and Russia, an important emerging friend of Pakistan. It also includes four members from Central Asia, a region that Islamabad hopes to engage more for trade, connectivity and energy. ""For Islamabad skipping the conference would raise the risk of Pakistan being isolated from an organisation that embraces its interests strongly,"" says Mr Kugelman.  No bilateral meetings are expected to take place between Mr Bhutto Zardari and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. ""Apart from the fact that a Pakistani foreign minister has not visited India in a long time, this visit is pretty much inconsequential in the larger bilateral context,"" Happymon Jacob of Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, says.   Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to America who is now at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, echoes a similar sentiment: ""The visit, per se, does not represent any thaw in the relationship.""  It's best to look at the Pakistani foreign minister's visit through a ""multilateral lens, not a bilateral one,"" says Mr Kugelman. ""He's not going to pursue reconciliation with Delhi. He's going to participate in a conference of regional organisation that holds considerable importance for Pakistan's interests."" That leaves the two rivals frozen in what Prof Jacob describes as ""cold peace"". He says: ""Neither side wants to rock the boat but has no appetite to make significant concessions to seek or begin a dialogue on the outstanding issues."" Mr Raghavan believes the ""relationship has been stable for the past two years or so but at a low plateau"". Mr Haqqani likens the relationship to ""being on a treadmill with periodic ups and downs"". The redeeming reality is that both countries have a strong interest in keeping tensions down. ""Pakistan is facing an internal mess and can't afford a fresh crisis with India. And India is increasingly concerned about China, its biggest security challenge, and doesn't want to have additional trouble on its western front from Pakistan,"" says Mr Kugelman. But if both sides have an interest in reducing tensions, why isn't the summit in India an opportunity to pursue long-lasting reconciliation? Clearly, politics stands in the way.  ""There would be considerable public backlash in either country if efforts are made to pursue peace. This would be especially costly in Pakistan, where the government is already deeply unpopular and in over its head,"" says Mr Kugelman.   ""At the end of the day, each country believes that its prime condition for formal dialogue hasn't been met: India wants to do more about terrorism, and Pakistan wants India to change its Kashmir policy."" (India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir, but control only parts of it.) India-Pakistan relations are even at the ""best of times remain precarious,"" says Hassan Abbas of the National Defense University in Washington DC. ""Political polarisation, both in India and Pakistan, makes the situation even more vulnerable."" Recent unconfirmed media reports of backchannel talks between the two countries don't impress the pundits - such talks, says Prof Jacob, are more about ""conflict management rather than conflict resolution."" Mr Haqqani offers a scintilla of hope. Meetings such as the one in Goa often ""pave the way for a resumption of dialogue"", he says. Others are not so hopeful. As Mr Abbas says: ""Even in the best of times, Pakistan-India relations remain precarious. Under the circumstances, a 'peaceful limbo' is a good option. In the long run, anything short of a peace deal will be damaging."" BBC News India is now on YouTube. Click here to subscribe and watch our documentaries, explainers and features."
risk appetite,How to look after yourself if you get Covid,2024-09-15,2021-12-16,By Michelle Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-59683083,"So you've caught Covid. What now?  How can you look after yourself or someone else at home, and when should you get extra help? Let people know that you have Covid.  They might be able to help by dropping off food or other supplies, and check how you are doing. The NHS also has volunteers who can help with things like shopping and collecting medicines. Find out more online or by calling 0808 196 3646 (8am to 8pm, seven days a week). Anyone who tests positive for Covid is no longer legally required to self-isolate, although it is still recommended.  You are also no longer legally obliged to tell your employer that you have Covid, but are still advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days. Many people will have mild or no symptoms, and will be able to safely ride out the infection at home. The official list of Covid symptoms has been expanded in England - but not yet in the rest of the UK - from the original three:  It now includes nine other symptoms which are also common signs of other respiratory infections: It's not possible to tell if you have Covid, flu or another respiratory infection based on symptoms alone, official advice says. But spotting these symptoms can help to reduce the spread to other more vulnerable people. If you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to go to work or school, you're advised to stay at home. Get lots of rest, drink plenty of water and take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help you feel more comfortable.  For a cough, try lying on your side or sitting upright rather than on your back.  Sitting up, rather than lying down, is also good if you are a bit breathless.  You could also try: Tips for breathlessness Some people find a gadget called a pulse oximeter useful. It clips on to your finger and checks the level of oxygen in your blood.  This can be a useful measurement to know, a bit like tracking your temperature with a thermometer.  Low levels of oxygen in your blood can be a sign you're getting worse. A reading of 95 or above is normal.  If it drops to 93 or 94 and stays like that an hour later, call 111 or your GP for advice. If it is 92 or below (on a device that is certified with a CE mark, and which you are using according to the instructions), go to A&E or call 999. The NHS website has lots of information about Covid, and you can also get advice over the phone from a pharmacist.  Some people with Covid will need medical care, which might include staying in hospital.  The NHS is also offering some high risk patients a pill they can take at home to help cut the risk of their infection becoming more serious. Get advice from NHS 111 or your GP if:  Go to A&E immediately or call 999 if: If you're worried about a baby or child, don't delay getting help. If they seem very unwell, are getting worse, or you think there's something seriously wrong, call 999."
risk appetite,Council with £469m budget gap 'took risks',2024-09-15,2022-11-30,"By Simon Dedman, Laurence Cawley & The Bureau of Investigative Journalism",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-63780096,"The chief finance officer of a council facing a £469m hole in its budget was warned by independent experts about the ""unprecedented"" risks being taken with public money.   Thurrock Council's shortfall is one of the largest ever reported by a UK local authority. Sean Clark, the council's corporate director of resources, arranged a series of business deals that apparently failed to produce the expected returns. Mr Clark did not respond to the BBC's questions or requests for comment. The Essex council's funding gap is more than three times larger than its annual budget.   On Tuesday, the Conservative-run council admitted £275m of taxpayers' money would be lost as a direct result of investments it has made. Evidence obtained by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and seen by the BBC reveals how, in March 2018, the financial advisors Arlingclose wrote to Mr Clark personally to express urgent concern about the council's ""extreme"" appetite for risk. The company felt that risk was ""well beyond"" all of its other clients, even those who had adopted relatively aggressive strategies.  For father-of-two Rob Gordon, learning of the council's current financial situation is a source of intense anger and frustration. He lives with his wife, Liz, and their two young children in one of the council-owned Seabrooke Rise estate tower blocks. Earlier this year, he said, his children had been made poorly by growing amounts of mould and damp in their flat. The building is currently having new insulation and cladding installed. ""I am angry,"" said Mr Gordon, who was recently injured in a fall in the tower block stairwell. ""You get annoyed, you get upset and you get angry. ""When you are seeing our repairs and work here not being done, but they [the council] have a brand new office, the college has a new front and there is a new school being built. When you can see this going on and you're not getting answers, that's when you get angry."" Thurrock's strategy of investing substantial sums of money borrowed from other local authorities had, wrote Arlingclose, moved the council ""well beyond the tolerances of what we consider to be prudential risk-management boundaries"".  ""Our advice has either been ignored or we simply have not been consulted,"" the letter, seen by the BBC, said. The letter listed a series of risk areas including the £370m invested in unrated bonds, high levels of debt and ""huge exposure"" to local authority funding. It also noted that the company's ""advice has either been ignored or we simply have not been consulted"". The letter continued: ""Arlingclose currently works with several local authorities that have pushed the investment boundaries… but the extent of the risk taken by Thurrock Council without consultation with us in key decisions is unprecedented. ""This activity presents reputational issues, both for Thurrock Council and Arlingclose."" It is understood that after the council terminated its relationship with Arlingclose in March 2019, the authority continued to approve increased borrowing from other local authorities, which at one stage were owed £1bn by Thurrock, in order to finance investments.  Those deals include £655m provided to companies via bonds which financed the purchase of 53 solar farms.  In late 2018, the council started to significantly increase its investment in a portfolio of 32 solar farms. These payments were made in three stages and would eventually total nearly £140m.  In September 2020, the council decided to pause its investment policy. However, it is understood further investments were made for more than a year after that decision was made. The BBC has learned that nine separate transactions totalling nearly £55m were made between October 2020 and December 2021. Those investments include some of the £94m Thurrock has tied up in Just Loans Group PLC, a lender which provides funding to businesses unable to raise money through traditional means. The company went bust in June and the council estimates it will lose £65m.  Other investments include £19m lost in a deal with a company that supplies eco-friendly generators to leisure centres and £14m written off after the collapse of a woodchip boiler business.  Mr Clark has been suspended on full pay since the urgent government intervention in September following ""grave concerns about the exceptional level of financial risk and debt incurred by the council"".  John Kent, leader of the Labour group on the council, described the current financial situation at the council as ""catastrophic"". However, he said the council's decision-making body as a whole was to blame for any mistakes rather than any one individual. He said as an opposition councillor he was not told where the council had been investing ""until the government announced its intervention"" two months ago. ""It is unconscionable and it did not have to be like this,"" he said. ""We've been warning them for years that this reckless gamble with the borough's finances would end in tears. ""If I'm honest, I did not really expect it to be quite as bad as this but it is absolutely catastrophic and it is not only my children but my grandchildren who will be paying the cost of this failure. ""I'm absolutely clear that council officers carry out the policies laid down by councillors,"" he said. ""The responsibility for this catastrophe lies fairly and squarely with the Conservative cabinet. Those people have been running Thurrock Council for the past six years.  ""We are supposed to believe that they did not know what was going on, we are supposed to believe that they received reports telling them they were borrowing £1.5bn but didn't think to ask what that money was being borrowed for or what it was being invested in."" Thurrock is not the only council currently struggling. Croydon Council has announced it faces a £130m black hole in next year's budget and Slough Borough Council revealed it had a £479m blackhole in its budget in July.  Northamptonshire County Council was described as England's ""worst-run council"" when it was abolished in 2021. It had to make cuts of about £34m. Mark Coxshall, leader of Thurrock Council, said: ""At the moment, we are £470m in debt which we can't cover and that is why we are needing to move for exceptional financial support from the government. ""It's a very large figure and I understand that."" He said the government was carrying out a Best Value investigation into ""everything that went on in the borough"" and that would be released by the secretary of state in ""the fullness of time"". Asked about the independent warnings given about the council's investments and investments continuing to be made after they were meant to have stopped, Mr Coxshall said: ""We can't answer that question at this time."" He added: ""These are shocking numbers but the first stage to creating a good plan for recovery is to understand the full extent of the problem."" A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: ""We are aware of the serious ongoing concerns about the financial management of Thurrock Council. ""Ministers have already appointed Essex County Council to the role of Commissioner and Best Value Inspector, giving them full control of the financial functions of Thurrock Council and powers to assess whether there are wider failures."" The government added it would ""not hesitate to take further action"" if needed.

risk appetite,Public sector to compete for ScotRail,2024-09-15,2018-08-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45284199,"Public sector bodies will be able to bid for the next ScotRail franchise, Scottish ministers have confirmed.  Bidders which are wholly owned by the Scottish government could compete with private firms to run the train service.  The parent company of ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne appears likely to be among those bidding for the next contract which begins in 2025.  Transport Scotland said David MacBrayne Limited has confirmed its interest in exploring the possibility of a bid. It comes after the Scottish Parliament was given the power to allow public sector bids for rail franchises under the Scotland Act 2016.  The SNP made clear its plans to use the new powers in its election manifesto in the same year.  Michael Matheson, the cabinet secretary for transport, said the government believed there should be a ""level playing field"" for the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises.  ""We secured the right for a public sector operator to bid for a rail franchise in Scotland, after being denied by previous UK governments,"" he added.  ""Identifying a public sector body to make a bid has not been easy. It was vital to consider a range of scenarios as we want to strengthen competition and achieve best value for the public purse, while delivering continuous service improvements. ""It is important for any public sector bidder to have the appetite to bid; the capability and capacity to see the bid through; and the ability and resources to make the franchise a success. ""It is also our view that the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish government should have full powers to consider all options for structuring our railways to meet Scotland's needs."" The franchise is currently run by Dutch state-owned Abellio, which won a 10 year contract which began in 2015.  However, the government could cancel the contract at its halfway point if the firm fails to meet its obligations.  Scottish Labour's transport spokesman Colin Smyth called on the government to use ""growing evidence of poor performance"" to end Abellio's term early.  ""When the SNP handed the franchise to run Scotland's railways to Abellio, they said it would be a 'world leading' deal, but the reality for Scotland's hard-pressed passengers has been anything but with hikes in fares, overcrowding, delays and stop skipping,"" he said. His view was backed by transport union TSSA, which also argued that the franchise system should be scrapped all together.  General secretary Manual Cortes said: ""Instead of wasting money on consultants to guide them through the franchise process a directly appointed public body could invest in more staff, better rolling stock and better toilets on the trains. The franchise process means passengers pay more and get less."" And Green MSP John Finnie said: ""The transport secretary's insistence that he'll be 'giving equal treatment' to franchise bidders from the private sector doesn't inspire confidence that we'll have a publicly-run, improved and expanded rail service in Scotland any time soon."" Meanwhile Jamie Greene, of the Scottish Conservatives, accused ministers of ""pursuing ideological vanity projects"".  And he warned: ""A public sector operator taking control of the ScotRail franchise shifts huge risk and potentially millions of pounds onto the shoulders of the Scottish taxpayer without any guarantee of an improvement in the quality."" David MacBrayne Limited is the parent company of CalMac Ferries, Argyll Ferries and harbour operator Solent Gateway.  It is a publicly-owned private company and its sole shareholder is the Scottish government.  Transport Scotland said future rail franchise competitions would be ""fair and transparent"", giving equal treatment to all bidders. "
risk appetite,May and DUP deal: What you need to know,2024-09-15,2017-06-12,By Alex Hunt,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40245514,"Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. UK Prime Minister Theresa May called a general election, thinking she could increase her power ahead of Brexit talks. But it turned out she didn't do as well as hoped and her party no longer has a majority of members of parliament (MPs). There are 650 MPs in the House of Commons - so any party getting more than 325 MPs has ""a majority"" because they are presumed to be able to win votes on all the things they want to do. Theresa May's Conservatives ended short of that total - getting 318 MPs (13 fewer than after the 2015 general election), Labour got 262 MPs (up 30), the Scottish National Party 35 (down 21), the Liberal Democrats got 12 (up 4) and the Democratic Unionists 10 (up 2). The Conservatives are still the biggest party in the House of Commons, and they have now agreed a deal with Northern Ireland party the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), to have its support in key votes. The Conservatives' 318 MPs and the 10 DUP MPs together make up more than half the MPs in the House of Commons. No. A coalition normally means different parties agreeing on a joint programme and ministers coming from both parties. The Conservatives and the DUP have agreed what is called a ""confidence and supply"" agreement. This is where the DUP agree to back the Conservatives in key votes - such as a Budget and a confidence motion - but are not tied into supporting them on other measures. Read the full Conservative-DUP agreement. As well as the obvious influence and prestige of being involved with the UK government, there will also be £1bn more spent on Northern Ireland over the next two years than had previously been planned. They have also got agreement on a range of policy priorities - such as keeping the guarantee to increase state pensions by at least 2.5% a year, to maintain defence spending and to maintain agriculture spending in Northern Ireland at the same level for the rest of the current Parliament (which theoretically takes us to June 2022). Read more: Where the money will be spent Basically, they are pro-union (UK, not Europe), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party is now the fifth largest in Parliament - its 36% share of the vote in Northern Ireland resulted in 10 MPs being returned to Westminster. It started as a one-man-band, with the Reverend Ian Paisley, a fundamentalist Protestant preacher, at its helm. He founded the party in 1971 in opposition to what he saw as the increasingly liberal approach of the Ulster Unionists - the party of the political establishment since the state was founded, in 1921.  The DUP may be less overtly religious than it was in the days when the late Rev Paisley was in charge, but on social issues it is still deeply conservative. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. Ruth Davidson, the Conservative leader in Scotland, is gay and plans to marry her partner and had sought a guarantee from Mrs May that any deal would not affect gay rights. Many in Scotland and Wales are also concerned about special financial deals being struck for Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance Party have said that a deal between the Conservatives and the DUP at Westminster would be likely to make power-sharing at Stormont more difficult. The former Labour Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain said a deal would ""jeopardise the neutrality, the non-partisan stance, that a prime minister and a secretary of state must have in relation to Northern Ireland's politics"". The UK government says Westminster business should be distinguished from its role in relation to the devolved administration. Theresa May says she hopes that all the parties in Northern Ireland will ""come together and reach agreement to re-establish a power-sharing executive"" by the 29 June deadline. Theresa May justified calling a snap election on the basis that she wanted a larger majority of MPs, to strengthen her hand in negotiating the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. Brexit did not appear to have been the key issue in the election, however the fact that she has ended up with fewer MPs means there is now uncertainty over her strategy for the talks to come. Those arguing for a Brexit that maximises trading links - a policy Labour held - are feeling emboldened and claim the result showed voters rejecting Mrs May's vision for Brexit. The DUP, which has long been a Eurosceptic party, broadly shares Mrs May's Brexit strategy and has committed to back her in any votes on Brexit strategy. Read more: What result means for Brexit Former Chancellor George Osborne, a man sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister, has described her as a ""dead woman walking"". She had to jettison her two closest advisers to appease critics in the Conservative Party and had to agree to a more collegiate form of cabinet government. She is weakened, but at the moment it seems that there is little appetite among Conservative MPs for either another general election - given Jeremy Corbyn's rise during the one just finished - or a leadership contest to replace Mrs May. There is also, at the moment, little sign of agreement on who could be parachuted in to replace her in a ""coronation"". Theresa May has got through the initial risk period, notably telling her backbench MPs ""I got us into this mess, I'll get us out of it"". The delayed Queen's Speech took place on Wednesday 21 June and the key vote on it is to take place on Thursday. The deal with the DUP means Mrs May is likely to win that vote - if she had lost it would be the equivalent of a vote of no confidence. Although they did not get the most MPs, and got 40% of votes compared with 42.4% for the Conservatives, Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party and its supporters have been celebrating their election performance. The reason for this is the way their support surged during the campaign, from below 30% in many opinion polls to 40%. Written off beforehand by many inside and outside his party, Mr Corbyn took everything thrown at him and has emerged as a man now firmly in charge of his party and, unlike before the election, being seen by non-supporters as having a realistic chance of becoming prime minister. At the moment Theresa May and the Conservatives show no sign of wanting to risk incurring the wrath of voters by calling another election. Once bitten, twice shy and all that. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is the candidate seen as on the rise, so why risk letting him build on the gains Labour made in this election? However you can't argue with the fundamentals, and the truth is that the Conservatives do not have a majority in Parliament, and Labour can't put together a coalition to secure a majority either. The aim appears to be to govern now for a full Parliament with DUP backing - but past precedent - 1974 when there were two elections in the year - would suggest that may be difficult to achieve.

risk appetite,Transcript: 'My Doctor refused to treat me if I went for gold',2024-09-15,2018-06-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-44601860,"Transcript: 'My Doctor refused to treat me if I went for gold' as broadcast on 22nd June 2018, presented by Beth Rose with Ali Jawad. BETH - Hi, it's Beth Rose here with the latest BBC Ouch podcast. And I've got a question for you: what would you choose, the hobby you love or your life? British powerlifter, Ali Jawad, a double leg amputee won bronze at this year's Commonwealth Games. But as a teenager rising through the sporting ranks the last thing he expected to floor him was an illness he'd never heard of, Chron's disease. And with that diagnosis came a decision: choose life or death. Well, first off congratulations on your medal at the Commonwealths. Tell me a bit about how it went. ALI - Well, obviously I came out with a bronze so it went pretty far better than I expected. Obviously to actually make it to Australia was a big struggle for me. A lot of people say it's probably a miracle that I made it. BETH - Really? What was so miraculous? ALI - Well, because after the Rio Paralympic Games my Chron's disease flared and I've been battling it since. Last year was a very bad year: bed ridden for most of it, in and out of hospital, not training, not competing. So, in October I think I relapsed again and my chance of going to the Commonwealth Games were pretty much out by then. BETH - The visual disability that you have? ALI - I'm considered an amputee. BETH - A double leg amputee. But then the thing that people might not know is you also have Chron's, which came on quite late, did it? Tell me about when it happened and why it happened.  ALI - I was at the Beijing Paralympic Games in 2008 and the night before I competed I felt quite sick. Now, I didn't think much of it because obviously in a village environment with loads of athletes bugs are bound to happen and I thought it was probably something that I ate. So, I went to the doctor and they said it was just a head cold. Now, I've had colds before and I've trained through them quite easily. This didn't feel like any head cold I've ever had before. Not only was I having symptoms of like the flu, but my stomach was really hurting and I was going to the toilet a lot more. So, basically the symptoms started to come on and overnight I'd lost about 3kg of bodyweight.  BETH - And as a powerlifter I'm guessing body weight is quite integral? ALI - Well, if you lose that sort of weight that quick you literally do lose your strength. So, I woke up in a very bad way and we had the decision to make: do I either compete or do I get pulled out. I wanted to compete because it's taken me a long time to get there and I put in the work, and it didn't matter where I finished, I just wanted to compete. And because I was so young it wasn't about medals, it was about the experience and competing at that sort of level. So, I competed, and even though it wasn't my best performance I got through it. And I think that's what mattered to me in the end.  But I was still very, very sick; I didn't know why. I thought well, these things happen, I got unlucky, and hopefully next time I won't be sick. But obviously I didn't realise what I had back then.   BETH - I guess you probably thought oh, I've got a stomach bug or whatever. And then did it just continue? ALI - It was weird because after I competed I got a little bit better so I just thought, I got unlucky, it was something that I ate and it was probably food poisoning. I flew back from Beijing and my symptoms got really bad. I was kind of on all fours in pain on the floor, or sometimes I'd pass out from it. I didn't know what was going on. I couldn't eat. I was seeing blood in the toilet. And in probably about eight to ten weeks I lost about two stone in body weight. BETH - And I'm guessing as an athlete as well you didn't really have much weight to lose? ALI - Well, actually I was quite fat back then, I was quite chubby. I lost about 14kg in probably about two months, so something was seriously wrong. Obviously I couldn't train, I couldn't actually do anything; I was bed ridden for a long time. So, I went to the GP and said, look I think I'm really sick. Their reasoning behind it was was that I went to a very stressful environment and I'd worked really, really hard so I just needed rest. I was like, I don't think this is that; I think there's something seriously wrong.  I went back two weeks afterwards, they took a blood test and then I got a call the next day saying, you need to go to hospital right now because your blood tests are abnormal, you need to go right now. So, I got rushed in, had a colonoscopy and they found out it was Chron's. BETH - What was it like to be told that? Did you know what it was at that point, what Chron's was?  ALI - No, I had no clue. I just thought I'd get an injection or some meds and it would be it. But when I sat down with the consultant he said, this is going to change your whole life; you have to prepare to put things in place to try and limit the symptoms. There's no cure for it. And I was like, there's no cure for what? I don't get what's going on.  BETH - We should say that Chron's disease is inflammation of the digestive symptom.  ALI - Yeah. BETH - Did they give you any management techniques? Is there a way to make sure that you don't get flare-ups, or do you just have to take them when they come?  ALI - At the time I got put on steroids straightaway. They're not anabolic steroids, they're catabolic, so they do the opposite of what anabolic does. So, anabolic is to grow and catabolic is to produce muscle wastage and stuff. So, not only was I trying to train through it, I was taking medication that actually probably made me go backwards. But it was the only thing at the time that was going to help my Chron's. And to be fair it did: I started eating properly again. But the side effects of the medication did get to me eventually. Training wasn't going very well. I wasn't recovering. I was having night-time sweats, joint pain. There are a lot of negative side effects to it. BETH - What did you think was going to happen to your career? ALI - Speaking to the consultant he pretty much said, from his knowledge there hasn't been a Chron's sufferer that's ever won a medal at the Olympics or Paralympics before. It would be up to me whether or not I want to pursue it because it's going to be very, very hard. He said, don't underestimate how hard it's going to be. So, obviously being an athlete having an ego you think you can do it surely, you know what you're capable of.  So, I went home that night and actually researched the amount of athletes that have got Chron's, and he was right, there was only one athlete with Chron's that only made it to the Olympics and came tenth. I think she was a canoeist from America I think. I saw a YouTube video of her and she said that she'd probably never reach her potential because of Chron's. And that scared me. I thought, wow, I've got big ambitions and she's saying that because of her Chron's it's limited her progression. And that's where the reality kind of hit me because at the time like it's one thing a doctor saying it, but when a fellow athlete says it with the condition.  BETH - And what were your friends and family saying? Were they thinking oh, sports is a tough career, maybe you should take care of yourself? Did you have that to fight against as well? ALI - Well yeah. Everybody told me to retire.  BETH - And how old were you at this stage? ALI - I was only like 19. I got told to retire straightaway by parents and friends. They hated seeing the struggle and the pain that I was in. Just to get through daily life was hard, let alone being in the gym 20 hours a week and trying to compete at that sort of level. I did, I tried to fight it, and in 2009 I just kept collapsing in the gym, I just couldn't give myself much more than I was giving.  BETH - Was it all the energy, you just didn't have the energy?  ALI - Yeah. So, with Chron's you get extreme fatigue, fatigue where like you just can't get out of bed. That obviously is not great for trying to lift big weights and get through a two-hour session, which was quite gruelling at times. So, I wasn't recovering. I had to make a decision whether or not do I either kill myself doing it or do I retire and try to pursue other things. I made the decision in 2009 to retire in I think it was the summer and to focus on my health.  BETH - Was that a tough decision?  ALI - Yeah, because I've always been the type of person that tries not to give up, no matter what. And for the first time I felt defeated. But at the same time I knew deep down that at the time I thought I'd given it the best I could and it just wasn't working. The Chron's got the better of me, and I didn't want to kill myself so I decided to retire.   BETH - And obviously we started this by saying congratulations at your bronze at the Commonwealth, so what happened? You obviously came out of retirement. What happened in those intervening years and what made you come back? ALI - I took I think it was six months after I retired to try and get back to being healthy again. I got to a point where I was kind of like maybe 60%, 70% healthy. I pursued other sports at the time. My dream was also to win a Paralympic gold medal, so I thought if I can't do it in powerlifting I'll try something else. So, I flirted with rowing a little bit but I didn't like it because I'm not very fit. I actually pursued table tennis for a while. I actually pursued that for two, three months and I was actually training every single day.  BETH - Had you played table tennis before or did you just go in cold? ALI - No. With the Chron's I thought I need a sport that's not as physically demanding, so more skill based, and I thought table tennis would probably fit me because I do like it, I like watching it, but obviously I'd never played it before. But one day I kind of like after a training session I went home and I thought, you know what, this is not me at all. My dream is to win a Paralympic medal but it's to do it in powerlifting, that's what I want.  I didn't tell my parents because they were very upset that I even mentioned it. I spoke to somebody about it and they said, well it's whether or not you risk your health for it and whether or not you ignore what other people say and pursue it. But I knew the risks, I knew the risks.  BETH - And were you living with your parents at this time or had you moved out? ALI - At the time I was.  BETH - So, that made it a bit harder?  ALI - That made it harder. I told my parents that I want to come back. They weren't too happy. And then within that week my Chron's got worse and I got rushed in for emergency surgery that week. That saved my life. I was on the verge of dying then. That was in 2010 in March.  BETH - And did that throw everything up into the air again? ALI - Yea, it did for me. I did not expect to get to that sort of level because I thought I was getting better, but then suddenly within a week of feeling okay I was literally in hospital on a seven-hour operation trying into save my life. It was nuts. BETH - And this is only two years as well, isn't it, since you were diagnosed with it? ALI -Yeah. I got diagnosed in 2009. BETH - So, one year.  ALI - Yeah, one year.  BETH - And you were… ALI - On an operation table, yeah, so it was crazy. BETH - Wow. So, I guess at that point did you just think I need to get better? ALI - No, it was actually the opposite.  BETH - Oh was it? ALI - Yeah. So, the Commonwealth Games in Delhi were in October that year and obviously the operation was in March. The doctor said, you have to prepare your friends and family for the worst tomorrow.  BETH - Wow. Before then did you have any idea that it was that serious?  ALI - I knew it was that serious but I didn't think he was going to tell me, so. BETH - What did you do? Did you speak to your friends and family? ALI - I thought well, the thing is my parents are quite stressy as it is, so I thought if I told them they'd just get more stressy so I didn't tell them. I told my friends instead. I said to them the night before, if you do come to the hospital you might not even see me, I could be dead. He was like, no, you have to think positive, you can do it, you can do it. So, yeah, they were very worried.  BETH - When the doctors or the anaesthetist came up to your bed and say, okay it's time now, we're going to take you down, what was running through your mind? ALI - To be honest I wasn't really afraid of dying. I went through hell with the last 18 months post Beijing, and I thought well, if I die I die, I don't really care; at least if I'm dead I'm not in any sort of pain anymore. And plus it wasn't really a happy period for me anyway, so I wasn't really that scared. I decided in my head if I survived it I was going to go for 2012. BETH - So, seven hours later you woke up and had your recovery and everything. And was that it, was your mind focused on 2012, which of course was in your home city in London? ALI - Yeah. It was quite funny because the nurse woke me up and I thought it was a dream, so I said to her, am I alive. And she was like, the operation went better than expected. And I was like, yes, come on, get in! And I knew from then on that I was going to go for 2012. But I didn't want to tell anybody until after I got out of hospital because I didn't want to worry my parents and my friends.  BETH - And what did the operation do? What was it for? ALI - They removed I think a section of my large intestine which was very, very inflamed. The doctor said afterwards that it was the worst thing he's ever seen. BETH - Really?  ALI - Yeah, because it was pretty bad in there.  BETH - Did you feel a difference once you'd recovered post-surgery? ALI - Obviously the pain was still there because obviously I was cut open and everything, but when it came to the Chron's symptoms they were reduced massively, yeah. I was way better than I've ever been ever since I got diagnosed.  BETH - And then London 2012, you had 18 months training did you?  ALI - No, there were a lot of complications in the lead up to it. I made myself get to the Commonwealth Games in Delhi five months after the operation, which wasn't great because the doctor said you need six months to recover, as in no training at all. I started training two weeks after the operation.  BETH - And did your doctor know this? ALI - He did, he had to sign me off. He didn't want to sign me off. He also said that if I do pursue it and I hurt myself again that he won't treat me. BETH - Wow, that's a big dilemma. ALI - Yeah. He was like, I can't do it; we've worked so hard to get you better, you knew the situation and now you're ruining it. But he said that if I prove that I can get better quick he might sign me off. So, I think I had to see him every seven days to monitor how my scar was, how my symptoms were and stuff. And two weeks after the operation I'd recovered as quick as someone that was like four or five months into it.  BETH - Wow.  ALI - It was crazy how quickly I recovered from it.  BETH - And was that because of your stamina and fitness from previous sport? ALI - Well, hopefully probably laid down the foundations from being a very fit athlete that you can probably recover from these things quicker. But also it was just like I didn't want to give up, because I had it in my head that the Commonwealth Games are five months away and I wanted to do it. Even though training was very difficult I managed to get to the Commonwealth Games, which was crazy. BETH - And what was it like? Was it a huge moment of satisfaction, you'd achieved what you'd set out to do? ALI - Oh yeah. I think the night before the operation if you'd told me I'd be in the Commonwealth Games five months later I probably wouldn't have believed you. To get from that stage to the Commonwealth Games was completely nuts. BETH - And how did it go?  ALI - I came fifth that time. For me coming fifth was obviously better than expected; I didn't want to come last. It wasn't the best performance, but for me I look back and think my medal was actually getting there, against all the odds and against all the pain that I had to go through I was satisfied with what I did. And I knew from then on that this will give me a big stepping stone to 2012. And I knew then that I was probably capable of doing it.  BETH - So, you did do 2012 and then you did Rio in 2016 where you got a silver medal? ALI - Yeah.  BETH - So, you were as far as we know the first? ALI - Well, I wasn't. BETH - Oh. ALI - The week before at the Olympics an American swimmer called Kathleen Baker she got silver and she's got Chron's. So, in the same year, in the same week two Chron's sufferers got a medal.  BETH - So, you joined the club. ALI - Yeah, well she got it first but I'd say it's the same week: we're joint first. BETH - And then obviously just a couple of weeks ago you had the Commonwealths and got your bronze. But I'm guessing in between all of that there was some serious management by your sports team who look after you to get you through.  ALI - Yeah.  BETH - What kinds of things do you have to take on board to manage the Chron's? ALI - I'm part of British Weightlifting on their World Class Performance programme and I work with people that are experts in their field, so I've got a nutritionist and a psychologist and a physio and a sports scientist and team manager and a lifestyle advisor as well. They all kind of collectively work together to make me better, and I've got targets to hit for every single one of them.  BETH - What kinds of targets do you have to do? ALI - Nutritionally obviously you have to follow the diet that was set with me. The diet focuses on obviously Chron's. The impact of training and how to recover from sessions. But mainly it focuses on my Chron's disease, because if I'm healthy I can train, and that's the main priority. Obviously with psychology it's all about being mentally better on what you can be. As a kid I used to be quite anxious before competitions, quite nervous; I think now because of everything I've been through I'm not nervous anymore.  BETH - You're in the 59kg category, is that right? ALI - I was in Rio. After the flare I'm back to 54kg now.  BETH - Okay, so that's how much you weigh.  ALI - Yeah.  BETH - And you set the world record, I think this is the latest world record, of 185.5kg? ALI - No, the world record was the last Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. BETH - Oh okay. ALI - 194kg at 59kg. It's gone now; I don't hold it anymore.  BETH - That's over double what you weigh. ALI - Probably more than three times.  BETH - Three times, all just on your shoulders and arms. One thing I have to ask, because you got the nickname The Showman, following the coverage in Australia, because every time you did a lift that you were pleased with you did like a flip. ALI - I did something, yeah.  BETH- You did something, like sometimes you jumped off the bench onto the ground. Now, what I've got to ask is obviously you've got your two leg stumps: does it not hurt when you land on the floor? ALI - Well, no because obviously I was born like this so for me I've been walking on my stumps all my life so they get used to the ground.  BETH - And you've got no suspension; you can't bend your knees.  ALI - As a kid I used to play football on the concrete so my stumps are very, very used to any sort of surface. BETH - Okay, that's good because every time it made me wince a bit.  ALI - Yeah. A lot of people are like, oh my god does that not hurt, and I'm like no, I'm used to it now so it's good.  BETH - Chron's has been in the news quite a bit lately because of the magician Dynamo has come out. He looked like he'd put lots of weight on but actually it was what they call moon face? ALI - Yeah. So, the medication he's talking about was Prednisolone.  BETH - So, moon face is where your face looks really bloated.  ALI - Yeah. I got really, really big in a short space of time. I looked like Mr Blobby. BETH - That must be quite hard to deal with, especially if you're in the public eye and people are always like, oh gosh, look at the weight he's put on, when it's not your weight.  ALI - Yeah. A lot of my friends were like, wow, how much weight have you put on. I think there was a week when I put on a stone. What Prednisolone does it increases your appetite to a level where you keep on eating; which is good because I lost all that weight and you want to try and get back to a healthy weight. But you put it on so quick that you're having six massive meals a day and you're still hungry. I got to a point where I thought actually, you need to try and fight the urge because you can't gain the weight in the wrong way. Obviously I was really fat so I thought this is probably not the best way to gain it. So, I tried my best to put a stop to it and start fighting the urges of eating.  BETH - That must be quite hard when your body is saying give me some food? ALI - Yeah, especially with someone that likes food. The thing is with training, so obviously with body weight classes I was getting to a stage where I was so above my body weight class I was getting dangerous to lose the weight as well. So, I needed to have some sort of control.  BETH - Do things like Dynamo chatting quite openly about it, and obviously there was mention of you having Chron's disease in the various coverage, has that made other people understand a bit more about what you have to go through in addition to all your sports training? ALI - In the beginning it was isn't Chron's disease to do with your diet, or people said it was IBS. We get quite angry because it's nowhere near that. But a lot of people were either misinformed or were naïve to what the symptoms were. And I think Dynamo coming out, he's a big name, hopefully it has raised awareness of what the disease does and just how bad it really is. BETH - And you're not really taking it easy now, are you, because you've already said Tokyo 2020 is what you're aiming for? I'm guessing it's Tokyo that's circled in red on your calendar?  ALI - That's the big one, yeah.  BETH - How are you going to get there? That seems quite a long time. Are you expecting some flare-ups? Is that how it works? ALI - I hope not. If I have one more flare I'll be out. I was quite adamant going into Australia if I had one more flare I probably will retire this time; it will retire me. My body just can't keep coming back from it. So, my job is now and the job my team has is to try and work out how we do not flare in the lead-up to Tokyo, because we know that one more flare could have severe consequences. BETH - Is that quite feasible that you can get through there without a flare if you're really clever, accurate? ALI - Yeah. So, my longest time without a flare is probably three years, so I can do it. I just have to make sure that I keep putting things in place and keep doing the right things. Hopefully the next 18 months I should be kind of on the road to being healthy again.  BETH - Well, I hope you get there and you do some more of your showman things.  ALI - I'll only do that if I do very well. Actually if I do quite badly and I show off it's bad! BETH - So, we've all got to keep those fingers crossed for the next three years at least in the hope Ali doesn't suffer a flare-up or a setback.

risk appetite,Frasers Group confirms interest in Arcadia brands,2024-09-15,2020-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55256457,"Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has confirmed it is considering buying Arcadia brands such as Topshop. ""We do tend to look at almost everything on the High Street,"" Frasers' chief financial officer Chris Wootton told the BBC's Today programme. He also said Frasers Group was still in discussions around potentially buying Debenhams. The Sports Direct owner has reported a rise in profits, despite a fall in sales. The company said this was partly due to business rates relief, particularly for its House of Fraser stores.  The once-mighty Arcadia retail empire, which also includes Burton and Dorothy Perkins, entered administration on 30 November, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Mr Wootton said it was still the case that Frasers Group is interested in Arcadia brands ""but the process has only just started so there's a long way to go as to ascertain what - if anything - we look at with that"". Frasers Group reported a 7% fall in sales for the six months to 25 October because of temporary store closures during the coronavirus lockdown. However, pre-tax profits for the period were £106m, up from £90m last year.  The group said its growing online business and the opening of new Flannels stores also helped push up profits. The latest results do not include the period when England entered a second national lockdown in November, but Mr Wootton said sales had been strong since stores reopened.  Frasers Group chairman David Daly called the results ""pleasing"" given that nearly all of its stores were closed until mid-June. ""In an industry sector blighted by the decline of the High Street we are really proud of our performance,"" he said.  Last week, Debenhams said that its 124 stores would close - and 12,000 workers would lose their jobs - unless a last-ditch buyer could be found.  Both Debenhams and Arcadia's brands had been struggling before the pandemic, but were hit hard by the loss in sales caused by lockdowns. Given the current retail climate, Frasers' strong financial results are ""no mean feat"" said Julie Palmer, partner at financial consultants Begbies Traynor.  ""The company has undoubtedly benefitted from the trend towards consumers exercising more during lockdown periods, and the growing appetite for athleisure and loungewear,"" she said. ""However, after Mike Ashley confirmed this week that the group was in talks with the administrators of Debenhams, investors will be mindful of the huge task before him to turn around the ailing business should the transaction succeed."" Frasers Group owns 491 Sports Direct stores and 46 Flannels outlets across the UK. "
risk appetite,What India's restless Gen Z really wants,2024-09-15,2022-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60211403,"India's aspiring middle class Gen Z - those between 18 and 25 years old - is making a break from tradition. But can the economy deliver on their dreams? Internet entrepreneur Ankur Warikoo has millions of YouTube and Instagram followers, and receives 300 emails a day from young people. Here is how he thinks the young Indians he has spoken to differ from their predecessors.  When we think of young, middle class Indians, we tend to think of them as hardworking, studious and largely respectful of their families' wishes and traditions.  We imagine young men and women intensely prepping for competitive entrance tests that will earn them a spot in a top engineering or medical school. They are determined to chart a dependable careers for themselves and live out their parents' dreams.  This, of course, is a stereotype.  Many young middle class Indians that I've spoken to have questioned their parents, rebelled and trod alternative paths. They haven't always played it safe. But for the most part, even after a detour, they eventually buckled down and stuck to the script.  Growing up, I was one of these people, and I believed that those who came after me were not that different.  They wear different clothes and use different words (my 22-year-old video editor says it's way cooler to say ""noice"" rather than ""nice""). They have more bars to go to, and perhaps have been in at least one romantic relationship before marrying. But I was sure that if I scratched the surface, I would find someone who was driven and aiming for a stable job. But everything that I thought I knew about young middle class Indians was challenged when I started creating content for them on YouTube and other social media two years ago.  I have made videos that have been watched by more than four million young people - half of them are in the 18-24 age group, and 40% of them live outside of India's 10 biggest cities.  They understand English but are more comfortable speaking in their native language. Every day, I receive hundreds of emails from them - topics range from money and careers to relationships and mental health.  I have engaged with a 15-year-old self-taught coder; a college dropout who is helping his father take their family business digital; a 24-year-old painter who has been painting since the age of six; a freelancer who is already earning three times what he would have made from a full-time job straight out of college; and an accountant by day and beatboxer by night (I have heard her, and she is brilliant at it!).  At one time, I would have assumed these 20-somethings to be quirky exceptions to the rule. But it feels like they are no longer such outliers.  Here are some of the things that struck me about the way they see the world - and their place in it.  For this group of Gen Z, college is not just the route to a job - instead, it's a space for opportunities.  They aren't fixated on the classes they take or the tests, or even the curriculum. College, for them, is a springboard for networking and experimenting. It's where they can mull over or even launch an early version of a start-up or do multiple internships without any financial burden. Young Indians typically never took a ""gap year"" between high school and college.  Taking an entire year off was seen as self-indulgent or a wasteful luxury. But the 18-year-olds that I speak to say they don't want to waste their life trying to be someone they are not. So, they  prefer taking a few months or a year to figure out who they are before they set out to pursue their goals.  Nearly every 20-something I have spoken to sees commitment as a trap.  They want to avoid it early in their life. For them, knowing themselves and owning themselves is far more important than someone else holding their hand.  Although most of them grew up watching their parents focused on stability, they seem to realise that it's a different time now - inequality is wider, dreams are bigger and the paths to success are many.  For them, money is not a source of survival but a source of freedom.  A bungalow in a posh neighbourhood isn't the goal. Rather, it's having money to splurge on a pair of Air Jordans after investing monthly savings in stocks and crypto. YouTube is their school.  They don't particularly care where the lessons are happening. They follow the right people on Instagram for quick and consumable nuggets of wisdom.  They have ambition and audacity. And they have one quality that sets them apart from every previous generation in India - a genuine appetite for risk.  Risk has always been a four-letter word in middle class India. Even in my parents' generation, stability was key. Work-life balance, career fulfilment, impact - these were terms thrown around by the privileged elite.  But Gen Z is not just aware of global opportunities that are available to them - they are also not shying away from giving it a shot.  They know that there is a path to retire at 35 - and they are not embarrassed to chase it - as opposed to slogging until you are 60.  It's why the flamboyant founders of successful start-ups - Vijay Shekhar Sharma of digital payments platform Paytm or Ritesh Agarwal, who became India's youngest billionaire when he founded India's largest hotel network - have become icons.  The fact that Paytm makes no profit, or that Oyo is struggling under a mountain of debt which fuelled its rapid expansion, is not an immediate concern.  And that worries me. Growing up, we were made to wait, often against our choice. We stood in line to buy milk, waited for hours to call someone or days for a letter to be delivered. We waited years to buy a vehicle and a lifetime to find financial stability.  Patience was learnt not by choice, but by the design of the India we lived in.  Now, everything we need - food, clothes, books, movies, even relationships - is available a click away.  The pace of the world, combined with Gen Z's ambition, makes them want everything now - I saw a tweet recently that read: ""My problem is I want everything today.""  This is the case with Gen Z everywhere - but in India, our economy is at odds with this generation's ambition.  Will the young accountant become a full-time beatboxer?

risk appetite,People 'snapping up' post-Covid bucket list trips,2024-09-15,2021-06-08,By Nicholas Bourne,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-57404696,"People are planning bucket list holidays due to ""pent up demand"" for a break, according to Welsh travel agents. They said places like the Maldives were being snapped up for 2022 with people ""definitely spending more"". But, for this year, the demand remains for UK staycations. Accommodation with hot tubs are proving popular along with cottages and lodges for families holidaying at home. The Welsh government has said people should only go abroad for ""essential purposes"", and First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to stay in Wales this year. Suzanne Cumpston, from Sam Smith Travel in Cowbridge, said the desire for international travel appears to have been ""suppressed"" for now - but longer term, people were looking to travel further afield. ""The appetite for 2021 is leaning towards UK staycations,"" she said.  Summer bookings are made up of breaks at UK lodges and cottages, she said, with hot tubs a requirement whenever possible. Other customers have booked holidays to the Maldives, the US, Iceland and the Greek islands from the latter part of the year in the hope they can go ahead. And one customer has just booked a £65,000 wedding party of about 15 people to Antigua in 2022.  ""People are booking to go longer, [to] bucket list places and upgrading rooms because they have lost out,"" she said. Other travel agents told BBC Wales that customers have increased their holiday budget and booked luxury breaks to places including Mauritius and the Canadian Rockies in 2022. But for now many have opted for staycations in Wales, Devon, Cornwall and on UK cruises. Mark White, boss of Ocky White Travel, Haverfordwest, said ""it seems everything with a hot tub will sell"" when it comes to booking a holiday at home. He said he was advising people ""not to commit to 2021 foreign holidays"" until further reviews of the travel traffic light system and in the hope the green list will open up. Wales has a traffic light system of travel, like in England, meaning countries are categorised due to risk. Portugal has now moved to the amber list, meaning arrivals must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days. ""Some people are still determined to go away,"" said Mr White. ""We are seeing more wish-list destinations coming through. ""People have learned not to take anything for granted and to take opportunities when they arise,"" he said. Travel agent Darren Owen said customers at Snowdonia Travel and Cruise in Colwyn Bay have rescheduled foreign holidays up to four times due to Covid travel rules. He said that made it financially difficult for independent travel agents who do not receive their commission until a few weeks before people go on holiday. Mr Owen said older people who have had their second Covid vaccine were booking foreign holidays for November and December, while families were booking to go abroad next May and June. Self employed travel agent Sue Glen, from Builth Wells, has taken up a second job as a Covid track and trace official with Powys council to help pay her bills, with customers also delaying their breaks up to four times. She said new foreign holiday bookings to places like the Maldives, Thailand and the US appeared to be more lavish, especially if customers have been able to save money during lockdown. And she said people holidaying at home were also prepared to pay in excess of £1,500 for a week's stay in a UK holiday cottage in order to ""make memories"". ""You have to get on and enjoy your life,"" she said. ""So many times I have had that conversation with customers. ""We have had a pretty awful few years."" Health club receptionist Angie Willmott, from Cardiff, ""just loves holidays"". She has just returned from a weekend in Cornwall, and hopes to be able to enjoy breaks in Crete in July and a Caribbean cruise in December, if they are on the green list. ""We need to have some optimism,"" she said."
risk appetite,'Bums on seats' vital for independent cinemas,2024-09-15,2020-10-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-54420498,"Cineworld described the cinema industry as ""unviable"" when it announced plans to temporarily close all its UK sites. So how are independent cinemas coping amid a dearth of blockbusters and reduced capacity due to the pandemic? Since being allowed to reopen in July, some say they have looked to diversify, by showing classic films or hosting live shows in a bid to get people through the doors. But what is crucial is getting ""bums on seats"", according to Neil McGlone, from the Riverside Theatre in Woodbridge, Suffolk. He said audience numbers had been ""up and down"" since reopening, adding: ""We have some good weeks and some not so good.  ""We are trying a few old classics and they are doing OK. ""But we need the bums on seats like all the cinemas at the moment. It's pretty tough for us."" Ian Wild, manager of Showroom Cinema in Sheffield, said: ""Whilst we just about got through the lockdown we need to start making money again. ""In the long term we can't fit as many people in and so we're having to see what impact that will have on our long-term financial prospects."" One disappointment for cinema owners was the decision to delay the release of No Time To Die, the latest instalment in the James Bond franchise. ""It would have revitalised the industry overnight,"" according to Brian Barnsley, who manages Penistone Paramount in Penistone, near Barnsley. His cinema is still showing independent films and organising live events, such as comedy evenings, to try to keep the public coming in. Sheffield Light Cinema's manager Keith Pullinger said the lack of major releases was partially due to the fact many cinemas around the world remain closed due to the pandemic. ""The studios in America are holding back their movies until they can be sure they get the returns that they want,"" he said. The dearth of major films has prompted the Peckhamplex, in Peckham, London, to close its doors temporarily. Chairman John Reiss said audience numbers had dropped since it reopened, partially due to Covid-19 but also as a result of a lack of new releases. ""As an independently run cinema remaining open is simply not viable with such low levels of audience admissions and we are determined to eke out our resources, looking after our 40 employees, so that we can bounce back,"" he wrote on the cinema's website. Dan Ellis, from the Jam Jar Cinema in Whitley Bay, Northumberland, said it was welcoming about 300-400 film fans a week. Although this is fewer than before lockdown, it remains better than initially expected. And Mr Ellis believes there is an opportunity to highlight the importance and value of independent venues. ""I don't see cinemas as just a place to see films,"" he said, pointing out they benefitted other town centre businesses by helping to increase footfall. ""I see it as a golden opportunity, we will be the only cinema offering midweek showings [due to temporary closures of chains]."" Mr Ellis said even without blockbusters cinemas offer an affordable night out and there is an appetite for films the whole family can watch. The government has announced support for independents through its Culture Recovery Fund, which will see 42 cinemas share £650,000. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said ""we need the public to pay their part"" and ""urged everyone to get booking your seats and support your local cinema"". Penistone Paramount's Mr Barnsley said if audiences do not want their cinemas to close then they need to make sure they use them. ""It's people sat in seats enjoying a movie that counts,"" he said. James Frizzell, who manages the Majestic in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, agreed it had been a challenging few months. But he is hoping the release of another delayed blockbuster, Wonder Woman 1984, at Christmas will help. ""If we can hold out to Christmas, I think there is a way forward for us, I think we can do it. If we can just battle through and people support us,"" he said. Mr Pullinger said it was tough, but he was confident independent cinema would survive. ""Going into this pandemic cinemas were in good shape and I believe the other side of this looks just as promising,"" he said."
risk appetite,"Funding 'saved or protected 3,700 jobs'",2024-09-15,2017-07-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-40605994,"More than 3,700 jobs have been created or safeguarded following investment in small and medium businesses in Wales. Finance Wales invested more than £56m in businesses in 2015-16, up by £10m on the previous year, and £79m was raised from private sector funding. Of those jobs, 1,163 were created and 2,555 were safeguarded. Companies that benefited included Tomlinson's Dairies in Wrexham, Peerless Gas in Flintshire and Siltbusters in Monmouthshire. Finance Wales, which uses money from the Welsh Government and other investors, makes investments in Welsh-based businesses, from £1,000 to £3m.  Chairman Gareth Bullock said: ""We fill a gap left by mainstream lenders, offering flexible finance solutions to companies who may struggle to get the package they need from the traditional sources of finance. ""Where there is decreased risk appetite in the wider investment market, we're able to step in and take that risk burden to help support ambitious Welsh businesses.  ""I'm proud of that, I'm proud of our flexibility and the approach our staff take to tailor deals for micro to medium companies."""
risk appetite,Tech trends 2019: 'The end of truth as we know it?',2024-09-15,2019-01-04,By Matthew Wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46745742,"More than 200 firms contributed to our request for ideas on what the global tech trends will be in 2019. Here's a synthesis of the main themes occupying the minds of the technorati this year. You may be surprised. This year it's all about data - a small, rather dull word for something that is profoundly changing the world we live in. New technologies, from voice-controlled speakers to ""internet of things"" (IoT) sensors, connected cars to fitness wearables, are vastly increasing the amount of digital data we produce. And artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and cloud computing are transforming the way we store, analyse and apply it. ""In 2019 smart sensors will start to be found everywhere, automating data collection to satisfy the voracious appetite of AI,"" says Tim Harper, a former European Space Centre engineer and now founder of G2O Water Technologies. AI could be a powerful force for good, improving healthcare and combating climate change, for example. But it also presents many dangers - to democracy, to financial markets, to the belief in objective truth.  Data in the wrong hands, used in the wrong way, could even threaten world peace, some commentators warn. ""Deepfakes"" - manipulated digital videos that overlay another person's face onto a body or change what people actually said - pose a growing threat, argues Katja Bego, data scientist at innovation foundation, Nesta. ""2019 will be the year that a malicious 'deepfake' video sparks a geopolitical incident,"" she predicts.  ""Though deepfakes are still a relatively new technology, they are evolving incredibly fast, making it harder and harder for the naked eye - or even digital forensics tools - to identify them. At the same time, they are also becoming ever easier and cheaper to create.""  She envisages a nightmare scenario in which a world leader could appear to declare war or spread damaging propaganda, with potentially devastating results. As fake news stories - often state-sponsored - continue to flood social media and China's Xinhua News Agency launches its first AI-created newsreaders, the lines between the fake and the real are becoming increasingly blurred.  If we cannot trust what we see or hear any more, is this ""the end of truth as we know it?"" asks Ms Bego. Andrew Tsonchev, director of technology at cyber security company Darktrace Industrial, believes the internet's openness and lack of accountability - qualities its founders cherished - play into the hands of those with malicious intent. ""Ultimately, manipulating the public discourse might prove to be a greater cyber-risk than the hacking of our devices,"" he says.  ""Controlling data may soon become more important than stealing it."" Cybersecurity companies are notorious for scaring us witless in the drive to sell more of their products. But that doesn't mean their warnings are worthless. And AI in the hands of criminal or state-sponsored hackers is certainly worth worrying about. ""2019 will see the first AI-orchestrated attack take down a FTSE 100 company,"" predicts Jason Hart, chief technology officer, data protection, at security firm Gemalto. ""A new breed of AI-powered malware will infect an organisation's systems, sit undetected gathering information, adapt to its surroundings, and unleash a series of bespoke attacks targeted to take down a company from the inside out."" AI will be needed to fight AI, many believe, particularly as the IoT vastly increases the number of potential weak points in this burgeoning network of connected devices.  Greg Day from Palo Alto Networks says: ""AI on AI cyber-battles will begin. Cybersecurity will be a machine versus machine fight with humans alongside to help and adjudicate.  ""While cybersecurity will look for new ways to spot adversaries and threats with AI, adversaries will use AI themselves and increasingly look to subvert machine learning and AI.""  This will ramp up the stakes even further. ""We'll see the first example of a scaled-up mass IoT attack affecting critical infrastructure,"" predicts Darren Thomson, chief technology officer at cybersecurity firm Symantec. But it's not all bad news. AI unleashed on all our health data could herald a new era of personalised medicine, many believe. ""We predict that by mid-2020, two in three patients with any condition will be supported by AI  and AI-related technologies, either as part of diagnostics, treatment, or administration,"" says John Gikopoulos, global head of AI and automation at Infosys Consulting. AI-powered computers are getting better at analysing images and diagnosing cancers, and helping to identify molecules that could be turned into life-saving drugs. Virtual doctors and chatbots are giving us health advice via apps. ""In 2019, for the first time ever, there will be more health data available outside health systems than inside them,"" says Othman Laraki, chief executive of Color, a San Francisco-based genetic testing company.  ""Your Apple Watch can deduce your heart health, your mood, your sleep patterns. Your genome can tell you your risk for inherited cancer and heart disease and traits that impact everything from your caffeine sensitivity to your ability to metabolise medicine.""  Data-driven healthcare, with an emphasis on prevention rather than cure, will have a ""tremendous societal impact"", he believes. In the wake of last year's Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in a maximum £500,000 fine for Facebook imposed by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, how big companies use and abuse our data has been under much greater scrutiny.   As firms scramble to get their data privacy policies up to scratch now that the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation is in force, ""2019 will be the year of GDPR fines"", says Harrison Van Riper, a senior analyst at cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. Some commentators are predicting a consumer fightback. ""In 2019, I expect that consumers will start to reclaim control of their data and monetise it,"" says Phil Beckett, managing director of disputes and investigations at management consultancy Alvarez and Marsal.  Systems are being developed to allow us to control our health, financial, social, and entertainment data effectively, argues Paul Winstanley, chief executive of Censis, a centre of excellence for sensing and imaging systems. ""It is then an individual's choice whether they want to share that data with a third party, or not."" As consumer trust has been ""severely dented"", argues Mark Curtis, co-founder at design consultancy Fjord, firms will increasingly adopt a ""data minimalism"" approach, only asking for data they really need. More Technology of Business ""They will have to clearly show the payback for users sharing their data, drawing a straight line from the act of sharing to receiving relevant products and services in return,"" he says. All this consumer data, analysed by AI, will at least enable firms to personalise their services, argues Nigel Vaz, international chief executive of digital transformation agency Publicis.Sapient. But rebuilding trust will be key, and this means consumers understanding how and why their data is being used, believes Ojas Rege, chief strategy officer at MobileIron, a mobile security company. ""Without transparency, there is no trust. Without trust, there is no data. Without data, there is no AI,"" he concludes. While data - how it is produced, stored, analysed and applied - is the key theme for 2019, developing technologies, such as voice control, superfast 5G mobile and connected cars, will gather pace through the year. But these will only emphasise further how vulnerable our data is and how much harder we need to work to protect, own and value it."
risk appetite,Carmakers bet on trucks to boost US sales,2024-09-15,2018-01-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42698718,"Carmakers are focusing on pickup trucks and SUVs as they seek to counter falling sales in the US.  Sales of new vehicles in the world's second-largest market dropped 2% last year to 17.2 million, the first fall since 2009. This year is expected to see another fall in sales, but carmakers hope a focus on the American stalwarts of pickups and SUVs will help. Pickup trucks tend to enjoy more robust sales and have higher profit margins. General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler have all rebooted their pickup truck offerings at the Detroit Auto Show this week, while BMW and Lamborghini are among those unveiling new SUVs. Pickup trucks account for about 15% of the US market and have higher profit margins. Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said sales of the models also tend to be less cyclical than other kinds of cars and the models appeal to buyers - like construction contractors - that are poised to benefit from new US tax cuts. However, SUVs already account for more than 40% of US sales, and next year carmakers will be facing an influx of cheaper, used SUVs that could undermine sales of newer models. The possibility of higher gas prices pose another risk. ""We think 2018 is going to be challenging for the kind of growth that segment has enjoyed,"" Mr Smoke said. The continued appetite for SUVs and trucks - traditionally gas guzzlers, though the efficiency has improved - underscores one of the problems facing car companies. Prodded by government emissions rules, firms are investing heavily in electric vehicles. But so far, buyer enthusiasm hasn't matched the buzz. Executives at Daimler and Fiat Chrysler warned at the show on Monday that firms would struggle to reach European targets for emissions from their fleets. In the US, where fuel remains cheap and emissions targets are under review, electric cars represent less than 1% of the market, according to Thomas Libby at research firm IHS Markit. ""It's tiny,"" he said. Mr Smoke said electric cars have had success with high-end American buyers, but it will take some time - and lower prices - to make inroads in the wider market. Nicolas Peter from BMW said governments and other companies would need to do more to encourage  widespread adoption of the cars. ""To accelerate electric powered cars across the world, we need not only the technology in the car, we need infrastructure,"" he said.  ""It will only develop if we have strong co-ordination between the car manufacturers, providers of electric power and the different mayors and governments across the world."" "
risk appetite,'Teenage depression linked to fathers',2024-09-15,2017-11-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42000702,"Depression in fathers, as well as mothers, has an impact on children despite mothers often being the focus when treating adolescent depression, a study suggests. The University College London (UCL) report looked at 14,000 families in the UK and Ireland. It said both parents had a role to play in preventing teenage depression. The researchers encouraged more fathers to seek help for depressive symptoms by speaking to their doctor. Dr Gemma Lewis from UCL, who led the study, said because mothers tended to spend more time with their children, there was often a tradition of ""mother-blaming"" when treating mental health issues in offspring. But she said the research showed that ""we should be bringing fathers into the picture more"". Dr Lewis added: ""If you're a father who hasn't sought treatment for your depression, it could have an impact on your child. ""We hope that our findings could encourage men who experience depression to speak to their doctor about it."" The study is based on two large samples of the general population - 6,000 families from Ireland and nearly 8,000 from the UK - in which parents and children, at the ages of seven, nine and 13-14, filled in questionnaires about their feelings. Children were asked about their emotional symptoms and parents also answered questions on their feelings, which were measured against a depression scale.  The results showed a link between depressive symptoms in fathers and similar symptoms in their adolescent children that was similar in size to the effect of a mother's depression. Many mental health problems, including depression, start at about the age of 13, the researchers said, and although depression in mothers was already known to increase the risk, the influence of fathers' wellbeing was a new finding. In the home, depressive symptoms can make mothers and fathers more prone to fatigue, more irritable and more likely to argue with their children. ""Children see the way their parents behave and act and this could bring on negative ways of thinking, which could then lead to depression,"" Dr Lewis said. The study concluded that fathers as well as mothers should be involved in tackling the problem of adolescent depression at an early stage. It also highlighted the importance of treating depression in both parents. Jo Hardy, head of parents services at charity YoungMinds, said parents often wanted to hide their own mental health problems so as not to burden their children but she said it was better ""to be honest and open, and give children a chance to ask questions"". ""It's important to remember that having depression does not need to stop you from being a great parent. You and your family can still support your child, provide reassurance and love, and help them to do things that they enjoy."" "
risk appetite,Single people in NI can stay indoors with loved ones,2024-09-15,2020-06-11,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52978413,"People living alone in NI will be able to stay at one other household as part of further easing of coronavirus restrictions.  First Minister Arlene Foster announced that, from Saturday, single adults can spend the night at another house in a ""support bubble"". The executive agreed to the move to ""minimise the impact of loneliness and isolation"". The relaxation does not apply to those who are shielding. The executive met on Thursday and agreed to lift a number of lockdown measures, because the R-number - which measures the rate of infection - is currently estimated as being between 0.5 and 0.9. One further coronavirus-related death was recorded in Northern Ireland on Thursday, bringing the Department of Health's total number of deaths to 538.  This figure is mostly focused on hospital deaths and where patients tested positive for the virus. Speaking at Stormont's daily press briefing on Thursday, Mrs Foster said ministers could not yet commit to allowing people who do not live alone to visit family and friends indoors, but said they hope to ""take another step forward"" next week. ""There's a real desire amongst grandparents to see their grandchildren but it is important we take this on a step-by-step basis,"" she added. ""We're appealing to people not to return to normal behaviour - do not take things for granted and please don't let your guard down,"" said Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. Some of the measures agreed by the executive take effect from Friday 12 June. Groups of up to 10 people who do not live together can meet outdoors, maintaining social distancing. Ministers recognised there was a ""strong desire to return to normal life"", said Mrs Foster. All non-essential retail is due to open from Friday, but shopping centres will now also be permitted to open. From Friday, places of worship and community centres can facilitate childcare for people who will have to return to work. But ministers are carrying out work on reopening the childcare sector, with more details to be announced after discussions with the Department of Health on Friday. Earlier this week, guidance for childminders and day care centres during the pandemic was published.  But some childminders have expressed concerns about plans for the sector, as more people with children prepare to return to their jobs. Ms O'Neill also said work was under way to see if the executive could, from next week, begin to provide indicative dates for other sectors to reopen. Northern Ireland's five-stage recovery blueprint does not include a timetable for reopening, with ministers saying they would not be calendar-led. However, the executive now wants to be able to ""signpost"" to people that they should get ready, added Mrs Foster. From Monday, people in Northern Ireland will be allowed to move house again, after the property market was paused following the imposition of lockdown in March. However, Ms O'Neill said the process of finding and moving into a new home would be different. ""People will have to accept doing more of the processes online such as virtual viewings,"" she added, as well as observing strict hygiene practices on visits in person. Estate agent John Minnis told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that it was ""fantastic news"" the sector could reopen. ""We can't keep up with the level of interest, the appetite is definitely there which is very surprising,"" he said. ""You'll be asked to bring a mask and bring gloves, the estate agent will be in a face shield and they will bring you through the house without the vendor there and without touching anything."" Elite athletes will also be allowed to begin using outdoor sports facilities to train again from Monday. However, Mrs Foster said ministers had not reached agreement on whether to bring forward the date for hotels and other tourist accommodation to reopen. It is scheduled for 20 July, but the executive has been facing calls to change it, with the sector in the Republic of Ireland due to open on 29 June. Economy Minister Diane Dodds will bring a paper to the executive next week on the matter. A bubble is defined as an exclusive group of people with whom you have close physical contact. This can be friends or family.   Members of a bubble would be able to visit one another in their homes, but it would still be important to limit the risk of chains of transmission. If Household A merges with Household B, Household B could not also link up with another group - Household C - because this would create a chain that could allow the virus to spread widely. The bubble concept has already been used in New Zealand and is being adopted in England, to allow single people to form support bubbles from Saturday."
risk appetite,Coronavirus front-line NHS staff 'at risk of PTSD',2024-09-15,2020-04-12,By Charlie Haynes,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52258217,"NHS staff on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic could develop anxiety, burnout, or post-traumatic stress disorder, the BBC has been told. Psychological first aid should be provided as the UK runs the risk of a ""future mental health crisis"", the British Psychological Society said. Ministers say NHS staff can call a helpline if they are feeling stressed. But MPs say this is not enough and that the government should provide extra support to those feeling overwhelmed. The cross-party group says any support should be extended to all front-line staff such as care home staff, mortuary workers and cleaners.  In a letter, MPs call for management in front-line organisations to put in place preventative measures like regular breaks, encouraging people to look after themselves and to tell people that it is ""OK to not be OK"". The MPs and British Psychological Society also say professional help from psychologists and therapists needs to be easily accessible - so trauma can be dealt with early. Front-line staff in the coronavirus crisis are routinely exposed to things the general population would never encounter - loss of patients, illness of colleagues, high levels of stress and increased exposure to Covid-19. Trauma can leave some with insomnia, feeling disorientated, with a sense of guilt or even physical symptoms like shaking, headache, loss of appetite and aches and pains.  Some people could see a deterioration of their mental health or develop anxiety or PTSD.  ""We are running the risk of a future mental health crisis and a generation of burnt-out health workers,"" said Kathryn Scott, director of policy at the British Psychological Society. ""If we act now with a plan focused on prevention and leadership we can minimise the impact of trauma on responders to Covid-19."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ''We share the concerns that this epidemic poses challenges to the mental health and wellbeing of all our health and care workers."" The spokesperson said NHS England had partnered with Headspace, UnMind and Big Health to offer ""free-to-use mental health apps for both NHS and care staff"". A £5m grant was also available for mental health charities to fund additional services for people who are struggling, the spokesperson said. Dr Andrew Molodynski, a consultant psychiatrist and mental health lead for the British Medical Association, said: ""Health workers are used to seeing death, but we aren't used to seeing lots and lots of people die when we can't do anything about it.  ""That will cause a lot of symptoms of anxiety, depression and trauma. ""I'm already seeing that in my hospital - staff are anxious and some are already off work because of the impact that has had on their mental health."" The all-party group of MPs has asked the government to encourage the NHS and care organisations to treat their staff with compassion, and signpost ways to get help.  The MPs also call for a focus on psychological first aid, developed for use in disasters like hurricanes or wildfires in the US.  It sees people at risk encouraged to seek help and support one another with stress before it becomes a serious permanent problem.   SNP MP Lisa Cameron, who wrote the letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, said protecting the mental health of staff was ""essential"" - just like providing adequate protective equipment. Ms Cameron added: ""If we fail to act now, front-line staff and communities will be living with the psychological consequences of coronavirus for decades to come."" Thousands of people in the UK have died after being diagnoses with coronavirus, including nurses, doctors, surgeons and other NHS staff."
risk appetite,Who will finish where in the Premier League?,2024-09-15,2019-08-06,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49236095,"The crystal ball is polished and it is that time of the year again - Premier League predictions. A few surprises, plenty of imponderables and a slight excuse that it is still not transfer deadline day yet. Disagree? Make your own prediction here. So here we go - how the Premier League will pan out in 2019-20... Phil McNulty's predicted 2019-20 Premier League positions at a glance Position Club Position (cont) Club (cont) 1 Manchester City 11 Watford 2 Liverpool 12 Southampton 3 Tottenham Hotspur 13 Bournemouth 4 Chelsea 14 Aston Villa 5 Manchester United 15 Burnley 6 Arsenal 16 Crystal Palace 7 Everton 17 Sheffield United 8 Leicester City 18 Brighton and Hove Albion 9 Wolverhampton Wanderers 19 Norwich City 10 West Ham United 20 Newcastle United Last season - Champions This season - Champions Manchester City remain the team to beat - they showed resilience and brilliance to put together a 14-match winning streak to see off Liverpool last season and have strengthened in midfield with the addition of Rodri from Atletico Madrid. Vincent Kompany's presence, so vital in the run-in, will be hugely difficult to replace on and off the pitch but class in all parts of the field will make it a Premier League treble for the side who swept the board domestically last season and the perfect sign-off to David Silva's brilliant career in England. This video can not be played Manchester City beat Liverpool on penalties to take the 2019 Community Shield Last season - Second This season - Second The other half of a rivalry that will be a battle for silverware for years to come. Liverpool will try to end what will be a 30-year wait for the title after falling agonisingly short despite losing only one league game last season, to the eventual champions. The Champions League was more than consolation but this season the Premier League will be firmly in the sights of manager Jurgen Klopp and his players. Liverpool may not have made the big eye-catching purchase as deadline day approaches but all their world-class stars such as Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah are secured and this is a team built to last. Klopp's team is not going away. It will be a fight to the finish but it may well be that the title will have to wait for another year. Last season - Fourth This season - Third It was a strange pre-season for Spurs with some discontented utterances from manager Mauricio Pochettino, including a suggestion of a change of job title to coach because of a lack of influence over transfers. This, however, is still a club and a team in fine shape. Tanguy Ndombele, a club record signing at £53.8m from Lyon, could prove an outstanding midfield addition to a team packed with quality and with the power to add before the deadline. Spurs reached the Champions League final last season, which will have whetted the appetite, and are now at home in a magnificent new stadium and will challenge this season. The title? No - let's not forget they lost 13 league games last season - but top three and time to end Pochettino's wait for a trophy. Now it gets difficult. Tottenham fans had to wait a long time to see their club make a new signing Last season - Third This season - Fourth The Premier League's top three is pretty clear (when viewed through this crystal ball, at least) but it will be a real dogfight for that last Champions League place and several clubs may be involved. Chelsea have taken a real gamble appointing the unproven Frank Lampard after one season in Championship management in which he took Derby County from sixth to sixth. Has owner Roman Abramovich invested in romance with this former legend rather than realism? And the biggest puzzle of all is how can Chelsea cope without the 'X Factor' provided by the now departed Eden Hazard? The reason for this prediction is that Chelsea have an uncanny habit of achieving against the odds - remember the ""disappointment"" of last season under Maurizio Sarri when they only finished third and won the Europa League? Never bet against Chelsea for a trophy either. Last season - Sixth This season - Fifth For all the cheerleading and predictable talk about a ""feelgood factor"", I have serious doubts that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the man to turn around this big beast of the Premier League - doubts voiced before the initial bounce was deflated into those embarrassing performances at the end of last season. Solskjaer, rather like Lampard, is totally unproven but was the safe choice for United's hierarchy. Harry Maguire, at an exorbitant £80m for a central defender who is serviceable without being anywhere near the Van Dijk class, will provide leadership in a defence still containing familiar faces such as Phil Jones and Chris Smalling while Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James will provide youth and pace. Can Solskjaer turn around United's decline? A game-changing signing in the next day or two may help but currently I struggle to foresee a top-four place. Last season - Fifth This season - Sixth The Gunners will challenge Spurs, Chelsea and Manchester United for a top-four place and will not go short of goals with Nicholas Pepe arriving from Lille for a club record £72m to augment Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. Dani Ceballos on loan from Real Madrid could be a masterstroke but this Arsenal side, now without Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny, still lacks leadership, and manager Unai Emery must cure the old flaws such as travel sickness. They blew their top-four chances late on last season and lost the Europa League final to Chelsea - hardly a catastrophic failure but can they take the next step? Best bet may be a domestic cup. Spain U21 international Dani Ceballos will get the chance to wear Arsenal's new away kit Last season - Eighth This season - Seventh Everton ended Marco Silva's first season strongly and attractively, illustrated by home wins over Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United - and he has been backed in the markets, so owner Farhad Moshiri will expect a top-six challenge and domestic cup run at least. Idrissa Gueye will be a real loss but Everton have secured the classy Andre Gomes on a permanent basis, added the talented Jean-Philippe Gbamin from Mainz and secured one of Europe's emerging teenage talents in striker Moise Kean from Juventus. If they can get it right in the final days of the transfer window, and that must include adding a central defender, they could have a real crack at that top six and beyond.  Last season - Ninth This season - Eighth Optimism abounds at Leicester thanks to Brendan Rodgers' fine start as manager after succeeding Claude Puel and some shrewd summer work in the transfer market. The Foxes are another club with genuine top-six aspirations. Maguire is a loss but they have recouped a serious fee and the additions of the gifted Youri Tielemans, such a success on loan last season, and striker Ayoze Perez from Newcastle builds on a squad that offers a potent mix of youth and experience. Rodgers will also want to prove his worth after moving from Celtic so I fully expect a very satisfactory season at The King Power Stadium. Last season - Seventh This season - Ninth I had rare success with a surprise prediction last season when I said then Premier League newcomers Wolves would finish seventh. Nuno Espirito Santo's side delivered and proved an excellent top-flight addition, backed by quality signings and an attacking style. No longer a surprise package and with a Europa League campaign to navigate, I'm not going so high this season but fully expect a top-10 finish, especially with the addition of striker Patrick Cutrone from AC Milan to support those who excelled last season such as Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota. Wolves managed to bring in Cutrone from AC Milan Last season - 10th This season - 10th It was a season of relative serenity at West Ham under the experienced Manuel Pellegrini, whose air of calm made it a solid first season in charge. The addition of Spain attacker Pablo Fornals from Villarreal and striker Sebastien Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt for a club record £45m will add quality and creativity, and you can bracket the Hammers with those other clubs who might fancy breaking into the top six if they get the wind in their sails. This video can not be played West Ham's Declan Rice out for revenge after prank video Last season - 11th This season - 11th Yes - you have read it right, Watford supporters. No relegation tip this year… which may of course be bad news. The painful embarrassment of that 6-0 FA Cup final loss to Manchester City aside, it was a very decent season for Javi Gracia's team, a well-organised team at a well-run club. Troy Deeney remains the talisman and Gerard Deulofeu delivers the magic. Another good mid-table finish in the offing. Last season - 16th This season - 12th After losing their sure touch with managerial appointments after the failure of Mauricio Pellegrino and the short-lived reign of Mark Hughes, Southampton look to have got it right again with the charismatic Austrian Ralph Hassenhuttl. He ensured their survival last season with a high-energy style that he will have further engrained in close season, an approach that saw a revival for the likes of Nathan Redmond. If the excellent Danny Ings can stay fit and Che Adams can transfer his striking talent from the Championship with Birmingham City to the top flight, and Moussa Djenepo can adapt, then watching Southampton may be very entertaining this season. Last season - 14th This season - 13th It was the usual mix of top-class victories and heavy defeats that sums up Bournemouth's Premier League life under manager Eddie Howe last season - and I do not see anything different this time. Keeping Ryan Fraser (so far) is crucial, while England striker Callum Wilson's new contract is a real vote of confidence in the Cherries' future. The absence through injury of David Brooks for three months is a blow. Philip Billing's arrival from Huddersfield will add stature but the goalkeeping looks a weakness. A late move there - Jack Butland from Stoke perhaps - would give more solidity. Last season - promoted  This season - 14th If you had a pound for every time you heard ""doing a Fulham""… Fulham spent more than £100m losing their identity and their Premier League status last season and Villa's similarly expensive sweep of the transfer market has brought the same accusations. Not from here - yes it is ambitious and contains risk but manager Dean Smith has also signed players he knows in the likes of Jota, Ezri Konsa and the likes of Tyrone Mings and Anwar El Ghazi, who were on loan last season. Plenty of eyes will be on the likes of Wesley, Trezeguet and Douglas Luiz - but Villa have also secured one of the best deals of the summer in signing an experienced goalkeeper of quality in England's Tom Heaton from Burnley for only £8m. Jack Grealish has Premier League quality and John McGinn can make a big impact. A season of consolidation is in prospect at one of the great old clubs. Trezeguet is one of 12 summer signings for Villa Last season - 15th This season - 15th Sean Dyche has done a superb job keeping Burnley in the Premier League, especially last season when he kept his nerve after a horrible spell up to Christmas. A smart manager who knows how it works and how to get the best out of his squad, he will keep Burnley up again. The return of Jay Rodriguez to his home town club will provide goals and quality and the return to fitness of Nick Pope meant Burnley could sell Heaton. It's a big season ahead for Pope. I predict survival for the Clarets. Last season - 12th This season - 16th Strange times at Crystal Palace. Manager Roy Hodgson will always provide solidity and, more likely than not, safety - but when will Eagles supporters and their hierarchy want more? They stayed up in comfort last season but so far it has been an unfulfilling summer with the departure of Wan-Bissaka and the confirmation of Jordan Ayew's signing hardly one to get the pulses pumping, although Gary Cahill will at least add experience to the defence. If the unsettled Wilfried Zaha is still at Selhurst Park at the weekend then their chances of a decent season instantly improve but currently looking like another season where mid-table consolidation is the best a superbly supportive fan base can hope for. Last season - Promoted  This season - 17th There is always at least one prediction that goes against the grain and this is mine. Sheffield United are plenty of people's tips to go down but I am going with the Chris Wilder factor and the stirring surroundings of Bramall Lane to keep the Blades in the Premier League. Wilder revels in his ""old school"" managerial persona. Do not be fooled. He is smart, meticulously prepared, has proved his tactical flexibility and his impressive record shows a manager waiting for this chance to show that he can sit comfortably at the highest level. Phil Jagielka's return will provide experience, while Oli McBurnie, at a club record £20m from Swansea City, will be relied upon for potency. Last season - 17th This season - 18th Brighton's dip in form that plunged them into trouble last season cost manager Chris Hughton his job and brought a new face and approach in the highly rated Graham Potter. Leandro Trossard from Genk is part of the new look while heavy responsibility will fall on the shoulders of new central defender Adam Webster, signed from Bristol City in a club record £20m deal - especially if Lewis Dunk leaves. Potter has many supporters and Brighton is a club to admire - but last season's decline must mean worries this time around if they do not make a good start. Last season - Promoted This season - 19th Now this is one prediction that may well come back to bite me given the exciting football played by Daniel Farke's side in the vibrant atmosphere of Carrow Road last season. The Canaries will be a colourful addition to the Premier League. Can Farke make this style work in the top flight? Plenty will hope so. So much will depend on whether Teemu Pukki, who scored 29 goals last season, can make the transition to elite level. If he can then I shall order a large helping of humble pie in advance. Last season - 13th This season - 20th Where do you even start? Where will this all end? Rafael Benitez, predictably, has gone and Steve Bruce finally becomes Newcastle United manager in a blizzard of discontent from supporters who, contrary to belief, do not want too much - just a little of what they genuinely deserve. Bruce is experienced and a realist. He will know he must make a big early impression or this has the potential to be a very miserable existence for the Toon Army under the continued ownership of Mike Ashley. Joelinton, a club record signing at £40m from Hoffenheim, steps into the spaces vacated by Ayoze Perez and Salomon Rondon. He carries a huge burden, while French winger Allan Saint-Maximin, a £16.5m signing from Nice, will be the man Bruce hopes can be the provider. When will the torture end for Newcastle's supporters? It may get worse before it gets better."
risk appetite,How will the fan pilot sport events work?,2024-09-15,2020-07-24,Laura Scott,https://www.bbc.com/sport/53518791,"Cardboard fans have been the only ones present at major sport since March A significant step towards the return of crowds to live sport will be taken this weekend, when The Oval welcomes 1,000 fans back to watch cricket. Other pilots will follow soon after at Edgbaston, Sheffield's Crucible Theatre and Goodwood racecourse, as the government prepares for a widening of spectator capacities this autumn. But how different will the fan experience be at these first test events? Sports fans could return in October, says PM Snooker crowds an 'unnecessary risk' - O'Sullivan When Surrey face Middlesex on Sunday for a men's county cricket friendly, it will mark the first time fans have attended a live sports event in England since the Covid-19 lockdown began in March and all sport was suspended. Tickets were reserved for members of both clubs, and there will be careful spacing of groups to avoid breaking social distancing guidelines. Households will be separated by two clear seats to the left and right of them, and only each alternate row will be used. Only a few stands will be used for the trial, with the areas nearest the pavilion reserved for participants. Richard Gould, Surrey CCC chief executive, said the club feels a ""considerable responsibility"" to get it right but there has been a positive response from members. ""What's been really pleasant to see is the level of support from the public,"" he said. ""Nobody knows quite what the appetite is for a return to live sport and we've been inundated with calls. We had 10,000 calls in the first hour."" Gould said the bars and concession stands will be open to try to make it ""as normal as possible"". ""The bars will be open, there will be PA announcements, everything going on on the big screens, food options available,"" he said. The World Snooker Championships at the Crucible will be the first indoor event with crowds, allowing around 300 supporters in for each session - about a third of the normal capacity. Audience members will only sit directly next to people who they purchased tickets with and are in the same household groups, meaning there will be a metre of space between people from separate bubbles. Ronnie O'Sullivan said the decision to allow fans in created an ""unnecessary risk"". But world number eight Kyren Wilson, who reached the semi-final in 2018, said: ""It's a little bit of normality isn't it, coming back into our lives.  ""The Crucible would have been strange without a crowd and I'm delighted there are going to be people in there and someone to play in front of.""  Fans have been sent a code of conduct which says they must wear a mask while walking around the Crucible, but can remove it while watching the action, and the bars will not be open. Glorious Goodwood is one of the major flat-racing festivals of the summer. The final day of the meeting - Saturday, 1 August - will see 4,000 racegoers, made up of members and their guests, in attendance. But the racecourse will be split up into eight mini-enclosures to avoid over-crowding, and organisers say this means ""it will be a very different experience for the racegoer than what they'd expect"". Adam Waterworth, Goodwood's director of sport, told BBC Sport: ""It won't be one big crowd of 4,000, it will be eight lots of 500 in effect.  ""It just makes sense, there are certain pinch points at any venue, the parade ring will be one for us, of course the winners' enclosure, and we've got to manage it in such a way that means only a very limited number of people can get access to those areas. ""You will stay in your enclosure. Different enclosures will have different things going for them, in terms of either their views or what the offer would be, but once you're in, you can't go from enclosure to enclosure."""
risk appetite,Has Trump turned his back on Europe?,2024-09-15,2019-01-14,By James Naughtie,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46798192,"As the EU says the US government has effectively downgraded its diplomatic status in Washington, how has the transatlantic relationship changed under Donald Trump's presidency? For generations, American presidents have saved some of their warmest words for their European colleagues.  They came to the Berlin Wall and spoke of freedom - and, after it fell, they spoke of a new era of co-operation with a rebuilt Europe. But in the era of Donald Trump, leaders across the continent now know that those days have gone. John F Kennedy's ""Ich bin ein Berliner,"" declaration, Ronald Reagan's 1987 message to Moscow: ""Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall,"" George HW Bush's promises of collaboration after the Cold War and Barack Obama's warm words about binding ties across the Atlantic are all now distant memories. With every visit to Europe and every White House tweet about the cost of Nato or EU tariffs, this president makes it clear that he believes Europe is more often an impediment than an ally.  None of his predecessors would have dreamed of calling the EU a ""foe"", as President Trump did in a recent interview about trade. With Europe embroiled in its Brexit difficulties, which leave so many questions unanswered, its leaders also find themselves scrambling to work out what it might mean if these old ties with the United States continue to unravel. That was what German Chancellor Angela Merkel was contemplating when she said, a few months ago, that it was time for Europe to take its destiny into its own hands. It was instructive to spend a few days in Berlin recently and to hear over and over again a version of these words.  As Daniela Schwarzer, from the German Council on Foreign Relations think tank, put it: ""The United States, with its 'America first' approach, has put Europe and Germany into the space of a strategic competitor, if not even an enemy."" Many of the journalists who watched Donald Trump's inaugural presidential address two years ago - in which the ""America first"" phrase became the theme of a nationalist marching song -  wondered how far he would go. Wouldn't the realities of power kick in? It seems not.  Karen Donfried, who served as President Obama's European adviser, told me: ""I would not assume that whoever follows Donald Trump goes back to where we were pre-Trump, because you can't.  ""Those four or eight years that Donald Trump is president will have changed the relationship and changed the US role in the world, so it will be different."" How different? Think of a rolling crisis on Europe's eastern border - between Ukraine and Russia.  Since the contentious annexation of Crimea in 2014 - which the Obama administration declared illegal and a reason for sanctions on Russia - there has been a series of clashes that have made it clear Vladimir Putin is not interested in taking the pressure off.  Why Ukraine-Russia sea clash is fraught with risk That is likely to be obvious in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential election in March.  But, in Washington, Donald Trump has shown little interest in the concern across Europe - especially in Poland and Germany - about President Putin's expansionist policy. Instead of promoting a collective approach, he has preferred his characteristic man-to-man style of negotiating, claiming that he rescued his relationship with President Putin in one conversation, a two-hour closed summit in Helsinki in July 2018.  Trump-Putin summit: After Helsinki, the fallout at home But in Angela Merkel's office, there was incredulity that the White House didn't consult its allies before that meeting with the Russian president and that it passed on almost nothing afterwards, beyond what emerged via Twitter. ""The Americans are our most important ally and we know how much we depend on the American contribution to our defence and security in the EU,"" said David McAllister, German-born to a Scots father, an MEP for Angela Merkel's CDU party, and one of her closest colleagues. ""But it's now about strengthening the European pillar within Nato, because under this president - and perhaps also under the next president - we might see less appetite in Washington to get involved in our immediate neighbourhood if it might be necessary."" So, rethinking is needed inside Nato. But that challenge is coming at an awkward moment: Angela Merkel is stepping down in two years, meaning Europe's dominant political figure will be gone. In Berlin, I also spoke to retired American diplomat John Kornblum, who followed the course of the Cold War from the 1960s to the end, and then became the US's German ambassador.  He wrote much of that 1987 Reagan speech, delivered at a time when Western objectives were much clearer than they are today. ""Europe is at a crossroads,"" he told me. ""It's now almost 30 years since the end of the Cold War. Europe is in a much weaker, less independent, less stable condition today than it was 30 years ago. And that's an unfortunate thing to say but it's true."" And the solution? It's easier to ask the questions than to find the answers. That's the tenor of these times. What everyone does now know is that Europe and the United States, however much they retain their shared values, have to re-engineer their relationship as together they negotiate a new age of uncertainty.

risk appetite,"Ban celebrity ads for diet aids, says NHS",2024-09-15,2019-02-02,By Laurel  Ives,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47090374,"Social media companies should ban ""damaging"" celebrity-endorsed social media ads promoting weight loss aids, England's top doctor has said. Some celebrities with large followings are promoting products such as diet pills and detox teas on social media. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, argues these products have a damaging effect on the physical and mental health of young people. He is also urging influential celebrities to act ""responsibly"". Prof Powis said: ""If a product sounds like it is too good to be true, then it probably is.  ""The risks of quick-fix weight loss outweigh the benefits, and advertising these products without a health warning is damaging.  ""Highly influential celebrities are letting down the very people who look up to them, by peddling products which are at best ineffective and at worst harmful.  ""Social media companies have a duty to stamp out the practice of individuals and companies using their platform to target young people with products known to risk ill health,"" he said.  Some influential celebrities have promoted weight loss aids for payment on social media, and this type of advertising is growing as brands realise how influential their posts are with young people. The Competition and Markets Authority recently announced a clampdown on celebrities who do not clearly label their posts as being paid-for advertisements, but there are few rules around what they can promote. NHS England's national mental health director Claire Murdoch told BBC Breakfast that the intention was not to ""suppress business or comment on what good business looks like"". However, she expressed concern over the influence these celebrities had over young people at an ""impressionable"" stage in their lives. ""Both the celebrities themselves and these social media companies themselves should be more responsible,"" she added. Kim Kardashian West, who has 126 million followers on Instagram, was criticised for advertising appetite-suppressing lollypops last year. She later deleted the post.  In January, she posted an ad promoting meal replacement shakes.  Katie Price (1.9 million followers) has advertised an appetite suppressant on her Instagram page, as did Vikki Patterson (4.2 million followers) of TV shows Geordie Shore and Loose Women.  Lauren Goodger of The Only Way is Essex has also advertised diet aids.  Actress Jameela Jamil, who campaigns for body positivity, has described Kardashian West as a ""terrible and toxic influence on young girls"", and a meal replacement shake as ""laxative teas."" Ms Jamil is the founder of the I Weigh social media campaign on Twitter and Instagram - where she encourages women to measure their value beyond their weight and looks. Research from the National Citizens Service shows that at least one in four young people say that their appearance was the most important thing to them, with over half of girls feeling the pressure to be thinner, and a third of boys thinking they should be more muscular.  ""Taking any substance which impacts the body, without proper medical advice and support, is a risk"" said Prof Powis.  ""Cosmetic treatments and get-thin-quick products which are readily and increasingly available and promoted, can be harmful if not used correctly."""
risk appetite,'I was going to the toilet up to 30 times a day',2024-09-15,2022-04-19,By Charlie Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-60251156,"About one in every 500 people in the UK have a stoma bag but many of us have never seen one because they are often hidden away. Best friends Ailish Evans and Summer Griffiths decided to change that. The pair, who have ulcerative colitis, say they want to show it's not just older people who have colostomy pouches, and there is nothing to be ashamed of.  Both women have had their colons removed and wear bags which collect waste from their digestive systems. ""When you've got a problem with your bowel it can be quite embarrassing but we really need to put that aside and talk about it,"" says Ailish, who lives in Corringham, near Basildon. The 25-year-old suffered with bowel problems for eight years before she was diagnosed in October 2020.  Her colon, also known as the large bowel, was so inflamed there was a risk it might burst. Her colon was removed just two weeks later. ""From the age of 16 I suffered from a really upset tummy and had to plan all my days out around whether I knew there would be a toilet close by,"" she says.  ""I could never drink alcohol on a night out with friends because it really aggravated me so it was difficult for me socially.""  Ailish says she was dismissed by several doctors because of her age and gender. ""Because I'm a young girl, they thought it was just period pains or my hormones. It was so frustrating."" She finally found a specialist who listened to her symptoms and diagnosed her with ulcerative colitis. But the delay had big consequences. ""Because I had been left for so long, there was no other option for me apart from surgery,"" she says. ""That's what made me want to raise awareness, because the sooner you catch it the more options you have, like medication."" Source: Crohn's and Colitis UK The surgery was done via keyhole and was not as scary as Ailish anticipated. She believes the benefits of having the stoma bag far outweigh any negatives. ""My quality of life is so much better, because there's no fear about having to find a toilet everywhere I go,"" she says.  ""There are some things I can't eat now like peas, sweetcorn, mushrooms, raisins, popcorn and peanuts, because they're not easy to digest - but my boyfriend has learnt lots of new recipes and really looks after me."" It was his idea for Ailish to start her Instagram page, after friends and family kept asking for more information to understand what she was going through. ""I've had some comments like 'you'll never get a boyfriend' and things like that, but I obviously already have one and I'm not fazed by it.  ""I also get great comments where people say they never understood how the bags worked before, but now they do, and that makes it worthwhile."" And it was through her Instagram page that she met one of her closest friends, Summer, who also has ulcerative colitis and has also had her colon removed. Summer fell ill while she was at university in Newcastle. The 21-year-old suffered blood in her poo, stomach pains and was going to the toilet up to 30 times a day. But doctors dismissed her symptoms and it was only when she returned home to Braintree in Essex that a specialist said she needed a colonoscopy, which showed severe inflammation. She ended up in hospital unable to eat or sleep, as she was in so much pain. Summer had to take a year out of university and move home with her parents. Doctors said she needed to consider having stoma surgery because various drugs were not getting her condition under control. ""My reaction was to shut it down. I said 'no that's not happening, I've not even had this a year and you're trying to remove my bowel'."" But the majority of her bowel was now scar tissue, and the colitis was continually attacking it, with doctors concerned it could explode. Summer tearfully accepted she needed to have the operation, but was terrified about living with a stoma bag. She posted on a Facebook forum for people with colitis asking if any other young people had been through the operation and Ailish replied and she started following her on Instagram.  ""I asked her every imaginable question and I thought 'this doesn't sound as bad as I was expecting,'"" she says. After surgery, Summer realised she had more freedom than before, without having to worry where the nearest toilet might be.  She wore jeans for the first time in two years, which were previously too uncomfortable, and found she was able to eat and drink much more. Summer decided to follow her friend's path in creating her own Instagram page to chronicle her life with a stoma bag. She hopes it will help others her age get diagnosed more easily. Many young people choose to conceal their diagnosis because they feel embarrassed and are concerned about being stigmatised, a study found. But Ailish and Summer believe it's best to be open and honest about the condition. ""Before I wrote my first post, I was so nervous and self-conscious. Having this illness stopped me from doing so much for so long but I'm just living my life normally now and I wanted to share that,"" Summer says.  Both women get questions from young people who have just been diagnosed and others about to go through stoma surgery. ""It's really nice to be able to reassure them like Ailish reassured me,"" Summer says.  ""I just tell them they can still live a really great life,"" Ailish adds.

risk appetite,Australia PM regrets handling of bushfire crisis,2024-09-15,2020-01-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51080567,"Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has expressed regret over his handling of the bushfire crisis ravaging the country.  The PM has faced mounting criticism over his government's response to the bushfires and its climate policy. Since September, bushfires have killed at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of homes. On Sunday, Mr Morrison conceded there were ""things I could have handled on the ground much better"". In recent weeks, Mr Morrison has been heckled by locals when visiting fire-hit communities in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, where the worst blazes are concentrated. In the town of Cobargo in New South Wales, one woman demanded more resources for the fire service, while others called Mr Morrison an ""idiot"" and said ""you won't be getting any votes down here"". ""These are sensitive environments, they are very emotional environments,"" Mr Morrison said in a TV interview with ABC.  ""Prime ministers are flesh and blood too in how they engage with these people."" Acknowledging the pressure fire services were facing, Mr Morrison said there was a ""new appetite"" for the government to take a more direct role in responding to the disaster. The PM said he would seek a royal commission review - a type of public inquiry - into the country's response to the bushfire crisis. Last month, Mr Morrison was criticised for going on holiday to Hawaii as the bushfire crisis worsened. The rising public anger at his absence eventually forced him to cut that trip short. Mr Morrison's government has been accused of not doing enough to address climate change, which experts say could increase the intensity, frequency and scale of bushfires.  But in the interview, the PM defended his government's approach, which he said took into account the effect of climate change on the bushfires. ""We're living in longer, hotter, drier summers,"" the PM said. ""This is obviously affected by the broader changes in climate."" Pressed on his plan to reduce carbon emissions, Mr Morrison insisted his government was on track to ""meet and beat"" its targets. Under the Paris climate agreement, Australia has pledged to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  However, Mr Morrison said a ""global solution"" was needed to tackle climate change. Tens of thousands of people across Australia took part in climate change protests on Friday. In cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, demonstrators turned out to press Mr Morrison's government to make a quick transition away from fossil fuels. Bushfire conditions eased on Saturday, giving firefighters temporary respite in areas where blazes are still raging. But with more hot weather expected next week, the risk was far from over, authorities warned. Authorities have warned that the huge fires, spurred by high temperatures, wind and a three-year-drought, will persist until there is substantial rainfall. More than 123 fires are still burning across New South Wales, with 50 said to be uncontained. According to NSW Rural Fire Service, more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed so far during this fire season. In Victoria, there were 32 bushfire warnings in place as of Saturday. A firefighter died while tackling a blaze in the state on Saturday, bringing the death toll from this season's bushfires to 28."
risk appetite,Panto season now 'up in the air' for 2020,2024-09-15,2020-11-26,By Paul Glynn,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55086157,"Pantomime producers have been left fearing the worst but planning for the best, following Thursday's coronavirus tiers government announcement. Theatres in tier three areas will not be able to reopen when lockdown ends on 2 December, unless they are moved into tier two after a review on 16 December. Dan Bates, the chief executive of Sheffield Theatres, says the news is ""devastating, but understandable"". His group of theatres - The Crucible, Studio and Lyceum - are in tier three. The Crucible's festive production of Damian's Pop Up Panto had been due to start on 6 December, but that is no longer possible at entertainment venues in Steel City. ""The last few days has been been like waiting for an exam result - what we're going to do and what our destiny is really,"" Bates told the BBC. ""What is frustrating is that we have seen the numbers [of coronavirus cases] reducing dramatically, particularly in Sheffield, and we're all a little bit on the cusp actually. ""But knowing we're in tier three now means OK, we have a plan really."" In fact, they have two. Plan A is to begin rehearsals under strict social distancing measures from next week, in case they are able to safely reopen their doors a week before Christmas. Plan B is to figure out a way to provide a decent online streaming alternative, to give audiences ""a little bit of magic"" at home at least, in the event of them remaining in tier three throughout the holidays. With 6,000 people having already paid for tickets, Bates prefers the sound of Plan A, and remains hopeful it can happen. ""Pantomime at Christmas in theatres is one of the most special times that we have, and I think to be able to bring a bit of joy - especially after the year we've all had - would be an, incredible thing to do,"" he added. As early as the summer, some of the UK's biggest pantomime producers started cancelling shows amid financial and health-related Covid concerns. Backing from the National Lottery in October meant some were able to be staged this Christmas, among them a star-filled spectacle at the London Palladium. The tier two venue tweeted on Thursday to say they were ""relieved and delighted"" to confirm that performances of Pantoland will go ahead as-planned from 12 December. But Michael Harrison, whose company Qdos Entertainment produce Pantoland, was critical of how the tier system was planned, telling The Stage: ""There is no joined up thinking at all."" ""To go into lockdown, and encourage rehearsals to keep going and then to announce a tier system is crazier than many of the scenes you will see in one of my pantomimes,"" he added. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport told the BBC the ""vast majority"" of pantomimes will be able to go ahead ""exactly as planned"" in areas that are in tier one and tier two. ""However it is important that we set a cap, to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus indoors and ensure venues can cope with managing the audience flow to and from venues."" They added they will ""continue to work with the cultural sector to bring back more performances in front of fuller audiences when it is safe to do so"". Another dormant theatre, Newcastle's Theatre Royal, recently received Lottery funding; as well as a cash boost out the government's £1.57bn Cultural Recovery Fund (just as Sheffield Theatres did). Before the winter lockdown, their long-running production of Robin Hood had been due to take off again on Tuesday 24 November. However, after the Tyneside city was similarly placed in tier three on Thursday, those plans are now ""up in the air"", admits chief executive Philip Bernays. The theatre boss, who says he should now be ""recovering from the effects of the first night"" is instead asking panto fans for a little more time to consider how to proceed fairly for all involved. ""We've not actually made a decision because we are still just looking at all the options,"" said Bernays. ""We really didn't want to disappoint the people of Newcastle and the North East,"" he added, noting how the appetite for theatrical festive fun remains strong, despite the pandemic. ""Everything is so fluid. We're in a difficult position, the public are in a difficult position, and the panto team - many of whom are freelancers - are in a very difficult position at the moment."" While the show has not yet been cancelled, rehearsals have not been able to get under way either. Streaming it online instead, Bernays said, is simply not economically ""viable"" for them - a stand-alone independent theatre - if all ticket holders have to be re-funded. ""Time will eventually run out,"" he concedes, just five days before everyone's first advent calendar window gets ripped open. ""We all want to do the show and the audience all want to see the show, but we can't keep everybody hanging around,"" concludes Bernays. ""I think the review in a couple of weeks is going to be fundamental and we may have a holding position until then, but we may make a decision beforehand. ""It's just up in the air."" Theatres Trust director Jon Morgan also reflected on the impact the new tier rules would have on the industry at a crucial period. ""It is a terrible blow for the theatre sector that so many large towns and cities in England are now in tier three, where theatres are not permitted to open,"" he said.  ""There are many theatres that we know were planning pantos and other shows for December, and this news will be devastating for those organisations.  ""They will have invested in rehearsals and other preparations for reopening and will now find themselves unable to recoup those costs, facing further financial strain in what has already been a catastrophic year."" Meanwhile, the chief executive of the Society of London Theatre (SOLT) and UK Theatre, Julian Bird, said the announcement was ""a relief for theatres in tier one and two areas - including London's West End"". Yet, he continued, it was ""equally devastating"" for tier three theatres, and ""especially pantos"". Like those currently in the balance in places like Sheffield and Newcastle. The move ""risks the survival of many venues and leaves thousands of theatre professionals struggling over the Christmas period"" he went on. ""Particularly freelancers who cannot rely on government [furlough scheme] support."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

risk appetite,Chemotherapy halted by hospital staff shortage,2024-09-15,2021-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-58669392,"A hospital trust has had to cancel chemotherapy treatments for some cancer patients due to a serious shortage of specialist staff.  Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs two hospitals in the city, said it postponed treatments for 49 patients on one day this week.  The problem has been caused by short and long-term sickness, and vacancies. The trust said it was ""deeply sorry"" and had ""prioritised care based on the likely clinical benefit"". Simon Roe, clinical director of cancer and associated services at the trust, which runs the QMC and City hospitals in Nottingham, gave a ""heartfelt apology"" to patients who had been affected.  ""From the beginning of this month we have faced a really challenging situation with staffing levels on our chemotherapy suites, which has mainly affected specialist nurses that we need to administer the chemotherapy,"" he said. Mr Roe said the trust was 30% down on the number of specialist nurses needed to run a full service. On Thursday he said staff had called 49 patients to cancel their treatment, representing about 10% of their patient list.  ""It has been incredibly difficult for our patients, their families and for the staff involved in this service,"" he said.  ""They have worked extremely hard over the past 18 months to maintain our cancer services so to be in this situation is really, really difficult and extremely upsetting for members of the team."" The trust said it was using guidance produced by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) during the pandemic to select which patients would have their treatment delayed.  Medical director Dr Keith Girling said: ""Our clinical teams are prioritising care based on the likely clinical benefit. We are deeply sorry for the concern and upset this will cause."" Mr Roe said staff were ""doing absolutely everything we can to get the service back up and running"" and he was optimistic they could offer treatments to everyone again soon. Annie Walton, head of the Nottingham Maggie's Centre, which provides free cancer support said they had seen a mixed response from patients.  ""Some are disappointed, very upset and some are angry, but some are quite relieved that they are having a break and the choice has been taken away from them,"" she said. ""With chemo comes a multitude of problems - memory loss, mobility problems, fatigue, nausea, appetite loss - and some people are looking for some quality end-of-life in the last years of their life, so they are relieved.  ""The pandemic has been really difficult for patients with cancer and their families, and now a lot of hospitals are struggling to roll out full programmes of cancer treatment. ""So we are still there to support them and help them along with that."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk."
risk appetite,US was 'cocked and loaded' to hit Iran targets,2024-09-15,2019-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48714414,"President Donald Trump has said the US military was ""cocked and loaded to retaliate"" against Iran, but he changed his mind 10 minutes before planned strikes. Attacks on three sites were planned in response to the shooting down of a US unmanned drone this week. Mr Trump said he had called off strikes after being told 150 people would die. He tweeted: ""10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone."" The late reversal was first reported by the New York Times on Thursday night. The newspaper said the operation had been ""in its early stages"" when Mr Trump stood the US military down. ""I am in no hurry,"" Mr Trump said on Friday. ""Our military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world.""  Mr Trump said Iran had downed the drone on Monday, despite an earlier US military statement that the incident happened at 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday). On Friday, the president told NBC News that he decided not to give final approval to the planned strikes because of the predicted death toll. ""I didn't like it. I didn't think it was proportionate,"" he said. Tehran says the unmanned US aircraft entered Iranian airspace early on Thursday morning. The US maintains it was shot down in international airspace. Tensions have been escalating between the two countries, with the US recently blaming Iran for attacks on oil tankers operating in the region. Iran has announced it will soon exceed international agreed limits on its nuclear programme. Last year, the US unilaterally pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities.  ""Iran can NEVER have nuclear weapons,"" Mr Trump said in his tweets on the aborted strikes - also revealing that increased economic sanctions against Iran were ""added last night"". The US has now asked the United Nations Security Council to meet on Monday to discuss Iran, Reuters news agency reports. In its initial report, The New York Times said that as late as 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Thursday, US military and diplomatic officials had still expected the strikes to take place on agreed targets, including Iranian radar and missile batteries. ""Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down,"" the newspaper reported, citing an unnamed senior administration official. But Mr Trump refuted this report on Friday, telling NBC that no planes were in the air. The strikes had been set to take place just before dawn on Friday to minimise risk to the Iranian military or to civilians, the New York Times report added. Tweeting on Friday, Mr Trump said three sites had been targeted. The Associated Press quoted a US official as saying the strikes had been recommended by the Pentagon and had been among options presented to senior administration officials. According to the New York Times, top Pentagon officials warned a military response could result in a spiralling escalation with risks for US forces in the region. The operation was called off after President Trump spent most of Thursday discussing Iran with his national security advisers and congressional leaders, AP reports. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton had pushed for a hardline stance, but congressional leaders urged caution, the agency says. Separately, Reuters quoted two Iranian officials as saying Tehran had received a message from Mr Trump through Oman overnight warning about an imminent US attack. That report was later denied by a spokesman for Iran's national security council, who said there was no truth to it and no message was sent. An official warned that ""any attack against Iran will have regional and international consequences"". ""When you violate Iranian territorial space, then we defend,"" Seyed Sajjadpour, one of Iran's Deputy Foreign Ministers, told the BBC. He also said it was clear that there were members of Donald Trump's administration who were intent on overthrowing Iran's government.   In the US, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said America had no appetite for war with Iran, while the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, called Mr Trump's Iran strategy a ""self-inflicted disaster"". Russian President Vladimir Putin said a war would be a ""catastrophe with unpredictable consequences"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency order on Thursday evening prohibiting US airlines from operating in an overwater area of Tehran-controlled airspace nearby in response. Airlines from other countries, including Britain's British Airways, the Dutch carrier KLM, Emirates, and Qantas of Australia, have also said they will re-route their flights to avoid parts of Iran. President Trump's decision to order – and then abort – an attack still sends a powerful message to Tehran.  The two countries came to the brink of direct conflict. But in this complex game of signalling, just what message will the Iranian leadership receive?  It, after all, had sent a significant warning of its own by downing an unmanned US reconnaissance drone.  Mr Trump initially appeared to play down the incident – but then apparently came the orders for a US retaliatory strike. That was followed by a last-minute change of heart.  The danger now is that Iran receives mixed messages that convey uncertainty and lack of resolve. This might encourage some in Tehran to push back at the Americans even harder.  There appears to be no diplomatic ""off-ramp"" in this crisis.  US economic sanctions are hitting home. Tehran is under pressure. Escalation remains an ever-present danger.  Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced its air force had shot down a US ""spy"" drone on Thursday morning after the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan. IRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". However, US military officials maintain the drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at the time. Iranian officials say two warnings were issued 10 minutes before the drone was shot down.  Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a high-ranking officer in the IRGC, said another military aircraft, carrying 35 passengers, had been flying close to the drone. ""We could have shot down that one too, but we did not,"" he said. The shooting down of the drone followed accusations by the US that Iran had attacked two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman. "
risk appetite,Carmakers bet on trucks to boost US sales,2024-09-15,2018-01-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42698718,"Carmakers are focusing on pickup trucks and SUVs as they seek to counter falling sales in the US.  Sales of new vehicles in the world's second-largest market dropped 2% last year to 17.2 million, the first fall since 2009. This year is expected to see another fall in sales, but carmakers hope a focus on the American stalwarts of pickups and SUVs will help. Pickup trucks tend to enjoy more robust sales and have higher profit margins. General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler have all rebooted their pickup truck offerings at the Detroit Auto Show this week, while BMW and Lamborghini are among those unveiling new SUVs. Pickup trucks account for about 15% of the US market and have higher profit margins. Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said sales of the models also tend to be less cyclical than other kinds of cars and the models appeal to buyers - like construction contractors - that are poised to benefit from new US tax cuts. However, SUVs already account for more than 40% of US sales, and next year carmakers will be facing an influx of cheaper, used SUVs that could undermine sales of newer models. The possibility of higher gas prices pose another risk. ""We think 2018 is going to be challenging for the kind of growth that segment has enjoyed,"" Mr Smoke said. The continued appetite for SUVs and trucks - traditionally gas guzzlers, though the efficiency has improved - underscores one of the problems facing car companies. Prodded by government emissions rules, firms are investing heavily in electric vehicles. But so far, buyer enthusiasm hasn't matched the buzz. Executives at Daimler and Fiat Chrysler warned at the show on Monday that firms would struggle to reach European targets for emissions from their fleets. In the US, where fuel remains cheap and emissions targets are under review, electric cars represent less than 1% of the market, according to Thomas Libby at research firm IHS Markit. ""It's tiny,"" he said. Mr Smoke said electric cars have had success with high-end American buyers, but it will take some time - and lower prices - to make inroads in the wider market. Nicolas Peter from BMW said governments and other companies would need to do more to encourage  widespread adoption of the cars. ""To accelerate electric powered cars across the world, we need not only the technology in the car, we need infrastructure,"" he said.  ""It will only develop if we have strong co-ordination between the car manufacturers, providers of electric power and the different mayors and governments across the world."" "
risk appetite,Africa needs China and the US to work together,2024-09-15,2021-12-09,By Dickens Olewe,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59531176,"Seventeen African countries are taking part in a two-day Democracy summit hosted by US President Joe Biden, billed as an event to discuss ways to defend against the rise of authoritarianism. Observers say it highlights the contrasting priorities of the US and China on the continent. The summit comes just over a week after the triennial Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (Focac) was held in Senegal's capital, Dakar, which has grown in significance as China became the continent's largest trade partner.  China's President Xi Jinping announced investments of at least $40bn (£30bn) in projects spanning agriculture, digital economy, climate change, industrialisation, as well as one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines in donation and joint manufacturing. ""It appears counterintuitive, but the more democratic a country, the closer they get to China,"" said W Gyude Moore, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development.  ""The biggest need in Africa happens to be infrastructure, and the funder to turn to in the last 20 years has been China,"" he added.  At the Focac event, a photo of Sierra Leone Foreign Minister David John Francis handing over an artist's impression of a yet-to-be-built 7km (4 mile)- long bridge to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi demonstrated China's important role in Africa. The estimated $1.2bn (£900m) Lungi bridge linking the peninsula capital Freetown to the main airport will offer a quick alternative to ferries which take hours and can be unreliable.   Some observers say President Julius Maada Bio sees the bridge project as key to his 2023 re-election campaign, although others say there is no economic justification for it, pointing out that the money could be better spent on dealing with social challenges like illiteracy and maternal deaths.  In The Gambia, President Adama Barrow recently won re-election after touting a Chinese-built bridge as well as promising to deliver a China-backed road project.  Folashade Soule-Kohndou, a senior research associate at the University of Oxford, says African politicians often need Chinese infrastructure funding to deliver their electoral promises. According to the African Development Bank the continent needs $130-170bn a year to meet its infrastructure needs, but there's currently a massive shortfall, in the range of $68-108bn.  That gap could potentially be filled by the European Union new $340bn infrastructure plan, the Global Gateway, as well the US's Build Back Better (B3W) scheme, which are both being promoted as alternatives to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). But for the moment, these two projects are short on detail, compared to BRI which has already built roads, railways and ports around the world. Trade expert Francis Mangeni says it would be best for Africa if the various initiatives focussed on synergy not competition.  ""Rather than seeing Chinese influence in Africa as negative and responding by competition and antagonism or containment, I think the other powers should complement it,"" he said. But he adds that it is up to African countries to assert their collective influence to ensure that this happens.  However, the Global Gateway and B3W can have advantages over China's initiative if they focus more on technology transfer, faster delivery of projects, and on investment that is less centred on debt, Ms Soule-Kohndou said.  Mr Moore agrees, saying that ""Africa needs to diversify its infrastructure funding, so this is a good problem to have"". But he adds that China has built cost-competitive infrastructure on the continent and it will therefore be tough, especially for US construction companies, to compete. He suggested that the US and China have different strengths that can be complementary to meet infrastructure, health, education and security needs in Africa.  ""The US has great strength in human-capital investment. Its universities are the best in the world, so are its health systems. China could build the hospitals and the US could train the doctors,"" Mr Moore said.  With the continent's population projected to double to 2.5 billion people by 2050, the focus on economic, social and political development is key. The Africa Free Continental Trade Agreement (AfCTA), an initiative launched in January to increase intra-African trade from its very low levels, is seen as a key way to achieve these aims. Mr Mangeni says China's proposal to link up BRI and AfCTA ""would massively boost trade on the continent and beyond"". ""The cost of trade in Africa is the highest in the world with transporting goods making up 90% of the cost, "" he said, adding that ""some of these people criticising China did not step in to invest in infrastructure"". Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, who was not invited to the US Democracy summit - a decision his foreign ministry termed ""a big mistake"" - welcomed the Chinese private sector's deepening engagement, saying Western private investors were ""losing appetite"".  Mr Museveni has been among a group of leaders pushing for increased access for African products to the Chinese market. He recently denied reports that the country's main airport was at risk of being taken over as an example of the widely reported but not proven accusations that China uses debt to entrap African countries.  But these projects have often been mired in corruption, kickbacks, and lack transparency - a situation that has contributed to some African countries struggling to repay their debt.   Some experts also worry that the continent's lack of a collective policy towards China undermines its strategic plans. ""Overall, China plays an important role as Africa's development partner, but Africa must be more proactive and co-ordinated in its relationship with China,"" wrote David Monyae from the Centre for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg. ""China has released three Africa policy papers since 2006 yet Africa is yet to develop a policy paper on China,"" he added.  In his book China's Second Continent, Howard French recounted a conversation with a former Chinese ambassador to Zambia who mocked US policy in Africa. ""You [US] employ local people and place them as observers at each and every polling station... what else? I haven't seen any roads being built, any schools, any hospitals that really touch people, that can last, that can serve society for long. Maybe training election people is your biggest contribution,"" said Zhou Yuxiao then ambassador to Zambia.  French wrote that he responded by mentioning the US' Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), which has provided life-saving drugs for millions of people on the continent since its launch in 2003. He recounted that Mr Zhou's entire response consisted of a nod. The US engagement in Africa is extensive especially in security and health services. It's African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) also gives African businesses access to the lucrative American market.  But Africa - as a unit - should chart its own path, just as Ghana's independence leader Kwame Nkrumah famously rallied the continent to ""face neither east nor west"" but face forward. According to studies, a majority of Africans want to live in free democratic countries, but they also want governments that deliver good roads, better education, security, healthcare and much more. In order to achieve these aspirations, African leaders should put the continent's interests first and cherry-pick from the different schemes on offer, rather than becoming pawns in a global competition for influence, analysts say."
risk appetite,The power of Disney's nostalgia during a pandemic,2024-09-15,2019-05-23,By Imran Rahman-Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47696220,"Ever since she can remember, Emily Talbut's been a massive Disney fan. ""I got the dresses for Christmas, played dress-up, and I got to go to the parks with my family,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I just grew up in a progressively more intense Disney household, I guess - probably driven by me and my sister, because we just loved the stories and the music as well."" Emily's go-to costume was Belle from Beauty and the Beast.  ""Belle had brown hair, like I do, and she liked to read - and that was basically me. I could see myself in the character"". When the Beauty and the Beast remake came out in 2017, starring Emma Watson, Emily was delighted.  ""A big reason why that's still probably my favourite live action remake is the nostalgia playing into it,"" she says. For her. the appeal is ""the idea of going back to your childhood again - but in a reimagined way"". Disney Plus launched in March, granting us on-demand access to all the old classics. And for the first few months of lockdown, it was all Emily watched. ""It was very comforting in that very scary period to just have old favourites to turn back to and relive,"" she says. She went straight to ""the ones that are the most comforting, like the key soundtracks from the 90s that I loved."" That feeling - of comfort, losing yourself in another world, going back in time - is hard to beat, especially in such turbulent times. It's something Disney is particularly good at creating. But does that mean the feeling can be exploited too? ""Nostalgia is commonly defined as in a sentimental or wistful affection for the past,"" says Dr Wijnand van Tilburg, a psychology lecturer and expert in nostalgia at the University of Essex. ""With the remake of some of these movies, it might be that they capitalise on those past feelings of nostalgia and make us fondly remember those past events."" He adds that it's ""overall experienced by people as a as a somewhat positive, bittersweet emotion."" It can also be useful during uncertain and difficult times. ""Research shows that nostalgia is quite effective in combating loneliness, boredom, and sadness. And these are all experiences that that not implausibly have arisen during the lockdown."" Part of the reason nostalgia can be useful, he says, is because it ""contains strong social elements."" It can help us feel more connected with others who have the same shared experiences. Mulan is Disney's retelling of its 1998 animated film, which was based on the Chinese legend the Ballad of Mulan. Its release - a few months delayed and on Disney Plus rather than in the cinema due to coronavirus - comes off the back of three Disney makeovers last year: The Lion King, Aladdin and Dumbo. Cinderella kicked off the latest batch of ""reimagined"" works in 2015, followed by The Jungle Book (2016) and Beauty and the Beast (2017). With the six recent remakes raking in a combined $5.8bn (£4.4bn) at the box office, there's clearly a huge appetite for our childhoods to be given the live-action treatment. Pre-coronavirus, Disney clearly backed the film to make money - having spent a reported $200m (£160m) on making it. But in an industry dominated by sequels and big franchises, should audiences be asking for more original stories? ""There's an inclination to want to reach for the past,"" says Samuel Jones, co-creators of the movie review YouTube channel NitPix. ""The majority of films right now are sequels and remakes. They're ways to stay somewhere that's separate from our world."" NitPix's most recent video is called ""How Disney Decimated Lion King"". It's over an hour long. One of the many criticisms of the film is that it's a watered-down version of the original. ""You end up with a film that's like kind of missing its essential nuts and bolts,"" says Samuel.  ""[There's] none of the personality, none of the character, none of the things that like make us excited about what will make us like what the original Lion King did,"" adds Max Bardsley, Samuel's NitPix co-creator. Max makes the point that remakes are nothing new.  ""Art has always been founded on recycling assets from other pieces of art and reinvigorating those assets as a way to offer them to people in new ways,"" he says. But his opinion is that these remakes are different. ""It's no longer about taking assets that you feel really excited about as an artist and reinvigorating those in a way that is an expression of yourself.  ""It's more about taking assets that lots of people seem to like, re-offering those assets in a way that's not too insulting or not too unfamiliar so that we can be assured everyone will like what they're being provided."" ""I think it's a shame though, because these films do deserve better,"" adds Samuel. ""You can look at any of these Disney films and get a lot of different ideas and themes and filmic concepts and great visual storytelling. ""But the easiest, risk-free option is the one that you usually take. And in these times when it's harder for businesses and harder for filmmakers, they're going to want to take even less of a risk."" The pandemic's not the only reason we're so drawn to that feeling of nostalgia right now. Samuel says technology has a lot to do with it too. He thinks the internet and social media were meant to break down boundaries in society and bring us all closer together. But instead, ""We've realised that it hasn't brought anyone together that much. I think that can feel very disorienting."" And that leads people to ""grasp on to something that they're familiar with"". It's not just at the box office where we see people reaching out for nostalgic experiences. After a lifetime of Disney fandom, Emily got her dream job working at Walt Disney World in Florida for two summers while she was at university. She describes her job there as ""making people smile all day"" and helping create a welcoming and friendly atmosphere. While there were a lot of young families there, Emily says there were also a lot of adults who would go without children, on romantic getaways or stag and hen dos.  ""You get people coming to visit and they've left their kids at home - because the kids aren't as interested as they are,"" she says. Emily thinks escapism is one of the main reasons people love immersing themselves in Disney World.  ""People are so invested in these stories,"" she says. ""We've all seen the movies, countless times - so getting to experience it in a different way I think is really appealing. ""It's also a very safe place - when you go into the parks you can't see the outside world."" But even as a huge Disney fan, Emily's worried the remakes might start to lose their appeal. ""Last year, people were getting a bit fatigued of it because we had Dumbo, Aladdin and The Lion King.  ""Obviously it's been a while now since any came out. So I feel like people are ready again to kind of embrace that"". Mulan is slightly different as the signs are that it draws more on the Chinese legend than the Disney animation. Fan favourite Mushu the dragon - voiced by Eddie Murphy in the 1998 version - isn't in it, and the songs have been cut. ""It doesn't have that star appeal, like Will Smith being the genie,"" says Emily.  ""But fans of Disney will want to see it, especially to support those lesser-known actors and encourage Disney to continue making films like that.  ""It does have greater diversity than what we've seen before."" After Mulan, Disney's announced nine ""Disney live-action"" movies to come out between 2021 and 2023. We know they will include The Little Mermaid, Peter Pan and Cruella (a 101 Dalmatians origin story). And it's very likely there will be more remakes of old animations - reports suggest they're working on the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Lilo & Stitch and Pinocchio, among many others. Some of those may only be released on streaming service Disney+ in the same way 2019's Lady and the Tramp remake was. It's not just animations that will get retold either.  It was announced in 2019 there are ""reimaginations"" of Home Alone, Night At the Museum, Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Cheaper By the Dozen in the pipeline. And there's another Indiana Jones sequel on the way too. With evidence to say that young people are feeling more distant from family and friends than ever before, nostalgia might just be our way of dealing with it.  ""We've all grown up and we have to live proper adult lives,"" says Emily Talbut. ""But it's fun to go back in time"". Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

risk appetite,How do people learn to cook a toxic plant safely?,2024-09-15,2019-09-03,By Tim Harford,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48859333,"In 1860, Robert Burke and William Wills famously led the first European expedition across the largely unknown interior of Australia.  It did not go well. Due to a combination of poor leadership, bad planning and misfortune, Burke, Wills and their companion John King ran out of food on the return journey.  They became stranded at a stream called Cooper's Creek, having found no way to carry enough water to cross a stretch of desert to the nearest colonial outpost at the unpromisingly named Mount Hopeless.  ""We have been unable to leave the creek,"" wrote Wills. ""Both camels are dead and our provisions are done. We are trying to live the best way we can.""  The local Yandruwandha people seemed to thrive despite the conditions that were proving so tough for Wills's party.  The Yandruwandha gave the explorers cakes made from the crushed seed pods of a clover-like fern called nardoo. Burke then fell out with them and, unwisely, drove them away by firing his pistol.  But perhaps the trio had already learned enough to survive? They found fresh nardoo and decided to make their own cakes. At first, all seemed well. The nardoo cakes satisfied their appetites, yet they felt ever weaker.  Within a week, Wills and Burke were dead. It turns out that safely preparing nardoo is a complex process. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.

Nardoo, a type of fern, is packed with an enzyme called thiaminase, which is toxic to the human body. Thiaminase breaks down the body's supply of Vitamin B1, which prevents the body using the nutrients in food.  Burke, Wills and King were full, but starving.  The Yandruwandha roasted the nardoo spores, ground the flour with water, and exposed the cakes to ash, each step making the thiaminase less toxic. It is not something one learns to do by chance. Barely alive, King threw himself on the mercy of the Yandruwandha, who kept him alive until European help arrived months later. He was the only member of the expedition who survived. As a foodstuff, nardoo is a curiosity.  The same cannot be said of cassava roots, which are a vital source of calories in many tropical countries, particularly for subsistence farmers in Africa. But like nardoo, cassava is highly toxic. It also requires a tedious and complex preparation ritual to make it safe. The cassava root will otherwise release hydrogen cyanide.  What makes cassava particularly treacherous is that some processing will reduce the bitter taste and the risk of immediate cyanide poisoning.  However, only the full, time-consuming ritual can guarantee that you will not be slowly poisoned, and develop a condition called Konzo, with symptoms including sudden paralysis of the legs.   But in 1981, in Nampula in Mozambique, a young Swedish doctor named Hans Rosling knew none of this. As a result, the situation he faced was deeply puzzling. More and more people were coming to his clinic suffering from paralysis in their legs. Could it be an outbreak of polio? No. The symptoms were not in any textbook.  With Mozambique slipping into a civil war, might it be chemical weapons?  He packed his wife Agneta and young children off to safety and continued his investigations.  It was Dr Rosling's colleague, the epidemiologist Julie Cliff, who eventually figured out what was happening.  Their meals of cassava had been incompletely processed. Already hungry and malnourished, they could not wait long enough to make the cassava safe. And as a result, they developed Konzo. Toxic plants are everywhere. Sometimes simple cooking processes are enough to make them edible. But how does anyone learn the elaborate preparation needed for cassava or nardoo? No single person does, according to Joseph Henrich, an evolutionary biologist.  He argues this knowledge is cultural. Our cultures evolve though a process of trial and error analogous to evolution in biological species. Like biological evolution, cultural evolution can - given enough time - produce impressively sophisticated results.  Somebody stumbles on one step that seems to make cassava less risky; that spreads and another step is discovered. Over time, complex rituals can evolve, each slightly more effective than the last. In South America, where humans have eaten cassava for thousands of years, tribes have learned the many steps needed to detoxify it completely: scrape, grate, wash, boil the liquid, leave the solid to stand for two days, then bake. Ask why they do this, and they will not mention hydrogen cyanide. They will simply say ""this is our culture"".  In Africa, cassava was introduced only in the 17th Century. It did not come with an instruction manual. Cyanide poisoning is still an occasional problem; people take shortcuts because cultural learning is still incomplete.    Henrich argues that cultural evolution is often much smarter than we are.   Whether it is constructing an igloo, hunting an antelope, lighting a fire, making a longbow or processing cassava, we learn not by understanding from first principles, but by imitating.  One study challenged participants to place weights on the spokes of a wheel to maximise the speed at which it rolled down a slope. Each person's best effort would be passed to the next person.  Because they benefited from earlier experiments, later participants did much better. Yet when asked, they showed no sign of actually understanding why some wheels rolled faster than others.   Further studies show that the verb to ape, meaning to copy, is ironically misplaced: the only ape with the instinct to imitate is us.  Tests reveal two-and-a-half year-old chimps and humans have similar mental capacities - unless the challenge is to learn by copying someone. The toddlers are vastly better at copying than the chimps.    And humans ritualistically copy in a way that chimps do not. Psychologists call this over-imitation. It may seem like the chimps are the smart ones here. But if you are processing cassava roots, over-imitation is exactly what you should be doing.  If Henrich is right, human civilisation is based less on raw intelligence than on a highly-developed ability to learn from each other. Over the generations our ancestors accumulated useful ideas by trial and error, and the next generation simply copied them.  No doubt some less useful ideas were mixed in with them, like the need for a ritual dance to make the rains come, or the conviction that sacrificing a goat will persuade the volcano not to erupt.  But overall we apparently did better by copying without question than by assuming, like the chimps, that we were smart enough to tell which steps we could safely ignore.  Of course cultural evolution can take us only so far. Now we have the scientific method to tell us that, yes, we really do need to leave the cassava for two days, but, no, the volcano does not care about the goats.  When we understand from first principles, we can make progress more quickly than by trial and error and imitation. But we should not look down on the kind of collective intelligence that saved King's life.  It is what made civilisation - and a functioning economy - possible.

risk appetite,Pope condemns treatment of migrants in Europe,2024-09-15,2021-12-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59538413,"The Pope has denounced ""narrow self-interest and nationalism"" over the way European countries treats migrants. Speaking on the Greek island of Lesbos, Pope Francis called the neglect of migrants the ""shipwreck of civilisation"". The Pope first visited Lesbos in 2016, when it was a major entry point for people trying to reach Europe. Since then, new flashpoints have emerged and the Pope expressed regret that little had changed. Last month 27 people died when their inflatable dinghy sank in the Channel between France and the UK. The number of people attempting the crossing has been growing, with more than 26,000 people arriving in the UK so far this year, more than double last year's total. Several people have also died in freezing temperatures attempting to cross into Poland from Belarus, which denies accusations it has been orchestrating the crisis at its border to destabilise the EU. ""In Europe there are those who persist in treating the problem as a matter that does not concern them - this is tragic,"" Pope Francis said. ""History teaches us that narrow self-interest and nationalism lead to disastrous consequences."" The pontiff was speaking at a temporary camp housing about 2,000 asylum-seekers, which replaced the overcrowded Moria camp that was destroyed in fires last year.  While the coronavirus pandemic had shown that major challenges had to be confronted together and there were some signs of this happening on climate change, there was little sign of such an approach to migration, he said. ""It is easy to influence public opinion by instilling fear of the other,"" Pope Francis said. ""The remote causes should be attacked, not the poor people who pay the consequences and are even used for political propaganda.""  By Fergal Keane, BBC News, Lesbos This was a speech delivered in front of refugees but aimed squarely at political leaders across the European continent. The Pope's words betrayed frustration at what he sees as the failure of politicians to adequately address the migrant issue. His message of compassion for asylum seekers is not new but his language on Lesbos was exceptionally forthright. Pope Francis was speaking against the backdrop of pushbacks of migrants at sea - including close to Lesbos - and on European land borders, as well as the erection of fences to prevent them reaching the EU.  Will his words make any difference? They certainly inject a powerfully compassionate element in a debate so often framed in the language of fear. But there is very little political appetite in Europe to liberalise the migration system. Nor is there any sign of the kind of global political will to address the problems of conflict and extreme poverty which drive so many to flee their homes.  The number of people entering Europe reached a high point in 2015, when more than a million people fleeing the Syrian civil war and other crises made the journey.  Since then numbers have fallen as nations along migrant routes closed borders. The EU also agreed a deal to return failed asylum seekers to Turkey and has provided support for the Libyan coastguard to pick up people who set off to sea. But the flow of people has not stopped, with 1,650 recorded by the International Organization for Migration as having gone missing while attempting to cross the Mediterranean this year. Francis said he understood that there was a lot of ""fatigue and frustration"" over migration that had been exacerbated by the pandemic, but warned that without change there was a risk that civilisation itself would find itself ""shipwrecked"". ""Let us eradicate the prevailing mentality revolving around our ego and personal and national egoisms which determine every decision we take,"" he said. Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, who was accompanying Francis, said the migration issue was the responsibility of all Europe, not just Greece.  More than 8,000 people have crossed into Greece by land and sea this year, down from about 15,000 last year and about 75,000 the previous year, according to EU figures. Greece is building closed camps on several islands to house asylum seekers until their claims are processed. It denies that Greek coast guards push back migrants at sea, insisting that they are saving lives. British Home Secretary Priti Patel has cited the Greek pushbacks as a possible model for the UK to push back migrant boats in the Channel."
risk appetite,Doctor cites Covid for transplant waiting list rise,2024-09-15,2023-07-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-66306392,"A senior doctor has said that Covid played a major part in making organ transplant waiting lists grow longer. Mr Sanjay Sinha, a consultant surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said transplant waiting lists in Oxfordshire have doubled in four years.  He said the county had felt the impact of growing waiting times for vital organs, with more than 7,000 people on the UK waiting list. ""One donor can save up to nine lives,"" he said.  ""We've just come through a pandemic which was unprecedented in our lifetime and it did have an impact on our transplant numbers."" Covid also impacted the living donation programme, which had been temporarily suspended during the height of the pandemic due to the lack of clarity around transmission risk and for the safety of both recipients and donors. Despite this, there has been a 5% transplant increase in the past year, which Mr Sinha said was vital to saving lives. In 2020 the law in the UK changed so all adults in England are now considered potential organ donors, unless they choose to opt out or are in one of the excluded groups. Mr Sinha said: ""There are missed opportunities -  only 1% of people who die have the potential to save lives."" Last year more than 430 people died while waiting for a transplant. Dan Sheridan was among those on the waiting list and is now celebrating six weeks since he underwent a liver transplant after being diagnosed with advanced liver disease in 2020. He said receiving the transplant felt like he had ""won the lottery"". ""During Covid it was very difficult because these procedures weren't available,"" he added.  ""All organs outlive the owner - I'm alive because someone else isn't."" Now, Mr Sheridan said thanks to his transplant he feels warmer and his appetite has returned.

risk appetite,He was protecting the oceans - then he disappeared,2024-09-15,2022-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62603911,"Keith Davis disappeared at sea thousands of miles from home. His body has never been found. Now the mystery of his death has shone a light on a maritime world that is largely hidden from view, writes Rachel Monroe. At my local grocery store in Texas, I can buy a can of tuna for less than a dollar. But, like many things that seem inexpensive, those low prices are only possible because of dangerous and largely invisible work happening far away - work that most of us will never know about. Davis, an idealistic and adventure-loving ukulele player from Arizona, worked to make the invisible world of commercial tuna fishing visible. And he may have paid a price for it.  ""He was very impulsive, very romantic, fly by the seat of his pants,"" said Anik Clemens, his friend and colleague. ""He was so passionate about what he did. He wanted to protect the oceans, he wanted to protect the fishermen and their industry."" In 2015, in the midst of a seemingly routine voyage on the Victoria 168, part of a tuna fleet owned by a Taiwanese conglomerate, the 41-year-old vanished hundreds of miles off the coast of Ecuador.   The crew searched the ship, but found no sign of him. As word of his disappearance trickled back to his friends and colleagues on the mainland, many were instantly suspicious.  ""He had 16 years of service. And there was no question in my mind that he was as professional and as careful and safe as anyone could be,"" said Bubba Cook, Davis's friend and the Western and Central Pacific Tuna Programme Manager for the World Wildlife Fund.  ""The inevitable conclusion is that something had to have happened to him. To this day, I'm convinced that he saw something that the people that were on that vessel didn't want him to see."" Looking into his disappearance for new BBC podcast Lost At Sea led me into a fascinating world.   Davis was a marine biologist who worked as a fisheries observer, a little-known profession that offers both great adventure and, in some cases, great risk. The estimated 2,500 observers are our eyes and ears on the oceans. They live on board fishing vessels for months at a time, venturing hundreds of miles offshore to protect those waters from overfishing, and to collect scientific observations that help us understand the health of our oceans and marine life. Observers live among the crew, working the same gruelling hours in the same harsh conditions. But they are also sometimes viewed with suspicion, because part of their job is reporting illegal activity.  But what might Davis have witnessed that could've put him at risk? The high seas, where legal jurisdiction is complex and there is little oversight, are known for illegal activity - namely trafficking in drugs and weapons and even sometimes human trafficking. However, to be clear, we haven't seen anything that shows Davis witnessed any of those activities on the Victoria 168.  The boat he was working on at the time of his disappearance was engaged in what's known as transshipment.  Transshipment vessels provide the longliner tuna fishing boats with fresh supplies and transport the freshly-caught fish back to shore. This process can enable some tuna longliners to stay out at sea for years at a time, which can help save on costs - and enable that 99-cent can of tuna I found on my grocery store's shelf. Observers who witness illegal activity are in an incredibly vulnerable position. When Davis was working on the Victoria 168, his only means of communication to shore was via the captain's computer.  People doing his job are sometimes trained to speak in code in case they see something that's too sensitive to say out loud.  Although Davis loved being an observer, he was also acutely aware of the job's perils. ""Many of us who have served have witnessed gun activity, knife fights, slavery... much of which we have to swallow as 'part of the job,'"" he wrote on Facebook the year before he disappeared. Even more alarmingly, Davis's presumed death is hardly an isolated incident. A number of observers have vanished or died under mysterious circumstances - there were two more incidents during the months that we were working on the podcast.  Most of these cases get far less visibility than even Davis did. That's because many observers aren't adventurous American men, like Davis, but rather Pacific Islanders working to provide for their families. They're often from communities with a strong history of artisanal fishing - a localised industry that, in many cases, has been devastated by the intrusion of globalised fishing fleets that rely on transshipment.  When men like Charlie Lasisi, an observer from Papua New Guinea, or Eritara Aati Kaierua from Kiribas, died under suspicious circumstances, they didn't make headlines. But it's observers like these who are bearing the brunt of our desire to buy cheap tuna. Davis's body has still not been found. Investigations by Panamanian authorities and the FBI were inconclusive.  ""While we find the lack of resolution regarding what happened to Keith extremely upsetting, there's little else that we can do,"" his employer, MRAG Americas, said in a statement. ""We continue to strive for maximum security for our observers deployed at sea and at land.""  The Gilontas Group, the owner of the Victoria 168, has declined to comment on the case, which is still technically open, and also noted that ""the Gilontas Group has cooperated with the authorities that conducted the investigation"". Officially, we don't know whether Davis died accidentally, took his own life, or was killed. But what we do know is that much of the illegal activity that takes place at sea relies on the idea that what happens far from shore, where there's no cell phone signals or security cameras, is essentially invisible to those of us on the mainland.  The job of observers, to witness what happens at sea, can make them vulnerable. ""Observers don't have support from the fishing industry. They don't have support from the agencies. They don't have support from their employers, the contractors. In the end, they're by themselves,"" said Liz Mitchell, the former president of the Association for Professional Observers. But over the course of my reporting, I found a host of people working to shed light on this unseen world.  The WWF's Bubba Cook has been tracking observers' unexplained deaths for over a decade. ""One of the bigger problems is that we just don't know how many observers have been lost,"" he said. ""Just here in the Pacific, it's been about one observer a year. And that's only [since] we started keeping records. How many before that died at sea under various circumstances, or never came home?""  There's also the Global Fishing Watch map, an open access tool that shows the locations of more than 65,000 shipping vessels from 2012 to the present moment.  By paying attention to stories like Keith Davis's, and Charlie's, and Eritara's, and by learning about what happens out on the high seas, we can make things safer for observers, for crews, and for our oceans.

risk appetite,Fears over chemical found in slime toys,2024-09-15,2018-07-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44852913,"Some children's slime toys contain potentially unsafe levels of a chemical which can cause vomiting and impair fertility, according to Which?. An investigation by the consumer group into 11 popular slime products found eight contained higher than recommended levels of a chemical called boron. One product had more than four times the EU safety limit, the tests found. Which? is advising parents to ""approach slime with caution"" and said retailers and the government must do more. It also urged parents to be careful when choosing to make ""homemade slime"", adding that some ingredients used to make slime - such as some contact lens solutions - contain borax, which is made up of boron.  Slime became one of 2017's biggest crazes, with millions of people sharing pictures on Instagram and watching DIY slime-making videos on YouTube. Which? tested some of the popular slime products on sale for the chemical boron, an ingredient which is often used to make the products sticky. Excessive levels of boron can cause irritation, diarrhoea, vomiting and cramps, it said. High levels may also impair fertility or cause harm to an unborn child in pregnancy, according to the European Commission. Eight out of the 11 slime products tested contained boron levels which exceeded the European Union safety limit of 300mg/kg.  Which? warned parents that many slimes have minimal safety labelling and some are even marked with a CE, suggesting they are safe - despite boron levels being above the EU safety limit. The eight slime toys which did not meet the EU safety directive were all purchased on Amazon, Which? said. Amazon has removed the products identified from its website.  In a statement, the web giant said all sellers ""must follow our selling guidelines and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account"".  Which? said anyone who owns any of the slimes which failed the test should be able to return it to the retailer and get a refund. The highest level of boron was Toysmith Jupiter Juice which had 1,400mg/kg of boron - more than four times the permitted level.  CCINEE Pink Fluffy Slime was found to contain 1,000mg/kg and Cosoro Dodolu Crystal Slime Magic Clay was tested to have 980mg/kg, Which? said. Slime bought from both The Works and Smyths were tested to be within the safety limit. One product purchased on Amazon, Hulk Green Halloween Slime, met the standard. Eve Squires's daughter Tilly, 10, was given slime as a birthday gift and opened it last Wednesday.  But on the Thursday, she was sent home from school after being sick in the classroom, having also experienced stomach cramps and a high temperature.  Eve, from Wimborne, Dorset, said: ""It didn't present like a normal fever because she wasn't pale and was very much normal self between vomiting. She also still had an appetite. As a mum of four, I've dealt with a lot of bugs.   ""Interestingly Fin, her eight-year-old brother, complained of stomach cramps on Monday and is off school today. Fin has had less time playing with the slime kit because it is Tilly's favourite present. ""They're the only two children to play with the slime and my other two children are not unwell."" But she adds: ""It could be a bug, I don't know."" Nikki Stopford, director of research and publishing at Which?, called for ""fundamental changes"" and said: ""Manufacturers must stop making unsafe products and the government and retailers simply have to do a far better job of getting anything identified as a risk off the shelves and out of people's homes."" A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: ""The government's top priority is to keep people safe, which is why goods being sold in the UK must meet some of the strictest safety laws in the world. ""The evidence provided by Which? will be considered by the Office for Product Safety and Standards and [it can] take any appropriate action.""  The British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) spokeswoman Natasha Crookes said: ""There are a large number of substances that are restricted from being used in toys for safety reasons.  ""Borax is one of those and it is worrying to see so many failing safety tests. Our advice would be to look for reputable toy makers and retailers. ""Members of the BTHA can be found on our website and when looking for toy retailers, try to visit retailers you recognise or look for the name behind the online brand - look at the reviews of sellers, do they have a track record in selling toys and if something looks too good to be true (particularly on price), it probably is.""  None of the slime toys that failed to meet the EU safety directive was made by BTHA members, she added."
risk appetite,Typhoid vaccine 'works fantastically well',2024-09-15,2019-12-04,By James Gallagher,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50587608,"A new typhoid vaccine works ""fantastically well"" and is being used to help stop an almost untreatable strain of the infection, doctors say. Cases of the bacterial disease fell by more than 80% in trials, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Experts said the vaccine was a game-changer and would reduce the ""terrible toll wrought by typhoid"". Nine million children are being immunised in Pakistan, where typhoid is now extremely resistant to antibiotics. Typhoid fever is caused by highly contagious Salmonella Typhi bacteria and spread through contaminated food and water.  It is a disease of poverty, most common in countries with poor sanitation and a lack of clean water. Symptoms include: It causes fatal complications, such as internal bleeding, in one in 100 people. Precise numbers on typhoid are hard to collect but it affects between 11 and 21 million people around the world each year and kills 128,000 to 161,000. More than 20,000 children - aged from nine months to 16 years - in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, took part in the trial.  Typhoid is a major public-health problem in the area. Half of the children were given the vaccine and their cases of typhoid fell by 81% in the first year of the study. ""It works fantastically well in preventing this disease affecting some of the world's most vulnerable children,"" Prof Andrew Pollard, from the University of Oxford, who has been involved in the trials, told BBC News. ""The burden of typhoid is so huge, we're seeing families taking children into hospital to be treated and being plunged into poverty paying for the costs of investigation and treatment with antibiotics. ""The arrival of this vaccine to control the disease is a pretty exciting moment.""  The children in Nepal, as well as those taking part in trials in Malawi and Bangladesh, will now be followed to see how long protection lasts.  Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium director Dr Kathleen Neuzil said the vaccine could ""reduce disease and save lives in populations that lack clean water and improved sanitation"". The World Health Organization has warned typhoid has acquired a ""crazy amount"" of antibiotic resistance and the world is ""reaching the limit"" of current treatments.  With rapid urbanisation in the developing world, the most effective preventative measure - clean water and flushing toilets - is unachievable for many countries.  And while there are two typhoid vaccines already available, neither is licensed for children under the age of two, so the most vulnerable people are unprotected.  Pakistan has an outbreak of what is called extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever. ""Right now in Pakistan, a strain of typhoid has developed resistance to all but one of the antibiotics we use to treat the disease, threatening to take us back to the days when typhoid killed as many as one-fifth of the people that contracted it,"" Dr Seth Berkley, chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, told BBC News. It started in Hyderbad, in Sindh province, in November 2016 and more than 10,000 people have been infected. Gavi is now paying for nine million children to be vaccinated and Sindh province will now become the first region in the world to add the vaccine to routine childhood immunisations. Dr Berkley said: ""This vaccine is a game-changer in the battle against typhoid, it also couldn't have arrived at a better time.  ""This vaccine should play a key role in bringing this dangerous outbreak under control and, once introduced into more countries' routine immunisation programmes, reducing the terrible toll wrought by typhoid worldwide."" Prof Pollard added: ""It is really exciting to have a new intervention, in a very rapid space of time, that can not only prevent the disease but help in the fight against anti-microbial resistance.""

risk appetite,Who are the billionaire Issa brothers?,2024-09-15,2020-10-02,By Noor Nanji & Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54343391,"Two UK billionaire brothers - who made their money in petrol stations - have struck a £600m deal to expand their fuel forecourt empire. Zuber and Mohsin Issa's EG Group, which owns Britain's third largest supermarket, Asda, agreed to buy the Co-op's 129-strong petrol forecourt business. The latest acquisition, however, has been seen as a move to expand Asda's presence in smaller, convenience grocery stores, following the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's.  The Issas have experience in retail. Their empire includes more than 6,300 convenience, retail and petrol forecourts, mainly in Europe and the US. The Blackburn-based brothers have been on a buying spree recently, which culminated in them snapping up Asda and fast food chain Leon.  They recently narrowly missed out on buying the struggling convenience store chain McColl's, losing out to Asda rival Morrisons. There were also reports they had their eye on a takeover of pharmacy chain Boots, before US pharmacy giant Walgreens dropped plans to sell the chain, saying buyers were unable to raise enough funds due to instability in financial markets. So who are the Issas and what are their plans for the UK High Street? The Issa brothers founded EG Group (initially called Euro Garages) in 2001, expanding it from a single petrol station in Bury, Greater Manchester. The business grew rapidly as the major oil companies sold off or closed their High Street petrol stations to concentrate on production and refining. The Issas were quick to spot an opportunity to add more retailing to their petrol stations. Motorists are now being offered a huge range of services when they stop by for fuel, from coffee to fast food to groceries. EG Group employs more than 53,000 people, almost 20,000 of them in the UK. In March, the firm said it planned to create nearly 23,000 more jobs in the UK over five years. The brothers own half of the group, with the remainder owned by TDR Capital, a private equity firm. According to their latest results, EG Group revenue for the year to December 2021 rose by 23.5% to $26.5bn (£21.1bn). The Sunday Times values the brothers' fortune at £4.73bn. They make donations through their own charitable foundation, which funds projects in the UK and abroad. The Issa brothers have snapped up a number of well-known High Street brands in recent years. In 2020, it was announced they had won the battle to buy Asda from US supermarket giant Walmart, in a deal valuing the UK grocer at £6.8bn. It meant Asda returned to majority UK ownership for the first time in two decades. The brothers were both  awarded CBEs after the news. Last year, the Issa brothers bought the British fast food chain, Leon. The deal, worth up to £100m, includes 42 company-owned restaurants, as well as 29 franchise sites which are mainly found in airports and train stations across the UK and a handful of European countries such as the Netherlands and Spain. ""It has been a buying spree,"" says Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst. ""The Issa brothers have a clear appetite for risk and the access to finance to drive that,"" he added. ""If you look at Asda and Leon, it's clear they are making acquisitions in complementary and adjacent market places, so what they're doing is synergistic."" Despite their rapid rise in the business world, the brothers don't always get what they want.  In 2020, their efforts to take over Caffè Nero fell through, with the coffee shop chain dismissing the bid as ""opportunistic"". And in May, Morrisons clinched a last ditch deal to buy the convenience store chain McColl's, beating EG Group to the prize. But Mr Hyman says he expects to see further acquisitions from the Issa brothers, as the economic outlook darkens. ""We are about to go into a recession, the market is tightening, and it's already oversupplied with players,"" he said. ""So what we're going to see is a lot of casualties and that will present opportunities along the way."" The brothers have experienced controversy in the past. Questions were raised about EG Group's governance after its auditor, Deloitte, suddenly quit in October 2020 and was replaced by KPMG. EG Group said the auditor had signed a ""clean audit"" for EG Group's 2019 financial accounts and there had been ""no disagreements on any auditing or accounting matters"". In December 2020, a BBC investigation found a company once co-owned by the Issa brothers was fined for ""appalling"" safety breaches. One worker at the Lancashire packaging firm Europlast (Blackburn) lost a finger in a bubble wrap machine in 2012. Mohsin and Zuber Issa were co-owners and directors of the company at the time, according to filings at Companies House. Another worker lost four fingers in 2015, weeks after the brothers resigned as directors. It is understood the brothers haven't been involved with Europlast since 2015, didn't have operational roles and have not been shareholders in Europlast for many years. A representative of Mohsin and Zuber Issa declined to comment. The Issas also faced questions in their home town when they bought eight homes, demolished them and began building five mansions, raising the ire of neighbours, the Lancashire Telegraph has reported. The brothers are said to be quite publicity-shy, with industry insiders saying they like to keep a low profile. This might change though, Mr Hyman says, as they continue to snap up well-known brands which raise their profile. ""They like to keep their heads below the parapet, but they might not be able to continue that way, especially the way they're going,"" he says."

A report has said the murders could not have been prevented, external under the current system in England, Wales and Scotland. One proposal is that GPs be told if a licence is granted, external so they can inform police of any mental health issues.  Bird killed 12 people, including his twin brother David, in a shooting rampage across West Cumbria on 2 June, before turning his gun on himself. The independent review was conducted by Assistant Chief Constable Adrian Whiting, of Dorset Police, the Association of Chief Police Officer's (Acpo) lead on firearms licensing. The government said the UK's ""tough"" firearms laws were always under review and would be tightened further if necessary.  Giving her reaction, the daughter of one of Bird's victims has said guns should not be kept in homes. The Acpo review concluded that Cumbria Police acted correctly in granting and renewing firearms certificates to Derrick Bird. He was first granted a shotgun certificate in 1974, aged 16. His most recent certificate renewal was in 2005 and it was due for renewal on 18 November this year. Bird shot 23 people in West Cumbria in June ACC Whiting's report said the force and other relevant agencies had no information prior to the shooting rampage which showed the gunman should reasonably have had his certificates revoked and guns seized. He said: ""The arrangements for firearm, shotgun and explosive certification in Cumbria are robust and the people involved have the appropriate knowledge, skills and experience. ""There were no reasonable opportunities for the licensing system to have been the instrument of intervention to prevent the appalling offences subsequently committed."" He said the circumstances of the case did not give rise to any immediately obvious changes to Cumbria police or the law that could have prevented the shootings.  But in the second part of his report, ACC Whiting did go on to make a series of recommendations. Under the Whiting proposals, family members would be formally asked if an applicant was suitable to own a gun.  Other recommendations included banning people from owning guns if they had received a suspended prison term, which is currently not the case. In 1990, Bird was convicted of two counts of theft and one of handling stolen goods and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.  Had the sentence not been suspended he would have become a ""prohibited person"" for five years under the Firearms Act 1968 and would have had to reapply for his shotgun certificate. ACC Whiting also said the law needed to be clarified around the use of firearms for the humane despatch of animals and pest control after what he described as a ""significant"" increase in handguns held for such purposes. The Chief Constable of Cumbria Constabulary Craig Mackey - who ordered the inquiry in the wake of the shootings  - supported ACC Whiting's proposals, saying they were ""trying to close and limit the opportunities for individuals who are unsuitable to get access to lawfully held firearms"". Parts of Cumbria were sealed off and people hid indoors during the shootings Crime Prevention Minister James Brokenshire said the government would consider the recommendations carefully. ""We have some of the toughest firearms laws in the world. We keep them under review and we are prepared to tighten them further, if necessary. All options are open for discussion,"" he said. But Jude Talbot, the daughter of Michael Pike, shot dead by Bird as he took his morning cycle in Seascale, said while she grew up around shotguns in rural Cumbria, there was no place for them in homes.  She told MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which is reviewing firearm controls: ""We should not have guns kept in a dwelling. I see no reason why they can't be kept in a gun club. ""I don't think we should be keeping things that kill and maim in a residential area."" Exceptions could be made for farmers to lock their guns away in an outhouse, she suggested.  The British Association for Shooting and Conservation (Basc) welcomed the report. This video can not be played Chief Constable Craig Mackey says he is assured that the licensing system 'worked' Director of firearms Bill Harriman said: ""UK gun owners go through an extremely rigorous licensing process to ensure as far as possible that they pose no risk to public safety and keep their firearms secure.  ""Sadly, you cannot legislate for the moment when a switch flicks in someone's head."" Another review, of how Cumbria dealt with the shootings from an operational perspective, is currently being undertaken by Assistant Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, of West Mercia Police. An inquest into the deaths of Bird and his 12 victims is then due to be held.

risk appetite,G8 fails to agree on no-fly zone,2024-09-15,2011-03-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12747875,"The German foreign minister warned of a risk of being 'sucked into a war' G8 foreign ministers meeting in Paris have warned Libyan leader Col Gaddafi he could face ""dire consequences"" but have failed to agree to a no-fly zone. Germany and Russia were said to oppose British and French plans aimed at halting the advance of Col Gaddafi's forces against rebels in the East. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle warned of a risk of being ""sucked into a war in North Africa"". France said it expected a UN resolution backing the rebels this week.  Reports from the UN in New York said a text was being drafted by British, French, Lebanese, US and German diplomats and was due to be circulated among the 15 members of the Security Council. In their final communique, the group of eight world powers warned the Libyan leader to ""respect the legitimate claim of the Libyan people to fundamental rights, freedom of expression, and a representative form of government"". This video can not be played Watch: William Hague says that there is ""a common appetite to increase the pressure on the Gaddafi regime"" At the weekend, the Arab League backed calls for a no-fly zone although French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe accepted that efforts at the G8 had failed to achieve broad agreement.  The US and Russia are both known to want more details of any proposed flight restrictions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Arab League had not ""formalised"" its decision to back a no-fly zone on Saturday, adding that it had stated in the same declaration that it was ""categorically opposed to any foreign intervention, particularly military intervention, in Libyan affairs"".  Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said the proposal would not be sufficient to bring the violence to an end. Mr Juppe did not say what the focus of a UN resolution would be but British Foreign Secretary William Hague said there was a ""common appetite"" for further discussion at the UN and a general agreement of the need for an urgent response. French attempts to push for a no-fly zone have met with a derisive response from Muammar Gaddafi who has given a 40-minute interview with German TV in which he singled out President Nicolas Sarkozy for criticism. ""He is my friend but I think he has gone mad. He is suffering from a psychological illness,"" he told RTL journalist Antonia Rados. Col Gaddafi added that he no longer trusted the West, apart from Germany. ""We are going to invest in Russia, India and China now. That's where our money is going to be invested,"" he said.

risk appetite,Ancient plant pills offer insight,2024-09-15,2011-04-28,Jane O'Brien,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-13190376,"This video can not be played Alain Touwaide looks at some of the ancient texts he has used in his research DNA extracted from 2,000-year-old plants recovered from an Italian shipwreck could offer scientists the key to new medicines.  Carrots, parsley and wild onions were among the samples preserved in clay pills on board the merchant trading vessel that sank around 120 BC. It's believed the plants were used by doctors to treat intestinal disorders among the ship's crew.  Such remedies are described in ancient Greek texts, but this is the first time the medicines themselves have been discovered. ""Medicinal plants have been identified before, but not a compound medicine, so this is really something new,"" says Alain Touwaide, director of the Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions, which has the world's largest digital database of medical manuscripts.  Prof Touwaide is working with scientists at the Smithsonian's Natural History Museum, who carried out the DNA analysis. They discovered traces of carrot, parsley, alfalfa, celery, wild onion, radish, yarrow and hibiscus contained in the ancient pills.  The pills, which researchers believe were diluted with vinegar or water to make them easier to ingest, were preserved inside tin boxes and were the size of coins. ""I was always wondering if the texts were only theoretical notions without practical application,"" he says. ""Now we know they were applied."" In May, Prof Touwaide's conclusions, based on the DNA findings and his own study of medicinal texts, will be formally presented to an international gathering of archaeologists, historians of medicines and other experts in Rome.  ""What is remarkable is that we have written evidence [from the ancient Greeks] of what plants were used for which disorders,"" says Alisa Machalek, a science writer for the National Institutes of Health, one of the world's leading research centres.  Researchers have studied ancient texts with descriptions of the plants contained inside the pills ""This research is interesting, especially for medical historians, because it confirms that what we eat affects our bodies."" Prof Touwaide hopes his research will help to develop modern treatments.  ""We extract the information from these texts so that scientists can see if they can make shortcuts to pharmacological discoveries,"" he says.  ""We re-purpose ancient medical information and jump from the past to the future."" For instance, the Roman statesman Cato recommended eating broccoli to stay healthy and Prof Touwaide has found references to the Greek physician Galen using it in the 2nd Century AD to treat intestinal cancer.  Prof Touwaide says modern research is now under way to isolate a compound found in broccoli that may be a source for the treatment of cancer today. ""This is a huge field in chemistry and pharmaceutical science,"" says Ms Machalek. ""Native Americans chewed on willow bark to relieve pain - now we pop open a bottle and chew on aspirin which contains similar compounds. Taxol, a cancer medicine, is derived from the bark of the Pacific Yew."" To understand the significance of the plants contained in the 2,000-year-old pills, Prof Touwaide studied a number of medical works, including the Hippocratic Collection.  The collection is one of the earliest sets of Greek writings still in existence and is attributed to Hippocrates, considered to be the founder of Western medicine.  He cross-referenced those findings with other works, such as the Encyclopaedia of Natural Substances, written in the 1st Century AD by Dioscorides. The dark spots above are microscopic plant fragments found embedded in clay on board the wrecked ship Dioscorides noted that ""the large onion is sharper than the round onion. All onions are pungent and apt to cause flatulence. They stimulate the appetite. They are thirst making. They cleanse the bowel."" ""They are good for opening outlets for various secretions as well as haemorrhoids, and they are used as suppositories, pilled and dipped in olive oil,"" Dioscorides wrote. A significant percentage of commercial medicines are derived from natural sources, but the active compound has been isolated, concentrated, standardised and packaged into measured doses. The shift toward synthetic chemical medicines occurred in the 20th Century, but according to Mark Blumenthal, the founder and executive director of the American Botanical Council, there is renewed interest in the medicinal benefits of natural foods - including those found in the pills. ""A lot of ancient plants have modern functions,"" he says.   ""There's a lot of marketing going on for so-called functional foods - foods with high levels of antioxidants, for improving the cardiovascular system or reducing the risk of cancer. ""Hibiscus tea is growing in popularity and research shows that it lowers blood pressure. Garlic and to some degree onions, continue to have cardiovascular benefits and reduce the build-up of plaque."" But Prof Touwaide says the traditional cures based on plants and minerals are in danger of being forgotten.  He says part of the problem is that too few people now study classical Greek, Latin or Arabic and there are not enough experts to interpret the original texts.  Prof Touwaide is proficient in 12 languages and has spent years collecting his library of 15,000 books on plants and their uses.  He believes such ancient knowledge should become protected by Unesco as part of the world's heritage.

risk appetite,How will coronavirus change the way we live?,2024-09-15,2020-04-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-52356136,"A return to how life was at the start of 2020 is some way off. Even when lockdown restrictions are eased, coronavirus will affect our lives in many ways. What will struggle to get back to how it was before, and what might change for ever? Twelve BBC correspondents offer their thoughts. From Zooming clients to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups, digital platforms have become the only way for many of us to work, get fit or be educated and entertained.  We're more relaxed about screen time hours for us and our kids, a huge culture shift from just a few weeks ago. It feels unlikely that'll disappear overnight. We now know the infrastructure can cope, on the whole. There have been wobbles, like Monday's Virgin Media outage, but broadband providers and mobile phone networks have handled the big surge in traffic.  In March, BT said it was ""well within manageable limits"", and it is still intending to roll out ultrafast full-fibre broadband to 227 rural communities across the UK in coming months.  Going forward, with lines between home and work blurred like never before, we'll need to think carefully about which platforms we use and what we say on them.  Still, video conferencing, once the poor relation to face-to-face meetings in the corporate world, is - for the moment - the norm. Remember that meme: ""This meeting could have been an email""? Perhaps it's finally within reach. Retail was already having a tough time. The lockdown and its ripple effects will speed up the huge structural changes under way in our High Streets. It's now all about survival of the fittest. Businesses in good financial health, and able to give customers what they want, will prosper. But weaker players - already grappling with falling sales, rising costs and intense competition - will fall by the wayside during the next 18 months.  But there's also a more immediate question. How many outlets will reopen at all? Some small firms may simply run out of cash and throw in the towel. Some larger retailers are also in administration. Many others will be looking at the profitability of stores and whether they could hand the keys back to landlords. After lockdown, there'll be an immediate sales bounce and stores are likely to lower prices to shift stock. But it may be short-lived if people have been made redundant and are unable to spend.  Fashion relies heavily on shoppers with spare cash and many of us will have endured the past weeks buying hardly any clothes at all - and survived!  It will be interesting to see if shoppers rethink their habits and priorities.  Covid-19 is the greatest shock to business for a century.  Emergency measures forced on reluctant companies will form part of future thinking. Questions such as ""do we need large city office space with staff relying on crowded public transport?"" will be asked. Home-working could make the rush hour history, which might then affect property values in satellite ""commuter towns"".  Staff will also demand more from employers in terms of flexibility, facilities and safety at work.  Companies may start hoarding cash to survive another crisis. Just as the banks became permanently less profitable after the 2007-08 financial crash - because they were forced to hold more base capital before lending - firms post-Covid-19 could be less inclined to invest. That will stifle growth. The digital transformation of business will get faster, with more automation and artificial intelligence to approve loans, profile customers, control stock and improve delivery.  Supply chains will be shorter, more resilient and possibly more local - but there are pluses and minuses to that. Economic nationalism, when governments try to protect their economies by cutting imports and investments from other nations, is popular right now - but some warn it results in a selfish and damaging ""beggar thy neighbour"" approach. Finally, international institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization and the European Union may be challenged to up their games - or go away.  We all hope for a return to business as usual. It's not going to happen. Some airlines might not survive this crisis. Others could perish in the aftermath. And those that come through it will be smaller.  There will be, at least in the medium term, fewer flights. That trend will be driven by people and businesses having less money to spend and video conferencing becoming the new norm.  Initially, there may also be nervousness about flying in the wake of a global pandemic. Thermal imaging cameras, which check your temperature as you walk through, could become commonplace at airports and even railway stations to try to reassure passengers and staff. A smaller aviation market means ticket prices could rise. After weeks of staying at home many of us will be itching to travel, but global travel by plane, train or boat might have to change. For example, EasyJet says it plans to initially leave middle seats empty so passengers aren't too close to each other - and tickets for a plane with lots of empty seats will be more expensive. The number of people on trains, tubes and trams is likely to be lower than at pre-crisis levels, as some work will continue to be done at home. The daily commute isn't great for social distancing and rail bosses are working out how to manage things when the government eases restrictions.  Independent and green modes of transport such as cycling and, once legalised, electric scooters should become more popular - although some commuters might jump in the car. The school day normally has its own rhythm and routine punctuated by lessons, bells and breaks. Now more than 90% of the planet's children are out of classes, according to United Nations agency Unesco. The disruption will ripple for years.  Teaching has moved online, with digital lessons on a scale never seen - highlighting concerns that digital poverty is locking children out of learning. Even in a major economy such as the UK, a significant minority don't have ready access to a device of their own, which they can use for schoolwork.  Ofcom estimates that 59% of 12 to 15-year-olds have their own tablet, while 83%  have a smartphone. However, some disadvantaged teenagers in England will be able to borrow laptops to help them study at home, thanks to help from the Department for Education. This temporary solution may need to become long term though, which is one legacy of this pandemic.  UK universities face other challenges. They're globally connected and have successfully marketed the value of a British degree around the world.  Mainland China alone is used to sending 120,000 students to the UK each year. That number will fall, as will numbers from other countries. The appetite to study far from family will not be as strong as it once was.  Research by the University and College Union suggests the combination of an immediate drop in international students this year, and UK students deciding to delay or not enrol at all, could cost universities £2.5bn and lead to 30,000 job losses. Sweet air and tranquil roads - in the grimmest of circumstances, the coronavirus lockdown offers a sense of how a greener world might feel. Levels of the gas nitrogen dioxide, linked to a wide range of health conditions, fell across parts of China and Europe as traffic flows diminished. And the rise of online meetings has shown what can be achieved without travel and has saved lots of carbon in the process. What happens next though is open to question. One scenario is that the world repeats the fossil fuel frenzy that followed the banking crisis, unleashing pent-up demand for oil and coal. Governments know this response well as a method to revive flagging economies. Another option is for a more sustainable recovery, with policies to encourage a low-carbon future. This would see determined pushes for renewable energy, public transport and home energy efficiency. It was meant to be a big year to try to halt the damage we're doing to the natural world and to cut the gases driving up temperatures to dangerous levels. That agenda, and the tough choices needed, might not be getting much attention - but they have not gone away.  In fact, the pandemic has shown us how governments can act when they need to - and how willingly people can respond. The issue is whether a similar drive can be directed to what the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres calls the ""deeper emergency"" of the environment. Legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly famously said: ""Some people believe football is a matter of life and death... it is much, much more important than that."" He was joking, of course, but now, more than ever, football's relevance has been put into perspective.  However, sport is a serious pleasure for many. It supports an industry employing hundreds of thousands and has been affected like never before.  Events have fallen like dominoes. Some, like the Olympics, have been postponed, while others, like Wimbledon, have been cancelled completely. Training schedules have been ripped up and staff furloughed. Players are taking wage cuts and broadcasters are warning of lost earnings in the hundreds of millions. In future, social distancing will be a massive headache for sporting governing bodies. How can close contact physical sports, like rugby, continue? Even playing behind closed doors presents a myriad of problems. An English Premier League football season without a champion was once unthinkable, but now the campaign hangs in the balance. Even if sport can return this year, the global recession likely to follow will surely affect business for years, especially in areas like transfer fees, wages, broadcast deals and prize money. For millions of fans, weekends are now very different. Moments of unbelievable effort and sporting talent often ripple through the nation, providing collective ""did you see it?"" experiences. The future of sport, without those moments and the fans to watch, looks very different indeed.   The arts sector is split 50-50 about the post-pandemic future, between the optimists and the pessimists.  The upbeat half think the UK arts scene will come back stronger than ever, providing an eager population with longed-for shared experiences and feel-good content.  Cinemas, theatres, concert halls, museums and galleries will thrive on a flowering of creativity, a response to the dark days of the virus. Plus, there will be new converts who discovered all that splendid free arts content made available online during lockdown. The pessimists fear grassroots venues - historical suppliers of fresh talent - will perish in a new era of austerity budgets. Local councils will sell off artworks, and thousands of jobs will be lost. A sector once known for dynamism and imagination will become conservative and risk-averse. I suspect the reality will settle somewhere between the two. The post-lockdown transition from closed to bustling venues won't be straightforward. Social distancing is likely to limit activity. Producers will need time to rehearse and finish productions. There'll also be size limits on film and TV crews making new content. Reruns could be a staple for a while. But let's not forget the UK's creative industries have long been strong economic driving forces. They are world renowned and full of talented individuals. It's going to be tough, but I'd back the arts and entertainment sector to not only keep us amused and intellectually sustained, but also to lead from the front. It's generally accepted the experience of living through the 1930s depression and World War Two shaped the so-called Greatest Generation - a cohort of Britons noted for resilience, prudence, humility, work ethic and sense of duty. They are qualities people see in the Queen and in 100-year-old Captain Tom Moore, who marched up and down his garden for the NHS.  It's hoped the Thursday night clapping for key workers is the sound of a nation discovering itself again and, denied the luxury of self-indulgence, our eyes are opened to what really matters. Lockdown, it is said, has unblocked a spring of neighbourliness that will flow long after restrictions are lifted.  Perhaps. But our suspended life in lockdown could be incubating a grievance that, when released, triggers angry questions, a search for blame, and demands for reprisals. Economic hardship will strain social ties. That's the real test for this generation - not ""can we keep our temper in lockdown?"" but ""can we quietly repair our social fabric in the tough times?"". The fear is that our behavioural norms will have become infected by distress and hardship, that we will emerge more individual and less together.   The hope must be that our society, like a virus, is mutating into something stronger. ""This pandemic has shone a spotlight on the overlooked and undervalued corners of society."" The words of the director of the World Health Organization in Europe, Dr Hans Kluge, as he described the shocking death toll in care homes across the continent.  His sentiment will chime with many who have constantly warned about the looming care crisis in the UK, particularly in England. An ageing population, years of underfunding, low pay, staff shortages and the failure of successive governments to reform the system, has left the sector on its knees.  Many staff looking after older and disabled people - in care homes and in the community - will say they felt forgotten when the pandemic first took hold. The focus on the NHS was not surprising, but they were caring for those particularly vulnerable to the virus. The struggle to get protective equipment, and slowness of testing in the community in England, have become symbols of their distress. Questions will be asked about the apparent failure to prioritise support to the care front-line, and what it may have cost in lives.  Then, we'll have a choice to make. Do we recognise, value and fund a properly integrated system that provides support in the community? Or, as our memories become hazy, will we again allow the importance of this type of care to fade into the background? Even before Covid-19 claimed its first victim, the US-China trade war was threatening the progress of globalisation. International supply chains bring perks - more choice, lower prices and, for some, higher incomes - but also job losses in the higher-wage West.  This pandemic has exposed other vulnerabilities.  There's the reliance on three countries - the US, China and Germany - to provide 40% of personal protective gear, and also businesses' dependency on single sources for vital components. There'll be a rethink of what products are ""strategic"", key to a nation's survival. They might be produced closer to home or alternative suppliers sought. But key to a recovery will be job creation and keeping down living costs. The former means that, however uneasy, governments may have to tolerate China's continued investment around the globe.  As for the latter, businesses need to keep costs low, and overseas sourcing of non-essential will continue. Some of the biggest brands, including H&M, have committed to helping workers in factories thousands of miles away to keep supply chains functioning.  Those companies were already looking beyond China to lower cost nations such as Vietnam, Ethiopia and Bangladesh - countries which will work even harder to attract foreign customers.  China's factories are firing back up, but who's buying? Currently, demand from locked-down customers has slumped. Trade could drop by a third this year. But it will bounce back, globalisation will continue - and the competition to be the world's production line will intensify. Catastrophe inevitably produces new priorities, even if old geo-political tensions remain. The pandemic has demonstrated, yet again, that global questions require global solutions.  But it has also shown that governments' first responses have been national. China and the US have squared up to each other over Beijing's responsibility for the pandemic, nations have closed borders, and there has been unseemly competition for medical resources. Multinational organisations have fared poorly. The EU apologised to Italy for its limited support and President Trump attacked the World Health Organization for being too close to Beijing. Those who see these building blocks of global order as outdated have more ammunition. Beijing's position is contradictory. It's the source of the virus and the global provider of much of the equipment to fight it, so expect the ""China problem"" to be a focus for Western governments. How do they rely less on Chinese goods and resist Beijing's efforts to get the world to play by its rules - while still pursuing co-operation on problems like climate change and, yes, future pandemics? There'll be a lot less money in defence budgets for shiny new weaponry - with security being redefined because of the extraordinary weaknesses revealed by the pandemic. National security capability will be judged by stockpiled medical equipment and preparedness for the next pandemic or environmental catastrophe, not just on how many tank brigades can be deployed. "
risk appetite,The under-18s who get to pick the next PM,2024-09-15,2022-08-20,By Joshua Nevett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62585183,"By-elections rarely pique the nation's interest in the way one did in the sleepy market town of Bridgwater in Somerset. The poll in 1970 marked the first time teenagers were allowed to participate in a UK election after the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18. The Conservative candidate, future Cabinet minister Tom King, won in a victory partially attributed to the youth vote, with the party's then leader taunting Labour as out of touch. These days teenagers routinely vote in elections of all kinds, including the Conservative ballot to pick who will succeed Boris Johnson as the next party leader and prime minister. Except that, unlike in UK general elections, children as young as 15 can take part - the age at which they are eligible to join the Conservative Party and enjoy full voting rights. The question of whether they should be able to do this - given that they would not be able to vote in a general election - is ""a tricky one"", says 17-year-old Tory member Aryan Ramkumar. In step with the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto, Aryan said he did not support extending voting rights to 16 and 17-year-olds in general elections. While he cast his ballot in favour of Rishi Sunak for the Tory leadership, ""I don't necessarily think we should be allowed to vote"", Aryan said. ""It's important for people aged 16 and above to give their opinion and bring a fresh perspective,"" he said. But the fate of the country, he reasoned, should not be up to under-18s who did not pay taxes, have mortgages or - in most cases - support families. Aryan, who is from London but goes to a boarding school elsewhere in England, said while he had ""always had this sort of right-wing ideology"", he became more engaged with Conservatives politics after Brexit. Galvanised by the UK's departure from the EU, he joined the party and the Young Conservative Network last year and has since been involved in campaigning. Among fellow young Tory members, the leadership contest has been a hot topic of debate. He has been making the case for Mr Sunak, who was ""someone of integrity"", whereas his rival Liz Truss ""has this utopian fantasy economy in mind"". Although, he added, not all under-18 members ""have the full idea of what's happening"". That view appears to be widely held within the ranks of the Young Conservative Network, which has hundreds of members. One of them is 16-year-old James Hawkes, who first became interested in politics in the build-up to the 2019 general election, before he joined the Conservatives earlier this year. Ms Truss got his vote because ""she's got better policies"" than Mr Sunak and has ""shown better ability to be prime minister, especially on the world stage"", he said. A student of politics and economics from Stockton-on-Tees, James believed there was a big difference between voting in Tory leadership ballots and general elections. ""If you're a Tory member under 18, you are paying to be there and will almost certainly have the political knowledge,"" he said. But there was a risk of ""undue influence if you don't have the political knowledge"", he added, claiming the majority of under-18s did not. Politically informed or not, teenagers are unlikely to have a decisive impact on the leadership contest any way, as research suggests the overwhelming majority of Tory members are aged over 45. Even so, the party's political opponents detect a whiff of double standards. No Young Conservatives in favour of giving votes to under-18s were available for comment, but Young Labour activist Hasan Patel, 19, was. He said giving 16-year-olds a vote in the Tory leadership ballot but not in general elections ""shows quite a lot of hypocrisy"" from the Conservative Party. Consider, Hasan said, the enfranchisement of 16 and 17-year-olds in Scotland and Wales, where under-18s can vote in local elections and elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd. Figures show that, as of December last year, there were 77,600 young people aged 16 or 17 registered to vote at Scottish Parliament and local elections, 1.8% of the total electorate. This was an increase of 4,300 (5.9%) on the previous year. For the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, the franchise was expanded to 16 and 17-year-olds for the first time in the UK. Almost 110,000 registered to vote and 75% of those who spoke to the Electoral Commission claimed to have done so. Importantly, the commission said in a report, 97% of those 16 and 17-year-olds ""said that they would vote again in future elections and referendums"". Research on elections in Austria, the first European country to lower the voting age to 16, has shown evidence of youth motivation to participate in the democratic process as well. These findings highlight ""there is an appetite for young people to get engaged in the political system"", Hasan said. And it is crucial they do, he said, because ""the younger you are the longer decisions politicians make are going to impact you"". Being able to shape those decisions is what organisations such as Young Labour and its Liberal Democrat counterpart have long been campaigning for. ""It's ridiculous that at 16 and 17 you can work, serve in the armed forces, or even start a family, but can't have a say on who runs the country - unless you are a member of the Conservative Party,"" the chairwoman of Young Liberals, Eleanor Kelly, said. The Liberal Democrats, she said, ""proudly support votes at 16, and will continue to fight to make the voices of young people heard"". These kinds of arguments hold no sway over Blake Cooper though. A 16-year-old from Warrington, Blake said he used to support Labour but switched to the Tories ""once I started reading more"". Brexit ignited his interest in politics and eventually he gravitated towards the Conservative Party. Still, neither Mr Sunak nor Mr Truss have impressed him so far, and he was considering spoiling his ballot as a result. ""I don't like how both of them claim to be northerners,"" Blake said. He was similarly indifferent about his right to vote for the next prime minister, saying: ""I'd be fine if they took the vote away from me."" Countering the arguments of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, Blake said under-18s ""don't necessarily have to vote to have an impact"". ""They can also shape the future in other ways."" "
risk appetite,California burglar bear Hank the Tank captured,2024-09-15,2023-08-07,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66429736,"A massive and notoriously mischievous black bear has been captured after more than a year on the run following a string of break-ins in California.  The 500lbs (227kg) bear, known to fans as Hank the Tank, is believed to have broken into 21 homes in the Lake Tahoe area since 2022.  Hank - who is actually a female bear registered as 64F - will be moved to a sanctuary in Colorado.  Her three cubs may be transferred to a facility in California's Sonoma County.  In a statement released on Friday, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) said that biologists had ""safely immobilised"" the bear, who had been linked to 21 break-ins by DNA evidence.  Pending a successful health check, Hank will be taken to the Wild Animal Sanctuary near Springfield, Colorado.  While California authorities have noted that relocation is ""not typically an option"", Hank's fame has given her a reprieve.  ""Given the widespread interest in this bear, and the significant risk of a serious incident involving the bear, CDFW is employing an alternative solution to safeguard the bear family as well as the people in the South Lake Tahoe community,"" the statement said.  Hank's three cubs will be taken to a different facility in Petaluma, California ""in hopes they can discontinue the negative behaviours they learned from the sow and can be returned to the wild"".  On the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, Colorado Governor Jared Polis welcomed Hank - and joked that she should have been named ""Henrietta the Tank"".  Hank was originally believed to have been responsible for over 40 break-ins, but DNA samples proved that the break-ins were also the work of at least two other large bears with a voracious appetite for human food.  The discovery that Hank was not alone in the crime spree prompted California officials to reassure the public that ""no bears will be euthanised, harmed, relocated to some facility or placed in a zoo"".  Biologists believe that Hank, who is considerably larger than most black bears, had grown unafraid of humans and had learned to use her strength to force her way into people's homes.  ""When you have a bear forcibly crashing its way through a garage door or ripping open a front door with people inside, that's pretty brazen and unusual,"" CDFW spokesperson Peter Tira told the BBC in February 2022.  The whereabouts and potential fate of the other two bears involved in the spree of California break-ins is unclear.  The BBC has reached out to CDFW for comment. "
risk appetite,School closed after pupil diagnosed with typhoid,2024-09-15,2020-03-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-51803224,"A Coventry school has closed after a pupil was diagnosed with typhoid. Whitmore Park Primary School was closed on Monday to complete a ""deep clean"" which began at the weekend. It is expected to reopen on Tuesday.  Head teacher Jacqueline McGibney said the school was working with Public Health England (PHE) ""who have advised us that the risk to children is low"". PHE said the child's infection was travel-related and an associated pupil was being tested.  Ms McGibney said the school in Halford Lane had been keeping parents informed.  ""We have a well-managed cleaning regime which follows the advice of the [city] council's environmental health team,"" she added. PHE said the infection was believed to be travel-related and the child has been receiving antibiotics and was ""feeling much improved"". A small number of close contacts have been asked for blood and stool samples, for lab testing, it added. Angela Cartwright, from PHE West Midlands Health Protection Team, said: ""The risk to other children at the school is low, but as a precaution, we are testing a small number of close contacts.  ""If typhoid fever is left untreated, symptoms will worsen over time, and there is a risk of developing serious complications - so it's important for people with symptoms to contact their GP or call NHS111."" Typhoid fever is caused by highly contagious Salmonella Typhi bacteria and spread through contaminated food and water.  It is most common in countries with poor sanitation and a lack of clean water. Symptoms include: It causes fatal complications, such as internal bleeding, in one in 100 people.

risk appetite,NI mumps cases 700% rise down to vaccine cycle,2024-09-15,2020-02-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51548281,"A 700% rise in cases of mumps in Northern Ireland is partly due to the vaccine becoming less effective over time, the Public Health Agency has said.  There were 534 confirmed cases last year, compared to just 67 in 2018. Dr Jillian Johnson said the majority of the cases were people aged 15-24 who have had two doses of the MMR vaccine. She said there is a rise in cases every two to three years as the mumps strand of the vaccine becomes less effective. Dr Johnston said people who have had the MMR get a milder form of mumps. Children are offered the MMR vaccine at 12 months and three years of age. ""We expect to see a rise in mumps activity every two to three years and that's what we're seeing at the moment,"" Dr Johnston said. ""We know that the mumps component of the vaccine decreases and becomes less effective over time. ""So every two or three years the number of people who are susceptible to getting mumps increases and that's what's happening."" Dr Johnston said people who have not been vaccinated can suffer from serious complications from the virus, including swelling of the brain and meningitis. She said of the 2019 cases, 23% had not had two doses of the MMR vaccine. There have been 79 cases of mumps so far in 2020. Dr Johnston said the figures show ""a bit of a seasonal fluctuation"". ""We would expect to see that trajectory and increase for the first six months of this year, then for the second half of the year we would expect to see a decline. ""We would like them to be lower and that's why we want people to make sure they have had two doses of MMR."" It has been revealed that cases of mumps in England reached their highest level in a decade. Outbreaks in universities and colleges raised the number of cases of the painful viral illness to 5,042 in 2019 - four times the number in 2018. Teenagers and young adults who have not had two doses of the MMR vaccine are deemed ""particularly vulnerable"". There were also increases in mumps cases in Wales and Scotland in 2019. Dr Johnston said people could check if they have had two doses of the vaccine through their GP and that it was particularly important for people travelling to universities to do so.  She that the increase in Northern Ireland was not as severe as in England because there has traditionally been a better uptake of vaccinations and NI was not as badly affected by a scare over MMR that hit England in the 1990s. ""In the scare in the '90s there was a small effect from that, but it wasn't as marked as in England,"" she said. ""Now we're lucky, because whilst we're seeing the mumps activity higher this year, it's not as high as what England is experiencing because they were affected by the scare more than we were in Northern Ireland."" It is a viral infection that used to be very common in children before the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1988. A classic sign is puffy cheeks under the ears. Mumps is contagious and spread through infected droplets of saliva breathed in through the mouth or nose.  Most people usually recover without treatment. But in rare cases, there can be serious complications, such as inflammation of the testicles in males, meningitis and deafness. Source: NHS UK The part of the triple vaccine that specifically protects against mumps is not quite as effective as the elements protecting against measles and rubella. However, getting the jab is still crucial - because the more people who are protected, the less likely mumps will be shared around. During outbreaks among students, which are common, completely unvaccinated people are at highest risk. Even if you get the illness after being vaccinated, you are likely to have a less serious form of it and fewer complications. Cases of mumps consistently outnumber measles and rubella cases every year. Teenagers and young adults in colleges and universities are now the ones who tend to be affected - for several reasons. Many of the 2019 cases were born in the late 1990s and early 2000s and missed out on the MMR vaccine when they were children. Research by a disgraced UK doctor, Dr Andrew Wakefield, falsely linking the vaccine to autism undoubtedly had an impact on uptake. Current students may also be too old to have been immunised or offered the MMR, or may only have had one dose of the vaccine and thus not be fully protected. It is also possible the vaccine's protection against mumps may have worn off."
risk appetite,Director Campion on her thrilling Hollywood comeback,2024-09-15,2022-03-06,By Emma Saunders,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60562041,"When Oscar-winning filmmaker Jane Campion signed up to adapt Thomas Savage's 1967 novel The Power of the Dog, she deliberately sought out a female cinematographer to work alongside. Specifically Ari Wegner, a name you're going to be hearing a lot more often from now on.  It may be 2022, but the combination of both a female director and a female director of photography is still a rare occurrence in Hollywood. The pair combined to create an unsettling and menacing western which tackles toxic masculinity and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as complicated, malevolent cowboy Phil, who forms an unlikely friendship with a younger man, Pete (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The film is leading the pack at this year's Academy Awards with 12 nominations, including best picture, best director and best cinematography - Wegner could be the first woman to win the latter. For many, that female recognition is cause for celebration after the so-called ""male gaze"" has dominated Hollywood for so long. But is there such thing as ""the female gaze"" and if so, what does that bring to a traditionally male genre like a western? Campion, who is now the first woman to be nominated for two best director Oscars, isn't sure.  ""It's so hard to know how much to believe in the female gaze or the male gaze,"" she tells the BBC. ""I think, to me, it's really the artist's gaze, bringing your sensitivity to the story. [But] I really wanted to have a woman cinematographer on this film, because there's so many other men and I really like to support women."" Wegner, who previously worked with Campion on a commercial, told the BBC's culture editor Katie Razzall: ""There probably is a gender element to it, but it's also just what interests you, what your upbringing is, what you notice.  ""And I think maybe Jane and I are similar in that way, really fascinated by subtle kinds of energy between people and what's not being said."" Campion says it's thanks to the film's ""feminist"" producer Roger Frappier that she got on board with the project in the first place after a meeting in Cannes. ""It's very lucky that he really trusted me with this story, which you would think is a book for the kind of big-guy type of person that would handle ranch material - even though I do ride horses, and my parents did have cattle on the farm (Campion grew up in New Zealand). ""I was grateful to him for believing in me. And I was grateful to Savage's book, which is kind of subversive... when you think about most western genre movies, they're really a kind of celebration of masculinity in one way or another... and often a romanticised version of what a man is. ""In Savage's hands, he ripped through it really, and showed us a very true and different version."" His version is one Campion and Cumberbatch have faithfully brought to life on screen through the latter's swaggering, snarling and insidious presence.  The film also stars real-life couple Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst as Phil's brother and his wife Rose, who is also Pete's mother. The film is Campion's first in more than a decade and has been largely well received by critics, with The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw describing it as ""one of Campion's best"" and Empire's Beth Webb noting that while the ""narrative here feels somewhat underdeveloped... Campion remains a master of sensory storytelling"". The Netflix film is another feather in the streaming giant's cap, but Cumberbatch recently told Vanity Fair he wished the film had enjoyed a longer cinema release (it had a finite two-week run before it headed exclusively to Netflix). Campion concurs. ""I'd have loved it to have been out in the cinema for longer but that wasn't the plan that Netflix had. However, I would have to say that we wouldn't have made the film at all without Netflix. They were the only people that were willing to pay what this film cost to make and they are incredibly supportive."" She adds that Netflix are now putting the film out in cinemas again ""because of the 12 nominations that we got and you know, the general interest in it and people wanting to see it on a big screen"". Campion also points out that streaming brings the film - which is essentially an arthouse one - to a bigger and wider audience, making it more accessible.  And she's delighted with the attention it's getting, including the awards buzz. ""I'm kind of thrilled. I feel like I've had kind of a comeback. I do feel really quite moved. People in the Academy have voted for so many categories."" She also understands it has greater significance for women in the industry as a whole after the shocking revelations about the abuse of women in Hollywood including the Harvey Weinstein scandal. ""I really feel that the MeToo movement changed everything. I think it was a very dark time in the late 90s. And up to about 2015. It was almost as if nobody was hearing the fact there was such a depth of inequality.  ""And when those brave ladies shared their stories... everybody woke up and went: 'It's really been impossible, and it's incredibly unequal, and we're not going to have it.'  ""It's just not OK to have so little representation of women in film and TV. I think women are doing so well. It's no longer charitable to be employing women. And that's the big change. We want to be recognised because we are really good!"" Wegner is also blazing a trail on the awards circuit. As well as the Oscar nomination, she is the first woman ever to receive a Bafta nod for best cinematography. ""I think the visibility really matters because everyone's the harshest critic of their own work, but it is something very meaningful to be recognised by your peers,"" she told Razzall. The Australian says she was ""so naïve"" when she first decided to go into her field. ""I had no idea that it was not a job that women usually did. It wasn't really until later in film school that I heard this term female cinematographer. And it slowly dawned on me that there were very few but... it was too late. I'd already decided [my career]."" The most recent annual Celluloid Ceiling report found that women comprised 21% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers working on the top 100 grossing films in 2020, up from 20% in 2019. Women also make up 50% of movie-goers. Campion says: ""We just have to keep going this way. It can never go back to what it was. It was a really dark time when people didn't want to see what women thought or made films about but now there's a real appetite amongst audiences, men and women.  ""Netflix are actively seeking to keep their ratio of material made by women up. It's acts like that that make a real difference.  ""And hiring Ari for an ambitious film like this one. Is that a risk? Well, I don't think it was a risk. She's really talented. All she needed was people that believe in her and to give her that opportunity, supporting her to make sure she does succeed. And she did succeed. Brilliantly."""
risk appetite,Gove: People will make up their own mind on Cummings,2024-09-15,2020-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52803224,"People will make up their own minds after listening to Dominic Cummings' ""exhaustive"" account of his travels during the lockdown, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said.  The prime minister's chief aide has defended driving 260 miles in March from his home to County Durham.  He said he acted reasonably and legally in going to stay on his parents' farm.  His statement on Monday overshadowed the PM's new plans to reopen all non-essential shops in England on 15 June. Boris Johnson said shops will be able to open if they meet safety guidelines. They follow outdoor markets and car showrooms, which will be allowed to reopen from 1 June. Retailers have generally welcomed the announcement but some experts said more clarity was needed on how shops should keep staff and customers safe.  Mr Cummings has faced calls to resign after it emerged he had driven his child and ill wife from London to County Durham during lockdown. At his news conference in the garden of 10 Downing Street on Monday afternoon, he said he did not regret his actions. On the subject of why he then drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed symptoms - Mr Cummings said he was testing his eyesight to see if he could make the trip back down to London. He explained that he had experienced some eyesight problems during his illness. Following the conference, several government ministers rallied in support of Mr Cummings, with many writing on Twitter that it was ""time to move on"". Mr Gove said Mr Cummings' account of his actions was ""exhaustive, detailed and verifiable"". ""People will make their own mind up as they listened to Dominic's account,"" he told BBC Breakfast.  ""Most people will understand he was under pressure, and sought to put the health of his wife and son first, and took care to ensure they as a family unit were not in danger of infecting other people."" Opposition MPs are due to meet later to discuss how to hold Boris Johnson and his senior aide to account.  Labour has criticised Mr Cummings for failing to apologise for his actions, while other parties continue to call for him to be sacked. Dominic Cummings' rose garden confessional was a bold move designed to take the drama out of a crisis. But giving detailed answers to why he at the very least broke the spirit of the lockdown rules does not answer the fundamental question now - is his continued presence in Downing Street more of a hindrance than a help to Boris Johnson? Tempers may have cooled slightly on the Conservative backbenches, but there are still calls for him to go, both private and public. And some senior Conservative MPs are still aghast at how much political capital the prime minister has burned through to keep Mr Cummings at his side. Opposition leaders still intend to push for his departure. The man respected by Mr Johnson for judging the public mood has made himself famous for falling foul of that opinion. His explanations may ease for some of the anger. But in Westminster and beyond, it will not disappear overnight. And when the prime minister is interrogated by senior MPs on Wednesday his decisions over Dominic Cummings will surely be on the list. Read more from Laura. Boris Johnson said he regretted the ""confusion and anger"" caused by the row, but continued to back Mr Cummings.  Meanwhile, all shops in England will be allowed to reopen from 15 June provided they meet new social distancing and hygiene measures to protect customers and staff from the virus. Mr Johnson said the change would depend on premises being ""Covid-secure"" and on the country making progress towards meeting the five tests set out by the government as being crucial to lifting the lockdown restrictions. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of the retail consultancy Savvy, said some smaller retailers would want ""more clarity"" from safety guidelines, on things like how many people can be in a store at one time.  She also questioned whether there would be the appetite from the public to return to shops.  ""Shopping is a social, fun experience a lot of the time and social distancing takes that away. It's going to be a very different way of shopping from what we're used to,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  Schools in England have also been told to prepare for a phased reopening from the beginning of June, beginning with pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6.  On June 15, up to a quarter of Year 10 and Year 12 will be allowed ""some contact"" to help prepare for exams. However, the prime minister acknowledged some schools would not be ready to open then. Latest government figures show the number of people to die with coronavirus in the UK rose by 121 to 36,914 on Monday. In other developments:"
risk appetite,Is football's racism battle being lost?,2024-09-15,2021-02-01,Dan Roan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55892185,"Manchester United and Sheffield United players kneeling before their recent Premier League game at Old Trafford - Manchester United pair Axel Tuanzebe and Antony Martial received racist abuse following the match When it comes to online racist abuse, football appears to have had enough. Again.  Last week's series of incidents provoked a wave of condemnation from across the game and beyond.  And yet, this comes almost two years after top stars took part in a campaign called '#Enough', a 24-hour social media boycott in protest at a similar spate of abuse. Now the same demands for tech platforms to do more are being made. So is the battle being lost? Why is it proving so difficult to tackle this issue? And where is this crisis heading? Duke of Cambridge calls for racist abuse of footballers to stop Chelsea 'disgusted' after Reece James racially abused on social media Arrest over racist abuse of West Brom player Sawyers Racist abuse sent to Manchester United pair Tuanzebe and Martial The pressure on the social media platforms is intensifying. The appetite for more regulation is growing.  Last week the Premier League said the tech companies ""need to do more"", calling for ""swifter removal of offensive messages and improved identification and banning of offenders"". Manchester United, with three of their squad subject to vile messages, urged the creation of verifiable and identifiable accounts so offenders could be caught, saying they and the players were ""sick of it"", making the point that no one should face such hate-filled abuse in their place of work. The Duke of Cambridge, who is also the president of the Football Association, wants social media companies to take more responsibility The Duke of Cambridge, who is also the president of the Football Association, has praised those who have spoken out and called for an end to the ""despicable"" abuse. Writing on Twitter, Prince William also cited the need for social media companies to raise their game. ""We all have a responsibility to create an environment where such abuse is not tolerated, and those who choose to spread hate and division are held accountable for their actions. That responsibility extends to the platforms where so much of this activity now takes place,"" he said. The Professional Footballers' Association, which represents players, has asked the tech giants to prevent users from being able to send explicitly racist terms and emojis. ""While racist abuse is allowed to continue on each platform, we can only conclude that this is a choice by the companies running the social networks,"" it said. Putting such criticism to the platforms is no easy task. We asked for an interview with Twitter on this subject back in 2019. We are still waiting for one. Our request last week for an interview with Facebook - the owner of Instagram - was met with a short statement saying: ""There is no place for racism on Instagram and we are committed to removing it when we find it. We know there is more to do and we will continue to work closely with clubs, players and football authorities to investigate instances of discrimination and collectively tackle this issue."" Twitter too issued a statement: ""Racist behaviour has no place on our service and when we identify accounts that violate any of the Twitter Rules, we take enforcement action. ""We have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our valued partners in football to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour - both online and offline."" This video can not be played 'Social media companies not vigilant enough' - Wright and Jenas react after Rashford is subject of racist abuse The government meanwhile has vowed to press on with plans for ""groundbreaking"" new online harms legislation later this year to make tech companies legally responsible for the online safety of their users, and make them accountable to a regulator - Ofcom, external - over abusive content. Racist messages would need to be removed ""without delay"". The proposals include the threat of massive fines of up to 10% of global turnover if the companies fail to meet their obligations, and there could even be criminal sanctions for senior executives.  Behind the scenes, I am told that while football authorities were encouraged by the recent meeting that Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden hosted with players to discuss online abuse, there is concern at how long it is taking to introduce new laws considered long overdue, and fears they may be watered down if the hugely powerful, US-based tech companies have their way and threaten to invest elsewhere.   But according to Kick It Out, external chief executive Sanjay Bhandari, the legislation - along with the promise of more regulation in the US from President Joe Biden - are grounds for optimism.  ""The cavalry is on the way,"" the head of the anti-discrimination body told the BBC. ""That's the hope on the horizon, but that may not come quickly enough so there's things we need social media to do right now. The behavioural, cultural problems will take longer to solve. It's the technology problem we can do more quickly and all of the answers sit with Twitter and Facebook. Technology has been massively unregulated for 25 years and its time we closed that loophole."" Marcus Rashford played in Manchester United's 0-0 draw at Arsenal on Saturday Some at the Premier League - which launched a dedicated, 'rapid-response' reporting system for players last year - say the social media platforms have improved in recent years, but not enough. There has been success with the removal of posts but officials want more effort to assist the authorities to find perpetrators so they can be banned by clubs (if they are a fan) or even prosecuted. While there have been some successful prosecutions - an Irish teenager is due to be sentenced on Wednesday for sending racist abuse to former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright - these are few and far between when the sheer scale of the abuse is considered.  One insider said league officials felt hampered by what they called impregnable and unresponsive tech companies using privacy, freedom of speech and the sheer weight of traffic as reasons for not handing over information that would help identify offenders. The fear is that the police - without the resources to pursue every possible crime - only intervene in the most serious cases, and abusers know they face little risk of sanctions. Court orders need to be obtained to force the platform to co-operate, evidence has to be gathered, and often offenders are overseas in different jurisdictions.  Another challenge is persuading players to take legal action, which can often seem a daunting prospect. A man was arrested following alleged racial abuse of West Bromwich Albion midfielder Romaine Sawyers While admitting there is ""more to do"", Facebook does point to the fact that it is working with Kick It Out on a fans' education and reporting initiative, and has built tools designed to prevent unwanted contact on Instagram. It has also tripled the size of its safety team to 35,000 people, claiming it proactively took action on tens of million of pieces of hate speech last year. But considering the vast wealth of these companies, many believe more should be invested. The tech companies argue that tackling this problem is not as straightforward as many assume. They have other areas of concern that must also be monitored across their vast, unregulated platforms; from suspected terrorism and paedophilia to the spread of misinformation.  Simply blocking certain discriminatory words or emojis from being used in the first place is problematic, because these can also be used in a non-offensive context, and across global platforms can have different meanings in different communities or territories. The companies can block devices for repeat offenders, but that person can then just use a different device. Many are now calling for an end to the anonymity that provides a shield to many abusers with a mandatory verification process that means users must give passport details for instance before opening an account. Given the mistrust over social media platforms' use of personal data however, there are fears that this could pose a threat to activists, whistleblowers and persecuted minorities who need to protect their identity online. Many also point out that in recent years, racially offensive comments have been published on social media by fully verified accounts.  Axel Tuanzebe (left) and Anthony Martial (centre) received racist abuse after featuring in a Manchester United defeat There are also those who believe that the time has come for football's authorities and clubs to invest more, and take the burden of reporting away from the players.  ""The problem is that the systems that they've got in place require a player to receive and then report the abuse themselves, and by that point the damage has already been done,"" according to Jonathan Hirshler, the CEO of Signify, a data science company that uses artificial intelligence to uncover the identities of abusers. ""The technology is there, using AI and open source data, to unmask vile and prolific abusers.  ""It's also important that football moves from reactive to proactive, to pick up abuse before the players have to, and package evidence in a way that the social platforms and authorities have little choice but to act on. So we need a new approach, working constructively with the platforms, to ensure that abusers have nowhere to hide."" There is no time to waste. During just the final six weeks of last season, a joint PFA and Signify study identified more than 3,000 explicitly abusive messages aimed at Premier League players, 56% of which were racist. Of the players surveyed, 43% said they had experienced targeted racist abuse.  Football has become a lightning-rod for a wider, societal issue. The scale of the challenge facing the sport is significant, and seems to be getting worse. Finding a solution however, is proving far from simple."
risk appetite,"Have I got Covid, a bad cold or something else?",2024-09-15,2020-09-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54145299,"As the latest version of the Omicron variant continues to spread quickly, the official list of Covid symptoms has been expanded in England - but not yet in the rest of the UK.  The updated guidance now lists nine extra symptoms, including a sore throat, muscle pains and diarrhoea, but many of these are similar to cold and flu symptoms. So how can you tell if you've got Covid, a bad cold or something else? The new list of Covid symptoms has been expanded from the original three: It now includes nine other symptoms which are common signs of other respiratory infections too:  It's not possible to tell if you have Covid-19, flu or another respiratory infection based on symptoms alone, official advice says. But spotting these symptoms can help to reduce the spread to other more vulnerable people. If you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to go to work or school, you're advised to stay at home. This was one of the three key Covid symptoms identified during the first two years of the pandemic but it appears to be much less common with Omicron infections. The most common five symptoms experienced by people with positive Covid tests recently are runny nose (83%), fatigue (71%), sore throat (69%), headache (69%) and sneezing (68%), according to the ZOE Covid symptom app. A high temperature is 37.8C or above, and can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus.  If you don't have a thermometer, check if you - or the person you're worried about - feel hot to the touch on the chest or back.  A high temperature is unlikely with a cold.  If you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to carry out normal activities, you're advised to stay at home in England. You should avoid contact with other people, in particular those who are at high risk of becoming seriously unwell if they get Covid. People with symptoms are no longer advised to test for Covid in England, but if you do have a positive result, you should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days after the day you took your test.  Many people will no longer be infectious after five days but some may still be able to pass on the virus for up to 10 days. People with symptoms are still advised to take a PCR test in Scotland and Northern Ireland or a lateral flow test (LFT) in Wales. Anyone who tests positive in the three nations is asked to isolate.  When testing ends in Scotland, people who feel unwell will be advised to stay at home until they feel better. The advice is to try to keep your distance from people you live with, particularly those whose immune system is weaker than normal. You can also open windows in rooms for 10 minutes after someone with symptoms has left.  Cleaning frequently touched surfaces such as door handles and remote controls can protect people in your house from Covid and other viruses. If you can't stay at home while you feel unwell, you can reduce the chances of passing on the infection you have by:  For most people who've been vaccinated - and children, even if they haven't had a jab - Covid infections are usually mild, and typically last for up to a week.  But some groups are still at higher risk and need protecting from Covid and other respiratory infections, including:  Some very young children who were born prematurely or who have heart conditions are also at risk from RSV, another respiratory virus. Most people can be treated for Covid at home, as with any other mild respiratory illness. You should get plenty of rest and drink water to keep hydrated. You can take paracetamol to relieve headaches and muscle aches or pains, but antibiotics won't work against viral infections like Covid.  If you're having trouble breathing, contact your doctor, or use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online. If you're very worried about sudden shortness of breath, call 999. The NHS also advises: "
risk appetite,Coronavirus front-line NHS staff 'at risk of PTSD',2024-09-15,2020-04-12,By Charlie Haynes,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52258217,"NHS staff on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic could develop anxiety, burnout, or post-traumatic stress disorder, the BBC has been told. Psychological first aid should be provided as the UK runs the risk of a ""future mental health crisis"", the British Psychological Society said. Ministers say NHS staff can call a helpline if they are feeling stressed. But MPs say this is not enough and that the government should provide extra support to those feeling overwhelmed. The cross-party group says any support should be extended to all front-line staff such as care home staff, mortuary workers and cleaners.  In a letter, MPs call for management in front-line organisations to put in place preventative measures like regular breaks, encouraging people to look after themselves and to tell people that it is ""OK to not be OK"". The MPs and British Psychological Society also say professional help from psychologists and therapists needs to be easily accessible - so trauma can be dealt with early. Front-line staff in the coronavirus crisis are routinely exposed to things the general population would never encounter - loss of patients, illness of colleagues, high levels of stress and increased exposure to Covid-19. Trauma can leave some with insomnia, feeling disorientated, with a sense of guilt or even physical symptoms like shaking, headache, loss of appetite and aches and pains.  Some people could see a deterioration of their mental health or develop anxiety or PTSD.  ""We are running the risk of a future mental health crisis and a generation of burnt-out health workers,"" said Kathryn Scott, director of policy at the British Psychological Society. ""If we act now with a plan focused on prevention and leadership we can minimise the impact of trauma on responders to Covid-19."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ''We share the concerns that this epidemic poses challenges to the mental health and wellbeing of all our health and care workers."" The spokesperson said NHS England had partnered with Headspace, UnMind and Big Health to offer ""free-to-use mental health apps for both NHS and care staff"". A £5m grant was also available for mental health charities to fund additional services for people who are struggling, the spokesperson said. Dr Andrew Molodynski, a consultant psychiatrist and mental health lead for the British Medical Association, said: ""Health workers are used to seeing death, but we aren't used to seeing lots and lots of people die when we can't do anything about it.  ""That will cause a lot of symptoms of anxiety, depression and trauma. ""I'm already seeing that in my hospital - staff are anxious and some are already off work because of the impact that has had on their mental health."" The all-party group of MPs has asked the government to encourage the NHS and care organisations to treat their staff with compassion, and signpost ways to get help.  The MPs also call for a focus on psychological first aid, developed for use in disasters like hurricanes or wildfires in the US.  It sees people at risk encouraged to seek help and support one another with stress before it becomes a serious permanent problem.   SNP MP Lisa Cameron, who wrote the letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, said protecting the mental health of staff was ""essential"" - just like providing adequate protective equipment. Ms Cameron added: ""If we fail to act now, front-line staff and communities will be living with the psychological consequences of coronavirus for decades to come."" Thousands of people in the UK have died after being diagnoses with coronavirus, including nurses, doctors, surgeons and other NHS staff."
risk appetite,'Sarri leaving with reputation intact',2024-09-15,2019-06-14,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48452006,"Maurizio Sarri (left) is set to return to Italy with Juventus after one season at Chelsea Maurizio Sarri's imminent departure from Chelsea comes as no surprise despite winning the Europa League - yet the maverick, unloved Italian can leave with his reputation enhanced. Sarri shaped Chelsea's superb 4-1 win over Arsenal in Baku, returned them to the Champions League after finishing third in the Premier League behind two magnificent teams in Manchester City and Liverpool, and only lost the Carabao Cup final to Pep Guardiola's City on penalties. And yet the 60-year-old Italian, still regarded as one of the coaching elite in his homeland, never looked like he would be in position to build on a season that would have most clubs talking instant contract extensions rather than divorce. Sarri, significantly, showed as much appetite to stay at Chelsea as they did to retain him. He could now say, with some justification, he was underappreciated. Indeed, the former banker can look back on his single season in west London with pride after that outstanding second-half display in Azerbaijan overpowered Arsenal to win his first serious silverware. And it was not just in the European context that Sarri, who succeeded compatriot Antonio Conte in July 2018, deserves great credit. It would have taken some manager to guide a team anywhere near Manchester City and Liverpool this season - as it will next season. Sarri's departure will have some questioning why the two parties did not make more strenuous efforts to extend their relationship - and yet the counter argument is that this is the inevitable end to what often appeared a loveless sporting marriage. Strange as it may seem, a very large majority of Chelsea fans will not mourn his exit. Sarri leaves Chelsea with a healthy win percentage of 63.49% Sarri was, in many ways, the anti-Conte. His predecessor left Chelsea amid rancour, his high-maintenance, full-on approach bringing a Premier League title and an FA Cup in two campaigns at Stamford Bridge as his relationship with the club's top brass fractured beyond repair. Conte was sharp-suited and slick. Sarri was the superstitious chain-smoker, who wore a tracksuit at all times and sated his craving for nicotine by chewing on a cigarette butt during matches. He left Napoli without a trophy but with an attractive and high-quality team, arriving at Chelsea with high praise from stellar figures such as Guardiola. The appointment was regarded as coup. And yet, after a start of rich promise, trouble descended. Supporters did not take to 'Sarri-ball'; the mockery and abuse directed towards the manager became impossible to ignore, particularly during their FA Cup fifth-round home defeat by Manchester United in February. That came less than three weeks after a 4-0 Premier League loss at Bournemouth, and a mere eight days after a 6-0 humiliation at Manchester City. Six days after the Blues went out of the FA Cup, there was more embarrassment; keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, apparently injured as a penalty shootout loomed, produced an astounding act of insubordination by refusing to be substituted during the EFL Cup final at Wembley. It seemed impossible that Sarri would survive. The lack of immediate alternatives, and a very good performance in defeat by Manchester City at Wembley, gave the manager breathing space to deliver a season that he will regard as well within his remit at Chelsea. This is a club where trophy targets are not necessarily set - but where the manager is expected to be in contention for major silverware and the Champions League places at the season's end. Sarri achieved both, putting a big European prize in the Stamford Bridge trophy cabinet. Chelsea agree deal for Sarri to join Juventus Chelsea managers under Abramovich Manager Dates Games Win % Trophies Maurizio Sarri Appointed 14 July 2018 63 63.49 Europa League Antonio Conte 1 July 2016 - 13 July 2018 106 66.04 Premier League, FA Cup Guus Hiddink (interim) 21 Dec 2015 - 30 June 2016 27 37.04 Jose Mourinho 1 July 2013 - 17 Dec 2015 136 58.82 Premier League, League Cup Rafael Benitez (interim) 22 Nov 2012 - 26 May 2013 48 58.33 Europa League Roberto di Matteo 13 June 2012 - 21 Nov 2012 21 52.38 Roberto di Matteo (interim) 4 Mar 2012 - 12 June 2012 21 66.67 Champions League, FA Cup Andre Villas-Boas 1 June 2011 - 4 Mar 2012 40 50.00 Carlo Ancelotti 1 June 2009 - 22 May 2012 109 62.39 Premier League, FA Cup Guus Hiddink (interim) 11 Feb 2009 - 30 June 2009 22 72.73 FA Cup Luis Felipe Scolari 1 July 2008 - 09 Feb 2009 36 55.56 Avram Grant 20 Sep 2007 - 24 May 2008 54 66.67 Jose Mourinho 1 June 2004 - 20 Sep 2007 184 67.39 Premier League (2), FA Cup, League Cup (2) Claudio Ranieri 18 Sep 2000 - 30 June 2004 190 52.63 So why is this decision to leave and return to Italy with Juventus no great surprise? Sarri guided Chelsea to a finish above Tottenham and won the Europa League so impressively, making Arsenal look distinctly second rate in the process. Yet his lack of connection with the players, as well as his tactical vagaries, meant his brief stay seemed so joyless for all parties. Conte was a player of the highest class with a track record of success with Juve and Inter, so his word was law. Sarri's background was in banking with no playing record or history of major trophies to fall back on. This may have contributed to a season in which his authority never appeared to be fully stamped on Chelsea's squad. Sarri was also stubborn to the point of pig-headedness in some moments, especially with his removal of N'Golo Kante, widely accepted as the best holding midfielder in world football, to a role marginalised on the right to accommodate favoured son Jorginho, who followed him from Napoli in a £50m deal. During the lows of February, Sarri's like-for-like substitutions - his habit of replacing Mateo Kovacic with Ross Barkley (or vice-versa) - became the subject of derision among Chelsea fans. When Barkley came on for Kovacic during that FA Cup defeat by Manchester United, the moved was greeted with very audible ironic laughter from the stands, before Stamford Bridge echoed to chants of ""you don't know what you're doing"". In his defence, Jorginho did improve as the season progressed but was rarely an upgrade on Kante, while Sarri's reluctance to use young England players Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi retreated as the season went on. He proved, belatedly, he could be flexible if not exactly revolutionary. Sarri never forged any sort of bond with Chelsea's fans, who regarded his signature style as tedious despite the flowing destruction of Unai Emery's Arsenal. His personality was a contrast to the combustible Conte and his wild celebrations. Perhaps because he was steeped in finance rather than the football to which he arrived late, Sarri seemed spectacularly unconcerned with how he was viewed either inside or outside Chelsea. He was even prepared to risk owner Roman Abramovich's wrath by complaining about the scheduling of an end-of-season charity game in Boston against New England Revolution. He was actually vindicated to an extent after Loftus-Cheek sustained a serious Achilles tendon injury in the match. Sarri is a singular man prepared to plough his own furrow, even if it is a lonely one. And yet, because the season ended with real success, there will always be a question of ""what might have been"" had Sarri stayed - although this will be a question that may not trouble Chelsea or their fans for too long. Sarri is leaving with his stock higher than when he arrived at Stamford Bridge."
risk appetite,BBC 'must do more to help older people',2024-09-15,2019-06-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48594434,"The government has said the BBC must ""do more to support older people"" after the announcement that most over-75s will no longer get free TV licences. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said he was ""very disappointed"" that the corporation had reached the decision. But Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said the government had ""breathtaking gall to blame the BBC for this mess"". The BBC said restricting free licences to over-75s who claim Pension Credit was ""the fairest and best outcome"". Around 3.7 million pensioners are expected to lose out on the entitlement when the change comes into force in June 2020. The decision comes four years after the government announced the BBC would take over the responsibility for providing free licences for over-75s by 2020 as part of the licence fee settlement. At the same time, the BBC was allowed to increase the licence fee and make it obligatory to have a TV licence to use iPlayer. On Tuesday, Mr Wright told the House of Commons that was ""a fair deal for the BBC"". Mr Wright also urged the corporation to ""use its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way"", which included showing ""restraint on salaries for senior staff"". He added: ""I firmly believe that the BBC can and should do more to support older people. And I'm now looking to them to make clear exactly how they will do that."" A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We've reached the fairest decision we can so we protect the poorest pensioners while ensuring everyone will continue to receive the best programmes and services that the BBC can provide."" Maintaining free TV licences for those pensioners was part of the Conservative Party manifesto at the 2017 general election. Conservative Party leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom called for a reversal of the plan, describing the decision as ""unacceptable"".  She said: ""It's a commitment in the Conservatives' manifesto and we need to find a way to reverse that."" Her leadership rival Esther McVey said she was ""ashamed"" of the BBC, which had ""forgotten the public they are supposed to serve"". Labour deputy leader Tom Watson told the House of Commons that voters who read the manifesto pledge ""have been betrayed and it's shameful"". He continued: ""The government had the breathtaking gall to blame the BBC for this mess, but passing the buck won't work. ""The BBC is not the DWP [Department for Work and Pensions]. Public broadcasters should never be responsible for social policy."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""providing over-75s with free TV licences is not too much to ask"". Conservative MP Ed Vaizey, who was culture minister when the licence fee settlement was made, told MPs the government should ""either take back this policy or support the BBC changes"". He said: ""I was in the DCMS [Department for Culture, Media and Sport] when this policy was imposed on the BBC by the Treasury to meet its £12bn welfare target, a target which I doubt we have met and has long been forgotten."" He added: ""It [the government] shouldn't use weasel words that undermine the changes the BBC has brought about."" Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said that when the decision was taken to transfer responsibility for free TV licences to the BBC ""it was understood that this would be a possible outcome"". Under the new rules, only low-income households where one person receives the Pension Credit benefit will still be eligible for a free licence. Copying the current scheme was ""ultimately untenable"", the BBC spokesperson said. ""The scale of the current concession and its quickly rising cost would have meant profoundly damaging closures of major services that we know audiences - and older audiences in particular - love, use, and value every day."" Around 190,000 people took part in a public consultation and there was ""little public appetite"" for closing services, the BBC said. On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""very disappointed"" with the BBC's decision. More than 150,000 people have signed a petition set up by the Age UK charity, which is calling for the government to take back responsibility for funding free TV licences. BBC News put some questions to an official BBC spokesman, based on questions submitted on this website, on social media and via email to BBC News. Here is what they said. ""We've reduced the costs of senior managers by £38 million and our spend on talent pay is also coming down,"" the spokesman said. ""It's been well reported that some talent have taken pay cuts but in any event, it's simply not the case that senior talent and management pay cuts would make up anywhere near the difference. ""If we capped talent pay at £150,000 and got rid of every senior manager, that would only make up a fraction of the cost of continuing free licences for all over-75s."" The BBC spokesman responded that the corporation will work with support groups ""to make it as easy as possible"" to get a licence. That will include a new payment plan featuring smaller fortnightly or monthly instalments, with telephone and personal support. TV Licensing, which is responsible for collecting licence fees, ""does everything reasonable to avoid prosecution"", the spokesman said. ""This is simply not true. The government decided to stop paying for the free TV licences. Parliament gave the BBC responsibility to decide what should come next from June 2020 and to consult - and that's what we've done."" It was the biggest public consultation in the BBC's history, the spokesman added, with more than 190,000 responses received.

The paper says research carried out in the US found that four in 10 of those taking lorcaserin lost a significant amount of weight over the course of a year.   The Daily Mail says the tablets boost the brain cells that control appetite, which can become less effective with age.  The chairman of the National Obesity Forum, Tam Fry, tells the Times the study reaffirmed the belief, held by many obesity specialists, that a drug that will safely suppress appetite will be ""the holy grail in obesity medication"".   The Sun calls the discovery ""Slim-ply the best"". Pope Francis's plea for forgiveness in Dublin was ""powerful and emotional"", according to the Guardian.   The Times says his denunciation of abuse by priests was ""heartfelt"". Uber, meanwhile, is gearing up for a shift from cars to bikes, the taxi-app's chief executive tells the Financial Times. Dara Khosrowshahi says electric bicycles and scooters are better suited to inner-city travel.  He acknowledges Uber's drivers will feel the pinch from potential passengers choosing a bike but says they will benefit from a higher proportion of more lucrative, longer journeys and less congested roads.

The Daily Telegraph says the Conservative Party is at risk of a ""blue Momentum"" with a surge in new members, angry at Theresa May's Chequers deal, who are keen to vote her out in any leadership contest.  Finally, the Battle of Bosworth has started afresh, according to the Telegraph.  It reports on a bid to convert the battlefield in Leicestershire - which in 1485 witnessed the end of the War of the Roses - into a test track for driverless cars.

risk appetite,"Mum's fear for girl, 4, in hepatitis outbreak",2024-09-15,2022-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-61592056,"A Scottish mum feared her four-year-old daughter could need a liver transplant after catching hepatitis.  Madison Duffy is one of almost 200 children in the UK currently being treated for the illness, amid a surge of cases around the world.   It has led to a number of children needing transplants but experts are not certain what has caused the outbreak.   ""They don't know why it's is happening and where it's coming from. It's frightening,"" mum Chloe Benham said. Hepatitis is a catch-all term to describe inflammation of the liver tissue.  Ms Benham told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that Madison fell ill last week, and they noticed her urine was particularly dark.  ""That is not normal so we took her to the doctor who did a urine test and then ordered blood tests,"" she said. ""Her liver enzymes were measuring over 1,000 when it should only be in the 50s, so we got sent to hospital for more blood tests."" At that point Madison, from Wishaw, Lanarkshire, was found to have hepatitis.  She developed classic symptoms - jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes - while in hospital.  ""It was scary because I didn't know what it was,"" said Chloe, ""When I Googled it there were a lot of horror stories like kids needing liver transplants. ""Medics have had to do screening and other tests to make sure there is nothing else causing it. They don't know why this outbreak is happening and where it is coming from. It is frightening."" Madison is now recovering well and is due to attend the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow for follow-up treatment.  Her mum believes she will be in hospital for several weeks and will also need to undergo blood tests and screening for the rest of her life. She has no idea how she contracted the illness. The most common symptoms of hepatitis are jaundice and vomiting.  Other signs of the virus are dark urine, pale grey coloured stools, itchy skin, muscle and joint pains, tiredness, feeling sick, a high temperature, loss of appetite and stomach pain. Last month, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced the launch of an investigation into a hepatitis outbreak in children under 10. On 20 May, Public Health Scotland (PHS) confirmed 26 cases of hepatitis had been reported, taking the total number of UK cases to 197. Cases have been detected in 20 countries worldwide, with nearly 300 children affected, and one death. There is no evidence of any link to the Covid-19 vaccine. The majority of cases are in children aged under five years old, and are too young to have received the jab. The latest UKHSA technical briefing suggested it could be linked to adenovirus. Adenoviruses are commonly passed from person to person and by touching contaminated surfaces, as well as through the respiratory system. Dr Jim McMenamin, the head of health protection (infection services) at PHS said the current risk to children of severe hepatitis remained low. ""Our investigations increasingly suggest that there is a link to adenovirus infection,"" he said. ""Common infections, like adenovirus, can be prevented with good hand and respiratory hygiene, therefore, I would encourage parents and care-givers to supervise young children while they are washing their hands to ensure they do so properly. ""Public Health Scotland continues to work with NHS and public health colleagues across the UK to investigate other potential causes and we will issue further updates as the situation develops."" Chloe wants other parents to watch out for the symptoms. She said: ""If they have any symptoms, take them to the doctor and even mention the hepatitis outbreak so they know to test for it. ""It's vomiting, dark urine and jaundice. Madison didn't start taking jaundice until she was in the hospital, so we basically caught it at the start. ""It was so worrying but I am fine now I know she is on the mend."""
risk appetite,Investors mob Airbnb listing giving it $100bn value,2024-09-15,2020-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55250359,"Shares in holiday booking platform Airbnb have surged on their first day of public trade, giving the firm a valuation of more than $100bn. The massive listing - the biggest of the year in the US - raised $3.5bn (£2.6bn) for the firm. The firm said it would use the money to help it survive the pandemic, which has devastated travel. The flotation comes as investor appetite for tech firms has sent US markets soaring. Demand for Airbnb shares was so hot, prices in opening trade more than doubled from the $68 apiece fetched ahead of the listing. That figure was already more than the firm had initially targeted.  Chief executive Brian Chesky told the BBC the firm planned to use the unexpectedly large windfall to help navigate the crisis. ""We are still in a storm,"" he said. ""We don't know how long the storm is going to last so we hope for the best but we plan for the worst."" ""We're going to be very prudent and very thoughtful about our investment, especially in a world of a huge amount of uncertainty, which is clearly where we still are right now,"" he added. Airbnb bookings crashed this spring, forcing it to slash staff numbers by 25% and raise $2bn in emergency funds.   Last month, the firm said travel had returned somewhat over the summer, as people looked to escape locked down cities with long-term rentals within driving distance. The company reported a surprise profit for the July, August and September months. But the firm has warned that renewed lockdowns in many places will weigh on recovery. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the money Airbnb raised despite the turmoil was a sign of hope that the travel industry will rebound quickly. ""Investors are clearly looking to [Airbnb] for a company that is a long term disruptor but at the same time a short-term winner if and when people start to travel in greater numbers in 2021,"" he said. He added: ""You've also got very, very enthusiastic stock markets right now... Some people think they may be running a little bit too hot but we shall find out."" More companies have raised more money by floating on US exchanges this year than any year since 2014, according to Renaissance Capital, a Connecticut-based firm that offers investments focused on initial public offerings. In addition to Airbnb, US restaurant delivery company DoorDash raised $3.3bn just this week. The listing has cemented the billionaire status of the firm's three founders, who started the company as a home-sharing site in 2008.  Since then, it has grown into a global juggernaut, with more than four million people listing properties on the platform in countries around the world.  Last year, roughly 54 million people reserved stays through the company, which takes a cut of each booking and made roughly $4.8bn in revenue last year. ""When they launched they put a lot of pressure on hotel rates and I think they inspired consumers to really create their own travel experience,"" said Rebecca Crook, chief growth officer at UK-based digital product agency Somo. ""Because of that they became quite renowned in terms of disrupting what consumers really wanted and expected from travel brands."" Airbnb's growth has challenged hotel rivals and caused headaches for cities worried about an influx of tourists to new areas. Those complaints have subsided since the pandemic, but the threat of more regulation is still a ""major risk that Airbnb are going to have to tackle,"" Ms Crook said. The company has also lost money every year since its founding - with losses of roughly $696m in the first nine months of this year. As of September, bookings remained more than 20% lower than in September 2019. And the firm warned they could fall farther again as officials in some places re-imposed lockdowns. In Kenya, much of the tourist trade has dried up, said Karen Fraser, who hosts guests in a double decker bus in her garden. ""We're still getting our weekend bookings... but it's totally empty during the weeks,"" she said.  Prior to the pandemic, the business was doing so well she gave up her day job. She says she's hopeful the pandemic has created pent-up demand that will make next year better than ever.  ""We're all hoping for a bumper year,"" she said. ""Whether that happens or not, we'll have to wait and see."""
risk appetite,The Handmaid's Tale: Beyond the book,2024-09-15,2018-08-13,By Lucy Todd,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45096360,"*** Spoiler alert: this article contains some content about the plot points from The Handmaid's Tale. *** The second series of the Handmaid's Tale came to an end on Sunday night.  Writing in iNews, Mark Butler calls the finale ""a nail-biting conclusion to the season, with a controversial twist"", but Vanity Fair's Sonia Saraiya termed the climax ""a singularly frustrating end to a season that, despite its high points, often struggled to find its purpose"". The series went beyond Margaret Atwood's original novel - with her blessing - but how well did the show do in extending the novel beyond its intended lifecycle and how difficult is it to go beyond the book of an acclaimed author like Atwood? ""The novel ends quite ambiguously,"" says Julia Raeside, who has written The Guardian's episode-by-episode guide to series two of The Handmaid's Tale. Speaking to BBC News, she adds: ""It's really interesting when someone takes up the mantle of an unfinished story. If they've got something to say about what happens when you repress women for so long, then it's something I welcome.""  The second series has been criticised by some for its brutal scenes, with some viewers switching off entirely due to what's been termed by some as ""needless torture porn"". ""I think the first couple of episodes were slightly misjudged,"" says Raeside, ""and I wonder how much brutality Atwood really agreed with. ""But on the whole it's been a fascinating watch. Some of the detail and colour they've added has been brilliant - for example, details about the regime and how the rest of the world sees the Republic of Gilead. The episode when the commander and his wife go to Canada and are initially welcomed is a personal highlight."" The Independent's culture editor, Christopher Hooton, agrees that overall the second series is a triumph, saying ""it may be the best adaptation and extension of a novel to date"".  ""The shift to a modern day setting has made the horrors of Gilead seem all the more stark and urgent... whether it's the millennial characters having so recently been hopping carefree between bars in an Uber, or June convalescing during her escape by watching some Friends on an iPad."" He calls the move beyond the novel to the second season ""seamless"", and says ""the first half was for me even better than much of season one"".  ""The show's only real falter came with the season finale,"" he says, ""which felt more George Lucas than Margaret Atwood as June pulled her hood up and headed back into the fray. The drama felt forced for the first time."" Todd van der Werff - critic at large for Vox - says, however, that a number of flaws have already crept in. ""What will eventually burden the show is that you can see the wheels turning where they need to keep it going for the next season. Atwood showed a tiny window into this horrible world, but they are making it a much larger window. ""It's difficult to do this without it turning into misery porn. So then you have to introduce new lighter elements, which run the risk of being oversentimental and saccharine in their nature,"" van der Werff says. The boss of streaming service Hulu, Randy Freer, has commented that the show could go on for 10 series. But van der Werff says that would be quite a push: ""For season two, the writers were pretty clever at leaving themselves a few things from the novel that they didn't include in season one - like time June spends with her mother. But I struggle to think of any show that's good over ten seasons - especially a drama. ""I think the show is good independent of the current political situation - in the western world, we have this creeping tide of authoritarian ideas at the fringes of the political sphere - but I wonder how much appetite there would be for The Handmaid's Tale without the existence of Donald Trump as the president. I doubt it'd win as many as awards..."" Raeside, however, admits at this point she still has appetite for more: ""I'd like to see more of how the regime came to power, how it's run. The way they leave a series in Handmaid's Tale is unique and means you'll want to watch more. Is revolution on the way?"" Hooton says: ""I generally prefer shows to be economic in terms of number of seasons, but I think The Handmaid's Tale is a rare example where something longer could work. There are enough interesting facets to the show's universe to fill more seasons, although we may need to step into different characters' shoes for a while as The Wire did."" Taking a television show beyond its source material is not new - but has certainly become more ambitious in its nature, according to Raeside: ""Long form content has become the new thing. It's a new method of TV making which wasn't around 20 years ago. The TV industry didn't used to just pick up and run with a franchise no matter if it had any legs or not."" ""There was a bit more reverence in old-fashioned TV,"" she adds, ""where you wouldn't dream of making up new developments for a character because it wasn't your character. I think TV has become cheekier."" Guardian TV critic Sam Wollaston points out there is a lot of financial gain in long-term content: ""Television is all about series these days - studios are never going to give up on a massive audience like that."" Game of Thrones is an obvious example of where the television series has outpaced the author's source material to keep up with demand - and done with ""varying success"", according to van der Werff. By series six the show creators David Benioff and DB Weiss had already gone beyond George RR Martin's five novels. And despite being provided with a brief story arc by the author, van der Werff says the latter seasons consequently ""feel like they are jumping through plot points. It makes no sense geographically, and feels like they are rushing through to a final conclusion."" And Hooton thinks the trajectory of the show has been shaped by fans' expectations: ""The situation with Game of Thrones is interesting, the show having morphed from a sort of political one to an all-out war epic. I think this has more to do with the hype and expectation coming from viewers than adaptation, however.""  Television adaptations have a tricky balancing act between portraying a faithful depiction of the world in which they're set, and expanding them. And the success of a show ""entirely depends on who's doing the adaptation"", says Raeside. ""Someone like Steven Moffat does it really cleverly in Sherlock and canters off with the idea."" Wollaston agrees: ""Sherlock is so beyond the original novels - but there is a kind of spirit of him in the series. It's done really well because there are nods to Arthur Conan Doyle all over the place."" Other shows have done this less well, with van der Werff terming ""problematic"" The Walking Dead, which was originally based on a comic book series, ""because it became long and too much of a slog. The same stuff just kept happening."" And there is some debate over when exactly Netflix's House of Cards, which was based on a 1989 British novel of the same name, had jumped the shark - or outstayed its welcome. Wollaston says he ""entirely stopped"" watching the show for the past couple of series because it had become too preposterous.  ""With The Handmaid's Tale though, I think it's ok for it to have carried on because it's a world and a situation - and I think that works with other worlds, like Game of Thrones, which continue the idea. ""The Handmaid's Tale has never been more relevant and it still resonates,"" he adds. ""The fact that the handmaid outfit is still being used as a protest symbol kind of speaks for itself.""

risk appetite,'Chemo is highlight of my fortnight during lockdown',2024-09-15,2020-05-22,By Angie Brown,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-52764675,"Adrienne Chaplin says she has grown to enjoy going for her chemotherapy because it is the highlight of her fortnight since the lockdown restrictions began two months ago. The 70-year-old now looks forward to her hospital trips for the uncomfortable cancer treatment because it means she can see hospital staff and other patients. Shielding and living on her own in Edinburgh has meant Adrienne has been living in isolation away from friends and family. She said the lockdown had made her feel claustrophobic. ""I normally dread chemo but now I look forward to it because I get to go out and to see people,"" she said. ""It gets me out of the house and the feeling of imprisonment. ""I now enjoy going for chemo and it has become the highlight of my fortnight. ""I feel claustrophobic in this lockdown and miss my son, Ellis."" The grandmother-of-two, who is originally from London, has been receiving chemotherapy for her incurable bowel cancer. She said: ""The worst side-effects are the fatigue and the night sweats. ""I've had to change my pyjamas four times in a night before and it really is quite unpleasant. ""My finger nails are flaking and I've lost my hair. ""I've lost my appetite and lost two stone since December."" Adrienne said she had tests done last November when she suffered ""terrible stomach pains"". Tumours were found to be pressing on her bowel which was causing the pain. She said: ""I've got incurable cancer, which is a bit scary.  ""The worst thing about the chemo side effects are that I've been getting blurred vision, which I've been very worried about because I'm frightened I will go blind. ""I called the optician about it but he can't see me because of the lockdown. ""I hope the chemo comes to an end and that my eyesight improves."" Adrienne is hoping her chemotherapy shrinks the tumours enough to give her years not months left to live. She has been battling cancer for 20 years after first being diagnosed with breast cancer at 50. Years later she then found a slow growing cancer in the form of lumps under the skin on her chest and had to have radiotherapy on her sternum to help with the pain. She said: ""I've had a bumpy ride and a fair few knocks in my life but I'm finding chemo very hard under lockdown. ""The lockdown is lonely and isolating and other than going to the hospital I can't go out and even my carers can't come into my house."" Having lost all her hair including her eyebrows and eyelashes Adrienne said she found her change in appearance difficult.  She said: ""I've always been a chubby person but now I'm a thin little bald looking lady and I don't like looking in the mirror. ""When I'm brushing my teeth I try to look anywhere but the mirror, it's hard to take and it's even harder in lockdown. ""My son said I shouldn't worry because nobody can see me during lockdown.  ""I look forward to going to the hospital because I can see all the other bald patients and we can have a laugh about it and have been saying things like at least we don't have to worry about the hairdressers being closed during the lockdown. ""I know my risk goes up as soon as I step outside the door but I get to chat to the driver in the bus that takes me there and it helps to relieve the feeling of isolation and the feeling of being shut in."" She added that a weekly call from her Macmillan Cancer Support buddy Bob had also helped with the isolation. She said: ""Macmillan has been really good and supportive, which has been really important at this time."""
risk appetite,Murderer jailed for raping and assaulting women,2024-09-15,2023-05-22,By Dan Martin & PA news agency  ,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-65669813,"A murderer serving a life sentence for killing his partner has been jailed for a further 12 years for raping and assaulting two other women. Frank Farrell was convicted of five counts of rape and five of actual bodily harm between 2009 to 2015 after a trial at Leicester Crown Court. After the trial, it could be revealed Farrell was serving a minimum term of 24 years for murdering Smita Mistry in Leicester in March 2021. Farrell, 38, was sentenced on Monday. The trial heard he had been in a relationship with the women and was initially kind and attentive but he later became violent, particularly when they refused to have sex with him. The jury returned unanimous verdicts on all but one of the charges, with a single count of actual bodily harm having a 10-to-two majority. Farrell had refused to come up from his cells for the sentencing, prompting judge Mark Watson to remark he had ""treated these proceedings with contempt and lacks the courage, now, to face the sentence"". He added: ""This does not affect sentencing, and is only indicative of the complete lack of remorse he has shown - and his cowardice."" Warning - the below contains distressing content He said Farrell had treated each victim ""as his own possession"" to satisfy his ""substantial sexual appetite"", assaulting both women ""on a regular basis"" and exposing them to ""humiliating and degrading"" treatment. The judge added: ""Both women described promising and happy beginnings to the relationship with Farrell; he was helpful, considerate and attentive towards them and their families, something neither had recent experience of. ""But over time his demeanour changed, and he began to control their lifestyles."" The judge said Farrell was a ""significant risk"" to women, adding the jail terms had been ""substantially reduced to take account of the time he must serve on his current sentence"", but would be ""consecutive to the life sentence he is serving"". ""He is a serial offender against women with the capacity to assault and rape his partners at will,"" he said. One of the victims described how Farrell raped her multiple times, both when she was awake and asleep. The second victim described Farrell raping her, again while awake and asleep, and demanding sex, with her fearing she would be assaulted if she refused. She was beaten and in one incident, Farrell forced dog faeces into her mouth. Farrell already had a 2006 assault conviction for biting a previous partner and another from 2018, against Ms Mistry - who he later went on to kill. In victim impact statements read to court, the first of Farrell's rape victims said she had been left ""damaged and degraded"" and ""scared and paranoid"". The second victim said she ""literally became a prisoner"" in her own home, adding Farrell was ""controlling - a predator and abuser"" and she had ""felt like his puppet, the way he wielded power"" over her. Officers found Ms Mistry dead in her home in Gedge Way, Leicester, with a post-mortem examination finding multiple injuries to her head, face and torso.  She died from an internal abdominal haemorrhage, which had been caused by blunt force trauma. Witnesses and CCTV placed Farrell at the address and showed there had been a confrontation between them, police said. During the murder investigation, police identified and contacted the two female victims of the rape and assault offences. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

risk appetite,Bluebells at risk from social media fans,2024-09-15,2019-05-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-48278121,"The survival of Scotland's bluebells is being threatened by people in pursuit of the perfect photograph. Conservationists warn the appetite for social media content is fuelling the problem at some of the country's ancient woodlands. Woodland Trust Scotland said bulbs are at risk of dying off if crushed by visitors getting close to the flowers. George Anderson of Woodland Trust Scotland said: ""Trampling has become a major problem. ""People are threatening the future of the very flowers they have come to enjoy."" Around half of all bluebells in the world are found in the UK. The native species is protected and strongly associated with ancient woodland. Bluebells flower between mid-April and late May and displays are coming to a peak. The trust is advising visitors to keep to recognised woodland paths and make sure larger dogs, in particular, are under control. Woodland Trust managed bluebell woods include Aldouran Glen, in Dumfries and Galloway; Keil's Den in Fife; and Glen Finglas, in the Trossachs. Mr Anderson said:  ""It does seem we are having a particularly bad year for carelessness at some woods.   ""Bluebells will be reaching their peak across Scotland in the coming week.  ""We absolutely encourage people to get out and enjoy what is one of our great natural spectacles. But enjoy them, don't destroy them."" He said social media and photo sharing sites may be compounding the problem in some locations.  He said: ""Stunning images quickly spread online, with location information attached.  ""This can generate many more visitors who want to get the same shot.  ""That's fine if everyone acts responsibly, but the danger is that trampling increases as the number of visitors goes up.  ""This can escalate to cause the worst damage at the most impressive sites. It is heartbreaking."" Not only does trampling spoil the spectacle for others, the weight of feet causes long-term damage to the bulbs. Mr Anderson said: ""They have a brief few weeks to replenish their store of energy from the sun.  ""Other plants often shade them out later in the summer.  ""If they are trampled it means bulbs may be unable to recharge themselves and so will not come up in future years."""
risk appetite,The door knock that killed a Japanese teenager in US,2024-09-15,2019-10-19,By Toby Luckhurst,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50063364,"In October 1992, Yoshihiro Hattori knocked on the wrong door.  Yoshi, as he was known, was a 16-year-old Japanese exchange student on his way to a Halloween party in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was with his friend Webb, and they were lost.  ""I didn't know that part of town too well, and I guess I took a couple wrong turns,"" Webb recalled in a recent interview. The two boys, decked out in fancy dress, thought they had found the right place. But they'd made an innocent mistake that cost Yoshi his life. A media frenzy followed, and later a massive campaign to change America's gun laws. Twenty-seven years on, Yoshi's parents, his host family in the US, and a Louisiana lawyer recalled the day that changed their lives. Yoshi was ""crazy about rugby"", said his parents, Masa and Mieko Hattori, in an email interview. ""At first he was not so active about going to America,"" they said. All that changed when Yoshi passed a test for the American Field Service (AFS) - a worldwide exchange organisation for young people. ""He became so eager,"" his parents said. Yoshi submitted an entrance paper for the programme. ""Wherever I go, I wish I could make the country a second home country,"" he wrote. ""I can make Japanese cooking like tempura cutlet for host families and introduce the living way of Japanese."" In the summer of 1992, Yoshi took off for a year in the US. He was met in Dallas by his hosts, the Haymaker family. They drove him back to their home in Baton Rouge.  Dr Holley Haymaker, a physician, and her husband Dick Haymaker, a theoretical physicist, had hosted exchange students before. But Hattori made an immediate impression, they said. ""Yoshi was very ebullient, a total extrovert,"" Holley recalled. ""The kids at McKinley High School loved him because he was such a free spirit."" Her husband agreed. ""He was a really, really extraordinary guy. He was life. He moved through space like a dancer."" Yoshi had been a rugby player in Japan but in the US he signed up to a jazz dance class. Holley found him a bike with lights and a helmet so he could cycle to class. ""He was very popular at that jazz class,"" she said. The Haymakers' son, Webb, who was 16 at the time, said Yoshi had an ""enormous appetite for life and experience"" and tried to make friends wherever he went. The pair attended a blues festival that September, and Yoshi was put in touch with another Japanese exchange student through some teenagers they met. A couple of weeks later, they were invited to a Halloween party just north-east of Baton Rouge, in the city of Central.  On Saturday 17 October, Dick and Holley went to a movie while Yoshi and Webb set off for the party. Yoshi was dressed as John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever - he had been watching a lot of John Travolta movies, Webb says. Webb was dressed as an accident victim, wearing a neck brace from a swimming pool injury earlier that summer with a few bandages for added effect. The pair set off looking for the house. ""Eventually we ended up on this street. We saw this house - it had Halloween decorations, it had three cars in the drive way, and the address was 10311, whereas we wanted to go to 10131. But I just saw the address and said, ""Oh this is it!"" Webb and Yoshi knocked on the door but got no answer. They then saw a woman open the side garage door and peer out before abruptly slamming it in their faces.  ""We were walking away sort of confused, I had started to walk down the block wondering if it was a different house,"" Webb said. ""But then someone opened the door - Rodney Peairs opened the door."" Rodney Peairs, a 30-year-old supermarket butcher, was holding a .44 Magnum revolver. Yoshi turned back towards him. ""He was very eager to get to the party and didn't understand, I guess, that [Peairs] had a gun. Maybe he thought it was a Halloween thing,"" Webb said. ""He was light on his feet and just sang, in a very boisterous way, 'We're here for the party! We're here for the party!' - sort of happy."" Peairs shouted ""Freeze!"" but Yoshi seemed not to understand and kept moving forwards. Peairs fired once, hitting Yoshi in the chest, and slammed the door. Across town, the Haymakers were leaving the cinema after watching The Last of the Mohicans. ""I said to Dick as we left the movie, 'It's great that this country isn't as violent as that anymore',"" Holley recalled. As they walked from the theatre, her pager went off and she called the number. It was the police. The officer on the other end of the line told her Webb was fine, but Yoshi - the officer garbled his name - was not.  Holley said they would meet the police at the hospital. ""That won't be necessary,"" the officer replied. Dick and Holley raced to the police station where Webb was sitting alone, unaware of what had happened to his friend after the ambulance drove away. His parents broke the news. ""The first words out of his mouth were, 'His poor mother',"" Dick said. ""That was the beginning of this whole story that wrecked the Hattoris' lives."" Yoshi's parents learned the news down the line from a worker with the exchange programme. His mother Mieko retreated to her son's childhood bedroom and cried.  Two days after the killing, the Hattoris flew to New Orleans. ""I was terrified,"" Holley recalled. ""I was to take care of their son and he was killed."" But the Hattoris had only concern for the Haymakers, she said. ""The first words Yoshi's mother said were, 'How is Webb?'"" Yoshi's shooting became a global news story overnight. It shocked people in Japan, where handguns are banned. Masa and Mieko took immediate action, launching a campaign in Japan calling for an end to easy access to firearms in the US. ""We began the petition drive from the wake,"" they said. ""Mieko wrote the draft for the campaign in the air plane coming back from Louisiana to Japan."" Back in Baton Rouge, Rodney Peairs' trial became a media circus. Police initially released Peairs without charge, assuming he was within his rights to shoot a trespasser. But after complaints from Louisiana's governor and Japan's consul in New Orleans, he was charged with manslaughter. His lawyers worked hard to establish his actions as self-defence. They said Peairs was ""no killer"", simply ""one of your neighbours"" who was reacting to Yoshi's ""extremely unusual way of moving"". Meanwhile, Bonnie Peairs - Rodney's wife, who first opened the door - told the court Yoshi had scared her and she had ordered her husband to ""get the gun"". The defence worked. In May 1993, Rodney Peairs was acquitted after a jury deliberation of just three hours. Masa Hattori attended the trial, hearing descriptions of his son as an ""out of control... hyperactive Japanese exchange student who thought his job was to scare people"". But he and his wife were not discouraged from their gun control activism.  ""We think Peairs is also one of the victims of America,"" Masa and Mieko said. ""That Rodney Peairs was acquitted is not related to our campaign."" The Hattoris' petition drive gathered pace. In the end, some 1.7 million Japanese people signed. Yoshi's story dominated the country's front pages and news broadcasts for weeks. Dick Haymaker also decided to gather signatures in the US, to help out the Hattoris. In the end, about 150,000 written signatures turned up by post. ""He basically gave his year to that petition drive,"" said Holley. ""It was before email, it was before the web, it was before Facebook, before any of this, so it all had to be done by telephone and snail mail."" Dick dedicated himself to gun control activism. ""The beginning was doing the petition drive and just throwing my life at that. And then I threw my life at Washington, and then I threw my life at trying to get an appointment with the president. I did in the end!"" Both families were in Washington in November 1993 as part of their campaign - everyone recognised them from their appearances on all three network morning shows, Dick says - when after months of trying they managed to get a note from Mieko to a friend of the family who happened to be staying at the White House. ""An old roommate of Bill Clinton's,"" Dick recalled. President Clinton spoke to the Haymakers and the Hattoris in the Oval Office. ""We felt we were welcomed,"" Mieko and Masa said. ""We believe he understood our position. He desired strong gun control laws."" The Hattoris and the Haymakers agreed that, despite his private support, there was little the president could do to help practically. But proposed gun control measures had gotten a boost from their campaign. The 30th anniversary of President John F Kennedy's assassination that month also helped raise awareness of the issue.  That month, Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, mandating background checks on gun buyers and a five-day waiting period on all purchases. President Clinton signed it into law just weeks after meeting the Hattoris and Haymakers.  US Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale travelled to Nagoya to meet the Hattoris in December 1993 and gave them a copy of the law, saying they had a ""very definite impact on passage of the Brady bill"". It had been first introduced in 1991, but was not brought to a vote until a few months after Yoshi was killed. And the following summer, in September 1994, Congress passed the federal Assault Weapons Ban - a 10-year moratorium on manufacturing certain semi-automatic weapons for civilian use. Dick insisted that they had nothing to do with the legislation, although they had been ""publicising"" the Brady bill before its passage. But he said it was a time when gun control seemed possible. ""It was at a point in history where things could change, and they did change. The Brady bill was an important first step in background checks."" The bill was not the end of the Hattoris' fight. They decided to launch a civil suit against Rodney Peairs, his wife Bonnie, and their home insurance company. They were put in touch with Charles Moore, a lawyer who had form taking on such cases; he had previously waived his fee after representing an English woman who was hit by a drunk driver in Louisiana. ""Sometimes you just do things because you want to do right,"" Moore said, in a phone interview. ""I get calls all the time on [Yoshi's case] even though it's been what, how many years now, 25 years or so? I was never expecting to get paid anything on it. I thought the insurance company would refuse to pay because it was an intentional act and there's no coverage for intentional acts."" To his surprise, the insurer paid out $100,000. Judge William Brown told the court that self-defence was ""not acceptable"". ""There was no justification whatsoever that a killing was necessary for Rodney Peairs to save himself,"" Judge Brown said.  But the Hattoris kept none of the money awarded. Instead they left it all in the US to fund gun control measures.  Both Mieko and Masa remain involved in activism, nearly three decades after their son's killing. Most recently they spoke to students who survived the February 2018 Parkland shooting, and took part in the March for Our Lives in March 2018 to show support. The Haymakers also remained involved. Over the years, they have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to gun control groups, including the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. The organisation used their money to set up a working group which helped formulate so-called ""red flag laws"" - a legal measure which allows the court-sanctioned removal of firearms from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others. And the couple recently gave a $500,000 endowment to Dick's university, Carleton College, to create the Yoshihiro Hattori Memorial Fund. It aims to help cover costs for Japanese students who study at the Minnesota institution. Holley and Dick aren't as actively involved in campaigning anymore - Holley, 74, still works part-time in mental health at public schools, while Dick, 79, has retired - but they are watching the renewed US debate about gun laws.  ""It's very, very different,"" Dick said. ""There are so many events and so many young people involved, and that's extremely important. How that will shake out, I just have no idea."""
risk appetite,'Aussie' flu. Should we be worried?,2024-09-15,2018-01-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42602394,"The NHS is preparing itself for a bad flu season. One of the strains circulating this year - H3N2 - has been dubbed Aussie flu because it is the same strain that recently caused big problems for Australia.  Australia's 2017 flu season was the worst the country had experienced in nearly a decade.  Experts are waiting to see if similar will happen in the UK, after a recent rise in cases. Every winter there are a few strains circulating and Aussie flu or H3N2 is just one of them. It is an influenza A virus that appears to cause more severe infections in young children and the elderly.  Most people will recover in about a week and won't need any specific treatment, apart from a bit of bed rest, some paracetamol or ibuprofen and drinking plenty of fluids.  But for some - the very old, very young or people with pre-existing health conditions such as heart disease - flu can be deadly. The UK is seeing a mix of flu types circulating including influenza B as well as the H3N2 strain.  H3N2 is not new. It was around last winter too.  Any strain of flu, including H3N2, can be dangerous for people who are vulnerable to it.  Experience from last winter suggests the elderly are a high risk group for H3N2. Influenza viruses are given different names based on their type - A, B and C. A is usually the most serious while C is usually a milder infection. They can be further subdivided according to the proteins that they carry on their surface. These are called H and N antigens.  The main strains circulating this winter are A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and B. Hospital admissions and GP visits for influenza have seen a sharp rise going into 2018, and although the figures are higher than last winter they are nowhere near as high as in 2009 when the swine flu pandemic hit the UK.  Professor Paul Cosford, Medical Director, Public Health England said: ""As we would expect at this time of year, flu levels have increased this week. Our data shows that more people are visiting GPs with flu symptoms and we are seeing more people admitted to hospitals with the flu. The vaccine is the best defence we have against the spread of flu and it isn't too late to get vaccinated."" The vaccine is designed to protect against the type of flu circulating in any given season.  Every year, the World Health Organization reviews the global situation and recommends which flu strains should go into the vaccine to be manufactured for the following season.  This year's flu jab is designed to protect against H3N2 as well as some other strains. Vaccination is the best protection we have against flu. But flu is unpredictable. Flu viruses constantly mutate and change, so it is a moving target to fight.  Public Health England says typical effectiveness of the flu vaccine is 40-60%, which means that for every 100 people vaccinated, between 40 and 60 will be protected. At risk people are advised to have annual flu jabs because flu strains can change from year to year, plus protection from the flu vaccine may wane after about six months. Adults aged over 65, pregnant women and those with underlying health conditions are advised to get a free flu jab. A flu nasal spray is available free to young children, who are thought to be the main spreaders of flu. In general, current flu vaccines tend to work better against influenza B and influenza A/H1N1 viruses than H3N2, according to US experts at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. And it's already known that flu vaccines may work less well in elderly people because they have weaker immune systems. Dr Richard Pebody, from Public Health England, said: ""This season's flu vaccine should be providing reasonable protection, similar to last winter. Last year the vaccine did not give quite as good protection for the elderly for H3N2.  ""That's something that we are watching closely to see if it is an issue this winter."" How the vaccines are made might also determine their effectiveness, according to research. Flu vaccines used in the UK and in many other parts of the world are currently grown in chicken eggs and this process can be tricky. Recent research in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found the H3N2 part of the flu vaccine did not grow simply during this process and developed mutations.  When they tested the vaccine in animals and humans they found the H3N2 part did a partial job of protecting against this strain of flu. The vaccine had 20-30% effectiveness against H3N2.  Experts stress this is still our best defence against the virus. And the jab provides excellent protection against other flu strains. A spokesman from Public Health England said: ""Although we would like this to be higher, this is still a very valuable level of protection against what can be a nasty and sometimes deadly illness."" Early indications suggest people vaccinated with a trivalent flu jab will not be protected against one of the circulating B viruses - B/Yamagata. The flu nasal spray immunisation given to children does protect against this strain, as does the quadrivalent flu jab, however. Trivalent vaccines will still offer better protection than having no vaccine in many cases, even if they may not protect against all of the circulating strains. Experts recommend that all those who are eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS should take up the offer. If you want to protect yourself against flu and you're not in one of the groups, you can buy the flu jab from high street pharmacies. People who can get it for free from the NHS include: A flu nasal spray is available to two and three-year-olds and some children at primary school. Front-line health and social care workers are also eligible to receive the flu vaccine. Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include: If you develop sudden chest pain, have difficulty breathing or start coughing up blood, call 999 or go to A&E.  See your GP if: Flu is very infectious and easily spread to other people. You're more likely to give it to others in the first five days. Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours. To reduce the risk of spreading flu:"
risk appetite,The Handmaid's Tale: Beyond the book,2024-09-15,2018-08-13,By Lucy Todd,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45096360,"*** Spoiler alert: this article contains some content about the plot points from The Handmaid's Tale. *** The second series of the Handmaid's Tale came to an end on Sunday night.  Writing in iNews, Mark Butler calls the finale ""a nail-biting conclusion to the season, with a controversial twist"", but Vanity Fair's Sonia Saraiya termed the climax ""a singularly frustrating end to a season that, despite its high points, often struggled to find its purpose"". The series went beyond Margaret Atwood's original novel - with her blessing - but how well did the show do in extending the novel beyond its intended lifecycle and how difficult is it to go beyond the book of an acclaimed author like Atwood? ""The novel ends quite ambiguously,"" says Julia Raeside, who has written The Guardian's episode-by-episode guide to series two of The Handmaid's Tale. Speaking to BBC News, she adds: ""It's really interesting when someone takes up the mantle of an unfinished story. If they've got something to say about what happens when you repress women for so long, then it's something I welcome.""  The second series has been criticised by some for its brutal scenes, with some viewers switching off entirely due to what's been termed by some as ""needless torture porn"". ""I think the first couple of episodes were slightly misjudged,"" says Raeside, ""and I wonder how much brutality Atwood really agreed with. ""But on the whole it's been a fascinating watch. Some of the detail and colour they've added has been brilliant - for example, details about the regime and how the rest of the world sees the Republic of Gilead. The episode when the commander and his wife go to Canada and are initially welcomed is a personal highlight."" The Independent's culture editor, Christopher Hooton, agrees that overall the second series is a triumph, saying ""it may be the best adaptation and extension of a novel to date"".  ""The shift to a modern day setting has made the horrors of Gilead seem all the more stark and urgent... whether it's the millennial characters having so recently been hopping carefree between bars in an Uber, or June convalescing during her escape by watching some Friends on an iPad."" He calls the move beyond the novel to the second season ""seamless"", and says ""the first half was for me even better than much of season one"".  ""The show's only real falter came with the season finale,"" he says, ""which felt more George Lucas than Margaret Atwood as June pulled her hood up and headed back into the fray. The drama felt forced for the first time."" Todd van der Werff - critic at large for Vox - says, however, that a number of flaws have already crept in. ""What will eventually burden the show is that you can see the wheels turning where they need to keep it going for the next season. Atwood showed a tiny window into this horrible world, but they are making it a much larger window. ""It's difficult to do this without it turning into misery porn. So then you have to introduce new lighter elements, which run the risk of being oversentimental and saccharine in their nature,"" van der Werff says. The boss of streaming service Hulu, Randy Freer, has commented that the show could go on for 10 series. But van der Werff says that would be quite a push: ""For season two, the writers were pretty clever at leaving themselves a few things from the novel that they didn't include in season one - like time June spends with her mother. But I struggle to think of any show that's good over ten seasons - especially a drama. ""I think the show is good independent of the current political situation - in the western world, we have this creeping tide of authoritarian ideas at the fringes of the political sphere - but I wonder how much appetite there would be for The Handmaid's Tale without the existence of Donald Trump as the president. I doubt it'd win as many as awards..."" Raeside, however, admits at this point she still has appetite for more: ""I'd like to see more of how the regime came to power, how it's run. The way they leave a series in Handmaid's Tale is unique and means you'll want to watch more. Is revolution on the way?"" Hooton says: ""I generally prefer shows to be economic in terms of number of seasons, but I think The Handmaid's Tale is a rare example where something longer could work. There are enough interesting facets to the show's universe to fill more seasons, although we may need to step into different characters' shoes for a while as The Wire did."" Taking a television show beyond its source material is not new - but has certainly become more ambitious in its nature, according to Raeside: ""Long form content has become the new thing. It's a new method of TV making which wasn't around 20 years ago. The TV industry didn't used to just pick up and run with a franchise no matter if it had any legs or not."" ""There was a bit more reverence in old-fashioned TV,"" she adds, ""where you wouldn't dream of making up new developments for a character because it wasn't your character. I think TV has become cheekier."" Guardian TV critic Sam Wollaston points out there is a lot of financial gain in long-term content: ""Television is all about series these days - studios are never going to give up on a massive audience like that."" Game of Thrones is an obvious example of where the television series has outpaced the author's source material to keep up with demand - and done with ""varying success"", according to van der Werff. By series six the show creators David Benioff and DB Weiss had already gone beyond George RR Martin's five novels. And despite being provided with a brief story arc by the author, van der Werff says the latter seasons consequently ""feel like they are jumping through plot points. It makes no sense geographically, and feels like they are rushing through to a final conclusion."" And Hooton thinks the trajectory of the show has been shaped by fans' expectations: ""The situation with Game of Thrones is interesting, the show having morphed from a sort of political one to an all-out war epic. I think this has more to do with the hype and expectation coming from viewers than adaptation, however.""  Television adaptations have a tricky balancing act between portraying a faithful depiction of the world in which they're set, and expanding them. And the success of a show ""entirely depends on who's doing the adaptation"", says Raeside. ""Someone like Steven Moffat does it really cleverly in Sherlock and canters off with the idea."" Wollaston agrees: ""Sherlock is so beyond the original novels - but there is a kind of spirit of him in the series. It's done really well because there are nods to Arthur Conan Doyle all over the place."" Other shows have done this less well, with van der Werff terming ""problematic"" The Walking Dead, which was originally based on a comic book series, ""because it became long and too much of a slog. The same stuff just kept happening."" And there is some debate over when exactly Netflix's House of Cards, which was based on a 1989 British novel of the same name, had jumped the shark - or outstayed its welcome. Wollaston says he ""entirely stopped"" watching the show for the past couple of series because it had become too preposterous.  ""With The Handmaid's Tale though, I think it's ok for it to have carried on because it's a world and a situation - and I think that works with other worlds, like Game of Thrones, which continue the idea. ""The Handmaid's Tale has never been more relevant and it still resonates,"" he adds. ""The fact that the handmaid outfit is still being used as a protest symbol kind of speaks for itself.""

risk appetite,Asian hornet nest found and destroyed in city,2024-09-15,2023-07-28,By Brodie Owen,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66337274,"An Asian hornet nest has been found and destroyed in Devon. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the nest was destroyed after surveillance in Plymouth. The surveillance by the National Bee Unit followed confirmed sightings in the city. UK Chief Plant and Bee Health Officer Nicola Spence urged people to report sightings of the invasive insect as soon as possible. The insect poses no greater risk to human health than native wasps and hornets. However, they prey on pollinating insects such as honey bees and can cause major damage to colonies. Ms Spence urged beekeepers to remain vigilant. ""By ensuring we are alerted to possible sightings as early as possible, we can take swift and effective action to stamp out the threat posed by Asian hornets,"" she said. ""That's why we are working at speed to locate and investigate any nests in the area following the confirmed sightings in Plymouth. ""While the Asian hornet poses no greater risk to human health than other wasps or hornets, they can cause damage to honey bee colonies and other beneficial insects."" Gerry Stuart, chairman of the Devon-based Asian Hornet Action Team, said the discovery of a nest in Plymouth was concerning. He said the spread of the insect in the UK would be a ""nightmare"". ""They are so destructive - they consume and move on,"" he said. ""It's very important to realise how precious our pollinators are - not just bees, but hoverflies, butterflies and other pollinators too. ""We are talking about devastation of crops and, if that's affected, it could certainly affect us.""  The Natural History Museum said Asian hornet queens are about 3cm (1.2in) in length and workers about 2.5cm (1in). Their legs transition from brown to yellow at the ends and they have an orange face. Anyone who sees an Asian hornet is urged to report it using Defra's online form or via the app Asian Hornet Watch. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

risk appetite,Fortnite's World Cup to be 'open to all',2024-09-15,2018-06-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44466723,"Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, has announced more details about its first World Cup. It would be open to all players, Epic said at a live celebrity tournament at the Los Angeles E3 gaming conference. And the $100m (£74m) prize pot - the largest in the highly lucrative world of e-sports - would be split between many events at different levels of competition around the world. It comes as some are expressing concern about young children playing Fortnite. Launched in June 2017, Fortnite now has 125 million players around the globe, according to Epic. Its most popular format, Battle Royale, pits 100 players against each other, some of whom are in small teams, to see who is the last person standing. The game is free, but players can spend real money on in-app purchases including skins to customise player avatars. Announcing the details of the World Cup in a blogpost, the company said: ""We're getting behind competitive play in a big way, but our approach will be different - we plan to be more inclusive, and focused on the joy of playing and watching the game. ""We'll be supporting community organised events, online events, and major organised competitions all over the world, where anyone can participate, and anyone can win."" ""This is for you, the players. Qualifications for the Fortnite World Cup will be based on merit. Epic will not be selling teams or franchises, and won't allow third-party leagues to do so either."" The play would focus on individuals and duos but ""there'll be plenty of opportunities to squad-up in competition, too"", it added. The qualifiers will begin in autumn 2018, with the World Cup event due to take place in late 2019. According to e-sports analyst Newzoo, organised, competitive computer gaming will generate more than £1bn in global revenue and almost double its audience to nearly 600 million people by 2020, giving it the potential to become one of the top five sports in the world. There is huge appetite for Fortnite. Last month, a tournament held by one of the game's most famous streamers, Ninja, saw more than 600,000 concurrent viewers on game streaming site Twitch. The game has an age classification of 12-plus but is increasingly attracting younger children, leading some to question whether it is suitable for such a young demographic. Alastair Graham, chief executive of online age verification company AgeChecked, said: ""[The] dangers of under-age children playing online games such as Fortnite are that it risks desensitising young children to mature themes such as gun violence, as well as putting them at risk of being scammed or groomed online by their elders.""

risk appetite,Travelling at Christmas: What you need to know,2024-09-15,2020-11-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55055297,"Christmas is often a frantic time for travel, with people rushing across the UK to be with loved ones for the holiday season.  But now that Covid restrictions will be eased from 23 to 27 December, public transport is expected to be even busier than normal, as travel for the holidays is compressed into a five-day window.  And this year there will be no squeezing on to a packed train carriage. Trains, coaches and planes are all running at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing, with tickets often needing to be booked in advance.  The prospect of public transport being unable to cope with demand has prompted the government to appoint a Christmas travel tsar - Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy. He is assessing whether road, rail and air networks are prepared enough for the onslaught of travellers during the festive window.   Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced a series of measures to minimise disruption during the travel window, including clearing roadworks, postponing rail upgrades and cutting some rail ticket charges. Mr Shapps said Sir Peter was carrying out a ""rigorous assessment"" of transport services to ensure ""everything possible is being done to help"". He urged people to ""closely consider their journey, plan and book ahead"". So what should you do if you're going to travel this year to spend Christmas with loved ones, and how might services be affected? As is standard every year, there are no train services running on Christmas Day and only a very limited number of services running on a small number of routes on Boxing Day. But for the days passengers can travel, they are being urged to book ahead and avoid busy times due to the combination of reduced capacity and the limited travel window. And some operators will prevent passengers from boarding without a pre-booked ticket. There have already been reports of advance tickets selling out or going for exorbitant prices.  The good news is that operators say more advance tickets will soon be available, blaming the current shortage on changes to the timetable caused by the pandemic.  But the bad news is that tickets are expected to sell fast.  The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, advised people to keep checking for tickets and consider signing up for notifications from rail operators, some of whom will confirm when more fares are available. Avanti West Coast, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line, has said it is suspending peak fares between 18 December and the end of the year to help maintain social distancing on its trains.  This will slash the cost of many journeys on its network - for example, passengers buying a fully-flexible fare from Manchester to London during what is usually a peak period will be charged £64.40 instead of £180. Meanwhile, under the government's latest Christmas travel plans, admin fees of up to £10 for changing advance tickets are being waived to encourage people to comply with the new restrictions. This applies to tickets that were bought for specific trains before England's Covid tiers were announced on 26 November There are also annual Christmas rail works to contend with - though the majority of the network has been cleared of engineering works in a bid to avoid disruption. However, Network Rail engineering works are taking place from 23 December to 4 January, with some railway lines closing to allow the work to take place. London King's Cross station will be closed for six days from Christmas Day as a £1.2bn upgrade of the East Coast Main Line continues.  Network Rail is also warning of a ""significantly reduced service"" from 25 December to 4 January between Clapham Junction and London Waterloo because of major work. But some work scheduled for the festive period has been reviewed. The closure of King's Cross on Christmas Eve for major engineering works has now been postponed from the afternoon until the end of service, to ease congestion for people making getaway journeys out of London. And works on the West Coast Main Line will be completed earlier than planned on 27 December. That will allow a full Sunday service to run from 10:00 GMT rather than midday, making it easier for passengers to return from their Christmas bubbles. Longer trains will run on Anglo-Scotland and Liverpool routes to boost the number of seats at anticipated busy times on the West Coast Main Line.  Chiltern Railway will also run additional services on 27 December, and East Midlands Railway will run a full intercity timetable over the Christmas period.   The government said rail engineering works such as the East Coast Upgrade had been planned for two years - and ""cancelling or delaying these works would see benefits to punctuality, safety and reliability deferred by up to two years"".  With trains likely to struggle with demand, coach operator National Express has said it will increase its services in the run-up to Christmas, having seen a ""significant"" increase in traffic to its website since the Christmas Covid rules were announced. However, this still amounts to a reduced service, the operator said, with this year's Christmas Day timetable covering about 55% of the locations compared with 2019. The operator said it will focus on major cities, towns and airports and expects demand for services to grow as more guidance about what we can do over Christmas is released by the government.   Megabus also said it had seen an increase in bookings over the past few days and expected demand to continue to grow. Both will have a role in the mass exodus of students from universities between 3 and 9 December, aimed at minimising the risk of them spreading Covid-19 to their home areas.   Megabus said extra seats will be available from all the largest university campuses, cities and towns for students travelling home for Christmas, including Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford, Newcastle, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Sheffield, Leeds, Norwich, Cardiff and Bristol.  National Express said it had increased capacity its usual routes that serve university locations and was speaking with universities about the possible need for special services. Both operators will have services on Christmas Day.  Mr Shapps has also said the government is relaxing rules to allow more types of coaches to run over the festive period. One upside for those travelling by road is that there are likely to be fewer roadworks than normal over the Christmas period. The transport secretary said 778 miles of roadworks had been cleared on motorways and A-roads to ease any congestion.  Where essential roadworks must continue, speed limits will be set at 60mph where possible, including on key routes such as the M6 and M1, ""to keep disruption to a minimum"". Melanie Clarke, customer service director for Highways England, said the ""current plan"" was to remove ""non-essential"" roadworks from 20 December to 4 January 2021.  The RAC said its breakdown team is planning for the roads to be busy during the five-day period when coronavirus restrictions are eased, though it said it ""remains to be seen"" what the appetite for journeys would be this year. The AA said it was not ""overly concerned"" that traffic congestion would occur on roads. A survey it conducted found two-fifths of drivers had already cancelled festive travel plans. EasyJet said it had already taken the decision to increase the number of seats on offer between London and Belfast, and London and Scotland over the Christmas period.  ""We are operating flights in line with demand, which we will be monitoring over the coming days and are able to adjust our flight schedule accordingly,"" a spokesman said.   British Airways said it had seen an uptick in the numbers of people visiting its website looking at flights and holidays.  A spokesman said it would be putting on larger aircraft if needed, ""where possible"".  But Irish airline Aer Lingus said it would be operating a ""much-reduced schedule"" due to a ""lack of demand"" for air travel. However, it said additional capacity had been added to key routes including Dublin to London Heathrow over the Christmas period."
risk appetite,Danske Bank boss quits over €200bn scandal,2024-09-15,2018-09-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45571744,"The chief executive of Danske Bank has resigned in the wake of a money-laundering scandal involving its Estonian operation.  Thomas Borgen stepped down following an investigation into payments of about €200bn (£177bn) through its Estonian branch. The Danish bank said many of those payments were suspicious. Mr Borgen said it was clear Danske had failed to live up to its responsibilities, which he regretted. ""Even though the investigation conducted by the external law firm concludes that I have lived up to my legal obligations, I believe that it is best for all parties that I resign,"" he said. The bank said it was unable to determine how much money was believed to have been laundered through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. Shares in Danske fell 7% in Copenhagen following Mr Borgen's resignation and a lowering of its outlook for the full year. Estonia's Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) said it was now examining the findings of Danske's internal investigation. ""The report describes serious shortcomings in the organisation of Danske Bank, where risk-appetite and risk control were not in balance,"" said the Estonian FSA's chairman, Kilvar Kessler. The watchdog and Denmark's financial supervision authority will now consider taking action. The FSA said that it had carried out thorough inspections of Danske Bank's Estonian branch in 2014. The following year the FSA said it ordered the bank to rectify flaws in its risk control organisation. That resulted in Danske's Estonian branch no longer serving customers who did not live in the country.  The branch's handling of Russian and former Soviet money has also been the focus of an inquiry in Estonia itself.  International financier Bill Browder is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most public critics. He has long alleged that Danske's Estonian branch was ""one of the main conduits related to the fraud"".  In July 2017, he gave evidence to the US Senate Judiciary Committee pertaining to allegations that Russia interfered with the 2016 US presidential elections.  Mr Browder set up and ran Russia's most successful hedge fund, Hermitage Capital Management, from 1995 to 2005. In 2005, he claims that the Russian government took over his firm and used it to claim a $230m tax refund. Mr Browder was refused entry into the country for ""national security"" reasons, so he moved to London and asked his staff to move with him. Mr Browder said his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, refused to leave as he wanted to investigate evidence of what he said was a massive tax scam by Russian government officials. Mr Magnitsky died in 2009 while in Russian custody.  After Mr Magnitsky's death, Mr Browder embarked on a worldwide campaign asking governments to pass legislation to freeze the assets involved and deny visas to human rights abusers.  In the US, this law was passed in 2012 and is known as the Magnitsky Act. The UK passed a similar bill in February 2017, updating its existing Proceeds of Crime Act.  In 2013, Mr Browder was tried in absentia in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison for tax fraud. Russia asked Interpol to arrest Mr Browder, but the international policing agency rejected the claim.  In May, Mr Browder was arrested and detained for two hours in Spain. He was released after Interpol announced that the arrest warrant was politically motivated."
risk appetite,Tackling the canine obesity crisis,2024-09-15,2017-09-09,By Dr Charlotte Brassey,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41161424,"When it comes to man's best friend, science may finally have solved the mystery of their gluttony - some Labradors, it seems, are genetically predisposed to being hungry.  That's according to scientists who were discussing their ongoing mission to improve our favourite pets' health at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton.  Several research teams in the UK are on a mission to improve canine health.  Researchers at the University of Cambridge have studied the appetite of Britain's favourite dog breed, and suggest Labradors are genetically at risk of becoming overweight. Roughly a quarter of British households own a pet dog, and Labrador retrievers remain our most popular canine companion.  However, this stereotypically ""greedy"" breed often suffers size-related health problems.  ""Obesity is a serious issue for our dog population,"" says Dr Eleanor Raffan from the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science.  ""It has the potential to have a massive impact on pet welfare."" In research supported by the Dogs Trust, Dr Raffan and her colleagues have analysed DNA from the saliva of Labradors across the UK. They found that particularly greedy individuals possess a gene mutation responsible for increasing their appetite. ""We found around a quarter of pet Labradors have at least one copy of this mutation in the gene,"" Dr Raffan explains. Their increased appetite manifests itself as a ""food obsession"", familiar to dog-owners as begging or scavenging for food. In the past, the onus has been on owners to restrict the diet of their pets to prevent excessive weight gain. But Dr Raffan's research suggests the propensity for large appetites, and hence potential obesity, is hardwired into some individuals.  ""We hope to shift the paradigm away from owner-blaming"" says Dr Raffan. ""It's a bit more nuanced than just owners needing to be careful."" Dr Raffan cautions against any attempt to breed this ""greedy mutation"" out of Labrador lines. While it might predispose the dogs to obesity, a strong focus on food may also explain why Labradors are so easy to train and are such loyal human companions.  ""If we try to get rid of the mutation, we might find we change the personality of the breed, and that would be a real shame,"" she explains.  Yet their results raise an ethical conundrum. Owners and veterinary surgeons are responsible for providing five core so-called freedoms to animals in their care, including freedom from pain and disease, and freedom from hunger.    Obesity is a disease, and negatively impacts upon canine quality of life. ""But equally, being hungry is a welfare issue,"" says Dr Raffan. ""And these dogs are genetically hungry.""   Dr Raffan hopes future research will improve the satiety of their diets, allowing a feeling of ""fullness"" without the potential for excessive weight gain.  Being overweight undoubtedly reduces a dog's quality of life, and can also affect their ability to cope with arthritis and other underlying joint disorders. At the University of Liverpool, scientists are using state-of-the-art imaging technology to study diseases affecting the knee joints of Labradors.  Damage to the canine cruciate ligament, similar to the injuries commonly suffered by professional human athletes, is the most common orthopaedic problem seen in veterinary practices. Injury to the knee ligaments is also more common in heavier dog breeds ""We're trying to understand how the shape of the Labrador body and the way they walk might contribute to knee problems,"" says Prof Eithne Comerford, a specialist in musculoskeletal biology. Using high-speed x-ray cameras, the researchers film their canine patients walking through the lab, and watch their knee bones slide and twist in real-time. The team hopes to understand how walking contributes to the risk of ligament injury and rupture in Labradors, with the ultimate goal of reducing lameness and suffering within the breed. ""This data will also help veterinary surgeons and engineers design better treatments for ligament damage in Labradors, like customised knee implants,"" explains biomechanist Dr Karl Bates from the University of Liverpool.  Both research groups rely heavily on the good will of Labrador owners, both for collecting samples and entering their pets into experimental trials.  In addition to tackling diagnosed health issues, researchers hope to change the public's perception of what ""desirable"" traits should characterise our favourite breeds.  ""There is a real danger when we breed dogs to be cuddlier and cuter,"" warns Dr Raffan. ""I think people have seen so many overweight Labradors, they start to assume it's normal"".

risk appetite,The experimental psychology lab behind AC Milan's glory,2024-09-15,2022-05-09,John Nassoori,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61245521,"Roberto Baggio (not pictured) missed the crucial penalty as Brazil beat Italy to the 1994 World Cup Franco Baresi. Roberto Donadoni. Roberto Baggio. The names are synonymous with AC Milan's glory years.  They are also etched into the memory of every Italian fan who witnessed the country's World Cup penalty shootout defeats of 1990 and 1994.  All three spoke of the trauma they felt over missing their spot-kicks. All three sought solace in the 'Mind Room', Italian football's first psychology laboratory.  Backed by Silvio Berlusconi and hailed by a succession of Milan managers from Arrigo Sacchi to Carlo Ancelotti, the Mind Room helped underpin an unprecedented run of success as the Rossoneri won 21 major trophies during the 23 years it was operational from 1986.  Combining stress relief therapy with cognitive training and neuroscience, the laboratory's impact would be felt as far afield as Chelsea, where its founder constructed a similar set-up in 2009.  Things had come a long way since the plan for the first incarnation was hatched, at a meeting between a soon-to-be Italian prime minister and an amateur karate champion. Dr Bruno Demichelis had been a martial arts student since he was a young teenager. In 1971, aged 24, he was beaten at an international karate competition by a less-fancied Japanese opponent. He struggled to process defeat and returned home to Italy looking for answers.  ""It wasn't a technical problem or a physical problem; I was very fit and very well-trained. Eventually, a friend of mine said to me: 'Is it a mental problem?'"" recalled Demichelis on the Football Psychology Show, external in December 2020.  ""I realised that I had trained with Japanese people for so long they were no longer just instructors or masters to me. They were my heroes. Psychologically, you cannot defeat your heroes. It was self-sabotage."" Demichelis' questioning prompted an interest in psychology. He eventually completed a PhD in the subject and found work as a consultant to Fininvest, a media conglomerate owned by Berlusconi. In February 1986 Berlusconi bought AC Milan. Sensing an opportunity, Demichelis arranged a meeting with the club's new owner. It was a discussion that would his change his life. Demichelis would go on to work at Chelsea under Carlo Ancelotti Demichelis' pitch was straightforward: you've seen the benefits of psychological support in the business world. Now apply them to football. Berlusconi's response was equally direct. ""The owner asked me if I was a Milan fan,"" Demichelis says, now aged 74. ""I said 'No'. I remember him stepping back a little bit and I thought 'Oh no'. Then he asked me if I was an Inter fan. I said 'No' and he moved a bit further back. Before he asked me the third question, I said 'I'm not a fan of any team!'"" Following a two-and-a-half-hour meeting, Demichelis was appointed as Milan's scientific coordinator, making him Serie A's only practising psychologist.  After a successful start at the club that saw him win the backing of manager Arrigo Sacchi, Demichelis' services were in high demand. Capitalising on the opportunity, he secured investment for a bespoke psychology laboratory based at Milanello, the club's training ground. The Mind Room was born.  Its purpose was two-fold. Firstly, it allowed Demichelis to run group sessions, satisfying the Milan squad's growing appetite for psychological support. Secondly, it provided an opportunity to answer a question he had long wrestled with: how do you attempt to quantify and scientifically support a player's psychological development, linking this to performances on the pitch? The Mind Room acted as part-sanctuary, part-mental training ground. Groups of up to eight first-team members - sat in state-of-the-art zero gravity chairs - were hooked-up to equipment including polygraph machines, used to monitor indicators such as blood pressure and breathing rates. A glass divide separated the players and a studious Demichelis, who was looking for physiological signs of a player's state of mind (or what he termed ""objective data in the 'mental area'"").  For example, if a player said he felt inhibited or lacking in confidence because of a muscle strain, Demichelis would conduct an electromyogram test to measure muscular electrical activity.  The readings enabled him to quantify conditions such as post-game 'tightness' and take proportionate remedial action, including carefully calibrated breathing training. In doing so, the Mind Room was not only aiding physical recovery and performance, but also supporting the development of psychological characteristics such as confidence. Demichelis also used results from Mind Room tests to devise cognitive training exercises. These involved the use of biofeedback devices, such as electrodes, which, when placed on a person's scalp, can monitor the brain's electrical activity. By seeing how an individual's neurons behave, it becomes possible to focus on strengthening synapses associated with skills such as problem-solving. This type of therapy is designed to help players reconfigure the type of negative 'inner talk' that can affect them in high-pressure situations. Baresi, Baggio and Donadoni were among those treated.  Demichelis says: ""One of them told me, 'I put the ball down and took three or four steps back. And then a little thought crossed my mind: what if I miss?'""  ""He said, 'That hit me. I started looking at the ball like it was a tiger. Then I looked at the coach: another tiger. Then I looked at the players and my team-mates: another 21 tigers. Then I thought about the people watching at home. In a moment, I had 4 billion tigers looking at me. I was shaking. I felt confused. I almost felt like crying.'"" Paolo Maldini lifts the 2007 Champions League trophy - at the age of 38 Beyond stress relief and cognitive training, the Mind Room also focused on improving players' reaction speeds by using response time tests. Participants were presented with two buttons and a pair of bulbs, clicking the left-hand or right-hand button if the corresponding bulb lit up. Flashing arrows - often pointing in the opposite direction to the light which was on - were used to add a greater degree of difficulty to the examination. While the concept sounds basic, reducing the time it takes for players to respond to rapidly changing on-pitch situations - even by a few tenths of a second - was seen as yet another way in which Milan could extend the careers of stalwarts such as Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini, who played until they were 41. ""You can't train 37-year-old players to become physically faster, but you can train them to become faster in analysing situations,"" Demichelis says. ""If they can process data more quickly, they can make quicker decisions. That's why we were able to keep players going."" Clarence Seedorf was the embodiment of this ethos. Nicknamed 'The Professor' by team-mates, Seedorf regularly visited the Mind Room, which was seen as the psychological 'station' within a wider physical and mental 'circuit', otherwise known as the Milan Lab. The Dutchman's devotion to self-development would pay off in more ways than one.  Demichelis explains: ""The general director of the Milan Lab said to him, 'Wow, you're 31, but fitness-wise you're 26. Your biological age is much, much younger.' ""Seedorf said, 'Give me that print out'. He went to the CEO and said, 'Listen to what your lab is saying about me. I am 26, biologically speaking, so extend my contract for four more years.' And they did!"" Seedorf's age-defying physiology was perhaps aided by the daily six-minute health checks Demichelis introduced, as part of his role as the club's scientific coordinator. Combining GPS data with physiological measurements such as heart rate variability, the checks were used to develop a 'risk scoring' system. By monitoring changes to a player's score against a baseline, Demichelis was able to indicate potential susceptibility to injury and proactively apply treatment.  For example, a 10% drop in a player's score would generate a yellow flag, with a 20% reduction resulting in an orange flag. A decrease of 30% would signal a red flag and preventative treatment in the Mind Room. According to Demichelis, the methods he helped to introduce contributed to Milan reducing soft tissue injuries by 91% during his time at the club. It is a striking statistic made possible in part by the support the Mind Room received at both boardroom and managerial levels. ""I had the players on my side because we had the club on our side.,"" says Demichelis. ""We had the coach on our side because he believed in our philosophy. At the time, he told the players, 'You don't play football with your foot. You play football with your brain.' It's a big asset for a sport psychologist."" Ancelotti and Demichelis' departure in 2009 effectively ended the Mind Room's use at Milanello, but the Italian pair established an equivalent base at Stamford Bridge after joining Chelsea. Petr Cech was among a number of players who jumped at the chance of benefitting from the methods Demichelis deployed in Milan, which professor of psychology Marc Jones describes as genuinely innovative. ""The Mind Room was breaking new ground in terms of its integration into the training environment,"" says Jones, who has worked with a number of football clubs. ""The fact there was a physical presence within Milan's training ground was, without doubt, the exception rather than the rule."" Jones namechecks John Syer and Chris Connolly - who both provided psychological support for Tottenham players in the early 1980s - as quasi-forerunners of Demichelis, but you have to look back to 1958 and Brazil's World Cup-winning psychologist Joao Carvalhaes to find a similarly decorated example of a laboratory dedicated to cognitive skills training. While Milan's trophy haul goes some way to illustrating the impact of the Mind Room, the public testimony of the managers who backed Demichelis' brainchild is perhaps as telling. In his book 'The Immortals', Sacchi's appreciation of the laboratory is such that he describes Demichelis as ""a psychologist whom I needed more than the players"". Ancelotti, meanwhile, has spoken of the ""value"" Demichelis added to Chelsea ""with his experience of the Milan Lab"". The appreciation appears to be echoed by the players Demichelis worked with. In 2014, after his appointment as Milan manager, Seedorf lured his former colleague back to the San Siro.  The reunion was short-lived - Seedorf's managerial reign ended after four months - but the Mind Room's long-term legacy is well established. Epitomising the innovation that characterised Milan's off-pitch and on-pitch operation during the 1990s, the root of its success lay as much in an age-old premise as it did on modern technology, according to its founder. ""We improved skills that are very well defined: recovery, attention, stamina, speed in analysing situations and making decisions,"" says Demichelis. ""The difference is that our players were able to deploy these skills under pressure.  ""As a player, you need to have this ability if you're going to take a penalty in the World Cup final.""

risk appetite,Veteran journalist Robert Fisk dies aged 74,2024-09-15,2020-11-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54774539,"Veteran foreign correspondent Robert Fisk has died of a suspected stroke at the age of 74. He had been admitted to St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin after falling ill at his home on Friday, and died shortly afterwards, the Irish Times reported. Fisk won numerous awards for his reporting on the Middle East, starting from the 1970s. But he also drew controversy for his sharp criticism of the US and Israel, and of Western foreign policy. Covering wars in the Balkans, Middle East and North Africa for UK newspapers over five decades, Fisk was described by the New York Times, in 2005, as ""probably the most famous foreign correspondent in Britain"". Born in Maidstone, Kent in 1946, he later took Irish citizenship and had a home in Dalkey outside the capital Dublin. Irish President Michael D Higgins has expressed his ""great sadness"" about Fisk's death on Sunday. ""With his passing the world of journalism and informed commentary on the Middle East has lost one of its finest commentators,"" he said in a statement.  After starting his career at the Sunday Express, Fisk moved to Belfast in 1972 to cover the Troubles as Northern Ireland correspondent for the Times. He became the paper's Middle East correspondent in 1976.  Based in Beirut, he reported on the civil war in Lebanon, as well as the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Soviet war in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq War. He resigned from the Times in 1989 after a dispute with the owner Rupert Murdoch and moved to the Independent, where he worked for the remainder of his career. In the 1990s he interviewed Osama Bin Laden three times for the paper. He described him as a ""shy man"" and looking ""every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend"" in their first interview in 1993.  Robert Fisk was brave and controversial. He was a brilliant writer, who did his best work in wars, transporting readers to his side in some burning village. He relished making enemies, especially if they defended US or Israeli activities in the Middle East. Fisk could be obsessive. He collected bits of shrapnel, often American made and fired by Israel, so he could use serial numbers to trace their origins. When I visited Beirut from Jerusalem in the 1990s he served me gin and tonics on his balcony overlooking the Mediterranean in a Yasser Arafat souvenir glass. Robert was old school. He poked fun at the flak jacket I brought to Lebanon from the former Yugoslavia, sniffing it to check for slivovitza plum brandy. Journalism can be a dog-eat-dog trade. Fisk's colleagues were not always kind about his work. I was an admirer, eating up his vivid reportage from Beirut when I was at school, and was awestruck when first I met him. I'll miss Robert, his guts and his appetite for the fight, even though usually he followed a warm hello with some crack about the evils of television news or the BBC. After the 11 September attacks plotted by Bin Laden, Fisk, an Arabic speaker, spent the next two decades covering conflicts throughout the Middle East, including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.  He was highly regarded for his knowledge of, and deep experience in, the region, and often dismissed journalists who sat behind desks instead of venturing out into the field. But he also drew criticism for his attacks on Western policy in the Middle East and was accused of being lenient towards the Syrian government in his reporting of the country's long and brutal civil war. Articles by Fisk about the US and Israel were often considered highly controversial. He said the Trump administration's acceptance in 2019 of Israel's annexation of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights showed Israel had effectively annexed the US, and repeatedly accused Israel of committing war crimes against the Palestinians. In 2011 Fisk was forced to apologise after the Independent was successfully sued by the then-Saudi interior minister over a report that alleged the minister had ordered police to shoot and kill unarmed protesters, based on a document which turned out to be fake. Fisk married US journalist Lara Marlowe in 1994 but the pair divorced in 2006. He had no children. "
risk appetite,"Council pays family £8,250 after respite failure",2024-09-15,2020-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-55317260,"A council has paid a disabled man and his family £8,250 after failing to provide appropriate respite care. But Somerset County Council has refused to accept one of four recommendations made by the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) regarding the case.  The failure, between 2015 and 2018 when the man was a boy, caused his family ""significant distress"", it said. The LGO found no fault with the council's special educational needs provision.  The boy suffered from physical and learning disabilities, leading to ""excessive appetite and unpredictable violent outbursts"".  His three younger siblings were ""physically scared"" of him and his weight increased from 4.4 stone (28kg) in 2013 to 16.7 stone (106kg) in May 2018. Somerset County Council concluded in September 2015 that the family needed respite care overnight once a week and for one weekend a month. The LGO found that although the council provided some respite care, it was never as much as it said the family needed. For that error, it has paid the man's mother £2,000, each of his siblings £2,000 and the man £250. The LGO said the authority should remind social workers that they should consider involving police if children are being put at ""significant risk"" by their siblings in some circumstances.  But Somerset County Council said that it would have been ""entirely inappropriate"" in this case and others like it. Its cabinet agreed not to implement that recommendation at a meeting on Wednesday.  The authority has been asked to pay the compensation within a month of the report being published on 9 November. "
risk appetite,Relentless Woods reigns in Florida rain,2024-09-15,2020-05-25,Iain Carter,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/52796475,"Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning line up a putt on the sixth green Tiger Woods is fit and firing, Phil Mickelson is a born entertainer and two legendary NFL quarterbacks can play half-decent golf.  Furthermore, Justin Thomas will have a big future in broadcasting if he ever needs it. Despite prolonged Floridian downpours that threatened golf's second comeback event, there was much to enjoy from a contest that pitted Woods and Peyton Manning against Mickelson and Tom Brady in the The Match (2). A total of $20m (£16.4m) was raised for Covid-19-related charities as Sunday's event proved far more worthwhile than its grubby forerunner, when Mickelson beat Woods to pocket $9m in November 2018. This was worthy because of the charitable aspect but it was enjoyable live sport in its own right. It was more watchable than the previous week's initial comeback event featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff. But as the rain pelted down it did not get off to the most promising start.  ""Let's have fun gentlemen,"" said Mickelson, before carving a wild drive left of the fairway and sandy waste that protected that flank of the opening hole. NFL greats Brady and Manning, who were playing off handicaps of 11 and nine respectively - both three shots above their official handicaps because of the difficulty of the course - struggled with their tee shots and in the early exchanges only Woods seemed capable of hitting the ball in the correct direction on the exclusive Medalist course where he is a member. This was the first time we had seen the Masters champion play since 16 February. More back trouble forced the 44-year-old to pull out of March dates at Bay Hill and then the Players Championship, which was abandoned after one round because of the coronavirus crisis. Here he resembled the man who plotted his way to a 15th major title at Augusta just over a year ago. Relentlessly he found fairway after fairway. On-board cameras provided gum-chewing close-ups when Woods drove his cart between shots. The brisk thoroughness with which he dried grips on his clubs was striking - it was the first time most people will have seen him without a caddie. Indeed, it was quite a thing to see him performing flag duties for his partner as well, but the most significant aspect was that Woods looked in control of his game and his body despite a potentially debilitating deluge.  Each player had their own individual golf cart to drive themselves around the course There was plenty more to take in. Mickelson's detailed explanation before executing a glorious chip on the second was a wonderful demonstration of his short-game mastery. Meanwhile his NFL superstar partner struggled badly. Via social media, US Open and PGA champion Brooks Koepka pledged $100,000 for a Brady par, while NBA legend Charles Barkley taunted from the commentary booth. Then, out of nowhere, on the seventh hole the Tampa Bay quarterback despatched his fourth shot, a 100-yard wedge, on to the green and the ball spun back into the hole for an extraordinary birdie.   Brady was back in the game, giving Barkley the benefit of his views and within minutes chatting to Koepka who joined the coverage on the phone. This was typical of a high-quality production. It succeeded despite the weather and the strictures of social distancing for the crews on the course.  But there were times when the players struggled to contain ingrained instincts and stick to non-contact protocols aimed at preventing coronavirus transmission. This may prove an issue when the PGA Tour returns on 11 June in Texas.  Frequent gambling captions offering odds on what might happen next showed the direction American golf is currently taking. It is a decent wager these will become a staple on the PGA Tour when it capitalises on relaxed US betting rules. The only other downside was pace of play.  It took three hours to cover the front nine when the better-ball format was used.   When they switched to greensome, where alternate shots were played after choosing the more favourable drive, the action was quicker and more absorbing. Woods and Manning were three up when Mickelson detailed how he would despatch his tee shot on the short par-four 11th. Once again he followed his words to the letter and found the green in spectacular style. Brady then slotted the putt for an eagle two. It was fabulous fare which surely reminded older viewers in the UK of the BBC pro-celebrity series that occupied prime-time TV slots in the 1980s. (If you don't believe me, pop 'Terry Wogan putt' into your search engine.) Suddenly there was a genuine contest being played at decent pace as the golfers sought to finish before darkness set in. Eventually Woods and Manning prevailed on the final hole. Brady had made a mess of his final tee shot. ""That's the TB we remember from the front nine,"" quipped Thomas, the world number four, who proved a superb on-course commentator. The 2017 US PGA champion spoke with wit and authority and was prepared to tell interesting stories. Aged 27, he possesses attributes likely to make him one of the game's big characters in coming years. By putting together four of the most recognisable names in American sport, this event succeeded in showcasing golf in many of its most interesting guises. We saw hopeless and inspired play from the hackers and true expertise from elite professionals. It certainly whetted the appetite for the return of the competitive game which is due at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas next month."

Players have so often desperately tried to avoid loss of form, fitness and the distractions of life going into the week of this showpiece event, notably during that agonising wait between the semi-final and final. Much like in 2020, there is another factor for players to consider amid the pandemic. With Covid-19 cases continuing to rise around the country, there has been an even more concerted effort to stay fit and well. No-one wants to miss this grandest of occasions. ""Covid's flying about everywhere in our area and probably across the country the levels are increasing, so we had a chat about two or three weeks ago to limit social gatherings,"" Tigers back-rower Adam Milner told the 5 Live rugby league podcast. ""So, no going to restaurants or going to pubs, and our captain Michael Shenton has taken his kids out of school because he didn't want the risk as you see schools being shut down and 'bubbles' bursting. ""Dan Sarginson missed out on the final last year [for Salford] and you don't want to be in that situation. ""The full squad, and I probably speak on behalf of St Helens too, have been extremely strict in what they're doing off the field."" Saints prop Kyle Amor added: ""You have to make subtle changes as to how you are around the training facility. Things you put in place like hand-gelling and when you're out and about really, thinking about where you are going and avoiding places you don't necessarily need to go to. ""I think that's something we've done as a group for a very long time, but, like Adam said, you don't necessarily have to be in a restaurant or a pub to catch it and you can get it just going to your local shop. ""Players and partners have taken extra precautions over the past couple of weeks. ""My wife is a primary school teacher so there's not really a lot I could do about it in certain respects. She can't stop going to work because I play rugby league - it doesn't happen. ""But we've all got through it and hopefully it'll all play its part in a good spectacle on Saturday.""

Saints are bidding to end a 13-year wait for the cup while, for Castleford, skipper Shenton was still in his mother's womb when the Tigers last won it 35 years ago. Amor, while acknowledging the past, was keen to look forward as Saints can add the cup to back-to-back Grand Final triumphs and cement their place in folklore. Castleford have the departure of head coach Daryl Powell and several players at the end of the season as motivation, while heroes of 1986 such as final try-scorer Tony Marchant have also offered good luck wishes and shared their memories with the squad. Former Challenge Cup-winning coach John Kear, himself a Castleford lad and former player, said the ingredients are ""mouth-watering"". ""It'll be a great game. Saints are renowned for playing some really good open football, and Cas are referred to as 'Classy Cas' and take great pride in that,"" he added. ""Saints have now got a steely defence, to go with some tremendous rugby league players and it's made for an outstanding final. ""I don't think it could have been written any better in the stars. Both are very hungry despite what Kyle was saying about not looking back. ""You always look back, and it has been a fair bit of time for Saints, but for Cas it has been a heck of a lot of time. ""Daryl, his coaches and his players will be making sure they perform really well to rectify the recent final in 2014 when they froze on the big stage. ""I'm pretty certain they won't freeze on the big stage this time and I think it'll be a mouth-watering clash, an excellent game and, for everybody involved, they'll have the extra zing of the crowd. ""Last year's final was a great rugby league final with regards to the standard of play, but it missed something. Whereas this, with the fans there, makes you salivate. It's going to be tremendous."" The scenes from England's Euros games at Wembley offer hope for a big crowd for Saturday's game After a year of games being played behind closed doors, particularly major events such as the Grand Final and the Challenge Cup, Saturday's test event status has opened up the potential of a 45,000-strong attendance. The semi-final triple-header at Leigh was played before limited crowds, while most clubs have managed to host up to 4,000 spectators depending on capacity. It will be the biggest rugby league attendance in this country since the 2019 Grand Final at Old Trafford, and, having seen the Euro 2020 matches played before big crowds at the stadium, it has whetted the appetite. Amor added: ""It felt flat with no crowds, and sometimes it was difficult to get motivated beforehand. It might not sound like the greatest thing to say as a professional sportsman, for what you were about to do. ""It's alright once you've kicked off and you get into it, you sort of forget about the crowd anyway then. You had to think, I've got a game of Super League ahead of me now, and try to find something. ""It's great.

risk appetite,Eubank Jr open to Canelo fight,2024-09-15,2020-07-07,Kal Sajad,https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/53258229,"In this week's Fight Talk we look at Chris Eubank Jr as a potential opponent for Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez after Billy Joe Saunders rules himself out of a September bout, Prince Naseem Hamed's son bids to follow in his father's footsteps and Luke Campbell vows to knock out Ryan Garcia.  Britain's WBO super-middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders says he will not be fighting Mexican pound-for-pound star Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez next.  And it seems he means it, adding that ""not even a billion pounds"" would change his mind.  Saunders was close to agreeing a deal to fight Canelo earlier this year before the coronavirus outbreak.  And with the Mexican Canelo still searching for his next opponent, Saunders told the Athletic that a September bout would not give him enough time to be fight-ready.  ""Let me get ready, let me win,"" Saunders said.  He also told IFL TV, external that his training has been hampered by the Covid-19 lockdown.    ""There were no gyms, nothing for me to go here and there to train. To fight that magnitude of fight you need to 110% ready,"" Saunders said.  Canelo has a record of 53 wins, two draws and one loss - to Floyd Mayweather in 2013.  Five of his wins have come against Brits: Matthew Hatton, Ryan Rhodes, Amir Khan, Liam Smith and Rocky Fielding.  But even with Saunders ruling himself out, there's still every chance there could be a sixth British opponent for Canelo.  First, Saunders' long-time rival Chris Eubank Jr threw his name into the mix… Eubank Jr was last in action when he beat Matt Korobov by technical knockout in December, the Russian suffering a shoulder injury in the second round.  Former world-title challenger John Ryder, who lost to Liverpool's WBA super-middleweight champion Callum Smith in November, is doing what he can to reel Canelo in…  He told Sky Sports that his promoter Eddie Hearn has made contact with Canelo's team.   Ryder has become a bit of a fan-favourite after many thought he was unlucky not to be awarded the win against Smith and feel he is deserving of a career-high payday against Canelo… And Smith, who was also in the running to take on Canelo earlier this year, is still game for the fight.  ""I'd take it in a heartbeat,"" he told Chris Mannix's Sports Illustrated podcast.  Of course, Canelo has other options. A trilogy fight with Kazakhstan's Gennady Golovkin might not whet the appetite with hardcore fans, but would still be lucrative for both boxers. Although that fight is unlikely to happen behind closed doors.  Boxing Scene reported that Ukraine's Sergiy Derevyanchenko has already been offered a contract to fight Canelo, while Canada's David Lemieux and Japan's Ryota Murata have also been linked.  Listen to the latest episode of 5 Live Boxing with Costello & Bunce Prince Naseem Hamed is undoubtedly one of the greatest British fighters of all time. The Sheffield-born former world featherweight champion's flamboyance and arrogance both in and out of the ring turned him into a huge pay-per-view star.  And now there is a new prince mapping his own journey to the throne as Hamed's 20-year-old son, Aadam Hamed, is set to turn professional.  Frank Warren, who promoted Prince Naz, said: ""If he has his old man's ability, then he should be OK.""  Meanwhile, Matchroom Boxing's Eddie Hearn highlighted the offspring of other famous boxers who have gone on to carve out their own careers.  ""Conor Benn, with us, has been fantastic and Chris Eubank Jr has been great entertainment over the years,"" Hearn said.  ""Naz's son? Let's see what he's got. It's hard for anybody to follow in the footsteps of a successful father.""   Lightweight contender Luke Campbell must be up there with the best active British fighters not to win a world title. The London 2012 Olympic gold medallist has twice challenged for world honours, losing to Jorge Linares in 2017 and Vasiliy Lomachenko in August 2019. The WBC has now ordered Campbell to fight Ryan Garcia for an interim belt, with the winner going on to contend for a full world title.  Garcia, 22, is one of the hottest prospects in boxing and regularly entertains his already huge social media fanbase (over 6.5m Instagram followers) with clips like this...  Time will tell if Campbell-Garcia materialises, but the Brit and his trainer are both up for it...  Campbell told Boxing Social, external that he'll knock out Garcia, while some boxing fans on Twitter questioned whether Garcia would risk his undefeated record of 20 consecutive wins by taking on someone as experienced as Campbell.

risk appetite,"'When your spleen is gone, it's gone'",2024-09-15,2017-11-03,Richard Conway,https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/41862016,"Ruby Walsh has ridden some of National Hunt racing's best-known performers including Kauto Star, Denman, Master Minded and Big Buck's but victory on Irish chaser Papillon to win the Grand National at his first attempt in 2000 remains his favourite achievement It is a career that has delivered over 2,000 race victories. Now aged 38, Ruby Walsh is an elite jockey who has been at the forefront of his sport for over two decades - and has a particular attitude to the physical pain his occupation regularly delivers. As the National Hunt season gets under way, BBC Sport travelled to County Kildare, Ireland, to talk to the two-time Grand National winner, his sister Katie - herself a jockey - and his father, Ted, a trainer and television pundit. It took a total of nine minutes and nine seconds and, some 17 years later, it remains the greatest race of Ruby Walsh's career. The 2000 Grand National was the then 20-year-old's first attempt at the daunting course of more than four miles; a first go at navigating its notorious fences, such as Becher's Brook and the Canal Turn. On board Papillon - a 10-1 shot, trained by his father, Ted - Ruby won a thrilling race, external by just one and a quarter lengths from Mely Moss.   More success would come in later years. Another National triumph on Hedgehunter in 2005 and then multiple wins in the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the King George VI chase on the legendary Kauto Star. But it is that April afternoon in 2000, cheered to the rafters by a huge Aintree crowd, that he insists can never be beaten. ""You can go to the Gold Cup on Kauto Star and he's 6-4, nearly even money, to win. And even though it's the Gold Cup, he's the best horse. ""You do your job right, you nail this and you've got a great chance of winning. ""In the National, it's unique. It doesn't matter if you're even money or 20-1, you basically have the same chance as everyone else of getting to the back of the third fence.""  Richard Conway joins the Walsh family around the breakfast table At the family breakfast table, after a morning on the gallops with Ted's current crop of horses, the conversation flows with talk of how the current prospects are faring and the weekend's football results.  The discussion soon returns to the Grand National and Katie, who finished third on Seabass in 2012, is in agreement with her brother on its timeless appeal.  She says: ""That's what makes it special. You line up there, 40 of you. And I'm not kidding you, everyone at that start, and I don't care what you're on, everyone says 'I've got a chance of winning this'.""  ""I'll tell you what's a worse thing,"" says Ruby, interjecting.  ""When you line up at the start and you think 'I've not a chance of getting to Becher's.""  The pair erupt in laughter at their memories of Aintree and their smiles reveal the passion they have for both the race and their sport.   The walls of Ted's kitchen carry portraits of the great horses the family has nurtured and trained over the years. Papillion, naturally, takes pride of place.  This is not a museum to past glories though. The talk over the scrambled eggs, toast, bacon and pots of tea prepared by Ted's wife, Helen, is about the promise of the new National Hunt season.   ""This is an exciting time of year,"" says Katie.   ""All the horses are back in and there's new recruits. So you don't really know if something's good or if everything's good. It's nice to find out what you have for the rest of the season.""  Father and son deep in conversation at Leopardstown in 2013 Ted, in his own inimitable way, puts the anticipation of discovering if there's a potential Cheltenham or Aintree contender in the yard somewhat differently.  ""You have a fair idea at an early stage,"" he says.  ""It's like kids going to school. One fella stands out very early. He picks up the teacher's teachings quicker than the others. He can spell 'elephant' while the others can spell 'cat'.  ""All of a sudden you think, 'he's a bit exceptional'.  ""Now the others may catch up. He may not get beyond the stage of 'elephant'.  ""But sometimes, before you know where you are, he's spelling 'Constantinople'. That's when you know, this one's a little bit different to the rest.""  There are only ever 16 horses at one time in Ted's yard, who also buys and sells his equine stock to make a living.  He has two horses in training from the famous Irish owner, gambler and philanthropist JP McManus but there's recognition that some trainers, like his countryman Willie Mullins, operate on a different level. ""We're a cornershop to his Tesco's,"" Ted remarks.  Ruby Walsh rode Kauto Star to Cheltenham Gold Cup victory in 2007 and 2009 The finances are crucial in what can be a tough business, especially in leaner years. However, it is the thrill of winning a big race that truly separates this trade from a regular nine to five job.   ""It's the accomplishment, the buzz, the thrill of doing it. The spin-off afterwards financially might be good but that's not what you're thinking of. You're thinking, 'I've prepared this horse for this big day and it's landed'. That's doesn't fade. It never goes away,"" says Ted.  Many would see getting up at dawn every day to muck out stables and prepare the horses his owners have entrusted to him as hard work.   Passion for racing transcends such thoughts, it seems.  ""We're all very lucky, we get up every morning to do something that we absolutely love,"" says Katie.  ""There's a lot of people who hate their jobs, don't want to go to work and are constantly looking for a way out.  ""Some people go through this life and all they want to do is milk the system and get what they're entitled to. And I feel sorry for them. They've no drive, no ambition. It's a sad existence.""  Somewhere amongst the horses' hooves is Ruby Walsh, having fallen off Kauto Star during the 2006 Cheltenham Festival It's a work ethic that extends to a shared attitude to pain and dealing with injuries, a common occupational hazard when steering a horse over the jumps at speeds of up to 40mph.  Ruby has sustained multiple broken bones throughout his career but sees it as just another obstacle he must clear in order to sustain success.  ""There are loads of things that people do that are high-risk,"" he says.   ""Would I join the army or the navy? You must be off your rocker.""  Losing your spleen, which occurred after falling at Cheltenham in 2008, would make many less hardy personalities think twice about carrying on. The fact that he was back riding within a month of the operation surely demonstrates that jockeys are a different breed from other sportsmen and women.  ""When your spleen is gone, it's gone. It's not coming back,"" he says. ""You don't need it. It would have been worse if it was kidney or my bladder. But it was my spleen that ruptured. They just took it out. Move on. It's not a huge drama. Take an antibiotic and a few injections and away you go.""  It would be easy to view this as a gung-ho, macho attitude. Instead, it's clear this way of thinking is the cold reality, in both sporting terms and economically, of what it takes to survive at the very top.  ""As long as it's not your brain or your neck, the rest will heal,"" Ruby adds. With a glint in his eye there's a suggestion other sports could benefit from that mindset. ""When you look at the massive contracts in other sports, do you make it more 'pay for play'? Do lads suddenly stand up a little bit quicker? Who knows?"" Katie Walsh leads on Seabass over the final fence at the 2012 Grand National before being beaten into third by Neptune Collonges and SunnyHillBoy. This is the best finish by a female jockey in the race. Staying fit, surviving the falls and recovering quickly when injured have helped him land some of the biggest prizes in jump racing, on some of the sport's most memorable horses. Kauto Star, Denman, Hurricane Fly, Quevega, Vautour, Hedgehunter, Annie Power, Un de Sceaux and Big Bucks are just some he has ridden into the history books. And yet, in common with other athletes at the very top of their discipline, there is an insatiable appetite and drive to keep on winning. What is left now to achieve? ""More,"" is the succinct answer. ""I never set out to achieve specifically what I've achieved. I was hoping to ride a winner, and then to ride another one and then as many as I could. You keep rolling on and on and on. You don't want to stop. There's no target. It's just to keep going and trying to get a notch further ahead."" As for Katie, there's a sense of unfinished business when it comes to the Grand National. A third on Seabass in 2012 was perhaps a taste of what is possible in the future. ""I'd love to win it. Of course I would. Who wouldn't?"" she smiles. The new season awaits with all its twists and turns. But no matter what happens, the Walsh family's enduring love for racing is a certainty.

Primed for a bold bid, although no top weight has won since Red Rum in the 1970s, and would be oldest winner for nearly a century. His 21-year-old jockey, whose father trained two National winners - Earth Summit (1998) and Bindaree (2002) - is a rising star who was aged just 14 when Tidal Bay won his first race in 2006. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 16-1 2 132-54U1  LONG RUN (FR)   9 11-09  Nicky Henderson Sam Waley-Cohen  Born 5 April, 2005. Defeated equine greats Denman and Kauto Star when winning 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup but patchy form this season. Horse owned by father of the jockey, who is an amateur but has best record over National fences of any in race - having won other contests four times, plus a second, fourth and fifth in the big race. A friend of Kate Middleton, he has initials etched in saddle in memory of brother Tom, who died aged 20 from cancer. Rating: 8/10 Odds: 16-1 3 13-606034 HUNT BALL (IRE)   9 11-07   Nicky Henderson Andrew Tinkler  Champion trainer still seeking first Grand National win. Was most improved horse in training three seasons ago and won at Cheltenham Festival for former trainer Kieran Burke but colourful ex-owner Anthony Knott later caused controversy when running the horse with a bookmaker's sign stencilled on his behind. Later sold to America, and has shaped promisingly on return to UK although stable jockey has picked Triolo D'Alene. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 80-1 4 301-1310  TRIOLO D'ALENE (FR) 7 11-06  Nicky Henderson Barry Geraghty Won the Hennessy at Newbury, then disappointed in Gold Cup. Trainer holds record for number of victories at Cheltenham Festival, but seven of his last 17 National runners have fallen at the first. Irish jockey one of the best around and scored aboard Monty's Pass in 2003. The old saying is 'weight stops trains' and question is whether the French-bred has enough puff to see off rivals with a lower burden. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 22-1 5 1113-22  ROCKY CREEK (IRE) 8 11-05  Paul Nicholls Noel Fehily  Runner-up to Triolo D'Alene in the Hennessy and highly regarded by trainer, who won the National with Neptune Collonges in a photo finish two years ago. Rocky Creek has been hindered by a few niggles this season, including piles and ringworm, but his form is solid. Bidding to become the first horse younger than nine to win the race since Bindaree (who was also eight) landed the spoils in 2002.

Has run well at Aintree before, winning the competitive Mildmay Novices' Chase for County Wexford trainer three years ago. Owned by Gigginstown House Stud, which was founded by airline boss Michael O'Leary. Jockey will be hoping for a comfortable ride, with plenty of room and to arrive at the right time.

He retains 18-time champion jockey AP McCoy as rider of his horses. McCoy picked Colbert Station last year, and his mount travelled well before departing at The Chair. Jockey has opted for Double Seven this time. Trainer is the father of sidelined jockey Ruby Walsh. The pair triumphed with Papillon in 2000. Replacement Mark no relation. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1 8 22P52-U4 WALKON (FR)   9 11-00 Alan King Wayne Hutchison  Likely to be popular with the red half of Liverpool, fond of the refrain 'Walk On' as a line in the Anfield football club's anthem You'll Never Walk Alone. You never know, perhaps it might be fate, with the Reds chasing a Premier League title and Aintree paying tribute to Hillsborough victims and campaigners 25 years on from the tragedy where 96 fans died. Walkon has won at the Merseyside track before - a juvenile hurdle in 2009. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 50-1 9 20P-1111 BALTHAZAR KING (IRE) 10 10-13 Philip Hobbs Richard Johnson  There would be few more popular winners in the jockeys' weighing room than if perennial title runner-up Richard Johnson finally landed the world's most famous steeplechase at the 18th attempt. He was narrowly denied on What's Up Boys 12 years ago. Boasts a decent chance on Cheltenham Festival cross-country chase winner, who would relish drying conditions and good ground. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1 10 P06-52P0 WAYWARD PRINCE 10 10-13  Hilary Parrott Jack Doyle Boasts some useful form, particularly when racking up a hat-trick of victories in the 2010-11 season, which culminated in a close third in the RSA Chase at the Cheltenham Festival under AP McCoy for previous trainer Ian Williams. Twice a winner in other races at Aintree and a Charlie Hall Chase runner-up to the talented Harry Topper earlier this season, although subsequent runs have been more wayward than regal. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1 11 -4503112  MR MOONSHINE (IRE) 10 10-12  Sue Smith Ryan Mania  Represents same trainer, jockey and owners as last year's 66-1 winner Auroras Encore. Scottish jockey was taken to hospital the next day following a nasty fall at Hexham races. Now fully recovered, he will once again ride for the trainer married to former showjumper Harvey Smith. Mr Moonshine was pulled up four fences from home last year but then third to Chance Du Roy in the Becher Chase over the National fences in December, and has won twice since. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1 12 6203-020 TEAFORTHREE (IRE) 10 10-12  Rebecca Curtis Nick Scholfield  It's easy to see Teaforthree being in the first three. Third last year, he was narrow runner-up to Monbeg Dude in the 2012 Welsh National. Looked potential winner 12 months ago before being passed late on, but has 5lb less weight to carry. Would be first Welsh-trained victor since Kirkland in 1905, but third in six years for a female trainer. Prepared with run in Cheltenham Gold Cup, where the horse finished eighth. Rating: 8/10 Odds: 12-1 13 10-501U  ACROSS THE BAY (IRE) 10 10-11  Donald McCain Henry Brooke Ran well at the front for a long way last year before fading to finish 14th. Trainer won the race with Ballabriggs in 2011, and his father Donald 'Ginger' McCain was successful four times (a 1970s treble for Red Rum then Amberleigh House 2004). Jockey takes to the big stage after impressing producers with a moody performance in a TV trailer for the National. Runs for a syndicate of Merseyside owners. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 50-1 14 F111116  DOUBLE SEVEN (IRE) 8 10-11  Martin Brassil IRE AP McCoy Double Seven is number 14 on the racecard. How about that? Trainer won the 2006 National with Numbersixvalverde. Double Seven racked up five wins earlier in the season and sure to be well backed with 18-time champion AP McCoy booked. Jockey gained his sole success in the big race at 15th attempt aboard Don't Push It four years ago and may not have too many rides in the contest left. He turns 40 next month.

Hasn't sparkled since changing stables and refused to race on one occasion, so his appetite for this test has to be taken on trust. However, if you believe in the adage 'horses for courses' you might go into battle with this one. Jockey's dad Brendan Sr rode Rhyme 'N Reason to victory in 1988.

Trainer, whose stable includes former champion chaser Sizing Europe, reports the horse schooled well over Grand National-style fences.

Approaching twilight of a career in which he has scored victories at big prices. Jockey won the Cheltenham Gold Cup on 20-1 chance Lord Windermere and is thriving after a nightmare start to the year when he was ditched by Gigginstown House Stud for younger jockey Bryan Cooper.

Chance may have gone, although should not be dismissed for Ireland's dominant trainer, who won the National with Hedgehunter in 2005. Jockey comes in for the ride after Ruby Walsh was sidelined following a fall at last month's Cheltenham Festival. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1 19 13P-3415 MONBEG DUDE (IRE) 9 10-09 Michael Scudamore Paul Carberry  Winner of Welsh National in January 2013, owned by trainer along with rugby union internationals Mike Tindall, James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson. Liable to hit the odd obstacle, 'The Dude' has been sent for schooling sessions, supervised by Tindall's wife Zara, a leading equestrian rider and the Queen's grand-daughter.

Marathon tip should pose no fear as CV includes a victory over four miles and a furlong. Ran well again when third to Balthazar King at the Cheltenham Festival despite having a head cold in the run-up, although this represents step into the big league. Thought to prefer good to soft ground so trainer will be hoping for a few showers in the build-up to the race.

Was sidelined for 18 months with tendon injury and switched stables. In eight rides over the National fences, 41-year-old jockey has completed the course six times including a third place on Simply Gifted (2005). Respected trainer won the National with Don't Push It in 2010.

One of four greys in the race this year, along with Walkon, Rose Of The Moon and stablemate Swing Bill. Only two greys have won since the 1870s - Nicolas Silver in 1961 and Neptune Collonges two years ago.

Would appreciate rain to soften the ground conditions. Jockey had biggest win of his career when riding Sire De Grugy to victory in the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham on 12 March. Says he would not swap the ride for any other in the race. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1 24 4UP-261  THE RAINBOW HUNTER 10 10-07 Kim Bailey Aidan Coleman Second horse past the post last year, albeit without his rider, who says he took to the fences well before he was unseated at the Canal Turn. Impressive Doncaster win last time out suggests pot of gold may be in reach for The Rainbow Hunter. Jockey missed out on 100-1 winner Mon Mome in 2009 when choosing to ride Stan instead.  Trainer scored with Mr Frisk in 1990 and has enjoyed a revival in recent years after some leaner times.

Fell at the Cheltenham Festival last month. Breeding suggests a dry spell and good ground would help. Jockey has yet to get round in three attempts in the National, but says of his 2014 mount: ""He's a good ride to get. He's big and gives me the feel of a nice horse.""

No seven-year-old has won since Bogskar in 1940. Horse owned by Paul and Clare Rooney. He founded an estate agents in 1981 which is now part of the Arun Estates network, worth an estimated £80m.

Winner of the Ulster National has been well backed in recent days. Formerly trained in Ireland by Philip Fenton, who faces a drugs case after banned steroids were seized from his yard.

Has scored nine times from 24 outings since making the switch. While he is not one of the likeliest victors, the 10-strong syndicate that owns the gelding hope he continues a unique record - he has won on his third start each season since he went jumping.

Only run over the National fences ended at the first when he fell in the Becher Chase behind Chance Du Roy in December. Katie Walsh was given the ride after Mikey Fogarty was injured on Friday.

Only 10th in Becher Chase at Aintree on seasonal return but won at Wetherby in January. Jockey is a son of Aintree racecourse chairman Lord Daresbury, who as Peter Greenall was champion amateur rider in 1976-77.

risk appetite,'Change the rules and Bryson will still win',2024-09-15,2020-09-21,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/54241284,"DeChambeau was the only player to finish under par at the 2020 US Open New US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau will find ways to win even if golf's rule makers try to guard against his power off the tee, his coach says. American DeChambeau won his first major by six shots at the testing Winged Foot course in New York on Sunday. The 27-year-old averaged 325-yards with his driver, prompting calls for golf's authorities to tame such big hitting. ""Try to make it tough for Bryson and I'm telling you he will figure out how to beat you,"" said his coach Mike Schy. 'Is it time to tackle golf's power issue?' Schy told BBC World Service: ""The reality is if you make it so Bryson can't play he will figure it out.  ""They can easily change this whole situation by scaling the rough on courses and they aren't talking about that. ""Instead of having the same rough 200 yards out from the green, you scale it. At 200 yards it's an inch and a half deep. At 60 yards it's six or seven inches deep. The game can go back to strategy and risk and reward if you scale the rough in the right way. ""If you scale the rough it becomes back to how it used to be."" England's Ian Poulter and others gave DeChambeau credit for following through on his decision to change his game DeChambeau's display intensified calls for golf's decision makers to tackle big hitting by changing courses, the design of clubs or even golf balls.  The R&A and USGA already have a Distance Insights project in place to look at the issue but its work has been halted by the Covid-19 pandemic. DeChambeau was the only player to break par at Winged Foot and he did so by attacking off the tee and accepting he would at times find rough.  He found just 23 of 56 fairways from the tee during his four rounds - the lowest proportion of any US Open champion. Rory McIlroy said to win while finding so few fairways was ""really hard to wrap my head around"". BBC Sport golf correspondent Iain Carter said DeChambeau had ""ripped up the golfing playbook"" but that it was ""time to act"" when finding fairways no longer matters at a major tournament. Notably, DeChambeau's win followed widespread coverage of a decision to change his body shape by adding 20lbs in bulk during the coronavirus lockdown. Schy says he is happy for his player to gain confidence in any way he wishes but feels his first major win owed more to his play on the green and his comfort in using an arm-lock putter. ""He owned that putter and I knew once he owned that it was only a matter of time that he would become a great putter,"" added Schy. ""I hope people don't look past that. To win a major you have to be a great putter and he is.  ""I'd say he's probably the best putter in the world right now."" Schy says DeChambeau has historically ""struggled with celebrating"" due to his appetite for work but insists he will push him to enjoy his US Open success for longer. Their quest to unlock further improvement will see them work with a 48-inch driver shaft in the coming weeks before the re-arranged 2020 Masters takes place at Augusta National from 12 November. ""Augusta, as far as the driving goes, it suits him extremely well as they don't have the rough like a US Open,"" Schy added.  ""Precision into the green will be interesting. That has been his weakness in the last three months. When you get to Augusta that has to become better."""
risk appetite,Asian hornet nest found and destroyed in city,2024-09-15,2023-07-28,By Brodie Owen,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66337274,"An Asian hornet nest has been found and destroyed in Devon. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the nest was destroyed after surveillance in Plymouth. The surveillance by the National Bee Unit followed confirmed sightings in the city. UK Chief Plant and Bee Health Officer Nicola Spence urged people to report sightings of the invasive insect as soon as possible. The insect poses no greater risk to human health than native wasps and hornets. However, they prey on pollinating insects such as honey bees and can cause major damage to colonies. Ms Spence urged beekeepers to remain vigilant. ""By ensuring we are alerted to possible sightings as early as possible, we can take swift and effective action to stamp out the threat posed by Asian hornets,"" she said. ""That's why we are working at speed to locate and investigate any nests in the area following the confirmed sightings in Plymouth. ""While the Asian hornet poses no greater risk to human health than other wasps or hornets, they can cause damage to honey bee colonies and other beneficial insects."" Gerry Stuart, chairman of the Devon-based Asian Hornet Action Team, said the discovery of a nest in Plymouth was concerning. He said the spread of the insect in the UK would be a ""nightmare"". ""They are so destructive - they consume and move on,"" he said. ""It's very important to realise how precious our pollinators are - not just bees, but hoverflies, butterflies and other pollinators too. ""We are talking about devastation of crops and, if that's affected, it could certainly affect us.""  The Natural History Museum said Asian hornet queens are about 3cm (1.2in) in length and workers about 2.5cm (1in). Their legs transition from brown to yellow at the ends and they have an orange face. Anyone who sees an Asian hornet is urged to report it using Defra's online form or via the app Asian Hornet Watch. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

It comes as some are expressing concern about young children playing Fortnite. Launched in June 2017, Fortnite now has 125 million players around the globe, according to Epic. Its most popular format, Battle Royale, pits 100 players against each other, some of whom are in small teams, to see who is the last person standing. The game is free, but players can spend real money on in-app purchases including skins to customise player avatars. Announcing the details of the World Cup in a blogpost, the company said: ""We're getting behind competitive play in a big way, but our approach will be different - we plan to be more inclusive, and focused on the joy of playing and watching the game. ""We'll be supporting community organised events, online events, and major organised competitions all over the world, where anyone can participate, and anyone can win."" ""This is for you, the players. Qualifications for the Fortnite World Cup will be based on merit. Epic will not be selling teams or franchises, and won't allow third-party leagues to do so either."" The play would focus on individuals and duos but ""there'll be plenty of opportunities to squad-up in competition, too"", it added. The qualifiers will begin in autumn 2018, with the World Cup event due to take place in late 2019. According to e-sports analyst Newzoo, organised, competitive computer gaming will generate more than £1bn in global revenue and almost double its audience to nearly 600 million people by 2020, giving it the potential to become one of the top five sports in the world. There is huge appetite for Fortnite. Last month, a tournament held by one of the game's most famous streamers, Ninja, saw more than 600,000 concurrent viewers on game streaming site Twitch. The game has an age classification of 12-plus but is increasingly attracting younger children, leading some to question whether it is suitable for such a young demographic. Alastair Graham, chief executive of online age verification company AgeChecked, said: ""[The] dangers of under-age children playing online games such as Fortnite are that it risks desensitising young children to mature themes such as gun violence, as well as putting them at risk of being scammed or groomed online by their elders.""

risk appetite,Travelling at Christmas: What you need to know,2024-09-15,2020-11-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55055297,"Christmas is often a frantic time for travel, with people rushing across the UK to be with loved ones for the holiday season.  But now that Covid restrictions will be eased from 23 to 27 December, public transport is expected to be even busier than normal, as travel for the holidays is compressed into a five-day window.  And this year there will be no squeezing on to a packed train carriage. Trains, coaches and planes are all running at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing, with tickets often needing to be booked in advance.  The prospect of public transport being unable to cope with demand has prompted the government to appoint a Christmas travel tsar - Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy. He is assessing whether road, rail and air networks are prepared enough for the onslaught of travellers during the festive window.   Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced a series of measures to minimise disruption during the travel window, including clearing roadworks, postponing rail upgrades and cutting some rail ticket charges. Mr Shapps said Sir Peter was carrying out a ""rigorous assessment"" of transport services to ensure ""everything possible is being done to help"". He urged people to ""closely consider their journey, plan and book ahead"". So what should you do if you're going to travel this year to spend Christmas with loved ones, and how might services be affected? As is standard every year, there are no train services running on Christmas Day and only a very limited number of services running on a small number of routes on Boxing Day. But for the days passengers can travel, they are being urged to book ahead and avoid busy times due to the combination of reduced capacity and the limited travel window. And some operators will prevent passengers from boarding without a pre-booked ticket. There have already been reports of advance tickets selling out or going for exorbitant prices.  The good news is that operators say more advance tickets will soon be available, blaming the current shortage on changes to the timetable caused by the pandemic.  But the bad news is that tickets are expected to sell fast.  The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, advised people to keep checking for tickets and consider signing up for notifications from rail operators, some of whom will confirm when more fares are available. Avanti West Coast, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line, has said it is suspending peak fares between 18 December and the end of the year to help maintain social distancing on its trains.  This will slash the cost of many journeys on its network - for example, passengers buying a fully-flexible fare from Manchester to London during what is usually a peak period will be charged £64.40 instead of £180. Meanwhile, under the government's latest Christmas travel plans, admin fees of up to £10 for changing advance tickets are being waived to encourage people to comply with the new restrictions. This applies to tickets that were bought for specific trains before England's Covid tiers were announced on 26 November There are also annual Christmas rail works to contend with - though the majority of the network has been cleared of engineering works in a bid to avoid disruption. However, Network Rail engineering works are taking place from 23 December to 4 January, with some railway lines closing to allow the work to take place. London King's Cross station will be closed for six days from Christmas Day as a £1.2bn upgrade of the East Coast Main Line continues.  Network Rail is also warning of a ""significantly reduced service"" from 25 December to 4 January between Clapham Junction and London Waterloo because of major work. But some work scheduled for the festive period has been reviewed. The closure of King's Cross on Christmas Eve for major engineering works has now been postponed from the afternoon until the end of service, to ease congestion for people making getaway journeys out of London. And works on the West Coast Main Line will be completed earlier than planned on 27 December. That will allow a full Sunday service to run from 10:00 GMT rather than midday, making it easier for passengers to return from their Christmas bubbles. Longer trains will run on Anglo-Scotland and Liverpool routes to boost the number of seats at anticipated busy times on the West Coast Main Line.  Chiltern Railway will also run additional services on 27 December, and East Midlands Railway will run a full intercity timetable over the Christmas period.   The government said rail engineering works such as the East Coast Upgrade had been planned for two years - and ""cancelling or delaying these works would see benefits to punctuality, safety and reliability deferred by up to two years"".  With trains likely to struggle with demand, coach operator National Express has said it will increase its services in the run-up to Christmas, having seen a ""significant"" increase in traffic to its website since the Christmas Covid rules were announced. However, this still amounts to a reduced service, the operator said, with this year's Christmas Day timetable covering about 55% of the locations compared with 2019. The operator said it will focus on major cities, towns and airports and expects demand for services to grow as more guidance about what we can do over Christmas is released by the government.   Megabus also said it had seen an increase in bookings over the past few days and expected demand to continue to grow. Both will have a role in the mass exodus of students from universities between 3 and 9 December, aimed at minimising the risk of them spreading Covid-19 to their home areas.   Megabus said extra seats will be available from all the largest university campuses, cities and towns for students travelling home for Christmas, including Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford, Newcastle, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Sheffield, Leeds, Norwich, Cardiff and Bristol.  National Express said it had increased capacity its usual routes that serve university locations and was speaking with universities about the possible need for special services. Both operators will have services on Christmas Day.  Mr Shapps has also said the government is relaxing rules to allow more types of coaches to run over the festive period. One upside for those travelling by road is that there are likely to be fewer roadworks than normal over the Christmas period. The transport secretary said 778 miles of roadworks had been cleared on motorways and A-roads to ease any congestion.  Where essential roadworks must continue, speed limits will be set at 60mph where possible, including on key routes such as the M6 and M1, ""to keep disruption to a minimum"". Melanie Clarke, customer service director for Highways England, said the ""current plan"" was to remove ""non-essential"" roadworks from 20 December to 4 January 2021.  The RAC said its breakdown team is planning for the roads to be busy during the five-day period when coronavirus restrictions are eased, though it said it ""remains to be seen"" what the appetite for journeys would be this year. The AA said it was not ""overly concerned"" that traffic congestion would occur on roads. A survey it conducted found two-fifths of drivers had already cancelled festive travel plans. EasyJet said it had already taken the decision to increase the number of seats on offer between London and Belfast, and London and Scotland over the Christmas period.  ""We are operating flights in line with demand, which we will be monitoring over the coming days and are able to adjust our flight schedule accordingly,"" a spokesman said.   British Airways said it had seen an uptick in the numbers of people visiting its website looking at flights and holidays.  A spokesman said it would be putting on larger aircraft if needed, ""where possible"".  But Irish airline Aer Lingus said it would be operating a ""much-reduced schedule"" due to a ""lack of demand"" for air travel. However, it said additional capacity had been added to key routes including Dublin to London Heathrow over the Christmas period."
risk appetite,Danske Bank boss quits over €200bn scandal,2024-09-15,2018-09-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45571744,"The chief executive of Danske Bank has resigned in the wake of a money-laundering scandal involving its Estonian operation.  Thomas Borgen stepped down following an investigation into payments of about €200bn (£177bn) through its Estonian branch. The Danish bank said many of those payments were suspicious. Mr Borgen said it was clear Danske had failed to live up to its responsibilities, which he regretted. ""Even though the investigation conducted by the external law firm concludes that I have lived up to my legal obligations, I believe that it is best for all parties that I resign,"" he said. The bank said it was unable to determine how much money was believed to have been laundered through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. Shares in Danske fell 7% in Copenhagen following Mr Borgen's resignation and a lowering of its outlook for the full year. Estonia's Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) said it was now examining the findings of Danske's internal investigation. ""The report describes serious shortcomings in the organisation of Danske Bank, where risk-appetite and risk control were not in balance,"" said the Estonian FSA's chairman, Kilvar Kessler. The watchdog and Denmark's financial supervision authority will now consider taking action. The FSA said that it had carried out thorough inspections of Danske Bank's Estonian branch in 2014. The following year the FSA said it ordered the bank to rectify flaws in its risk control organisation. That resulted in Danske's Estonian branch no longer serving customers who did not live in the country.  The branch's handling of Russian and former Soviet money has also been the focus of an inquiry in Estonia itself.  International financier Bill Browder is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most public critics. He has long alleged that Danske's Estonian branch was ""one of the main conduits related to the fraud"".  In July 2017, he gave evidence to the US Senate Judiciary Committee pertaining to allegations that Russia interfered with the 2016 US presidential elections.  Mr Browder set up and ran Russia's most successful hedge fund, Hermitage Capital Management, from 1995 to 2005. In 2005, he claims that the Russian government took over his firm and used it to claim a $230m tax refund. Mr Browder was refused entry into the country for ""national security"" reasons, so he moved to London and asked his staff to move with him. Mr Browder said his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, refused to leave as he wanted to investigate evidence of what he said was a massive tax scam by Russian government officials. Mr Magnitsky died in 2009 while in Russian custody.  After Mr Magnitsky's death, Mr Browder embarked on a worldwide campaign asking governments to pass legislation to freeze the assets involved and deny visas to human rights abusers.  In the US, this law was passed in 2012 and is known as the Magnitsky Act. The UK passed a similar bill in February 2017, updating its existing Proceeds of Crime Act.  In 2013, Mr Browder was tried in absentia in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison for tax fraud. Russia asked Interpol to arrest Mr Browder, but the international policing agency rejected the claim.  In May, Mr Browder was arrested and detained for two hours in Spain. He was released after Interpol announced that the arrest warrant was politically motivated."
risk appetite,The door knock that killed a Japanese teenager in US,2024-09-15,2019-10-19,By Toby Luckhurst,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50063364,"In October 1992, Yoshihiro Hattori knocked on the wrong door.  Yoshi, as he was known, was a 16-year-old Japanese exchange student on his way to a Halloween party in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was with his friend Webb, and they were lost.  ""I didn't know that part of town too well, and I guess I took a couple wrong turns,"" Webb recalled in a recent interview. The two boys, decked out in fancy dress, thought they had found the right place. But they'd made an innocent mistake that cost Yoshi his life. A media frenzy followed, and later a massive campaign to change America's gun laws. Twenty-seven years on, Yoshi's parents, his host family in the US, and a Louisiana lawyer recalled the day that changed their lives. Yoshi was ""crazy about rugby"", said his parents, Masa and Mieko Hattori, in an email interview. ""At first he was not so active about going to America,"" they said. All that changed when Yoshi passed a test for the American Field Service (AFS) - a worldwide exchange organisation for young people. ""He became so eager,"" his parents said. Yoshi submitted an entrance paper for the programme. ""Wherever I go, I wish I could make the country a second home country,"" he wrote. ""I can make Japanese cooking like tempura cutlet for host families and introduce the living way of Japanese."" In the summer of 1992, Yoshi took off for a year in the US. He was met in Dallas by his hosts, the Haymaker family. They drove him back to their home in Baton Rouge.  Dr Holley Haymaker, a physician, and her husband Dick Haymaker, a theoretical physicist, had hosted exchange students before. But Hattori made an immediate impression, they said. ""Yoshi was very ebullient, a total extrovert,"" Holley recalled. ""The kids at McKinley High School loved him because he was such a free spirit."" Her husband agreed. ""He was a really, really extraordinary guy. He was life. He moved through space like a dancer."" Yoshi had been a rugby player in Japan but in the US he signed up to a jazz dance class. Holley found him a bike with lights and a helmet so he could cycle to class. ""He was very popular at that jazz class,"" she said. The Haymakers' son, Webb, who was 16 at the time, said Yoshi had an ""enormous appetite for life and experience"" and tried to make friends wherever he went. The pair attended a blues festival that September, and Yoshi was put in touch with another Japanese exchange student through some teenagers they met. A couple of weeks later, they were invited to a Halloween party just north-east of Baton Rouge, in the city of Central.  On Saturday 17 October, Dick and Holley went to a movie while Yoshi and Webb set off for the party. Yoshi was dressed as John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever - he had been watching a lot of John Travolta movies, Webb says. Webb was dressed as an accident victim, wearing a neck brace from a swimming pool injury earlier that summer with a few bandages for added effect. The pair set off looking for the house. ""Eventually we ended up on this street. We saw this house - it had Halloween decorations, it had three cars in the drive way, and the address was 10311, whereas we wanted to go to 10131. But I just saw the address and said, ""Oh this is it!"" Webb and Yoshi knocked on the door but got no answer. They then saw a woman open the side garage door and peer out before abruptly slamming it in their faces.  ""We were walking away sort of confused, I had started to walk down the block wondering if it was a different house,"" Webb said. ""But then someone opened the door - Rodney Peairs opened the door."" Rodney Peairs, a 30-year-old supermarket butcher, was holding a .44 Magnum revolver. Yoshi turned back towards him. ""He was very eager to get to the party and didn't understand, I guess, that [Peairs] had a gun. Maybe he thought it was a Halloween thing,"" Webb said. ""He was light on his feet and just sang, in a very boisterous way, 'We're here for the party! We're here for the party!' - sort of happy."" Peairs shouted ""Freeze!"" but Yoshi seemed not to understand and kept moving forwards. Peairs fired once, hitting Yoshi in the chest, and slammed the door. Across town, the Haymakers were leaving the cinema after watching The Last of the Mohicans. ""I said to Dick as we left the movie, 'It's great that this country isn't as violent as that anymore',"" Holley recalled. As they walked from the theatre, her pager went off and she called the number. It was the police. The officer on the other end of the line told her Webb was fine, but Yoshi - the officer garbled his name - was not.  Holley said they would meet the police at the hospital. ""That won't be necessary,"" the officer replied. Dick and Holley raced to the police station where Webb was sitting alone, unaware of what had happened to his friend after the ambulance drove away. His parents broke the news. ""The first words out of his mouth were, 'His poor mother',"" Dick said. ""That was the beginning of this whole story that wrecked the Hattoris' lives."" Yoshi's parents learned the news down the line from a worker with the exchange programme. His mother Mieko retreated to her son's childhood bedroom and cried.  Two days after the killing, the Hattoris flew to New Orleans. ""I was terrified,"" Holley recalled. ""I was to take care of their son and he was killed."" But the Hattoris had only concern for the Haymakers, she said. ""The first words Yoshi's mother said were, 'How is Webb?'"" Yoshi's shooting became a global news story overnight. It shocked people in Japan, where handguns are banned. Masa and Mieko took immediate action, launching a campaign in Japan calling for an end to easy access to firearms in the US. ""We began the petition drive from the wake,"" they said. ""Mieko wrote the draft for the campaign in the air plane coming back from Louisiana to Japan."" Back in Baton Rouge, Rodney Peairs' trial became a media circus. Police initially released Peairs without charge, assuming he was within his rights to shoot a trespasser. But after complaints from Louisiana's governor and Japan's consul in New Orleans, he was charged with manslaughter. His lawyers worked hard to establish his actions as self-defence. They said Peairs was ""no killer"", simply ""one of your neighbours"" who was reacting to Yoshi's ""extremely unusual way of moving"". Meanwhile, Bonnie Peairs - Rodney's wife, who first opened the door - told the court Yoshi had scared her and she had ordered her husband to ""get the gun"". The defence worked. In May 1993, Rodney Peairs was acquitted after a jury deliberation of just three hours. Masa Hattori attended the trial, hearing descriptions of his son as an ""out of control... hyperactive Japanese exchange student who thought his job was to scare people"". But he and his wife were not discouraged from their gun control activism.  ""We think Peairs is also one of the victims of America,"" Masa and Mieko said. ""That Rodney Peairs was acquitted is not related to our campaign."" The Hattoris' petition drive gathered pace. In the end, some 1.7 million Japanese people signed. Yoshi's story dominated the country's front pages and news broadcasts for weeks. Dick Haymaker also decided to gather signatures in the US, to help out the Hattoris. In the end, about 150,000 written signatures turned up by post. ""He basically gave his year to that petition drive,"" said Holley. ""It was before email, it was before the web, it was before Facebook, before any of this, so it all had to be done by telephone and snail mail."" Dick dedicated himself to gun control activism. ""The beginning was doing the petition drive and just throwing my life at that. And then I threw my life at Washington, and then I threw my life at trying to get an appointment with the president. I did in the end!"" Both families were in Washington in November 1993 as part of their campaign - everyone recognised them from their appearances on all three network morning shows, Dick says - when after months of trying they managed to get a note from Mieko to a friend of the family who happened to be staying at the White House. ""An old roommate of Bill Clinton's,"" Dick recalled. President Clinton spoke to the Haymakers and the Hattoris in the Oval Office. ""We felt we were welcomed,"" Mieko and Masa said. ""We believe he understood our position. He desired strong gun control laws."" The Hattoris and the Haymakers agreed that, despite his private support, there was little the president could do to help practically. But proposed gun control measures had gotten a boost from their campaign. The 30th anniversary of President John F Kennedy's assassination that month also helped raise awareness of the issue.  That month, Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, mandating background checks on gun buyers and a five-day waiting period on all purchases. President Clinton signed it into law just weeks after meeting the Hattoris and Haymakers.  US Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale travelled to Nagoya to meet the Hattoris in December 1993 and gave them a copy of the law, saying they had a ""very definite impact on passage of the Brady bill"". It had been first introduced in 1991, but was not brought to a vote until a few months after Yoshi was killed. And the following summer, in September 1994, Congress passed the federal Assault Weapons Ban - a 10-year moratorium on manufacturing certain semi-automatic weapons for civilian use. Dick insisted that they had nothing to do with the legislation, although they had been ""publicising"" the Brady bill before its passage. But he said it was a time when gun control seemed possible. ""It was at a point in history where things could change, and they did change. The Brady bill was an important first step in background checks."" The bill was not the end of the Hattoris' fight. They decided to launch a civil suit against Rodney Peairs, his wife Bonnie, and their home insurance company. They were put in touch with Charles Moore, a lawyer who had form taking on such cases; he had previously waived his fee after representing an English woman who was hit by a drunk driver in Louisiana. ""Sometimes you just do things because you want to do right,"" Moore said, in a phone interview. ""I get calls all the time on [Yoshi's case] even though it's been what, how many years now, 25 years or so? I was never expecting to get paid anything on it. I thought the insurance company would refuse to pay because it was an intentional act and there's no coverage for intentional acts."" To his surprise, the insurer paid out $100,000. Judge William Brown told the court that self-defence was ""not acceptable"". ""There was no justification whatsoever that a killing was necessary for Rodney Peairs to save himself,"" Judge Brown said.  But the Hattoris kept none of the money awarded. Instead they left it all in the US to fund gun control measures.  Both Mieko and Masa remain involved in activism, nearly three decades after their son's killing. Most recently they spoke to students who survived the February 2018 Parkland shooting, and took part in the March for Our Lives in March 2018 to show support. The Haymakers also remained involved. Over the years, they have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to gun control groups, including the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. The organisation used their money to set up a working group which helped formulate so-called ""red flag laws"" - a legal measure which allows the court-sanctioned removal of firearms from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others. And the couple recently gave a $500,000 endowment to Dick's university, Carleton College, to create the Yoshihiro Hattori Memorial Fund. It aims to help cover costs for Japanese students who study at the Minnesota institution. Holley and Dick aren't as actively involved in campaigning anymore - Holley, 74, still works part-time in mental health at public schools, while Dick, 79, has retired - but they are watching the renewed US debate about gun laws.  ""It's very, very different,"" Dick said. ""There are so many events and so many young people involved, and that's extremely important. How that will shake out, I just have no idea."""
risk appetite,Veteran journalist Robert Fisk dies aged 74,2024-09-15,2020-11-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54774539,"Veteran foreign correspondent Robert Fisk has died of a suspected stroke at the age of 74. He had been admitted to St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin after falling ill at his home on Friday, and died shortly afterwards, the Irish Times reported. Fisk won numerous awards for his reporting on the Middle East, starting from the 1970s. But he also drew controversy for his sharp criticism of the US and Israel, and of Western foreign policy. Covering wars in the Balkans, Middle East and North Africa for UK newspapers over five decades, Fisk was described by the New York Times, in 2005, as ""probably the most famous foreign correspondent in Britain"". Born in Maidstone, Kent in 1946, he later took Irish citizenship and had a home in Dalkey outside the capital Dublin. Irish President Michael D Higgins has expressed his ""great sadness"" about Fisk's death on Sunday. ""With his passing the world of journalism and informed commentary on the Middle East has lost one of its finest commentators,"" he said in a statement.  After starting his career at the Sunday Express, Fisk moved to Belfast in 1972 to cover the Troubles as Northern Ireland correspondent for the Times. He became the paper's Middle East correspondent in 1976.  Based in Beirut, he reported on the civil war in Lebanon, as well as the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Soviet war in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq War. He resigned from the Times in 1989 after a dispute with the owner Rupert Murdoch and moved to the Independent, where he worked for the remainder of his career. In the 1990s he interviewed Osama Bin Laden three times for the paper. He described him as a ""shy man"" and looking ""every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend"" in their first interview in 1993.  Robert Fisk was brave and controversial. He was a brilliant writer, who did his best work in wars, transporting readers to his side in some burning village. He relished making enemies, especially if they defended US or Israeli activities in the Middle East. Fisk could be obsessive. He collected bits of shrapnel, often American made and fired by Israel, so he could use serial numbers to trace their origins. When I visited Beirut from Jerusalem in the 1990s he served me gin and tonics on his balcony overlooking the Mediterranean in a Yasser Arafat souvenir glass. Robert was old school. He poked fun at the flak jacket I brought to Lebanon from the former Yugoslavia, sniffing it to check for slivovitza plum brandy. Journalism can be a dog-eat-dog trade. Fisk's colleagues were not always kind about his work. I was an admirer, eating up his vivid reportage from Beirut when I was at school, and was awestruck when first I met him. I'll miss Robert, his guts and his appetite for the fight, even though usually he followed a warm hello with some crack about the evils of television news or the BBC. After the 11 September attacks plotted by Bin Laden, Fisk, an Arabic speaker, spent the next two decades covering conflicts throughout the Middle East, including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.  He was highly regarded for his knowledge of, and deep experience in, the region, and often dismissed journalists who sat behind desks instead of venturing out into the field. But he also drew criticism for his attacks on Western policy in the Middle East and was accused of being lenient towards the Syrian government in his reporting of the country's long and brutal civil war. Articles by Fisk about the US and Israel were often considered highly controversial. He said the Trump administration's acceptance in 2019 of Israel's annexation of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights showed Israel had effectively annexed the US, and repeatedly accused Israel of committing war crimes against the Palestinians. In 2011 Fisk was forced to apologise after the Independent was successfully sued by the then-Saudi interior minister over a report that alleged the minister had ordered police to shoot and kill unarmed protesters, based on a document which turned out to be fake. Fisk married US journalist Lara Marlowe in 1994 but the pair divorced in 2006. He had no children. "
risk appetite,Who are the billionaire Issa brothers?,2024-09-15,2020-10-02,By Noor Nanji & Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54343391,"Two UK billionaire brothers - who made their money in petrol stations - have struck a £600m deal to expand their fuel forecourt empire. Zuber and Mohsin Issa's EG Group, which owns Britain's third largest supermarket, Asda, agreed to buy the Co-op's 129-strong petrol forecourt business. The latest acquisition, however, has been seen as a move to expand Asda's presence in smaller, convenience grocery stores, following the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's.  The Issas have experience in retail. Their empire includes more than 6,300 convenience, retail and petrol forecourts, mainly in Europe and the US. The Blackburn-based brothers have been on a buying spree recently, which culminated in them snapping up Asda and fast food chain Leon.  They recently narrowly missed out on buying the struggling convenience store chain McColl's, losing out to Asda rival Morrisons. There were also reports they had their eye on a takeover of pharmacy chain Boots, before US pharmacy giant Walgreens dropped plans to sell the chain, saying buyers were unable to raise enough funds due to instability in financial markets. So who are the Issas and what are their plans for the UK High Street? The Issa brothers founded EG Group (initially called Euro Garages) in 2001, expanding it from a single petrol station in Bury, Greater Manchester. The business grew rapidly as the major oil companies sold off or closed their High Street petrol stations to concentrate on production and refining. The Issas were quick to spot an opportunity to add more retailing to their petrol stations. Motorists are now being offered a huge range of services when they stop by for fuel, from coffee to fast food to groceries. EG Group employs more than 53,000 people, almost 20,000 of them in the UK. In March, the firm said it planned to create nearly 23,000 more jobs in the UK over five years. The brothers own half of the group, with the remainder owned by TDR Capital, a private equity firm. According to their latest results, EG Group revenue for the year to December 2021 rose by 23.5% to $26.5bn (£21.1bn). The Sunday Times values the brothers' fortune at £4.73bn. They make donations through their own charitable foundation, which funds projects in the UK and abroad. The Issa brothers have snapped up a number of well-known High Street brands in recent years. In 2020, it was announced they had won the battle to buy Asda from US supermarket giant Walmart, in a deal valuing the UK grocer at £6.8bn. It meant Asda returned to majority UK ownership for the first time in two decades. The brothers were both  awarded CBEs after the news. Last year, the Issa brothers bought the British fast food chain, Leon. The deal, worth up to £100m, includes 42 company-owned restaurants, as well as 29 franchise sites which are mainly found in airports and train stations across the UK and a handful of European countries such as the Netherlands and Spain. ""It has been a buying spree,"" says Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst. ""The Issa brothers have a clear appetite for risk and the access to finance to drive that,"" he added. ""If you look at Asda and Leon, it's clear they are making acquisitions in complementary and adjacent market places, so what they're doing is synergistic."" Despite their rapid rise in the business world, the brothers don't always get what they want.  In 2020, their efforts to take over Caffè Nero fell through, with the coffee shop chain dismissing the bid as ""opportunistic"". And in May, Morrisons clinched a last ditch deal to buy the convenience store chain McColl's, beating EG Group to the prize. But Mr Hyman says he expects to see further acquisitions from the Issa brothers, as the economic outlook darkens. ""We are about to go into a recession, the market is tightening, and it's already oversupplied with players,"" he said. ""So what we're going to see is a lot of casualties and that will present opportunities along the way."" The brothers have experienced controversy in the past. Questions were raised about EG Group's governance after its auditor, Deloitte, suddenly quit in October 2020 and was replaced by KPMG. EG Group said the auditor had signed a ""clean audit"" for EG Group's 2019 financial accounts and there had been ""no disagreements on any auditing or accounting matters"". In December 2020, a BBC investigation found a company once co-owned by the Issa brothers was fined for ""appalling"" safety breaches. One worker at the Lancashire packaging firm Europlast (Blackburn) lost a finger in a bubble wrap machine in 2012. Mohsin and Zuber Issa were co-owners and directors of the company at the time, according to filings at Companies House. Another worker lost four fingers in 2015, weeks after the brothers resigned as directors. It is understood the brothers haven't been involved with Europlast since 2015, didn't have operational roles and have not been shareholders in Europlast for many years. A representative of Mohsin and Zuber Issa declined to comment. The Issas also faced questions in their home town when they bought eight homes, demolished them and began building five mansions, raising the ire of neighbours, the Lancashire Telegraph has reported. The brothers are said to be quite publicity-shy, with industry insiders saying they like to keep a low profile. This might change though, Mr Hyman says, as they continue to snap up well-known brands which raise their profile. ""They like to keep their heads below the parapet, but they might not be able to continue that way, especially the way they're going,"" he says."
risk appetite,Arts and music venues may require face masks,2024-09-15,2020-08-05,By Robbie Meredith,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53654545,"Audiences at arts and entertainment venues like theatres may be asked to wear face masks and undergo temperature checks when they reopen. These are among measures suggested in guidance produced by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI). Singing and some musical performances are described as ""higher-risk activities"". Theatres, arts centres, galleries and music venues have been closed since mid-March. They have not yet been told by the NI Executive when they can reopen for indoor performances. The Arts Council has previously warned that many venues and organisations face significant box office losses due to the prolonged closure. To enable them to reopen to the public again, ACNI has produced a 76-page guidance document called 'In the Bubble of Our Making: Reopening the Arts in Northern Ireland'. ""We know that public confidence at returning to indoor events and performances is low - we have all seen the statistics on the low appetite for booking for future arts events, and the alarming time-lag there may be before even bookings are considered,"" the document said. ""The Arts Council is keen to see public performance spaces open in towns and cities across Northern Ireland, including sites for outdoor installations and exhibitions."" Each individual venue can use the ACNI guidance to introduce safety measures for staff, performers and members of the public. Venues are advised to adopt measures like social distancing, enhanced cleaning, one-way signs and hand sanitisers similar to other workplaces. They will also keep records of anyone entering for 21 days to assist with contact tracing. Venues will also have to consider whether audiences will have to wear masks or face coverings when they reopen - as they are ""enclosed public spaces"". ""Based on your risk assessment and taking into account audience expectation, you may decide that you will require all visiting public to wear face coverings as part of your new entry conditions,"" the ACNI document said. ""Current guidance states that wearing a face covering is recommended in situations where it is difficult to practice social distancing e.g. on public transport or in enclosed public spaces."" There are some exceptions for young children, autistic people or those with respiratory conditions. Venues will also decide if they need to introduce temperature checks for staff or audiences, although this is not mandatory. The guidance also said that when venues reopen performances may need to be ""shorter, fewer, oftener, safer"". Other measures may include: Theatres and other venues will have to reduce the number of people they can admit to ensure social distancing. Members of the audience may only be able to sit together if they are from the same household or support bubble, for example. If people are going to an exhibition or a gallery, they may have to book a time-slot in advance rather than 'walk in'. However, ACNI has warned that admitting reduced numbers of people will put many venues in peril. ""It is financially impossible for live theatre, concerts, festivals and venues to operate with audience capacity reduced to 20% or 30%,"" they said. ""Paradoxically, some of Northern Ireland's most commercially effective arts organisations will now find themselves the worst affected."" Northern Ireland has received £33m as part of a UK government support package for arts venues but the executive has not yet decided how it should be spent. The ACNI document also provides guidance to enable indoor music performances to take place again. ""Singing and playing wind and brass instruments, especially in groups, are considered higher risk activities because of the potential for aerosol production and the absence presently of developed scientific analysis to assess this specific risk,"" it said. ""The evidence and advice are being developed rapidly, but at this current time additional risk mitigation should be considered in these contexts."" For instance, if professional singers and musicians are performing they should maintain 3m social distancing from other performers and any audience. The capacity in music venues will also be limited to allow for ventilation and appropriate social distancing if a concert is taking place indoors. The chief executive of ACNI, Roisín McDonough, said that arts organisations had shown an ""astonishing aptitude"" in reaching audiences during lockdown. ""There is an enormous appetite for a return to live, in-person, arts, and we want to make sure that our venues have the most up-to-date guidance that will allow them to safely open their doors and welcome back audiences,"" she said. ""We can use this experience alongside the new guidance to expand our horizons and re-engage audiences in different ways, in different shapes and in different places."" The full guidance document is being published on the Arts Council of Northern Ireland's website."
risk appetite,The women using art to explain Covid-19 science,2024-09-15,2021-03-05,By Dhruti Shah,https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-56152069,"There's barely any country in the world that hasn't been touched by the coronavirus pandemic and its aftershocks.  But with so much information out there, it's sometimes hard to digest all the details and fully take it in. Ahead of International Women's Day on 8 March, we invite you to meet three women who are using their artistic talents, combined with their expertise in the fields of science, health and technology to help the fight against coronavirus. Avesta Rastan, 25, is a visual science communicator currently living in California.  At the start of the pandemic, she realised there weren't many infographics revealing how Covid-19 directly affected the human body. So the artist, who is of Iranian and Canadian heritage, and is a member of the Association of Medical Illustrators, saw a unique opportunity to use her skills and her training in pathological illustration (the drawing of disease) to help the wider public. ""I saw lots of illustrations and 3D models of the virus itself and its protein but I didn't really see what it did to us,"" she explained. She started investigating and soon created an infographic that unexpectedly went viral on social media. Even the World Economic Forum shared it. She was approached by people all over the world wanting to see the poster in different languages and offering to translate her explanations. It's now available to download in 18 languages on her website. Rastan says: ""I'm not a frontline worker; I'm not in health care, but you help out in whatever way you can and for me that was using my art. She adds science can have a reputation for being difficult to learn and that does deter people but illustrations bridge that gap and could encourage more to enter her field. ""Science itself isn't hard - it's a natural process for humans; we're naturally curious and want to understand how things work"", she adds. In the future she wants to be involved in building educational platforms. But for now, she's spreading the word about her unusual career.  ""I have definitely noticed in the past 10 to 20 years there are more women in this field than men. In the older generations it was definitely a male dominated field but now things are changing,"" she says. And while the pandemic has been a terrible thing for the world to go through, Rastan admits that for her it did offer a silver lining. She embarked on a freelance career and worked with academic researchers, medical tech start-ups, doctors and surgeons.   Rastan, who finds a lot of her inspiration comes from nature, has a new job in the US now.  But she continues to spend her spare time on a passion project on social media called Lumi Science where she's still visualising the virus and its variants.  ""Science communication is so key to society. When you understand something, you're empowered to try to change it or try to mitigate the risk"", she says. Dr Radhika Patnala is a neuroscientist and the founder and director of the start-up Sci-Illustrate.  The Indian-born entrepreneur, who studied in Singapore and Australia before moving to Munich, Germany, says one of the beauties of working in science is that the field is incredibly collaborative and crosses geographical and institutional boundaries. Her company creates science illustrations for a whole range of clients but she also has several passion projects underway, with the most recent focused on her response to the pandemic.  It's a 10-part series of illustrations called Covid Dreams.  ""I came across this very interesting piece of information, that people who got Covid-19 were having weird dreams. I thought that was an amazing idea to explore. I also wanted to challenge myself to try to depict something which is very serious and slightly depressing, in an unusual and visually different way,"" she says. Her series encompasses different parts of the coronavirus experience, from detailing the nucleo-protein packages within the virus to imagining what someone's mouth inside the mask looks like.  It was when she was doing her doctorate, with a focus on immunology and epigenetics, that Patnala, 32, reconnected with her artistic side.  ""I'd be in a neuroanatomy lab and we would look at slices of mice and rat brains and stain them, so we could look at individual cells and the tissue architecture of the brain in detail.  ""A lot of my PhD involved looking under a microscope at neural tissue, how the different cells talk to each other and how beautiful the tissue architecture of the organ itself was,""  she says. For Patnala, the pandemic has not led to a significant difference to her day job and, with so many in the industry now focusing on virus illustrations, she was continuing to work on visualising other diseases for clients in need. ""There are important things happening all the time in our industry - there are companies looking at cancer therapeutics and trying to find drugs for niche cancer types; there are people working on cardiovascular diseases,"" she explains. Stating the science field has always had trouble getting money from policy makers, she suggests perhaps a change is on the way, adding: ""The pandemic woke everyone up to the amazing work that people are doing in laboratories all the time."" When Nujuum Hashi, 26, caught coronavirus early last year, she refused to let it destroy her creative ambitions and all the dreams she had steadily been working towards over the past few years. Hashi had given up her career as a nurse in Somaliland to pursue art, despite her family's misgivings about her chosen path, and she resolved that while the pandemic had knocked her strength, it wasn't going to kill her spirit. Hashi, who is now living in Mogadishu, Somalia, had just returned from a trip to Kenya in April 2020 when she realised that she was sick.  ""First I had a headache, then I had a rough throat. I lost my sense of smell and I was shivering and cold; I had dizziness and a migraine. I lost my appetite and even my eyes were very dry and sensitive to light. My brain couldn't do any creative work - I just felt incredibly flat."" But while she was self-isolating, she realised it was important for her to stay connected to the world. ""I still tried to do live Instagram art classes - even while I was sick - to entertain others. I'd teach people how to draw faces and hands and other things.  ""I wanted to show the world I was fighting corona and that I was doing my best. When I felt my brain was returning to a better place, I did an illustration of me boxing the corona as I wanted to show I was fighting this evil virus. I was angry about the virus and this was a celebration picture.  ""If I can fight it; others can try to do so as well."" As well as illustrations focusing on her experiences, Hashi has been drawing and painting scenes to encourage others to take care and be more aware of the community around them.  Her illustrations include an image of the Covid-19 virus on a world tour and a drawing in tribute to the frontline doctors and nurses trying to save lives. Hashi grew up in a medical family - her mother is a midwife, while her late father was an anaesthetist. And it was back in Hargeisa, Somaliland that Hashi herself trained and worked as a nurse. She said it was a job she loved as it meant she could help the community but there came a point in her life when the desire to create art overwhelmed her. She says it is not easy being a female artist in Somalia but as a creative person, she feels a personal responsibility to share her talents with the world. While 2020 was a difficult year, she is optimistic about the future. She plans to continue seeking out more business opportunities, and she wants to use her art to tackle misinformation about the pandemic. ""There's a lot of misunderstanding in our country. Sometimes I have to show people that the right information is here and tell others to stop spreading the wrong information,"" she says. The virus has had global ramifications with many calculating women will bear the brunt with long-lasting social and economic effects.  But could the virus be the catalyst for change in traditionally male dominated fields? Reports suggest the pandemic has led to more women considering a career in the sciences.  After all, as these three women stress, education leads to empowerment. "
risk appetite,NHS reforms are unlikely to bring radical change,2024-09-15,2021-02-11,By Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56028809,"Changes to the NHS always make headlines.  The public has a strong emotional attachment to it, like in no other country.   Using its services is the way that millions of us interact with the public sector every day, often at times of great anxiety, sorrow, or joy.  When it comes to election time, it is often at the top of voters' lists.  So, no surprise there is always tension and trepidation in Westminster when governments want to make changes.   That's why so much has been written about ministers' plans to shift things around in the NHS. You can read an outline of them here.  The most important question, of course, is not what is behind the changes, but whether patients will see any difference to the care they receive in the real world in the years to come.  But it is worth, for a second or two, pondering the political journey the changes represent.  First, much has been made of the draft law finally burying the changes that were brought in by the coalition government and its former Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley. Even their introduction was painful, causing massive political problems in the early days of the coalition.  As one wily observer of the intersection between health and politics recalled: ""It was as if Lansley didn't have a political idea in his head and Cameron didn't have a practical idea in his head."" The changes turned GPs into consumers, picking and choosing health care on all our behalf. Irrespective of whether the principle of increasing competition was a good one, the way the changes were brought in ratcheted up the level of bureaucracy in the health service in England, which was described by one source simply as often ""a waste of time"".  The coming legislation will unpick all of that.  Local health care providers and local councils will have to work together in future, as many of them already have been doing under a new structure. And, of course, because it is the public sector, a new acronym is born - the ICS or the Integrated Care Systems.  The hope is this will have a significant impact in the real world, allowing local authorities and local clinicians to work together more easily. Instead of worrying about commercial contracts, they will be worrying about patients.  And inside the NHS, there's a belief that the pandemic has shown exactly how this can work.  Groups of GPs, Primary Care Networks (known as PCNs, obviously), have been vital to the success of the roll-out of the coronavirus vaccine.  The principle is they are small enough to understand and know their patients, but big enough to make the economies of scale.  They had already been introduced, however, and to an extent the NHS has, for several years, been bringing in changes like this that found ways of working around the changes that the Lansley reforms had made.  In practical terms though, Thursday's burying of the Lansley reforms is a legal consequence of some changes that were already under way. And in fact, when Jeremy Hunt was the health secretary a couple of years ago, it was clear that the Tories were already resolved to ditch the coalition's changes, with the NHS's blessing. So far, so not that surprising. What is somewhat surprising, or at least ironic, though is that the proposed changes mark a pretty big move away - at least in emphasis - from the use of competition and the private sector.  A Tory government that believes in free markets is presiding over a shift away from that and the response to it has been rather muted.  The use of market forces in health was, for a long time, a hotly contested argument in politics - not just whether or not the private sector should be used to fill in the gaps, but whether, as New Labour believed, competition between different health care providers and choice for patients was a big part of the answer to the NHS' woes.   It is worth noting that Tony Blair's health adviser was none other than Simon Stevens, now, of course, the chief executive of NHS England.  The private sector will still be able to provide services to the NHS. This is not a moment where they are being booted out.  But what one former minister described as the ""ginger of a bit of competition"" is fading, leading another source to talk about the ""conversion of Simon Stevens"".  There are also nerves at how the powers the secretary of state will have will read like ""back to the future"". It is no secret that central government was frustrated, particularly in the early days of the pandemic, that actions they wanted to take at the top of the chain did not always have the desired effect at the end.  With the NHS' operational independence, sources complained at the time that the health care system was like a ""black box"". As a result, the health secretary, as part of these changes, will regain some of the powers that were passed over to the NHS years ago.  The temptation to take control is clear, particularly in the current circumstances. But one former minister warns of a two fold risk: ""You can't run the system from Whitehall and it's politically foolish. He'll end up with every problem on his desk.""  The defenders of the changes point out that the solutions being espoused have changed because the health service's problems have changed. When competition and choice were the mantra, the NHS' problem was lengthy waiting lists. Private sector efficiency and competition was seen as a way of driving them down.  Now the issues of demand and an ageing population means the gap between health and care is becoming smaller and smaller. With pressure on budgets too now, one source said: ""The pressure isn't to compete, it has to be to collaborate.""  Despite some of the rhetoric around, however, the changes outlined on Thursday do not provide a long term solution to how we care for the elderly.  Espousing more working together between doctors, social care and councils could help, but it is not the big answer to the problems laid so bare during the pandemic.  That solution is still promised, but still some way off.  But the promises are not insignificant. There will be changes to the NHS in England that will make a difference to how one of the most important organisations in the country is run. The government will, in law, correct what many see as the mistakes of a decade ago - formalising some changes that have already been made in practice on the ground. And a Tory government is stepping away, to an extent, from competition and the private sector with barely a political murmur. With the pandemic and the Tories' traditional political vulnerability on the NHS, they have little appetite right now for something more radical, nor the political space to make the argument.  But the plans don't seem likely to add up to a dramatic turnaround for the NHS that will either suddenly tear up the system, or make all its problems quickly go away."
risk appetite,School closures extended to Monday,2024-09-15,2021-01-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-55856790,"Guernsey's schools will stay closed to all students on Monday in light of a recent coronavirus outbreak. Cases have risen to more than 100 since lockdown was announced, with 39 of them linked to 11 education settings. The closures include all early years providers and childminders and the ""dynamic"" situation will be reviewed on Monday, the States of Guernsey said. When reopening begins, the children of key workers and vulnerable students will be the first to return to school. So far, 24 students and 15 staff members have tested positive for Covid-19. On Thursday, Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA) chairman Peter Ferbrache said it was ""more likely than not"" schools would remain closed. Once approved, the reopening process will begin with the children of the ""most essential workers and the most vulnerable children"" to help free people who are ""key to the response to coronavirus"", the States explained. This could mean a review of essential worker lists from the first lockdown to keep student and staff numbers in schools down, but no detail about exactly who this would include has been given. The decision to postpone reopening was made by the CCA to plan and set up a ""robust testing system"" to support bringing some children back into school. A spokesman said: ""There is a strong appetite to get settings reopened as soon as possible, however everyone involved also wants to make sure the decision is made when it is safe to do so, without putting anyone at any unnecessary risk.""

risk appetite,Trial boost for lorcaserin obesity drug,2024-09-15,2018-08-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45319393,"A major study has found promising results for the safety of a weight-loss drug available in the US. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, says adults using the drug lorcaserin lost an average of 4kg (8.8lb) over 40 months. It says the drug, which works by suppressing appetite, does not put people at greater risk of heart issues. But experts emphasise the importance of long-term lifestyle changes in achieving effective weight loss. Lorcaserin has been available in the US for several years under the name Belviq, but it has yet to be approved for use in Europe. The study followed 12,000 overweight or obese adults in the US over three-and-a-half years. After 40 months, people prescribed lorcaserin were three times more likely to have lost 5-10% of their body weight than those using a placebo, according to Dr Erin Bohula, one of the study's lead authors. Tests for heart valve damage showed no significant differences compared to those taking the placebo. This has been a key concern over the safety of other slimming pills. Patients using the drug were also at a slightly lower risk of type 2 diabetes. It is not yet known if lorcaserin has any other side effects. The pill is taken twice a day and costs about $220-290 (£155-225) per month in the US. The drug does not have a European licence.  In England, it would have to be approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and in Scotland by the Scottish Medicines Consortium before it could be prescribed.  However, it could offer an alternative to invasive weight-loss procedures such as gastric band surgery. Over half of UK adults are thought to be overweight or obese. Both conditions carry an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease."
risk appetite,Barclays tightens lending on Brexit caution,2024-09-15,2018-05-31,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44323693,"Barclays is tightening its lending criteria to a UK economy that is lagging behind the rest of the world. Chief executive Jes Staley says Brexit uncertainty was helping to stunt economic growth and that was something the bank could not ignore. Speaking exclusively to the BBC he said ""we have to be mindful of weaknesses in the economy and we have protect the integrity of the bank"". That meant tightening some lending criteria, ""just to be prudent"". ""In no way do we pull back in a radical fashion - but we will look at our credit exposures and see whether that's proper given the direction of the economy,"" Mr Staley said. ""We can at the margin tighten some of our underwriting criteria and credit standards just to be prudent for the stability of the bank."" The UK economy is still growing - but very slowly. In the last 12 months it has grown 1.2% compared with 2.2% in the US and 2.5% in the eurozone. Mr Staley said measures might include looking at how big a loan Barclays would be prepared to provide as a percentage of the value of a residential property - the so called loan to value ratio - particularly in London and the South East.  He arrived in north east England today with an encouraging message for local business - announcing a new £500m fund for loans to small and medium sized businesses.  But his warning on the UK economy, and Barclays' risk appetite, was the more telling content for a bank with over a £1 trillion in UK loans.   The government has always accepted that businesses - particularly foreign ones - will be cautious about investing in the UK while Brexit is under discussion.  A group of European industrialists told the Prime Minister as much at a meeting yesterday at Number 10 on Wednesday.  But the fact that the headwinds are making a UK bank such as Barclays say explicitly that it is becoming concerned about its exposure to the UK economy is a new development."
risk appetite,Should Africa be wary of Chinese debt?,2024-09-15,2018-09-02,By Larry Madowo,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45368092,"African countries have shown a healthy appetite for Chinese loans but some experts now worry that the continent is gorging on debt, and could soon choke.  The Entebbe-Kampala Expressway is still something of a tourist attraction for Ugandans, nearly three months after it opened.  The 51km (31 mile), four-lane highway that connects the country's capital to the Entebbe International Airport was built by a Chinese company using a $476m (£366m) loan from the China Exim Bank. It has cut what was a torturous two-hour journey through some of Africa's worst traffic into a scenic 45-minute drive into the East Africa nation's capital.  Uganda has taken $3bn of Chinese loans as part of a wider trend that Kampala-based economist Ramathan Ggoobi calls its ""unrivalled willingness to avail unconditional capital to Africa"". ""This debt acquired from China comes with huge business for Chinese companies, particularly construction companies that have turned the whole of Africa into a construction site for rails, roads, electricity dams, stadia, commercial buildings and so on,"" the Makerere University Business School lecturer told the BBC. The Chinese loans come as many African countries are once again in danger of defaulting on their debts more than a decade after many had their outstanding borrowing written off. At least 40% of low-income countries in the region are either in debt distress or at high risk, the International Monetary Fund warned in April.  Chad, Eritrea, Mozambique, Congo Republic, South Sudan and Zimbabwe were considered to be in debt distress at the end of 2017 while Zambia and Ethiopia were downgraded to ""high risk of debt distress"". ""In 2017 alone, the newly signed value of Chinese contracted projects in Africa registered $76.5bn,"" Standard Bank's China Economist Jeremy Stevens wrote in a note.  ""However, despite a sizeable remaining infrastructure deficit on the continent, there is a concern that African countries' debt-service ability will soon dissolve,"" he says.  The Chinese model has many high-profile defenders on the continent, including the head of the African Development Bank (ADB) Akinwumi Adesina, a former Nigerian agriculture minister. ""A lot of people get nervous about China but I am not. I think China is Africa's friend,"" he told the BBC.  China is now the single largest bilateral financier of infrastructure in Africa, surpassing the ADB, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank and the Group of eight (G8) countries combined.   The money's impact is conspicuous all over Africa, from shiny new airports and roads as well as ports and high-rise buildings that are also creating much-needed jobs. In fact, a McKinsey and Company analysis found that the amount of loans Beijing had made to Africa had tripled since 2012, including an outsize $19bn to Angola alone in 2015 and 2016.  It cited Angola and Zambia as unbalanced partners with China in Africa.  ""In Angola's case, the government has supplied oil to China in exchange for Chinese financing and construction of major infrastructure projects - but market driven private investment by Chinese firms has been limited compared with other African countries,"" the firm said.   Africa has made significant new gains in trade, investment and financing arrangements with China, says Ghanaian investment analyst Michael Kottoh.  ""There are several truly win-win deals African nations have closed without the typical onerous conditions associated historically with doing business with western countries,"" says Mr Kottoh, whose advisory firm Konfidants counsels international clients.  ""But there is a sense in which China is obviously the bigger winner - simply because it has the upper leverage in most negotiations."" McKinsey projects that revenues for Chinese firms in Africa could hit $440bn by 2025.  Even Mr Adesina agreed that: ""The issue that I have seen is the asymmetry of power in the negotiations of the transactions, where you are actually giving your mining rights away just because you want to build a superhighway.   ""You are only dealing with one country, how are you sure that you are getting the best deal?"" China does not have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act like the United States, or similar legislation in other Western countries that criminalise bribes paid overseas in exchange for contracts.  Even though Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz calls the Western criticism of China's work in Africa ""sour grapes,"" he admits that there are corruption concerns.  ""Every project whether it comes from the west or China needs to be evaluated against the rate of returns,"" he told the BBC in Nairobi but added that it was up to the continent's governments to be more transparent. Mr Ggoobi also says there are greater concerns over the environmental effects of Chinese investments, ""particularly given the poor, weak, corrupt regulatory institutional infrastructure in Africa"". In 2015, the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies sounded alarm bells that African countries might be unable to repay Chinese loans ""due to fluctuating commodity prices and decreasing absorptive capacity"". ""We find that Chinese loans are not currently a major contributor to debt distress in Africa,"" they now say in a new briefing paper ahead of the 7th Forum on China Africa Cooperation Summit this week in Beijing.  China has the lion's share of African debt but the countries are borrowing from many other sources internationally so it is not single-handedly to blame for indebtedness.  When the summit last met, in Johannesburg, China promised $35bn in concessional foreign aid loans among other credit lines to Africa.  What has not improved is what Standard Bank calls a ""significant trade deficit with China"" since 2014. It says only five African countries have a trade surplus with China.  Mr Ggoobi wants China to help Africa build institutional capacity to attract and host viable investments using avenues like special economic zones and industrial parks to shore up the continent's export-focused manufacturing.  So far, China has only paid lip service to such long-term support that would wean African countries off their dependency on the Asian tiger.  Djibouti last month launched the first phase of the Chinese-built free trade zone billed as Africa's largest but it is seen as just another piece of the jigsaw puzzle as China revives old trade routes in its Belt and Road Initiative which targets 60 countries.  Ugandans might enjoy soaring above the swampy Nambigirwa Bridge on their new expressway, but there are real fears that they could end up drowning in Chinese debt. "
risk appetite,Mental illness 'doesn't discriminate',2024-09-15,2018-06-07,By Kelly-Leigh Cooper,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44396081,"The news that fashion designer Kate Spade took her own life earlier this week is highlighting to many the universality of mental illness and the sad reality that it can affect anyone in any walk of life.  Social media quickly filled with tributes to the 55-year-old as news broke of her death on Tuesday. Many of the headlines focused on public shock, because the successful designer, on the surface, appeared to ""have it all"". ""It's often been said that mental illness and suicide doesn't [sic] discriminate,"" says Dr John Draper - director of the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline service. ""It's not really about a person's circumstances,""  ""In some ways a highly successful person can even feel trapped because everything seems perfect - they think nobody will understand or believe that they have a problem."" In recent years there have been efforts made throughout society to try and break these taboos about emotional struggles and mental health. A number of well-known celebrities, from actor Dwayne Johnson to singer Demi Lovato, have opened up about their personal struggles with conditions such as depression and anxiety. Canadian comedian Jessica Holmes knows too well the problems of going through depression in the public eye.  ""I'm a person who had it all going on in my career,"" she tells the BBC. ""I had opened for Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Seinfeld; I was on a popular Canadian comedy show. ""And despite having all of that, and two healthy kids and a supportive husband - I still sank into a depression that lasted about two years."" ""My psychologist explained to me that a depressed mind is like a sieve: only negative thoughts make it through. You can't compute the positive things that are happening in your life - even if, like me, you have so much to be grateful for.""  Kate Spade's sister has suggested in media interviews that her sister had struggled with depression for some time but had expressed worry that seeking treatment could harm the ""happy-go-lucky"" image of her fashion band. Jessica says she ""absolutely understands"" how people under public pressure can feel like they have to keep up a ""vibrant healthy preppy"" image. ""I just hope we see cases like Kate Spade's with empathy and understanding,"" she says.  ""There are people out there who think there's no other option for them - but I feel like it's our duty to remind people there is."" International research has long-recognised the risk of a ""contagion"" effect after high-profile suicides.  Many in the media now follow guidelines about responsible reporting of suicide - which includes being mindful of phrasing and not discussing the suicide method. But Dr Draper believes celebrities can also contribute to a ""positive contagion"" and are pivotal in normalising dialogue around mental health. ""There's research that has shown that when people share their stories of hope and recovery, that it was associated with a reduction in the rate,"" he told the BBC. The phenomenon has also been recognised in physical public health issues - HIV awareness and testing reportedly went up after actor Charlie Sheen spoke publicly about his diagnosis. The number of the US suicide prevention helpline Dr Draper directs was given a huge platform last year when US rapper Logic named a song after it. 1-800-273-8255 deals with severe depression and suicidal thoughts - with the chorus evolving from lyrics of ""I don't want to be alive"" to a transformative message of recovery.  ""In the US, for every one person that dies by suicide, there's another 280 who think seriously about don't,"" Dr Draper says. ""The other 280 don't make the headlines."" Jessica agrees that public discussion, especially by high-profile figures, is integral to breaking taboos. She now speaks openly about her experience - even writing and performing humorous motivational comedy about depression. ""Recovering for me was sort of like pulling the cord on a motorboat,"" she says. ""It doesn't work and won't start and then for no apparent reason - maybe it's the 30th time, suddenly it does and the boat goes."" Chris Smith, a clinical professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, says he has seen a change in the media treatment of mental health in the last decade or so - despite our appetite for celebrity revelation being as high as ever.  He believes the internet has been transformative in allowing celebrities to get ahead and control their own narratives - not leave it to tabloids.   ""Typically celebrities have had someone to speak on their behalf or broker information,"" he says. ""If wielded well, social media can be productive, positive and powerful.""  Research has long looked into links between creative professions and high reported incidences of mental illness. In the fashion world, British designer Alexander McQueen and L'Wren Scott have taken their lives in recent years. Other high-profile industry names have also openly struggled with substance abuse.  Professor Carolyn Mair, from Psychology for Fashion, believes the clothing industry is particularly difficult to work in. ""There's increasing pressure on designers to create more and more, and be out-and-about themselves,"" she told the BBC. ""It's a very tough industry. Every collection is expected to be better than the rest and even more perfect."" She believes more needs to be done for models, designers and others working in fashion - starting in education.

risk appetite,Britain's Fat Fight: Why we're losing,2024-09-15,2018-04-24,By Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-43838655,"Everywhere we go these days, we are urged to buy food and eat it - and it's almost never good, not vegetables or fruit or well-balanced meals, but crisps, chocolate, burgers, fizzy drinks and sugary breakfast cereals. They're cleverly designed, tempting and honed by the fierce competition of the food industry. It's like an arms race for our appetites. Unfortunately, we are the losers - because this all makes it incredibly difficult to eat well. And it's causing a health crisis like we've never seen before. In the UK, obesity is already the leading cause of premature death after smoking.  Today, 25% of us are obese. If things don't change, by 2050 that will be 50%. It makes me wonder if I want to live until then (I'll be 85!). Because if I do, and we have indeed hit that horrendous statistic, the country will be buckling under an epidemic of type 2 diabetes, cancers, amputations, strokes and heart attacks.  We'll be a nation of the stumbling sick. And, for what it's worth, Britain's Fat Fight, the series I've made for BBC One, will have made no impact whatsoever. Not that it's up to me to solve the problem, or even any of the tireless campaigners or researchers I've met along my journey.  We have a government and an NHS who will surely have a far bigger problem if this isn't sorted out.  And we have a food industry whose combined sense of social responsibility, or lack of it, will pretty much determine the future health of the nation. It's no surprise perhaps that ""Gov UK"" and ""big food"" are high on the list of those I want to talk to.  I start with two of the world's best-known breakfast cereal makers, Kellogg's and Nestle, sent in their direction by a bunch of mums and dads who have just watched their kids do an adult-free supermarket sweep.  The young shoppers end up parked in the cereal aisle, loading their trolleys with box after cartoon-decorated box of sugar-added breakfast cereals. What the parents want to know is this: if almost all supermarket own-brand cereals now use the coloured traffic-light labels that flag up excess sugar (or fat, or salt) with a bright red marker, how come two of the biggest breakfast brands in the world are ducking out?  Why do they continue to baffle us with monochrome numbers and percentages in tiny little boxes, hidden well away from the un-missably colourful antics of Tony the Tiger, or the cheeky Coco Pops monkey? I have some fun trying to get Nestle and Kellogg's to answer this simple question on camera. Of course neither of them wants to be interviewed. But turning up at their HQs with a camera crew in tow as their employees arrive at work can be a surprisingly effective way of focusing the corporate mind. In the past, I might have argued the responsibility for change is essentially a personal one. Only you can decide what you put in your mouth, right? But after 16 months working on these films, I'm completely convinced that a culture of blaming and shaming individuals helps no-one - and completely misses the point. We haven't turned into a nation of lazy, greedy people in a single generation. Biological evolution doesn't work like that. Business, on the other hand, can evolve at a terrifying rate. And the business of designing and selling mass-produced food has rapidly outstripped our ability to defend ourselves against it. The fact that two-thirds of us are now overweight proves this is not a problem of the unlucky or weak-willed few. It's a problem we all face. The idea behind Britain's Fat Fight is that it's time we faced it together. What do you think? Join the debate on our Facebook page. Behind the devastating statistics are of course real human stories - millions of them. Janet lives with her father, Jim, who has had his lower leg amputated as a result of his type 2 diabetes. She dreams of losing weight not just to avoid a similar fate but so she can go surfing and skiing with her daughter Amara. But as a single mum in a full-time job, dashing home to cook for her daughter and her dad, Janet is too stressed to even get started on her diet. She ends up cooking herself a special supper - and not always a healthy one - to eat after Jim and Amara have gone to bed. I met her as part of Newcastle Can - an initiative I set up to get the city coming together to eat more healthily, be more active, and lose some weight. It's easier to tackle these challenges together than alone. More than 7,500 people around the city have signed up, and between them they've lost over 80,000lb in weight. By way of a reality check, that's still 20,000lb short of the 100,000lb we've been shooting for, and it's taken 16 months - not the year we set for the challenge. Losing weight is incredibly hard. I know this partly because my own weight has been up and down over the years. Early in the first film my GP warns me that my 36in (93cm) waist and BMI of 26.2 puts me firmly in the overweight stats - and at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This is despite the fact that I'm quite useful in the kitchen, I don't eat a lot of takeaways, and I love my veg. I thought I knew my weaknesses: cheese (and biscuits), chocolate (and puddings generally) and wine with my dinner. But it is still a shock when I work out that, in terms of calories, my weekly wine intake is roughly equivalent to 22 cans of coke. When it comes to our health, it's amazing how adept we are at deceiving ourselves and tweaking our narratives to avoid making changes. After three months of filming with Janet, I am sensing she is really stuck - and I decide it's time to find a way to jump start her journey. So I tell her she doesn't need to lose weight in order to go surfing and suggest we try it together - the very next day. There isn't time to discuss it or wriggle out. We are doing it. It leads to one of my favourite moments making the series, sitting on Tynemouth Beach with Janet after two hours together, in thick wetsuits, in the chilly November sea. She is beaming. She has spent a good deal of time rolling in the surf in various undignified positions (as have I) but she has also caught several excellent waves, and loved every minute of it. Four months later, she has lost nearly four stone. What's got to change in the long term to make it easier for us to eat better, get fitter and live longer? And who's going to make it happen? What, for instance, will our government do? Will it curb the excesses of junk food advertising, especially when targeted at kids? Will they support our GPs and nurses to provide sensitive and practical diet advice and better preventative care? Will they educate the next generation to feed themselves better? In the end, me asking big companies to change their ways, and our government what it is doing about obesity and healthier eating, will only ever have a limited effect. But you telling them, with your shopping trolley or your vote, what changes you want to see - now that, I'm absolutely certain, can make a massive difference. Britain's Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is on BBC One at 21:00 on Wednesday, 25 April, and will be available on iPlayer afterwards."
risk appetite,Can digital tourism get people travelling again?,2024-09-15,2020-10-30,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54658147,"For many people, a trip to Germany's fairytale-like Neuschwanstein castle, the Republic of Ireland's stunning Cliffs of Moher, or the pristine waters of the Maldives are a bucket list ambition.  Plans for these and other international trips in 2020 were brought to an abrupt halt by the Covid-19 pandemic. Around the world, once-crowded sights lay dormant, with hotels empty and not a tourist in sight. The statistics speak for themselves. On 13 October, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) said that international traffic ""has all but disappeared"", with airlines carrying only about 10% of normal levels.  By Iata's estimate, Covid-caused disruptions put more than 41 million jobs at risk across the travel and tourism sector.  In the absence of travellers, tourism boards, hotels and destinations have turned to virtual reality (VR) - a technology still in its relative infancy - to keep would-be visitors interested and prepare for the long road to recovery.  What began for many as a temporary stop-gap measure may now be a long-term tool. Iata predicts that travel will not resume to pre-pandemic levels until 2024.  Faced with a new reality of diminished tourism, many believe that Covid-19 might be the watershed moment for VR that changes perceptions from a clever and occasional marketing trick to a permanent fixture of tourism marketing.  ""The impact of Covid-19 may have allowed VR to somewhat shake off its image of being a gimmick in tourism,"" says Ralph Hollister, a tourism analyst at Global Data and author of a report on VR's applications in tourism.  ""The further this pandemic goes on for, the higher the chance that VR may become a valid form of alternative travel as consumers get more used to this technology.""  Steve Perillo is boss of Travel World VR, a US-based VR and 360-degree video marketing and production company that works with tour operators, destinations, cruise lines and hotels. He says the pandemic has been a ""shot of adrenaline"" for a technology that to date had ""not yet really arrived"". Now he says VR can whet a potential audience's appetite. ""The momentum has really picked up. It's really launched the concept of travelling remotely.""  In this environment, a number of countries have stepped up VR marketing efforts to prepare for the gradual recovery of their tourism industries.  Among the most prominent is Germany, which has unveiled a number of immersive projects to highlight the country's potential as a travel destination.  In 360-degree videos designed to be seen on Oculus Rift headsets, for example, the German National Tourist Board (GNTB) has taken viewers on trips across the country, as well as to parts of its Baltic and North Sea coasts.   Another set of videos - for the Microsoft Hololens - includes views of six of the country's most famous castles and palaces.  ""Digital applications cannot, and are not intended to, replace the experience of real-world travel,"" GNTB chief executive Petra Hedorfer told the BBC.  ""But VR and AR (augmented reality) applications are essential elements in keeping interest in Destination Germany alive during travel restrictions, getting potential customers excited about our product and providing inspiration for real-world travel.""  Some 1,200km (745 miles) to Germany's west, VR was being explored by Irish tourism officials even before the pandemic began.  In November 2019, Tourism Ireland launched a two-part VR experience designed to promote sights in Northern Ireland.   The Embrace a Giant Spirit campaign - which involved collaboration with Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Paul Muldoon and Oscar-nominated cinematographer Seamus McGarvey - included the famed Giant's Causeway and highlighted the country's role as the setting for HBO's Game of Thrones.  ""We know technology is already changing how we travel, and it's only going to accelerate with VR in a post-pandemic environment,"" says Siobhan McManamy, Tourism Ireland's director of markets.  With travel still largely at a standstill, it remains too early for Ireland and Germany to gauge their return on investment: that is, the number of people who, having seen a destination virtually, actually book tickets and visit.  Thoyyib Mohamed, managing director of the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation, says while VR will indeed help boost tourism, the direct correlation may be hard to measure.  In the case of the Maldives, VR has been used to showcase various experiences on island properties, such as morning yoga by the beach, snorkelling, or cooking lessons.  ""An increase in investment in VR does not directly translate to an increase in visitors in the future,"" he says.  ""However, the amount of times… VR is utilised, either on websites, in print or even during [travel] fairs, can translate to potential conversion.  ""Each medium provides a different return value, but is assisted by the investment done on VR marketing.""  Some, however, believe the benefits of VR in travel might be felt much sooner.  They include Miguel Flecha, a Madrid-based travel and hospitality expert for the multinational consulting firm Accenture.   He thinks that as restrictions ease in the next few months, VR will be a vital tool in helping familiarise travellers with a new environment and help slowly rebuild consumer confidence.  ""As we start to recover, there will be segments of the population that will be willing to travel like crazy. Younger people will be booking flights as soon as possible, but other segments of the population won't be very comfortable,"" says Mr Flecha. VR technologies, he adds, can be a cost-effective and potent way to help clients feel more comfortable - and more willing to travel.  New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. ""They [travellers] could be shown health and safety measures, or the check-in process at a hotel in the new reality so that they feel safer, or the boarding process on a flight or cruise. ""If you're able to increase the comfortability of a client to travel, in the end they'll book. They'll stay in a hotel, or they'll fly with you. That's the return on investment - you're incentivising the client to travel.""  An airline using VR to replace travel isn't without precedent. Since 2017, Japan-based First Air - which bills itself as the ""first virtual aviation facility""- has been offering VR ""flights"" from Tokyo, complete with boarding passes, in-flight meals and programmed destination countries from Italy to New Zealand.  With the onset of the pandemic, the company's bookings spiked 50%, it told reporters this summer.   There are, however, a number of limitations that experts say are currently holding the technology back, including large, unwieldy headsets and high costs.  The most important limitation, according to Mr Flecha, is that there has yet to be a trusted global brand to place its bets on VR. ""The industry needs to believe in the technology [for it to succeed],"" he says. That may have begun to change with the September launch in the US of Amazon Explore, a platform that gives access to one-on-one virtual experiences with tour guides and local residents in countries around the world. Experiences offered on the high-tech giant's public beta version range from tours of Kyoto neighbourhoods in Japan to artisan shopping in Costa Rica and fish taco cooking lessons in Mexico.  As Mr Flecha sees it, Amazon Explore may foretell the success or failure of VR in the travel industry.   Serious investment by a high-tech giant and a trusted brand - Apple and Samsung are also looking into virtual reality - could, he believes, be the ""great accelerator"" needed."
risk appetite,'I was going to the toilet up to 30 times a day',2024-09-15,2022-04-19,By Charlie Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-60251156,"About one in every 500 people in the UK have a stoma bag but many of us have never seen one because they are often hidden away. Best friends Ailish Evans and Summer Griffiths decided to change that. The pair, who have ulcerative colitis, say they want to show it's not just older people who have colostomy pouches, and there is nothing to be ashamed of.  Both women have had their colons removed and wear bags which collect waste from their digestive systems. ""When you've got a problem with your bowel it can be quite embarrassing but we really need to put that aside and talk about it,"" says Ailish, who lives in Corringham, near Basildon. The 25-year-old suffered with bowel problems for eight years before she was diagnosed in October 2020.  Her colon, also known as the large bowel, was so inflamed there was a risk it might burst. Her colon was removed just two weeks later. ""From the age of 16 I suffered from a really upset tummy and had to plan all my days out around whether I knew there would be a toilet close by,"" she says.  ""I could never drink alcohol on a night out with friends because it really aggravated me so it was difficult for me socially.""  Ailish says she was dismissed by several doctors because of her age and gender. ""Because I'm a young girl, they thought it was just period pains or my hormones. It was so frustrating."" She finally found a specialist who listened to her symptoms and diagnosed her with ulcerative colitis. But the delay had big consequences. ""Because I had been left for so long, there was no other option for me apart from surgery,"" she says. ""That's what made me want to raise awareness, because the sooner you catch it the more options you have, like medication."" Source: Crohn's and Colitis UK The surgery was done via keyhole and was not as scary as Ailish anticipated. She believes the benefits of having the stoma bag far outweigh any negatives. ""My quality of life is so much better, because there's no fear about having to find a toilet everywhere I go,"" she says.  ""There are some things I can't eat now like peas, sweetcorn, mushrooms, raisins, popcorn and peanuts, because they're not easy to digest - but my boyfriend has learnt lots of new recipes and really looks after me."" It was his idea for Ailish to start her Instagram page, after friends and family kept asking for more information to understand what she was going through. ""I've had some comments like 'you'll never get a boyfriend' and things like that, but I obviously already have one and I'm not fazed by it.  ""I also get great comments where people say they never understood how the bags worked before, but now they do, and that makes it worthwhile."" And it was through her Instagram page that she met one of her closest friends, Summer, who also has ulcerative colitis and has also had her colon removed. Summer fell ill while she was at university in Newcastle. The 21-year-old suffered blood in her poo, stomach pains and was going to the toilet up to 30 times a day. But doctors dismissed her symptoms and it was only when she returned home to Braintree in Essex that a specialist said she needed a colonoscopy, which showed severe inflammation. She ended up in hospital unable to eat or sleep, as she was in so much pain. Summer had to take a year out of university and move home with her parents. Doctors said she needed to consider having stoma surgery because various drugs were not getting her condition under control. ""My reaction was to shut it down. I said 'no that's not happening, I've not even had this a year and you're trying to remove my bowel'."" But the majority of her bowel was now scar tissue, and the colitis was continually attacking it, with doctors concerned it could explode. Summer tearfully accepted she needed to have the operation, but was terrified about living with a stoma bag. She posted on a Facebook forum for people with colitis asking if any other young people had been through the operation and Ailish replied and she started following her on Instagram.  ""I asked her every imaginable question and I thought 'this doesn't sound as bad as I was expecting,'"" she says. After surgery, Summer realised she had more freedom than before, without having to worry where the nearest toilet might be.  She wore jeans for the first time in two years, which were previously too uncomfortable, and found she was able to eat and drink much more. Summer decided to follow her friend's path in creating her own Instagram page to chronicle her life with a stoma bag. She hopes it will help others her age get diagnosed more easily. Many young people choose to conceal their diagnosis because they feel embarrassed and are concerned about being stigmatised, a study found. But Ailish and Summer believe it's best to be open and honest about the condition. ""Before I wrote my first post, I was so nervous and self-conscious. Having this illness stopped me from doing so much for so long but I'm just living my life normally now and I wanted to share that,"" Summer says.  Both women get questions from young people who have just been diagnosed and others about to go through stoma surgery. ""It's really nice to be able to reassure them like Ailish reassured me,"" Summer says.  ""I just tell them they can still live a really great life,"" Ailish adds.

risk appetite,Senior MP demands answers for leaseholders,2024-09-15,2021-05-30,By Dan Whitworth,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57240060,"MP Clive Betts has written to the government to ask why new guidance designed to help about 500,000 leaseholders sell or remortgage their flats is not being followed. It was issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) in March. It is supposed to help surveyors decide which tower blocks need extra fire safety checks. But although mortgage providers were consulted on the guidance, Money Box has found some lenders are ignoring it. The extra checks are called an Exterior Wall System form, or EWS1, and were introduced in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire in which 72 people died. That form is supposed to provide assurance for buyers, sellers and, crucially, mortgage providers about whether or not a flat is safe to buy, sell, or lend against, depending on whether it has flammable cladding, vertically stacked balconies or other issues. But Money Box listener Jie Shen, who is trying to provide for his retirement, is selling a flat which has neither of those problems.  He says three separate mortgage providers have turned down his prospective buyer because Jie's building doesn't have an EWS1 form - even though the RICS guidance says it doesn't need one. ""I feel like I'm trapped into this situation. I can't move on with my life, I'm just locked into this and I don't know how to resolve this,"" he says. ""I think the mortgage lenders should follow the advice from RICS and shouldn't insist on an EWS1 form [for a building] that does not contain flammable cladding. ""I just don't understand why the mortgage provider insists on this - it's just bureaucracy."" Another complication for Jie, and many others like him, is that getting an EWS1 form is not in his power, even if he wanted to get one. He is a leaseholder and the decision to pay for the survey needed to get the form lies entirely with the freeholder who owns his building. In Jie's case, the management company of his building, representing the freeholder, has quoted the RICS guidance to show the building should not require an EWS1 form, leaving Jie utterly stuck. But Jie's buyer has been turned down by three mortgage providers exactly because he doesn't have an EWS1 form. And so it goes round and round, with Jie left in limbo. It's hearing about cases like Jie's that has made Mr Betts act. Writing to the Secretary of State for Housing, Robert Jenrick, Mr Betts, while recognising that the EWS1 is ""a process led by industry"", has asked two key questions on behalf of the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee, which he chairs: He has requested answers by the end of May. Mr Betts has also asked people who find themselves in the same position as Jie - when the RICS guidance shows their tower block doesn't need an EWS1, but when lenders are insisting on one - to email the committee at ""hclgcom@parliament.uk"". Speaking to Money Box after hearing about Jie's case, Mr Betts said: ""The system was set up with the lending industry and the surveying industry to work together to give reassurance to lenders. That's its whole purpose. ""So if it isn't giving reassurance to lenders to lend on buildings which the system says don't need a certificate... then the system is a complete failure and it needs taking up with both RICS and the lenders, so it doesn't leave people stranded in homes that they can't sell and can't remortgage."" UK Finance, which represents nearly 300 banks, building societies and mortgage providers, says it's supportive of the guidance but it's down to individual lenders whether or not they implement it, based on their own risk appetite. It also told Money Box that while lenders instruct valuers to complete property valuations, it's the valuers who determine whether or not EWS1 forms are required. The Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government told Money Box it wanted to encourage ""a sensible, proportionate approach to risk and for lenders to accept alternative forms of assurance"", adding that it was investing £5bn to help protect leaseholders from the cost of replacing unsafe cladding on their homes.

risk appetite,What China's gloomy numbers tell us,2024-09-15,2020-04-17,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52305259,"China put its economy into a self-induced coma to fight the virus. Now it's slowly getting back to work, but don't expect that to save the rest of us. It won't be enough as the latest numbers show us. China's GDP shrank by 6.8% for the first three months of the year - its first year-on-year contraction in decades, in fact since records started. It's a sign of how hard it will be to restart all our economies.  First off, China's economic data always comes with the caveat: don't believe what you read. Independent economists always say the figures are much lower than what the government says.  But this year's first-quarter economic data was always going to be bad.  They confirm that the lockdown exacted unavoidable significant pain on the economy. But it doesn't end here. Almost every economist I've spoken to says that things will get worse before they get better.  So if you were hoping that any growth momentum in the coming quarters will help the rest of us - think again.  The World Bank says in the base case scenario, China will see growth fall to 2% this year from 6% last year - and if things get worse, it would see growth fall to 0.1%. That's basically no growth.  Whatever Beijing manages to eke out from now will not be enough for the rest of us to hitch our wagons to in the hopes of a recovery.  Despite the grim first-quarter news, companies are starting to get back to work in China - albeit slowly. In a survey of its members from the end of March, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said that nearly a quarter of their companies expect a return to normal business operations by the end of April, while 22% had already resumed normal operations. Some 40% say they will keep their investment levels in line with what had previously been planned - so no job cuts there or scaling back of factories.  That momentum is being mirrored on a much greater scale domestically.  ""Last month, my contacts in China said they weren't going out, period,"" Vinesh Motwani, managing director of Silk Road Research told me.  ""Now, they're slowly going back to work - and even grabbing after-work beers.""  Mr Motwani says the data he's tracked is encouraging, showing that most businesses in China will be back to 100% by May, with demand somewhere in the 60-100% range, depending on the industry.  But almost 20% of China's economy is made up of exports, according to data from the World Bank in 2018 - selling goods to the rest of us. Global demand is key to its recovery. And with most of Europe, the US and UK - its biggest customers - at home during the lockdown, there's not much optimism about that kicking back in anytime soon.  When China put parts of the country in lockdown in January, starting with Wuhan and then extending to other cities, the proverbial excrement ""hit the fan"", as one Singapore-based exporter told me.  He sources 90% of his goods from China - everything from kitchen gadgets to cleaning items. Demand from his American customers was soaring, but because of the lockdown, he couldn't source anything. He had to tell his customers in the US that we had no idea when the lockdown might end. But fast-forward two months and ""it's as if nothing happened"", he says.  ""Factories are fulfilling orders in record time,"" he said. ""And now the things I'm sourcing are masks and hand sanitisers - that's the only thing my customers in the US want. Factories that made kitchen supplies before are now making masks."" That demand from the rest of the world IS showing up in data from China. Shipments picked up last month as factories reopened, according to think tank Capital Economics.  But it warned that ""with economic activity in the rest of the world now collapsing"", the worst is still to come for China's export sector.  Foreign demand will slump this quarter, the think tank says, as Covid-19 weighs on economic activity outside China.  And it's no use hoping that the Chinese consumer will help to shore up China and the global economy.  'What is now holding the economy back is a lack of demand,' says AXA Investment Manager's Aidan Yao.  ""This problem is particularly acute in consumer services industries, as social distancing keeps people away from restaurants, movie theatres and tourist sites."" AXA says a recent broker survey of large services firms shows that while 75% to 85% of supply has been restored, demand is only running at 50% to 55% of normal levels. And many companies don't expect full normality at home to return until the second half of the year.  On top of all of those challenges, new coronavirus cases and re-infections are risking China's tepid economy recovery. It is clear the government hasn't ruled out locking down clusters or hot spots again if it needs to, which could lead to more severe economic outages in the future.  ""China's governance system allowed it to go through a hard lockdown nationwide,"" says Mr Motwani, ""with a very gradual resumption of activity over the course of two months as it prioritised containment over economic activity."" China itself won't be immune to job losses either. The official unemployment rate - which at the best of times is highly doubted - rose to 6.2% in February, its highest on record. Beijing does have the firepower to fight some of this, specifically to help out its small and medium-sized enterprises.  The central bank has been cutting some of China's interest rates: short-term loans to corporates jumped in March after this.  But survival is key for these firms right now - and more help may be needed to give these companies a lifeline.  In the last global financial crisis, China spent close to $600bn (£478bn) on stimulus, and that helped to lift the rest of the world's economic engine. But that also put massive debt risk into the Chinese system - something Beijing simply doesn't have the appetite for right now.  Which means banking on China's growth to help the rest of us get through the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression is not just unrealistic, it's risky. China has enough problems of its own to focus on."
risk appetite,Mental illness 'doesn't discriminate',2024-09-15,2018-06-07,By Kelly-Leigh Cooper,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44396081,"The news that fashion designer Kate Spade took her own life earlier this week is highlighting to many the universality of mental illness and the sad reality that it can affect anyone in any walk of life.  Social media quickly filled with tributes to the 55-year-old as news broke of her death on Tuesday. Many of the headlines focused on public shock, because the successful designer, on the surface, appeared to ""have it all"". ""It's often been said that mental illness and suicide doesn't [sic] discriminate,"" says Dr John Draper - director of the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline service. ""It's not really about a person's circumstances,""  ""In some ways a highly successful person can even feel trapped because everything seems perfect - they think nobody will understand or believe that they have a problem."" In recent years there have been efforts made throughout society to try and break these taboos about emotional struggles and mental health. A number of well-known celebrities, from actor Dwayne Johnson to singer Demi Lovato, have opened up about their personal struggles with conditions such as depression and anxiety. Canadian comedian Jessica Holmes knows too well the problems of going through depression in the public eye.  ""I'm a person who had it all going on in my career,"" she tells the BBC. ""I had opened for Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Seinfeld; I was on a popular Canadian comedy show. ""And despite having all of that, and two healthy kids and a supportive husband - I still sank into a depression that lasted about two years."" ""My psychologist explained to me that a depressed mind is like a sieve: only negative thoughts make it through. You can't compute the positive things that are happening in your life - even if, like me, you have so much to be grateful for.""  Kate Spade's sister has suggested in media interviews that her sister had struggled with depression for some time but had expressed worry that seeking treatment could harm the ""happy-go-lucky"" image of her fashion band. Jessica says she ""absolutely understands"" how people under public pressure can feel like they have to keep up a ""vibrant healthy preppy"" image. ""I just hope we see cases like Kate Spade's with empathy and understanding,"" she says.  ""There are people out there who think there's no other option for them - but I feel like it's our duty to remind people there is."" International research has long-recognised the risk of a ""contagion"" effect after high-profile suicides.  Many in the media now follow guidelines about responsible reporting of suicide - which includes being mindful of phrasing and not discussing the suicide method. But Dr Draper believes celebrities can also contribute to a ""positive contagion"" and are pivotal in normalising dialogue around mental health. ""There's research that has shown that when people share their stories of hope and recovery, that it was associated with a reduction in the rate,"" he told the BBC. The phenomenon has also been recognised in physical public health issues - HIV awareness and testing reportedly went up after actor Charlie Sheen spoke publicly about his diagnosis. The number of the US suicide prevention helpline Dr Draper directs was given a huge platform last year when US rapper Logic named a song after it. 1-800-273-8255 deals with severe depression and suicidal thoughts - with the chorus evolving from lyrics of ""I don't want to be alive"" to a transformative message of recovery.  ""In the US, for every one person that dies by suicide, there's another 280 who think seriously about don't,"" Dr Draper says. ""The other 280 don't make the headlines."" Jessica agrees that public discussion, especially by high-profile figures, is integral to breaking taboos. She now speaks openly about her experience - even writing and performing humorous motivational comedy about depression. ""Recovering for me was sort of like pulling the cord on a motorboat,"" she says. ""It doesn't work and won't start and then for no apparent reason - maybe it's the 30th time, suddenly it does and the boat goes."" Chris Smith, a clinical professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, says he has seen a change in the media treatment of mental health in the last decade or so - despite our appetite for celebrity revelation being as high as ever.  He believes the internet has been transformative in allowing celebrities to get ahead and control their own narratives - not leave it to tabloids.   ""Typically celebrities have had someone to speak on their behalf or broker information,"" he says. ""If wielded well, social media can be productive, positive and powerful.""  Research has long looked into links between creative professions and high reported incidences of mental illness. In the fashion world, British designer Alexander McQueen and L'Wren Scott have taken their lives in recent years. Other high-profile industry names have also openly struggled with substance abuse.  Professor Carolyn Mair, from Psychology for Fashion, believes the clothing industry is particularly difficult to work in. ""There's increasing pressure on designers to create more and more, and be out-and-about themselves,"" she told the BBC. ""It's a very tough industry. Every collection is expected to be better than the rest and even more perfect."" She believes more needs to be done for models, designers and others working in fashion - starting in education.

risk appetite,Hepatitis C home test kits available in England,2024-09-15,2023-05-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65571131,"Home test kits for a virus which attacks the liver are now available to order online in England, as the NHS tries to reach those needing treatment. Hepatitis C tends to affect current or past drug users and people who have had contact with infected blood through a tattoo or medical procedure abroad. It can lead to liver disease and cancer, but symptoms often go unnoticed for many years. The NHS website says it can usually be cured by taking a course of tablets. More than 70,000 people are thought to be living with the virus in England. Some may not know they have it, so would be unlikely to go to their GP for a test. Shabana Begum, 55, from Yorkshire, found out she had hepatitis C in 2004 after feeling constantly unwell. ""Every hair on my body hurt, I had insomnia, flu-like symptoms and I was seeing my GP every three or four days,"" she said. Shabana would cry for hours on end because her whole body was in pain. She was told she had been living with the virus for 15 to 20 years, and was able to link it to injections she had received when she moved to Pakistan as a teenager. She remembers the corroded metal syringes that were used at the time, and now spends her time warning others to be cautious when travelling to South Asia, where hepatitis C is regularly found. ""It can be transmitted at the barber's, when getting piercings, a tattoo or other procedures using syringes,"" she says. She also goes into communities to promote free, confidential testing. ""For people who feel they don't have time to see their GP or go to community events, they can log in online and just order a test.""  The home tests involve a tiny amount of blood from a finger prick being dropped into a test tube, which must then be posted to a lab for analysis. Those who receive a positive test result will then be contacted and referred for treatment, NHS England says. Rachel Halford, from charity The Hepatitis C Trust, said it had never been easier to find out if you have hepatitis C. She said people could be exposed to the virus in a number of ways ""including having a blood transfusion before the early 1990s, having medical treatment or a tattoo abroad, or via injecting drugs use"".  The disease is endemic in some countries in South Asia including Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, making the risks of being infected higher. She told BBC Breakfast: ""I think one of the problems about Hepatitis C is you can have it for a long time without knowing that you've got it, because the symptoms are very similar to other things.  ""So this is a really easy and safe and confidential way to get a test."" Most people do not seem to experience any noticeable symptoms when first infected. Some 25-35% do, but the symptoms often resemble other illnesses. They can include: About 20% of people who develop symptoms experience jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes).  Source: The Hepatitis C Trust It is estimated that there were 74,600 people living with hepatitis C in England in 2021 - many fewer than just five years before, thanks to better access to antiviral treatments. Deaths from the virus have also fallen - by a third, from 482 in 2015 to 314 in 2020 in England, and by a similar amount in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there is concern that a lack of access to drug services during the Covid pandemic may have halted further progress.  NHS national medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said the NHS was ""on track"" to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030. ""As patient numbers get smaller and each remaining case becomes harder to find and cure, it's vital we offer easy-to-access self-test kits - especially for those who have been exposed to the virus but may be reluctant to come forward,"" he said. In the UK in the 1970s and 80s, about 3,000 people died after being given blood products via NHS treatments containing HIV and hepatitis C. A public inquiry on the contaminated blood scandal started in 2019 and is still running."
risk appetite,"Election in NI is last resort, says ex-Tory leader",2024-09-15,2022-11-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63499549,"Another Stormont assembly election is the ""last resort"" for trying to resolve the political crisis, a former leader of the Conservative Party has said. Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he did not think people in Northern Ireland wanted another election so soon after the previous poll last May. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has said he will call an election, with the deadline to restore devolution having passed last week. But he has not set a date for a vote. On Wednesday Northern Ireland Office Minister Steve Baker said a date for another Stormont election would be confirmed soon. The leaders of the Stormont parties who would sit on the Northern Ireland Executive met Mr Heaton-Harris on Tuesday but they said he gave no clarity about when an election might be held. Devolved government in Northern Ireland has not functioned properly since February. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has blocked the restoration of power-sharing in its protest against the post-Brexit trading arrangement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Sir Iain Duncan Smith told BBC News NI that there was no appetite for an election in Northern Ireland. ""It's the last resort, frankly, and I don't think people want it,"" he said on Thursday. ""The great elephant in the room of all of this is the [Northern Ireland] Protocol itself,"" he said. He urged the EU to be open to finding a resolution with the UK over the post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland. ""At the moment they sort of refuse to discuss the ending of the protocol and the institution of a better way of doing things,"" said Sir Iain. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland aligned with some EU trade rules to ensure that goods can move freely across the Irish land border after Brexit. Unionist parties argue that it has undermined Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border with England, Scotland and Wales. The DUP has refused to return to Stormont until the protocol is scrapped or changed. The UK wants a fundamental rewrite of the treaty while the EU believes sufficient ""flexibilities"" can be found within the existing text. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said the prospect of an election ""should be taken off the table"". ""The sensible thing to do would be to introduce legislation to avoid this [election] and get serious about people getting back into government,"" said the Foyle MP. He said he believed talks between the UK and the EU over the protocol would ""bear some fruit"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said that avoiding an election would allow the UK-EU negotiations ""to continue in earnest"". He added: ""Any progress potentially stands to be put at risk by needlessly calling an assembly election that will change nothing but stands to further undermine the return of devolution and cost the taxpayer £6.5m."" After Tuesday's talks with the Northern Ireland secretary, Sinn Féin vice-president said the public had been ""left in limbo"" with no clarity about an election. The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson urged the government to have a ""razor-like focus"" on getting a solution to his party's concerns about the protocol. Naomi Long, the Alliance Party leader, said the Northern Ireland secretary was ""clearly taking time"" over what to do next. The most recent assembly election in May resulted in Sinn Féin winning the most seats for the first time. That meant Ms O'Neill was entitled to the role of first minister. The DUP was the second-biggest party but it refused to nominate a deputy first minister, meaning a ruling executive for Northern Ireland could not be formed."
risk appetite,'Multiple medicines' side-effect risk for over-65s,2024-09-15,2019-08-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-49433927,"Two million older people are risking side-effects from taking multiple medications, a charity has warned. Age UK says more than one in 10 over-65s in England take at least eight prescribed medications each week. While many are vital for those with complex conditions, the charity says one in five may be inappropriate. GPs said no-one should be taking unnecessary medicines but people should not stop taking their medication without first talking to a doctor. Age UK says older people should not worry about taking many medicines - if they are appropriately prescribed and correctly managed. But the way the body processes medicines changes with age, so they may be more susceptible to side-effects, including: The charity wants older people to be fully involved in decisions about what they are prescribed, and for doctors to regularly review what patients are taking. Jane, 77, had been prescribed 17 different medicines, five of which have to be taken at least five times a day. She has 10 long-term conditions, including epilepsy, high blood-pressure, an underactive thyroid, osteoarthritis and psoriasis. Her GP asked for the medications to be dispensed into blister packs, with all the appropriate tablets for each day put into their own separate pack. But this didn't work for Jane and she stopped taking her medicines altogether. When a pharmacist went through what Jane was taking, they found seven of the 17 could be discontinued. They also stopped using the blister packs. Jane's blood pressure is now under control, she is having better treatment for her other conditions, and she's happy and more confident about the medicines she is taking. 'Fewer pills' Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: ""Our strong advice to older people is never to stop taking any of your medications off your own bat but to talk to your GP if you have concerns and to ask for a review if you haven't had one for a year or more.  ""Everyone's needs change over time and new treatments are always becoming available, so it is well worth your doctor looking at whether your medicines are the best they can be and, indeed, whether they are all still necessary.  ""Most older people would agree that the fewer pills they have to pop, the better."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said family doctors only prescribed a medication after weighing up the risks and benefits for the patient. ""Of course, we don't want to see people taking unnecessary medications - this is not good for the health of our patients or for NHS resources - and it is normal practice for any long-term prescriptions to be kept under review and reduced or discontinued if no longer necessary,"" she said. ""With many older people living with multiple and complex health conditions, prescriptions for more than one medication will often be vital and no course of treatment should be stopped without the advice and support of a GP or other suitably qualified healthcare professional."""
risk appetite,Legalising assisted dying 'a risk to vulnerable',2024-09-15,2020-01-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-51193400,"Giving terminally-ill people on the Isle of Man the right to choose when to die could put the ""vulnerable at risk"", a campaigner has said. Politicians are to be asked to consider legalisation on voluntary assisted dying at January's Tynwald sitting. Our Duty of Care (ODC) said a law change could pressurise people to end their lives ""prematurely"". Dr Alex Allinson MHK said the motion was an attempt to gauge political appetite for ""progressive reform"". ODC spokesman Dr David Randall said the island's ""superb palliative care services"" allowed people to have ""a comfortable and dignified death"". Isle of Man Freethinkers, who support a right to choose, previously said any debate should be ""based on science and compassion"". After giving a presentation to Tynwald members on the issue, Dr Randall said changing the law could put ""vulnerable people at risk of suffering real or imagined pressure from others to end their lives prematurely"", adding that the terminally-ill patients have ""the same legal protections as everyone else"". The Roman Catholic Church on the island has also opposed ""any liberalisation of current legislation"", with Monsignor John Devine stating in a letter to the chief minister that the church ""condemns the deliberate taking of life"". Dr Allinson said a law change ""would allow for more compassion and personal choice when a person's death is inevitable and imminent."" ""Whilst we have wonderful hospice and palliative care services on the island, there are still those who's suffering cannot be effectively treated."" The Isle of Man Medical Society and the Association of Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland have stated their official position is to oppose the legalisation.  A similar bid to change the law was thrown out by members of the House of Keys when the issue was last debated in 2015."
risk appetite,Apple shares hit record on iPhone growth,2024-09-15,2018-07-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45025871,"Apple shares hit a record on Wednesday, pushing the market value of the tech giant closer to the $1 trillion mark. The shares rose more than 5% to end at more than $201, close to the roughly $207 price needed to make it a $1tn company. The rise came after Apple reported strong demand for its most expensive iPhones, boosting quarterly revenue despite just 1% growth in shipments. The average iPhone price hit $724 (£552), well above the expected $694. The firm said its $999 iPhone X - launched last year - remained its most popular iPhone model in the quarter and had driven the higher sales price. Revenue growth of 31% in Apple's services business, which includes the App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, also boosted the firm's performance. Overall the tech giant's revenue jumped 17% year-on-year to a quarterly record of $53.3bn (£40.6bn), with every region except Japan reporting double digit growth. Profits rose to $11.5bn, up 32% compared to the same period in 2017. ""The lesson Apple's management has learned from the iPhone X, is when you sell a smartphone for more than $1,000 you can sell fewer units and still reap the financial benefits,"" said analyst Thomas Forte from DA Davidson & Co. If Apple's momentum continues, it could be the first US company to hit a $1tr market value. Globally, PetroChina reached that milestone in 2007, though the market cap, which is generally calculated by multiplying the number of shares in a company by its current share price, was measured using the price of its Shanghai-listed shares, not those traded elsewhere, and has since fallen. Apple already claims a market capitalisation of about $975bn, making it the world's most valuable company, ahead of Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft. To reach the $1tn threshold, Apple will need to see further increases to its share price - though exactly how high the price has to climb depends on how many shares Apple has.  That is changing as the firm is engaged in a generous share buyback programme, which it expanded by $100bn in May. The company is also vulnerable to trade tensions between the US and China, which have led to new tariffs and rattled global stock markets. The US is mulling additional duties on $200bn in Chinese imports, which could affect Apple's operations.  In recent days, state media in China have also had reports that fault Apple for not doing enough to counter spam in its messaging service. Apple chief executive Tim Cook told financial analysts on Tuesday that the firm is assessing the risk from the latest US tariff proposal but has not felt direct effects from the higher duties already put in place. ""Our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences,"" he said. However, he said he was optimistic that ""this will get sorted out"". Apple sold 41.3m iPhones in the April through June period, up 1% from last year. The appetite for the firm's most expensive phones marked a contrast with the world's largest smartphone seller Samsung, which disappointed investors by warning of lower than expected sales of its high-end Galaxy S9 . But Chinese tech company Huawei, which reported 15% revenue growth in the first half of this year, overtook Apple to become the world's second-biggest smartphone seller in the quarter, according to market research firms Canalys and IDC.  That left Apple in third place after Samsung and Huawei."
risk appetite,Conquering peaks (and diabetes) 50 times in 50 days,2024-09-15,2019-07-15,By Lauren Turner,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48931502,"Michael Shelver and Patrick Mertes both have a love of the outdoors and climbing. Neither has a functioning pancreas. How is type one diabetes affecting their bid to climb to the highest point in each of the 50 US states in just 50 days?  Being halfway up a mountain when you have a hypo - a low-blood sugar episode that can cause dizziness, disorientation and even unconsciousness - is far from ideal.  But it's a risk that friends Michael and Patrick are having to face every day as they aim to be the first with diabetes, they believe, to achieve 50 in 50. It's thought only 274 people have hit all 50 high points, most doing so over the course of their whole life, with just a handful going for the 50-day deadline.  Their mission is seeing them cover more than 16,000 miles, including hiking 315 miles of trails.   Their type one diabetes means their pancreas doesn't produce insulin, the vital hormone needed to allow cells to use glucose from food. Without insulin, your cells can be starved of energy and over time, dangerously high levels of glucose build up in the body.  If you have type one, insulin has to be injected, either manually or through an insulin pump, which Patrick and Michael use.  Too much or too little insulin can cause problems. And what makes the balancing act more difficult is that so many other things that can affect blood glucose - like exercise, altitude and adrenalin.  They started with the trickiest summit of all - the 20,310ft (6,190 metres) Denali in Alaska, North America's highest point. It was both a literal high for them, but also the source of dozens of low blood sugars as well as several episodes with ketones, a complication which can occur when blood sugars go too high. Patrick, who has been living with diabetes since 1997, when he was nine, says: ""What I've struggled with most so far was the altitude on Denali.  ""We did it fairly quickly in terms of the standard route - most people take up to 17 days and we summited in nine. That did have some effect on blood sugar, as well as my pulmonary health. ""I'm not a very emotional guy, but reaching the summit of Denali was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. Being able to not only attain that goal, but to do it with Michael, was next level for me.""  Another in the long list of potential issues is that insulin does not like extreme environments.  Michael, who was diagnosed in 2004 when he was 10-year-old, explains: ""We have to make sure our insulin is always in the normal temperature range, as it doesn't work properly outside of that.  ""On Denali, we had to take our insulin and place it inside something padded - so in this case, we chose a sock - and then put that sock inside an insulated flask, and then sleep with that inside our sleeping bags. It can get up to -40F there - it was around -25F at the summit for us.  ""We had to wear a lot of layers, with our pumps inside our inner jackets to make sure it stayed warm and that the tubing was OK, as that's more likely to freeze. None of it could be exposed to the air or it would freeze pretty quickly.""  Frozen insulin would mean it would not work, which could then lead to dangerously high blood sugar levels.  ""In remote areas, we have to be sure we have adequate supplies and back-ups,"" he adds. ""We can never be too far away from a pharmacy in case anything needs to be replaced - we can't afford not to.""  Patrick says that at certain altitudes, they're ""not using products the way they're meant to be used"", adding: ""So it's trial and error at that point.""   Millions of people around the world have diabetes. The majority of them, about 95%, have type two diabetes, which means their bodies do not properly use insulin, a naturally-occurring hormone secreted by the pancreas. Insulin is needed to get glucose - formed when carbohydrates are broken down by the body - from the bloodstream into cells.  Type two diabetes can be controlled through diet, exercise, oral medication or a combination of all three. Sometimes it requires the use of insulin. Certain groups are more at risk of getting type two, and in the US it is more common in African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, as well as older people.  Type one is an autoimmune condition where the body does not produce insulin at all, so it has to be injected through the skin. It cannot be prevented at all and can occur in people of every race as well as every shape and size. It used to sometimes be known as juvenile diabetes, but this was not accurate as it is not a childhood disease and can be diagnosed at any age.  About 1.25 million Americans have type one diabetes, with an estimated 40,000 diagnosed each year. Source: American Diabetes Association  The men have been friends since 2015, when they met while working for a type one diabetes non-profit organisation helping families affected by the condition.  They decided last year to plan a challenge that would allow them to bring people with type one diabetes together and to raise money for non-profit organisations helping get people with type one diabetes into the outdoors.  Patrick says: ""We have an affinity for adventure. I'd hiked the John Muir trail last year, and gave Michael a call afterwards, saying: 'I want to find a way to put together a big adventure with as many people from the type one community as we can'.  ""It's nice having someone else with you who knows all about being out of [blood glucose] range. There's no one I would trust more doing this adventure with.""  They spent the most time researching the technology they would use, choosing a continuous glucose monitoring system, which provides constant readings and information to your phone or a small device, instead of the old-school finger-pricking method of getting a blood glucose reading.  Their insulin pumps also use technology that can shut down insulin supply if blood glucose levels are heading too low.  They were projecting to finish in 41 days, but when they speak to the BBC - on their way to Spruce Knob, West Virginia - they're a day ahead of schedule and now expect to complete the challenge in 39 or 40 days. ""There's been a real ebb and flow of energy levels,"" says Patrick. ""We hit a wall today after getting in around 2.30am last night, then doing a nine-mile hike at 8.30am. But as long as we can get coffee in us and take the opportunity for rests when we can then we'll be OK. We feed off the energy from people who come out and meet us for the summits - it really invigorates us. ""Diabetes can be a really isolating condition - we don't necessarily look like we're sick or there's anything wrong with us. I think people have a hard time understanding it's a 24-7 thing. We never get a day off. ""So being able to build a community around type one can really transform how you see it. We wanted to prove to the rest of the world that if you plan ahead and have the right attitude, you can do anything with this condition.""  You'd think that such a gruelling schedule would mean having a healthy appetite.  But Michael says: ""Altitude can really affect appetite. My challenge at the moment is making sure that I'm eating enough. There's no consistency - we're never getting eight hours' sleep, and three set meals a day. We're sleeping a few hours at a time, living out of a van and then maybe eating at a gas station.""  Patrick agrees, adding: ""We're trying our best to get better at eating - but we're currently doing very well at living off granola bars and cheese strings. We've been so busy and have gone 12 hours and then realised we haven't had anything proper to eat, or we've just had snacks.""  Michael says: ""This whole experience is a metaphor for diabetes really. We've spent months planning for it - and then a huge storm can come in and change the plan. It's exactly how diabetes works. No matter how much you prepare, something is going to pop up.""   Patrick sums up their mission this way.  ""Multiple days, I've woken up and thought ""what the hell am I doing?'.  ""Then we'll have experiences that remind me of why we're doing this. In North Carolina, we did a hike with a high school freshman who's been experiencing some challenges. When we finished the hike, he said that it had helped him see there was a light in a dark tunnel - and now he says he's planning to hike the Appalachian Trail.  ""If what we're doing helps just one kid, it's worth it.""  Patrick and Michael have now completed the East Coast summits and are travelling to the Midwest before some of the bigger peaks on the West Coast. You can follow their progress here."
risk appetite,Feeding Britain: Can we grow it alone?,2024-09-15,2020-06-09,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52980630,"Self-sufficiency. Don't count on others. Look after ourselves. It's one response to crisis, which became more of a business concern after supplies from Asia were disrupted in the early phases of coronavirus crisis. Then airfreight was cut by aircraft being grounded, and the movement of people between countries all but stopped. It's become the mantra of Trumpians in the US - re-shoring manufacturing from Asia, and going into a risky spiral of trade spats with China. India's response to crisis has been to turn in on itself and its own markets. Going further back, it was also in Brexit rhetoric, telling us we didn't need to depend so much on imports from the continent, and should return to making things for ourselves. Complex supply chains, on which countless jobs depend? Tough luck - simplify 'em. That's the background to an initiative launched on Monday by the UK food and drink industry, to reverse the steady rise of dependence on imported food over recent decades. It's one of those initiatives to shape the future of the economy as Britain pulls out of crisis. That's despite a lot more crisis for the food and drink sector to deal with, before arrival at that less import-dependent destination. So before we consider a future of more British food for British gobs, how are things going in food and drink? We all still need food (some of us, I admit, have depended on it for lockdown comfort rather more than we should), and the retail sector has worked with producers to keep things flowing. The panic-buying and hoarding weeks of March seem a long time ago. The industry weathered that storm and moved on to the challenges of re-shaping retail and delivery to a very different landscape - with lower footfall, distancing and measures to protect staff - while demand was distorted by the running down of those hoarded food stocks. For many, the absence of restaurants and catering has been a huge challenge. Scottish salmon farmers used to supply enough for a million meals a day, much of it in sandwiches and catered meals. Fish farmers are having to find new routes to new markets. Tonnage has been left in farm cages, awaiting an upturn in demand, which means capital is tied up and revenue reduced. A lot of fish - farmed and caught by the deep-sea fleet - is filling up processors' freezer capacity.  Those who land langoustines and lobsters have had to find new markets and teach new tricks to home chefs. Producers have innovated by selling and delivering direct to the domestic customer. Prime cuts of beef that would normally be expertly grilled in a restaurant are being minced, because that's what the consumer will buy. I'm told by David Thomson, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation in Scotland, that the quality of the average pound of mince has never been higher. Farmers have had to adapt to far fewer migrant workers coming into Britain to work. They were quick to advertise jobs online for domestic recruits, aware that an employment crisis was breaking in other sectors. There was a lot of interest at first, I'm told. Some of that fed through to job applications. But very few British-based recruits have stuck with the job. It's hard work. To help the industry, one of the significant exemptions in the quarantine rule for inbound travellers is that farm workers can isolate as a group while working the berry fields. Some producers are struggling to find new markets. Without cafes open to froth up cappuccinos, our collective appetite for milk has fallen. But cows still have to be milked, particularly at this time of year with the ""spring flush"". The industry is asking: will there have to be a significant cull of Britain's dairy herd, to match supply with demand? Of course, producers desperately want restaurants, hotels and canteens to reopen. But that brings new risks. Whereas these outlets for food are now hibernating, with furlough payments to keep them alive, once they're exposed to a very uncertain market, without government support, Mr Thomson voices industry concerns that they may not last long, leaving their suppliers high and dry. He also points out that eating out in restaurants will be curtailed not only by government regulation and by customer anxiety about infection, but by the rise in unemployment meaning an aggregate reduction in spending power. Amid the uncertainty, one welcome aspect of government support that is rarely mentioned, but vital to business, is in trade credit insurance. That's the guarantee that you will be paid by the restaurant you're supplying with, say, butcher meat, even if the restaurant becomes insolvent. It's clear that the risk of that insolvency, when lockdown eases, will be much higher than before. Commercial insurance could be withdrawn or premiums could soar, so the government has stepped in with its own £10bn reinsurance guarantee, intended to keep those contracts flowing. But will it ensure that food and drink keeps flowing into the UK, to meet our demand and appetite for foreign fare? Possibly not. The prospect of a no deal on Brexit by the end of this year could usher in a sharp reduction in trade. To protect UK farmers, used to the protection of the Common Agricultural Policy of both subsidy and trade protection from non-Europeans, the UK would have to introduce high tariffs on imports. Without a special trade deal with the EU, that would have to apply to Europe as well. Or some free trade ideologues favour removing tariffs, opening up to lower cost producers elsewhere, and letting the market adjust. That would probably devastate farming. Amid the talk of opportunity, there is clearly also alarm: ""The UK's 7,000 small and medium-sized food and drink manufacturing enterprises are particularly vulnerable in the middle of the 'eating ecosystem'. There is little clarity on new trading arrangements due in seven months. ""It is essential we build an agreed, coherent plan on these key economic, environment and health issues for the UK. Early removal of tariffs would be very difficult to reverse, so we would advocate a more detailed case by case examination before final decisions are taken."" That is the view of the wide range of 31 producer organisations, from the overarching Food and Drink Federation to the niche Vinegar Brewers Association, with their outline plan for reform to the ""eating eco-system"". They cite the BBC in reporting that Britain's ability to feed itself has declined from 65% of the market in 1998 to 50% by 2017. That may reflect changing UK tastes and growing appetites, or a higher degree of specialisation and more efficient production across continental Europe. It could reflect a lack of incentives from markets and subsidies for the British farmer and other producers. The industry alliance would like us to adapt our eating choices to rely more on goods that can be produced in the UK. It suggests that could be tied in with government targets for healthier eating, from reduced fat to portion control. The various lobby groups offer up the prospect of animal welfare standards more attuned to British sensibilities and lower food miles travelled to help reach environmental targets. The plan is not for complete self-sufficiency. Turnips might make winter feel a lot longer than it is already. Instead, the target is to take the recent £24bn trade deficit in food and to cut it by £8bn. That would not only be achieved by substituting imported food with the home-grown variety, but by boosting exports. At present, the big exports are Scottish - whisky and salmon. After that, they are chocolate, cheese, pork, gin, beef and breakfast cereals. Even English wine makes the top 10. The industry's strategy borrows heavily from the joined-up approach to the food and drink export effort in Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland. It wants to see a similar approach to Scotland Food and Drink, with a new agency called UK Food and Drink, with £120m of annual UK government funding in its early years. They do so with a plea to retain divergent, devolved approaches across the UK. This is but one answer to the looming battles within government, and outside it, about adopting food standards from trading partners other than the European Union, and notably the US: have neither. But it's not that simple. There are powerful forces driving international trade in food. Other countries will want trade deals that open up more sales to the UK, not less. And it's a big ask of the consumer and retailers to make a shift to buying British, unless price, weakening sterling and tariffs combine for a decisive push in that direction. The industry senses, as others do, that the current Covid-19 crisis, followed by Brexit, together offer an opportunity to plough through change much faster than is usually possible. They want to plant a flag in the grocery aisles, which may be the union flag, the Saltire or Welsh dragon, in the hope that shoppers will rally to it and show patriotic loyalty to home-grown producers."
risk appetite,What's behind the rise of Asia's stock markets,2024-09-15,2017-10-26,By Virginia Harrison,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41651086,"Memory chips and China's economic muscle are among the factors that have put a rocket under Asian stocks this year, pushing markets to record or multi-year highs.  ""Everyone hated Asia markets for a long time,"" says Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors. ""Now we've moved on from there"".  Moved on indeed: South Korea's Kospi sits at a record; Japan's Nikkei 225 index is above a two-decade high; Hong Kong's Hang Seng is around a 10-year peak, while markets in India, Taiwan and Indonesia are among the others scaling fresh heights.  It's an unusual moment for equities in the region as strong corporate profits, economic stimulus and growth are overshadowing nearby political risks. ""Markets seem impervious to events,"" says CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy. ""Sabre-rattling from North Korea barely makes a dent"".  And some analysts argue that as long as US markets keep their cool, there's plenty of good times for investors in Asia still to come. Since the 2009 crash, global markets have been moving steadily higher - with a few stumbles en route.  Massive liquidity coupled with ultra-low interest rates has created a fertile environment for stocks to thrive. Asia has enjoyed a tailwind from record gains on Wall Street. At the same time, China's economy - aiming for 6.5% growth this year - has been  underpinning the broader region for some time.  The world's second largest economy has a big impact on the fortunes of other countries, even as its growth rate moderates. Take South Korea: It's seen double-digit export growth for the last 11 months, thanks largely to China, which buys about one-quarter of its products sold offshore.  ""China's improving economic conditions can really be seen as a trigger for the equity run in Asia,"" says IG Markets analyst Jingyi Pan.  Japan's economy is also gathering steam.  Exports are climbing and strong domestic spending on devices like cameras and computers from China is driving growth.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election, and the likely continuation of his Abenomics policies, was met with cheers from investors.  Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors in Japan believes the benchmark Nikkei index can track even higher.  ""Japan has a long way to go. There's $18tn in cash on the sidelines,"" he says, adding that most of that money is currently invested in low-yielding Japanese government bonds.  ""There's a similar boat load of money that wants to get out of China,"" Mr Rogers says. That money could find plenty of homes in Asia where equities are cheap relative to other parts of the world. Companies in the region are strengthening, and well-received results this earnings season have given markets a boost. For South Korean firms, the outlook is even brighter. CLSA analyst Paul Choi says at the beginning of 2017, people were expecting 10% corporate earnings growth, now that forecast is around 50%.  It's got a lot to do with memory chips. Higher prices for chips used in electronic devices have spurred index heavyweights like Samsung and SK Hynix, as well as the broader market.  In fact, Mr Choi says that fluctuations in the value of memory chips is more threatening to South Korea's market than provocations from its northern neighbour.  Which brings us back to North Korea.  Investors appear largely unshaken by displays of military aggression - missile tests and provocations against Japan - and analysts say markets have factored in the risk. Rogers Investment Advisors Mr Rogers describes the North Korea threat as ""kind of overblown"". That attitude will shift dramatically if threats turn to action. Until then, other risks to the Asian rally loom larger.  Turning off the stimulus tap and the ratcheting up of interest rates will dampen enthusiasm, while analysts point to China's ballooning debt as another threat to the region.  Mr Rogers says political risk and ""unpredictability"" hang over Asian markets and unexpected moves could stunt recent rallies. The threat of the ""unknown"" is a familiar refrain from market-watchers in the region.  ""The most damaging risks are the ones we don't forecast,"" says CMC Markets' Mr McCarthy.  A final recurring note of caution is the rush on Wall Street. Recent gains have been inspired by strong earnings, along with hopes of tax reform and business friendly policies under President Trump. But the chorus of concern about the market's sharp rise is growing on Wall Street. History shows a gradual climb-down from the record highs on US markets is unlikely, and a collapse could shock the world.  ""If the US blows up, most things will come off. [Asia] won't be immune,"" says Josh Crabb of Old Mutual Global Investors.   ""Markets tend to get euphoric and then they get fearful. Theoretically you shouldn't have boom and bust, but human behaviour drives stock markets more than logic."""
risk appetite,Why my family lives in a house full of puppies,2024-09-15,2018-12-24,By Rebecca Seales,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46595733,"Guide dogs are like politicians or Santa Claus: it's a bit hard to imagine them as babies.  But while I've never had a playpen of MPs crawling around my living room (promise…), I can't say the same about guide dog puppies.  This is the story of where guide dogs for blind and partially-sighted people really come from. It includes: why they wear nail-varnish as soon as they're born, why they're never scared of fireworks, and why you really must play them Guns N' Roses. Settle in, team. The pups and I have a tail we'd like to tell you… It was a hot July night when the 12 youngest children of Abby Seales made their appearance, slithering out in a 01:00 relay on my parents' kitchen floor. Abby, aged five, half-Labrador and half-Retriever, had some typical canine symptoms during her nine-week pregnancy: A spot of morning sickness, low appetite, clinginess, and - in the final hours - panting and contractions.    You could see the spasms move across her stomach when a puppy was on its way, each one ejected in a bag of fluid. In the wild, its mother would gnaw the sack open for the pup to take its first breath. But in this case, the job of ripping it fell to her human family. Five hours and one ""is it stuck?!"" panic later, a dozen perfect specimens lay curled beside their mum - six girls and six boys, 11 black and one lone golden. Why did these creatures, destined for life-changing work, enter the world in a bungalow in the Midlands instead of a high-tech vet's surgery? The answer is that it's standard practice. Every year, about 1,400-1,500 such pups are born in the UK, and Guide Dogs' 270 breeding mothers live with volunteers as full-time pets.  Abby, like the others, has never been a working guide dog - but she was marked out as breeding stock before she was born, as her parents had qualities the charity wanted to keep in the bloodline. Before their mother dog is due to give birth, volunteers are taught how to deliver a puppy and sent the right kit - comfy, absorbent bedding, medical gloves, and a special ""whelping box"" where the pups will live, complete with bars round the sides to stop the mother dog from sitting on any that lie against the walls. In case of emergency, staff from Guide Dogs are on 24-hour call. At the risk of sounding evil, Labrador puppies aren't at their cutest as newborns. They look like wrinkly hamsters. The Andrex Phase, when they lollop around irresistibly, kicks in at about five weeks.  At six weeks, we know ours will leave their mother for the Guide Dogs National Breeding Centre near Leamington Spa, where they'll have to pass a puppy profiling test - the first hurdle. Any that fail will be dropped from the guide dog programme. And what stands between these tiny squeakers and that judgement day is… just us. No pressure, right? So, first things first: the pups are born soggy. They get cold very easily, so each is gently dried with a soft towel and placed under an infrared heat lamp with its mother. As soon as one lies next to another, a problem emerges: at a few hours old, they look identical - but it's vital that we can tell them apart. Coloured collars would work, but playfighting pups can get tangled up in them. The lifesaver? Nail varnish. Each puppy gets a dab in a different place on its coat soon after birth, which its human carers use as a code.  The mark is placed where it's easy to spot - above any of the pup's legs, or at the base of its tail.  A little girl with a mark above her right foreleg would be known as ""RFG"" - or ""right fore girl"". And ""LHB"" would be ""left hind boy"" - a male puppy with a mark on his back leg.  They aren't the catchiest names, it's true. Pups get their proper ones at six weeks, when they're taken to the National Breeding Centre. In the meantime, some volunteers call them all after characters in Coronation Street or Harry Potter. But in the Seales family and dozens of others, it's become almost normal to coo, ""hiiiii, little right fore girrrrlllllll!"" at a tiny, wriggling ball of dog.  In this litter, we made one exception: The single golden puppy in our dirty dozen was nicknamed ""Mourinho"" after the famous football manager Jose, who named himself ""the Special One"".   Labs are legendary for their greed, and I can confirm the instinct kicks in young. At feeding time, each one turns into a milk-seeking missile.  Between zero and two weeks old, they are functionally blind and deaf, and can't stand up - so they move around by shuffling, like seals. When not competing for a teat, they can often be seen in a ""cuddle puddle"" formation - nestled close to each other and their mother for comfort and warmth. One of our littlest puppies quickly stood out because she seemed to lack the manic milk craving the rest were exhibiting. At two days old, she wasn't suckling properly and was noticeably weak and floppy.  Worse still, her weight was falling instead of rising rapidly. Puppies can deteriorate within hours at this age and we were extremely worried we might lose her.  Cradling the blanket-wrapped pup, we sought advice from Abby's brilliant ""doggy midwife"", Karen Stanton (formal title: ""Guide Dogs Brood Bitch Supervisor""), who visited the litter every few days to check their welfare. Her verdict: hand-feed the puppy every two hours with a syringe or a baby-style bottle, and a special formula milk. I definitely can't say this was easy. Not least because at the start, ""Poorly Pup"" (as she became known) was close to death and could hardly hold her head up. I can, thank heaven, say it was successful. Over several weeks, milk from her mother plus additional hand-feeding eventually got her weight up to a healthy level.  Puppies develop at an extremely rapid rate, which is both amazing and disarming to watch.  Between weeks two and three, they learn to stand, totter around like furry drunks, then walk steadily. Tails start wagging, they make a small growly noise, and playfighting breaks out everywhere. Guide dog pups try their first solid food between weeks three and four - and mealtimes become a messy affair. The charity favours a device called the ""multi-feeder"", where up to six pups can eat at the same time from six separate bowls. This rarely happens, as several would rather dive feet-first into their neighbour's dinner. If they were baby people, this would be the hideous toddler feeding stage… Luckily for our sanity, puppies also love sleep, which they pursue with the ardour of Olympians in a medal year. They also yawn more adorably than any creature yet seen on Earth. Maybe you're wondering about the weird Guns N' Roses reference at the start of this piece. Believe it or not, it wasn't (only) a clickbaity attempt to entice you in. In fact, music is part of ""puppy socialisation"", in which the mini hound learns to understand and interact with humans, and gets used to non-threatening noises and other goings-on.  Volunteers get a tick-list of things the pups should be introduced to - noisy toys and alarm clocks from week three, for example - and are encouraged to play them a wide variety of music. Ours got classic rock, Motown legends, a spot of Vivaldi, and some brass bands just in case their future owners like the trombone.  Since working guide dogs have to be calm about pet-spooking noises like bin trucks and thunderstorms, the charity also hands out a CD full of ""bad"" sounds to be introduced when they're two weeks old. (Sorry about the fireworks, little ones…) By six weeks, the rascally brood are annoying their mother with their sharp puppy teeth, and it's time for them to start the first leg of their training journey.  After many cuddles, all 12 leave at once, borne off to the National Breeding Centre, and the house feels unnaturally quiet without their squeaks, yelps and growls. At the centre, experts will test their temperaments, judging their confidence levels. It may sound brutal, but timid pups are unlikely to make good guides, and the charity deems it better not to put them through unnecessary stress. There's still a happy ending for pups that fail the assessment, though. They will be offered to other charities whose work relies on assistance and therapy dogs. Dogs for Good, for example, trains canines to help people with disabilities. Their amazing animals can fetch items from supermarket shelves, open doors, or even help empty the washing machine.  Some pups will go to work as medical detection dogs, supporting people with serious health conditions. Someone with a life-threatening nut allergy might have a dog to sniff rooms for nut traces, for example. As for the pups that pass the Guide Dogs tests, they'll be sent off across the UK to live with Puppy Walkers - volunteers who look after them from the age of seven weeks, until they're 14 months old and ready to start training in earnest.  For the benefit of this story, I was allowed into the breeding centre to see our puppies one last time. I'm not convinced Poorly Pup knew who I was, but I was certainly glad to see her again - curious, healthy, and on the verge of a new adventure.  Every year in the UK, 850 new guide dogs are carefully matched with blind or partially sighted owners. In many cases, it's a life-changing partnership.  To our absolute joy, this whole litter passed their puppy assessment tests, so they're all in the running to join them. All pictures subject to copyright"
risk appetite,Saudi Aramco flotation values oil giant at $1.7tn,2024-09-15,2019-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50450527,"Saudi Arabia has placed a preliminary valuation on state oil company Aramco of between $1.6tn (£1.22tn) and $1.7tn. The company has published an updated prospectus for its initial public offering (IPO), seeking more than $25bn for the sale of 1.5% of its shares.  That would make it potentially the world's biggest IPO, coming from the world's most profitable company  It is short of the $2tn valuation that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was reportedly keen to achieve. ""The base offer size will be 1.5% of the company's outstanding shares,"" the state-owned energy giant said in a statement that set the price range at 30-32 Saudi riyals per share ($8-$8.5). That could value the IPO at as much as 96bn riyals ($25.60bn) at the top end of the range. If priced at the top end, the deal could just beat the record-breaking $25bn raised by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Individual retail investors, as well as big institutions, will have a chance to buy shares. Aramco had initially been expected to sell some 5% of its shares on two exchanges, with a first listing of 2% on the kingdom's Tadawul bourse, and then another 3% on an overseas exchange. The firm says there are now no current plans for an international sale, with that long-discussed goal now seemingly being put on ice. Aramco called off a number of so-called roadshows for the shares, aimed at enticing foreign buyers, the Financial Times reported.  European meetings were cancelled on Monday after similar pitches in Asia and the US were dropped at the weekend, the newspaper said. The crown prince is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries. Analysts S&P Global Ratings said the stock market debut could enable Saudi Arabia to strengthen its financial position.  ""If subsequently effectively deployed, the funds raised could be used to support longer-term economic growth in Saudi Arabia,"" it said. In its prospectus released last week, the company lists a variety of investment risks ranging from terrorist attacks to geopolitical tensions in a region dominated by Saudi-Iran rivalry. The 600-page prospectus also includes the government's control over oil output as another potential risk. After the flotation, Aramco will not list any more shares for six months, the prospectus says. Although one of the attractions for investors is the potential of high dividends, the document said Aramco has the right to change dividend policy without prior notice. Aramco has hired a host of international banking giants including Citibank, Credit Suisse and HSBC as financial advisers to assess interest in the share sale and set a price. Based on the level of interest. The sale of the company, first mooted four years ago, has been overshadowed by delays and criticism of corporate transparency at Saudi Arabia's crown jewel.  Aramco last year posted $111bn in net profit. In the first nine months of this year, its net profit dropped 18% to $68bn. A third of Aramco's shares - about $8bn worth - will be sold to the man and (the prospectus says) even the divorced woman on the street, giving local Saudi Arabians a stake in their nation's cash cow for the first time.  A TV and billboard advertising campaign, as well as social media, is stoking enthusiasm on the ground and demand is expected to be high.  For the remaining $16bn, the oil giant is turning to institutional investors. And a source close to the company says there has been sufficient interest that they're confident they can cover most of this off within the Gulf.  But there will be disappointment amongst officials if global demand is not there for the jewel in Saudi Arabia's crown.  A fossil fuels company owned by an absolute monarchy in a volatile region are not an easy sell for many Western firms, pursuing the latest trend in investment policy of ""ESG"" (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria. Norway's sovereign wealth fund is among those to already rule themselves out from investing.  But the promise of sharing the promised annual $75bn cash dividend pot might be too good for some to miss, according to James Bevan, Chief Investment Officer at CCLA Investment Management (one of the UK's largest charity fund managers).  Given his firm's focus, he is not looking to invest in the shares but explains why some are. ""It's a 'risk' in the eyes of some investors to be very underweight in oil and gas, and Aramco may be a means of plugging a sector gap with perhaps less worry than associated with holding Gazprom,"" he says. Investors follow indexes - such as the FTSE 100 - which are made up of array of types of industries and so some feel oil and gas needs to be correspondingly represented in their portfolio. As Aramco's big sales pitch road show kicks off, the real test of investor appetite for the company will begin. "
risk appetite,Why I injected myself with an untested gene therapy,2024-09-15,2017-11-21,By Jessica Lussenhop,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41990981,"The moment Tristan Roberts became the first human to inject an untested, experimental gene therapy into his stomach fat, he was sitting on a leather couch in his friend-slash-yoga instructor's living room, not on a doctor's examining table. The glass coffee table in front of him was strewn with syringes. A Chihuahua mix wearing an inflatable recovery collar snored beside him. The event was livestreamed on Facebook, and hundreds tuned in (later, Roberts' mother watched, though she was ""not thrilled"" with his decision). On Roberts' right was Aaron Traywick, head of Ascendance Biomedical, the nascent company behind the treatment. A network of unnamed researchers around the US assembled the vials in front of them.  ""We do not advise that anyone watching this video do what is about to be done here,"" said Traywick, who is not a scientist and identifies primarily as a ""community organiser"".  ""Tristan Roberts is completely within his rights according to the FDA and the rule of law in this nation… to self-experiment on himself in any way that he deems medically appropriate. It is his body and it is his right."" Roberts - a wiry 28-year-old computer programmer with a mop of dirty blonde hair - also has no formal training in medicine or genetic engineering. That's partly the point. He and Traywick are members of a growing community of biohackers, the do-it-yourself movement in biology, medical science and genetics that has sprung up outside the confines of universities and pharmaceutical firms.  There are now biohacking conferences and community biohacking spaces in Silicon Valley, Boston, New York City and Austin, where high school students, biomedical start-up owners and professional scientists gather to educate and experiment together. Their simplest experiments include making glow-in-the-dark beer; the most lofty aim to cure disease, clean up oil spills, and defeat the aging process. What Roberts was about to do has been characterised by scientists and bioethicists as everything from ""fringe"" to  ""risky"" to ""frightening"". The harshest assessment came from Scott Burris, an expert on HIV public health policy at Temple University. ""This is delusional behaviour,"" he said. ""It's not plausible to me that this guy is even on planet Earth."" But Roberts believed these voices were too cautious, too hemmed in by convention. ""We may be risk takers but we're not stupid,"" he said. ""I think we're heading towards a part of time where patients and test subjects are able to have a greater stake in the outcome of the experiment."" Roberts is not the first person to inject himself with an unregulated gene therapy. At least three individuals have publicly attempted to augment themselves with genes that will inhibit cell death or boost muscle growth, and self-experimentation is also happening in private. But Roberts is the first person to do so publicly in search of a cure.  Six years ago he was diagnosed as HIV positive. Two years ago, he stopped taking conventional antiretroviral drugs.  His reasons were manifold - he hated the side effects, feared that missing a single dose could build up the virus' immunity. But he also rejects the idea of being on medication for the rest of his life. Roberts wants to be cured. ""I'm excited about the possibility of potentially curing this, maybe for a few months, maybe for a few years - maybe indefinitely,"" he said. ""But there's only one way to find out."" Roberts filled one of the syringes from the vial, lifted his T-shirt, and expelled a breath sharply. ""I want to dedicate this to all the people who have died while not being able to access treatment,"" he said. Then he pinched a thin fold of skin on the right side of his bellybutton and inserted the needle.  The tiny amount of liquid Roberts injected into the fat cells under his skin contained trillions of plasmids, hoop-shaped pieces of DNA containing a section that should trigger production of the antibody N6. A US National Institutes of Health (NIH) study showed N6 neutralised 98% of the HIV virus in lab conditions. The antibody came from a single person, one of the tiny number of HIV patients known to scientists whose bodies somehow manage the virus on their own. Roberts' hope, and the hope of the treatment's creators at Ascendance, was that the plasmids would successfully cross into the nuclei of Roberts' cells and coax them into producing N6 antibodies. The goal is a ""moonshot"" - a cure for HIV, and one the biohackers believe they can bring to market faster and more cheaply than institutions hampered by regulations and corporate concerns over profitability. ""DNA is a language and I believe people that already live in this generation will learn to be poets of that language,"" Machiavelli Davis, a friend of Roberts who helped develop the treatment, said on the Facebook Live.  Many scientists and bioethicists argue that experiments like this one are too amateur to produce any meaningful results, that the dangers of self-experimentation outweigh the speculative benefits, or that patients who try self-experimentation may have no idea what they're signing up for.  ""I strongly fear that, without a robust structure for conducting risk-assessment and handling risk and liability issues, the Ascendance Biomedical model will only transfer all these heavy, complex responsibilities to individuals at their own cost and peril,"" wrote Eleonore Pauwels, a science policy expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and an expert in genomics.  But now that anyone can obtain a custom gene sequence with the ease and convenience of online shopping, people like Roberts can play in a genetic arena that was once walled off.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can crack down on unlicensed human testing, and the sale of gene-editing products or kits intended for self-experimentation is against the law. But whether or not the act of self-administering an untested drug is illegal is a grey area amateur scientists and biohackers are eagerly taking advantage of. ""We've been living in a medical system that is very paternalistic, where you don't learn what happens in your body. What you see happening now, it's the rise of the new bio-citizen,"" said Pauwels. ""How do you democratise [medicine] without taking an enormous amount of risk? It's a big question."" Three weeks later, Roberts walked into the chilly offices of a blood testing facility in downtown Washington DC for his second blood test since self-administering the treatment. In a few days, he'd be able to see if the treatment was having any effect on the virus. A tall lab technician in a papery smock sat Roberts in a padded chair and deftly collected three vials of Roberts' blood in under a minute. ""I'm excited to see the results, but at the same time it's tempered by a bit of non-attachment. It's rare that you get things right on the first shot,"" said Roberts. ""I'm in this for the long haul."" Roberts' friends and family were nervous about his desire to become ""patient zero"", but knew better than to try to talk him out of it. A few years ago, he left a $75,000-a-year computer programming job after he said the money and the comfortable apartment weren't making him happy.  He has no permanent address, floating between his boyfriend, his family and friends' homes. For his freelance programming work, he insists on being paid only in cryptocurrency, though that presents its own logistical challenges. He nearly couldn't pay for the bloodwork because he was having problems quickly converting his Bitcoins into dollars. Last year, during a protest through downtown DC, police officers arrested Roberts after they said he spray painted the word ""CORRUPT"" on FBI headquarters.  ""Occupy the city!"" he yelled just before the officers pushed his head into the car. (He did community service in exchange for a clean record.) Despite his appetite for risk, Roberts was feeling uneasy in the three weeks since injecting the plasmid treatment. First, the skin on his back broke out in large red bumps. He figured he was bitten by mosquitoes, but couldn't be sure. Then he was felled for four days by a strange, feverish feeling, a loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal issues.  ""I'm fricking terrified it might be the plasmid,"" he said. ""I'm 98% certain this is fine. But there's still this 2% that's like - this could be something terrible."" The nightmare scenario would be that the plasmid was replicating out of control. If he went to the emergency room, could the doctors there be expected to help when they had no understanding of the substance he'd injected?  Then again, he thought, was this a sign that the treatment was actually working? After a few days, the symptoms subsided, leaving Roberts to wonder what was happening inside him. By the time he took the blood test, the Facebook Live video of the injection had been viewed more than 20,000 times. Mark Connors, the lead NIH scientist who discovered the N6 antibody, was among the viewers.  Connors was unimpressed with the scientific reasoning behind the treatment.  ""These seem like very smart young men and they have command of some of the facts, but not all the facts,"" he said. While N6 is more versatile than any other HIV antibody previously discovered, Connors said it can't wipe out the virus all on its own, and there is a debate raging in the field about whether or not antibodies alone will ever be able to cure the virus. HIV's protein envelope continuously mutates, shifting into forms that prevent our antibodies from binding to and neutralising it. As potent as N6 is, HIV can still develop a resistance to it, making it a poor candidate as a ""monotherapy"" or stand-alone treatment, said Connors. ""For the most part, the rules aren't what take so long [in drug development],"" he added. ""It's not the FDA sitting on drugs. The reality is this is a deliberative process."" Another thing that concerned scientists about Ascendance was the lack of detailed information on the company's website - there's no phone number, nor a list of employees or advisors. Traywick said this is in part due to proprietary reasons and in part because the company is still so young. But he also said he needs to obscure the identities of the working scientists who are biohacking for Ascendance on the side, to avoid opening them up to legal or reputational risk.  Traywick put the BBC in touch with the researcher who assembled Roberts' treatment by phone, though he refused to give his name or location in the US. He codenamed him ""M McConaughey"" - a reference to actor Matthew McConaughey's portrayal of the 1980s amateur HIV researcher in the film The Dallas Buyers Club. In a call, ""McConaughey"" actually disagreed with Traywick and Roberts' decision to livestream the first injection, and with throwing the word ""cure"" around. He agreed with Connors that this first dose is unlikely to have an impact, and worried that the livestream set up unrealistic expectations. ""Even when you're doing everything you can to make things quick, you can't be nature,"" he said. ""Biology is very slow and difficult."" Among the tiny handful of biohackers and researchers who have publicly self-experimented with gene therapy, there is disagreement over whose science is sound. Josiah Zayner, chief executive of a company that sells do-it-yourself gene-engineering kits, has injected himself with gene therapies in front of live audiences, but he refused to comment on Ascendance or Roberts, writing that they have ""very little idea what they are doing"".  Brian Hanley, a microbiologist who gave himself a gene therapy designed to increase his stamina and life span, hates being called a biohacker. While he sees little problem with scientists experimenting on themselves, he fears that biohackers who promote self-experimentation will encourage total amateurs to take risks they don't understand. ""[They] could give themselves a significant issue, potentially including dying from it,"" said Hanley. ""The biggest danger is you could infect yourself with something."" George Church, a pioneer in genome sequencing who has become a de facto sounding board for people interested in self-experimentation, said that while he always recommends caution, clinical trials and the involvement of physicians, sometimes startling results can come from a single patient. He pointed to the example of Barry Marshall, a physician who in the mid-1980s proved that ulcers are caused by bacteria - by drinking an infectious broth. ""It was dramatic enough that it led to his Nobel prize,"" said Church. ""Anything is possible."" On yet another friend's couch in a tidy townhouse in Arlington, Virginia, Roberts prepared to go on Facebook Live again to share the results of his blood tests. He had purposefully not looked at the data yet. The room was full of people. A film crew for a forthcoming documentary series on biotech prepared to capture his reaction. Aaron Traywick watched from the kitchen, and three of Roberts' friends whispered in the background. ""My greatest fear of turning out to be Geraldo Rivera is popping up,"" Roberts said. ""He goes to reveal what's inside Al Capone's vault and it's just some trash, some empty beer bottles."" Without the means to test for the presence of N6 in Roberts' blood, they were relying on his viral load count. The day before injecting the treatment, his blood contained 11,912 copies of the virus per millilitre. He hoped to see that the viral load dropped to 2,000 copies or less. If it was in the 2,000 to 8,000 range, conclusions would be hard to draw. A flat or increased viral load could indicate the treatment had failed.  Although Roberts enthused about a patient-controlled future when the democratisation of medicine has toppled big pharma, this was obviously also personal. He admitted to fantasising about telling his parents over Thanksgiving dinner that the treatment had worked.  He also recalled getting a paper cut soon after he first found out he was HIV positive. Looking down at his hand, he saw his own blood as a poison. ""That's what I'm looking forward most to helping heal,"" he said. ""It's not necessarily the infection itself, but the possibility of harming others."" After greeting the audience on Facebook Live (which again included his mother), Roberts told them: ""I think it's time."" He opened the documents sent from the lab and frowned slightly as he read. Then he laughed. ""Alright, so - yeah, this was not what we were hoping for."" According to the test results, Roberts' viral load rose from 28,800 on week two to 36,401 on week three - still low levels, but not the desired results. His count of CD4 helper T-cells - the immune system cell that HIV attacks - was higher than he'd ever seen it, but there was no way to know what that meant. ""More data is necessary,"" Traywick chimed in from off-camera. Then he sat down next to Roberts, joking: ""We didn't kill you."" After they switched off the broadcast, Traywick slumped backwards in his seat. One of Roberts' friends quietly slipped the magnum of sparkling wine that had been sitting on the kitchen counter into the refrigerator. They opened a bottle of red instead. Traywick said that this is part of his vision for the company - one that shares its failures publicly just as readily as its successes.  ""I am a little bit let down,"" said Roberts, sipping from his glass. ""It's hard.""   Despite the initial failure, Roberts said he believes that the gene therapies that he and others are testing will hold the key to obliterating HIV, as well as other diseases that have stumped the medical field. ""It's opened up so many possibilities, it's redefining what it means to be human."" In December, Ascendance's researchers will release a second version that contains 10 to 100 times the number of plasmids; Roberts plans to inject that as well. He has no plans to return to medication and said he fully expects to be cured someday. Connors, the NIH researcher, tuned in to Facebook to watch Roberts get his results. He disagreed with the biohackers' belief that traditional research methods move too slowly - human trials of N6 injections are set to being in early 2018 - and he said that he wished Roberts would go back on anti-virals.  ""It kind of breaks my heart,"" he said. But, he added, Roberts actually has something in common with the patients whose bodies naturally create antibodies like N6 and others currently being studied as a means to combat the virus.  ""The people who make up the cohort are people who refuse treatment,"" he said. ""They have a similar independent streak."""
risk appetite,Russia and West talk all week but war risk remains,2024-09-15,2022-01-14,By Paul Adams,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59985589,"Is Europe a safer place after a week of diplomacy that has criss-crossed the continent? The short answer is probably no. From marathon talks in Geneva between the US and Russia, to the first meeting of the Nato-Russia Council in more than two years, to a session of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe in Vienna, grievances have been aired, red lines drawn, accusations levelled. Wendy Sherman, Washington's veteran negotiator, spoke of ""a better understanding of each other and each other's priorities and concerns"", after almost eight hours of talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Monday. For his part, Mr Ryabkov said the Americans had ""considered our concerns seriously"". When the focus shifted to Nato, the Alliance's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke of ""a general willingness and support of the idea of dialogue"" from his Russian interlocutors. At a time when 100,000 Russian troops maintain their menacing presence on Ukraine's northern and eastern borders - the comings and goings of specific units and pieces of equipment minutely analysed for clues as to the Kremlin's true intentions - the fact that so much time has been spent talking this week is positive. It seems too early to talk about a process. Mr Stoltenberg said the Russians were not yet ready to agree to a schedule of further meetings. Mr Ryabkov appeared to pour cold water on the idea of more dialogue. ""I do not see reasons to sit down in the coming days,"" he told Russian TV, ""to gather again and start the same discussions."" The reality is that no-one has really agreed what these talks are about. For the West, it's all about preventing a Russian military incursion into Ukraine. For Russia, it seems to be about stopping Nato in its tracks: preventing Ukraine from ever joining and, beyond that, rolling back the Alliance's presence and activities on the territory of the old Soviet empire. When Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, spoke to journalists after Wednesday's meeting at Nato, he launched into a protracted litany of grievances about the Western alliance's behaviour since the end of the Cold War. He sought to portray Nato as an aggressive presence in Europe, with Russia as the continent's only real peacekeeper. If Nato tries to contain Russia, he warned, ""there will be a policy of counter-containment"". ""If there is deterrence, there will be counter-deterrence."" In the Kremlin's world view Russia is threatened, not threatening; Russia's troops are minding their own business on Ukraine's border, while Nato's modest presence in countries bordering Russia is unacceptable. It's head-spinning stuff at times, but stems from a lingering, deep-seated resentment at the collapse of Russia's sphere of influence at the end of the Cold War, and what Moscow sees as the speed with which Nato took advantage. The West's response so far, apart from the threat of ""massive"" consequences should Russia invade Ukraine, is to offer reciprocal ""risk-reduction"" measures, including the placement of missiles in Europe and greater transparency on the size and scope of military exercises. But most of this is about repairing the fraying edges of Europe's existing security architecture, rather than inventing a radically new one - something for which there is no appetite within Nato.  And so, for the time being, the two sides are talking across each other, with no guarantee that even this dialogue of the deaf will continue. Ms Sherman noted that the Russian side had not ruled out holding more talks, but warned that if Russia walked away, it would be ""quite apparent that they were never serious about pursuing diplomacy at all"". At the end of this big week of diplomacy, Polish Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairman Zbigniew Rau warned that the risk of war was greater now than at any time in the last 30 years. It's hard to disagree. "
risk appetite,"Public need 'home truths' on economy, says Hammond",2024-09-15,2021-02-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56182669,"Former Chancellor Lord Hammond has said the government must risk unpopularity and tell ""some difficult home truths"" about the state of the economy.   He told the BBC that dealing with the pandemic had been the financial equivalent of ""fighting a war"". But giving money away was easier than collecting it for ""a populist government"", he added. A No 10 spokeswoman said she ""doesn't recognise"" his characterisation of a government reluctant to be unpopular. She added that the pandemic had shown Boris Johnson was ""a prime minister that is prepared to take difficult decisions and is weighing up very hard choices at the moment"". The Budget on Wednesday comes amid rising unemployment and follows the biggest UK annual economic shrinkage on record. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Hammond - who resigned as chancellor when Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019 - said the economy had taken a ""huge hit"" from Covid-19, but should ""bounce back"". There had been ""long-term scarring"", with sectors like aviation and hospitality suffering ""permanent damage"", and transport and retail ""changed forever"", he added. Official figures show the UK economy contracted by 9.9% in 2020 - more than twice as much as in any previous year on record. On Tuesday, it was revealed unemployment had risen to 5.1% in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. And the national debt - worsened by furlough, other pandemic help schemes and falling tax takes - stands at more than £2 trillion. Lord Hammond said it was unlikely in the ""foreseeable future"" that ministers would be able to ""do anything that will actually see the debt starting to fall"". ""But what matters is not the absolute size of the debt, but the size of the debt relative to our economy,"" he said. ""If we can grow the British economy over the coming years, then just as we did after the Second World War, we can make the debt fade in significance, because, although it stays the same in absolute terms, it becomes a much smaller percentage of our national economy."" Philip Hammond has never been Boris Johnson's number one fan, to put it mildly. They clashed on Brexit, with the former chancellor being booted out of Parliamentary Conservative Party during the wild political autumn of 2019. But even though he is back in the party fold, and with the ermine of a Tory member of the House of Lords no less, the former occupant of No 11 isn't mincing his words. While he sticks to the broad consensus backing the government's massive emergency economic support during the pandemic, Lord Hammond looks very pointedly to the challenges that will come next, questioning whether Downing Street will have the right priorities. His not very subtle implication: Downing Street would rather be popular than do the right thing. Read more from Laura here. Lord Hammond said the challenge facing the government was ""how to move out of this crisis period"".  He praised Mr Sunak for getting the economic response right so far and said he was ""very confident"" his instincts were ""the right ones"".  But he said his fear was ""that as a populist government, giving money away is always easier than collecting it in"", and warned that ministers had ""made very extravagant commitments to the British electorate in good faith before the coronavirus crisis"". ""Not all of those commitments can now sensibly be delivered on and that's going to be a big challenge for a government that regards its short-term popularity as very, very important,"" Lord Hammond added. He said he was ""not sure"" the current ""top leadership"" had the ""appetite for being unpopular, in order to do the right thing"". The prime minister has said the chancellor will set out the government's plans to ""build back better"" in next Wednesday's Budget.  Mr Sunak has promised to lay out the ""support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery"", adding: ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy."" A Treasury spokesman added: ""The chancellor has always put protecting jobs and livelihoods at the heart of everything he has done and that will not change. ""This Budget will give people the reassurance they need in the immediate term, and he will be honest with the British people about how we are going to recover beyond this crisis."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""not the time"" for tax increases for individuals or businesses, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. James Green, who runs the Whitstable Oyster Company in Kent, says the impact of the pandemic has been ""tough"". ""Obviously there's Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, which affected us, the restaurant side of the business and the oyster sales. We were open over the summer. We were busy, like most coastal places, and then we shut again in November."" But Mr Green adds: ""For the oyster side of the business the impact of Brexit is probably had more of an effect than Covid-19, I would say."" As a result of Britain leaving the single market, he says he has tons of oysters sitting on his farm that he cannot sell either to France or domestically.  Mr Green says the chancellor should give the shellfish industry ""some help to get us through now - otherwise there won't be one"". "
risk appetite,Malta and Balearics join Scotland green travel list,2024-09-15,2021-06-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57601808,"Malta, Madeira and the Balearics are being added to the international travel green list for Scotland. The Scottish Government said there would be close monitoring of the Balearics ahead of the next review in three weeks. Other green list additions include Antigua, Barbados and Bermuda. The changes come into effect on 30 June. The easing follows the latest review of the travel risk 'traffic light' system which came into effect on 17 May. The destinations have also been added to the UK's green list for international travel. A number of destinations, including Tunisia and Uganda, have been added to the red list which requires managed isolation for 10 days on return. The Scottish government said it was considering the evidence for easing amber list travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people.  It said caution around public safety meant no decision on this was expected immediately, and four nations discussions would continue. GREEN LIST: Malta, Madeira, Balearic islands (Ibiza, Menorca, Majorca and Formentera), Antigua, Barbados, Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Anguilla, Montserrat, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Pitcairn, Turks and Caicos Islands. RED LIST: Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia, Uganda The latest analysis of international travel restrictions has brought no changes to the green and red list requirements. Travellers currently returning from red list countries are required to enter managed isolation.  Amber list returnees must self-isolate at home with two Covid tests on days two and eight.  Travellers returning from green list countries are not required to isolate, with a Covid test on day two. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""From the outset we have said caution is required regarding international travel and people should think very carefully about travelling abroad as situations can suddenly change. ""We continue to work closely with the other home nations and are cautiously supportive of exploring options for the easing of restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers arriving from countries on the amber list. ""But only if the clinical advice supports it and if systems are in place to ensure the wider safety of the Scottish population."" Joanne Dooey, president of the Scottish Passenger Agents' Association, said any destination making it onto the green list was welcome. She said: ""The Balearic Islands are one of the most popular destinations for Scots to travel on holiday. The additional Caribbean destinations are also good news.  ""Travel agents can hope for a surge in bookings as the schools break up. This coming weekend should have been the big holiday exodus for many Scottish families - the busiest weekend of the year.  ""There is a strong appetite for travel and we need this change to be a consistent one to try to help Scotland's travel sector survive. Being able to travel to amber countries if you have been double vaccinated is the next positive move we need. "" "
risk appetite,Airport in 'strong position' despite Flybe loss,2024-09-15,2020-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51749302,"Cardiff Airport is in a ""very strong position"" to survive the loss of Flybe, the economy minister said. The airline went into administration on Wednesday, putting 2,000 jobs at risk. About 330,000 passengers a year flew with the airline from Cardiff Airport to destinations such as Dublin, Edinburgh, Belfast, Cork and Paris. Cardiff Airport said all Flybe flights had been cancelled and its passengers should not travel to the airport unless they had booked alternative flights. Economy Minister Ken Skates said that while Flybe represented 24% of the airport's traffic, it made up 5.6% of its total revenues. ""Whilst of course it will be challenging to mitigate this loss, Cardiff Airport is not at risk,"" he added. But Plaid Cymru said the collapse of airline was ""deeply concerning"". Peter Hughes, regional secretary of Unite Wales, called it a ""very worrying development,"" which would leave hundreds of Welsh workers extremely concerned.  He called for all levels of government to provide a ""coordinated strategic response"" to ensure the airport remained viable. The collapse of Flybe is a huge blow for Cardiff Airport, with about 330,000 of the 1.6m passengers flying from the airport every year using the airline. That is a huge proportion, but not as much as it used to be. It is a serious blow not just for the number of passengers, but for those using the shops and other services provided by Cardiff Airport. We have seen in the past that when airlines have pulled out, Cardiff Airport has found replacements for some busy routes fairly quickly, such as Glasgow, but it is a very difficult time for airlines, and it has not just been Flybe who have been struggling. Cardiff Airport had been trying to get a loan from the Welsh Government and it had been said that a catastrophic event, like the collapse of an airline, would be taken into account as part of the decision making process. Mr Skates said ""incredibly hard work"" had been put in at the Welsh Government-owned airport over the past years to safeguard it. He pointed to the fact Loganair had already stepped in to take on the Cardiff to Edinburgh flights as evidence it has a viable future. It will begin daily flights between the Welsh and Scottish capitals from 23 March. Flights to Anglesey, Teesside, and Aberdeen will continue to be operated as normal by Eastern Airways, which had been a franchise of Flybe.  In a letter to the airline's staff, Flybe chief executive Mark Anderson said: ""Despite every effort, we now have no alternative - having failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading. ""I am very sorry that we have not been able to secure the funding needed to continue to deliver our turnaround."" None were employed in Cardiff - there were 50 at the airport, but they left in October when the airline closed its base there. Cardiff Airport's chief executive Deb Bowen Rees said the loss of the airline would have a ""large impact"" on the business, but the airport was in a strong position to deal with the loss. She said the airport was ""actively talking to a number of airlines"" about taking over core domestic routes. The Welsh Government bought the struggling airport in 2013 for £52m and while passenger numbers have increased, in December 2019 the airport posted a pre-tax loss of £18.5m.  ""Really we are in a much stronger position to address this now and Flybe have played a very important part in enabling us to get to this position,"" Ms Bowen Rees told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales. ""The advice for passengers booked on Flybe-operated flights is not to come to the airport today or over the next few days, but to check the Civil Aviation Authority website - all our other flights are continuing to operate as normal."" Transport for Wales said any stranded passengers would be able to use their trains for free to get to their destination for the next seven days, providing they had a valid boarding pass. First Group trains, which runs Great Western Railway and Avanti West Coast, said people could have free travel to their final destination by ""any reasonable route"" if they show a valid Flybe boarding pass on Thursday. National Express has also offered to provide free coach travel when there is a comparable route available.  Flybe customers who bought tickets directly from the company will not be protected by the Atol scheme. However, if you went through a travel agent or other third party you might be covered. Some people may be able to get their money back if they paid by credit card or with some debit cards. The Welsh Government said: ""We are working closely with the UK government and the management team at Cardiff Airport on the impact of the Flybe news."" Ministers had been considering giving the airport a further £6.8m, after approving a loan of £21.2m last year, to invest in buildings and infrastructure, route development, and security. Plaid Cymru said the collapse of the airline, which attracted between 320,000 to 340,000 passengers to Cardiff a year, was ""deeply concerning"" and serious questions needed to be asked about the Welsh Government's handling of the airport's loan. The Welsh Conservatives urged the Welsh Government to work fast to replace the routes and secure jobs. Mr Skates' defended the Welsh Government's investment in the airport, saying it would have gone out of business without it. ""A lot of opposition members didn't want us to save the airport,"" he told BBC Wales. ""The airport, there is no doubt, would not have survived until today had the Welsh Government not rescued it."" BBC MasterChef winner Gary Maclean was due to fly from Glasgow to Cardiff for an event on Thursday, and is now driving nearly 400 miles to get there. ""We woke up to a text saying the flight wasn't happening,"" he said. ""We had to be up at 03:30 GMT, we didn't have any other plans to get there."" ""It's just one of those things,"" he said. A woman who used Flybe to visit her son and granddaughter in Jersey said her ""lifeline had just been broken"". Jacquie Morgan from Cardiff told Dot Davies on BBC Radio Wales: ""We regularly fly back and forth, every holiday, and they obviously come over here for holidays. ""What is the alternative? It'll cost us a lot. It's time as well,"" she said. Katie Johnson from Cardiff was on holiday with her husband and four-year-old daughter when she got a text saying the airline had gone into administration. The family were due to fly home at 12:15 on Thursday.  ""It's been a stressful morning sorting things. The ATOL advice line was useless and the number the Civil Aviation Authority gave wasn't taking calls,"" she said. After spending almost two hours on the phone to her travel company, she was told the family could fly to Bristol Airport on Thursday evening as their package holiday was ATOL protected. ""The travel company in fairness have been good. Thank goodness we had a package holiday,"" she said. Flybe had been hoping for a £100m lifeline and changes to Air Passenger Duty taxes. The carrier ran into difficulties last year and was bought by a consortium which includes Virgin Atlantic. In January, the new owners said they would pump £30m into the business to keep it afloat, but appealed to the UK government for additional support. Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, said Cardiff's departure board would be looking ""very very thin"". ""Because Flybe was losing so much money we can conclude that most of its routes were loss-making,"" he said. ""Now that doesn't necessarily mean they were all loss-making, and if you look, for instance, at the flights from Cardiff to Edinburgh, you have basically three a day. ""It might be that Ryanair or EasyJet would come in and offer one or two a day. ""But other routes - I genuinely fear that there is not going to be much of an appetite for, for example, putting on a flight to Jersey,"" he said."
risk appetite,Feeding Britain: Can we grow it alone?,2024-09-15,2020-06-09,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52980630,"Self-sufficiency. Don't count on others. Look after ourselves. It's one response to crisis, which became more of a business concern after supplies from Asia were disrupted in the early phases of coronavirus crisis. Then airfreight was cut by aircraft being grounded, and the movement of people between countries all but stopped. It's become the mantra of Trumpians in the US - re-shoring manufacturing from Asia, and going into a risky spiral of trade spats with China. India's response to crisis has been to turn in on itself and its own markets. Going further back, it was also in Brexit rhetoric, telling us we didn't need to depend so much on imports from the continent, and should return to making things for ourselves. Complex supply chains, on which countless jobs depend? Tough luck - simplify 'em. That's the background to an initiative launched on Monday by the UK food and drink industry, to reverse the steady rise of dependence on imported food over recent decades. It's one of those initiatives to shape the future of the economy as Britain pulls out of crisis. That's despite a lot more crisis for the food and drink sector to deal with, before arrival at that less import-dependent destination. So before we consider a future of more British food for British gobs, how are things going in food and drink? We all still need food (some of us, I admit, have depended on it for lockdown comfort rather more than we should), and the retail sector has worked with producers to keep things flowing. The panic-buying and hoarding weeks of March seem a long time ago. The industry weathered that storm and moved on to the challenges of re-shaping retail and delivery to a very different landscape - with lower footfall, distancing and measures to protect staff - while demand was distorted by the running down of those hoarded food stocks. For many, the absence of restaurants and catering has been a huge challenge. Scottish salmon farmers used to supply enough for a million meals a day, much of it in sandwiches and catered meals. Fish farmers are having to find new routes to new markets. Tonnage has been left in farm cages, awaiting an upturn in demand, which means capital is tied up and revenue reduced. A lot of fish - farmed and caught by the deep-sea fleet - is filling up processors' freezer capacity.  Those who land langoustines and lobsters have had to find new markets and teach new tricks to home chefs. Producers have innovated by selling and delivering direct to the domestic customer. Prime cuts of beef that would normally be expertly grilled in a restaurant are being minced, because that's what the consumer will buy. I'm told by David Thomson, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation in Scotland, that the quality of the average pound of mince has never been higher. Farmers have had to adapt to far fewer migrant workers coming into Britain to work. They were quick to advertise jobs online for domestic recruits, aware that an employment crisis was breaking in other sectors. There was a lot of interest at first, I'm told. Some of that fed through to job applications. But very few British-based recruits have stuck with the job. It's hard work. To help the industry, one of the significant exemptions in the quarantine rule for inbound travellers is that farm workers can isolate as a group while working the berry fields. Some producers are struggling to find new markets. Without cafes open to froth up cappuccinos, our collective appetite for milk has fallen. But cows still have to be milked, particularly at this time of year with the ""spring flush"". The industry is asking: will there have to be a significant cull of Britain's dairy herd, to match supply with demand? Of course, producers desperately want restaurants, hotels and canteens to reopen. But that brings new risks. Whereas these outlets for food are now hibernating, with furlough payments to keep them alive, once they're exposed to a very uncertain market, without government support, Mr Thomson voices industry concerns that they may not last long, leaving their suppliers high and dry. He also points out that eating out in restaurants will be curtailed not only by government regulation and by customer anxiety about infection, but by the rise in unemployment meaning an aggregate reduction in spending power. Amid the uncertainty, one welcome aspect of government support that is rarely mentioned, but vital to business, is in trade credit insurance. That's the guarantee that you will be paid by the restaurant you're supplying with, say, butcher meat, even if the restaurant becomes insolvent. It's clear that the risk of that insolvency, when lockdown eases, will be much higher than before. Commercial insurance could be withdrawn or premiums could soar, so the government has stepped in with its own £10bn reinsurance guarantee, intended to keep those contracts flowing. But will it ensure that food and drink keeps flowing into the UK, to meet our demand and appetite for foreign fare? Possibly not. The prospect of a no deal on Brexit by the end of this year could usher in a sharp reduction in trade. To protect UK farmers, used to the protection of the Common Agricultural Policy of both subsidy and trade protection from non-Europeans, the UK would have to introduce high tariffs on imports. Without a special trade deal with the EU, that would have to apply to Europe as well. Or some free trade ideologues favour removing tariffs, opening up to lower cost producers elsewhere, and letting the market adjust. That would probably devastate farming. Amid the talk of opportunity, there is clearly also alarm: ""The UK's 7,000 small and medium-sized food and drink manufacturing enterprises are particularly vulnerable in the middle of the 'eating ecosystem'. There is little clarity on new trading arrangements due in seven months. ""It is essential we build an agreed, coherent plan on these key economic, environment and health issues for the UK. Early removal of tariffs would be very difficult to reverse, so we would advocate a more detailed case by case examination before final decisions are taken."" That is the view of the wide range of 31 producer organisations, from the overarching Food and Drink Federation to the niche Vinegar Brewers Association, with their outline plan for reform to the ""eating eco-system"". They cite the BBC in reporting that Britain's ability to feed itself has declined from 65% of the market in 1998 to 50% by 2017. That may reflect changing UK tastes and growing appetites, or a higher degree of specialisation and more efficient production across continental Europe. It could reflect a lack of incentives from markets and subsidies for the British farmer and other producers. The industry alliance would like us to adapt our eating choices to rely more on goods that can be produced in the UK. It suggests that could be tied in with government targets for healthier eating, from reduced fat to portion control. The various lobby groups offer up the prospect of animal welfare standards more attuned to British sensibilities and lower food miles travelled to help reach environmental targets. The plan is not for complete self-sufficiency. Turnips might make winter feel a lot longer than it is already. Instead, the target is to take the recent £24bn trade deficit in food and to cut it by £8bn. That would not only be achieved by substituting imported food with the home-grown variety, but by boosting exports. At present, the big exports are Scottish - whisky and salmon. After that, they are chocolate, cheese, pork, gin, beef and breakfast cereals. Even English wine makes the top 10. The industry's strategy borrows heavily from the joined-up approach to the food and drink export effort in Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland. It wants to see a similar approach to Scotland Food and Drink, with a new agency called UK Food and Drink, with £120m of annual UK government funding in its early years. They do so with a plea to retain divergent, devolved approaches across the UK. This is but one answer to the looming battles within government, and outside it, about adopting food standards from trading partners other than the European Union, and notably the US: have neither. But it's not that simple. There are powerful forces driving international trade in food. Other countries will want trade deals that open up more sales to the UK, not less. And it's a big ask of the consumer and retailers to make a shift to buying British, unless price, weakening sterling and tariffs combine for a decisive push in that direction. The industry senses, as others do, that the current Covid-19 crisis, followed by Brexit, together offer an opportunity to plough through change much faster than is usually possible. They want to plant a flag in the grocery aisles, which may be the union flag, the Saltire or Welsh dragon, in the hope that shoppers will rally to it and show patriotic loyalty to home-grown producers."
risk appetite,Good cop bad cop for councils,2024-09-15,2018-03-21,By Nick Servini,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-43489901,"We have had the good cop bad cop combination: enter the middle-ground cop. Okay it doesn't have the same ring to it but that is how the current Local Government Secretary Alun Davies is portraying himself with the latest proposals for re-organisation. He follows in the footsteps of Leighton Andrews who tried to force through changes without success, and Mark Drakeford who tried to woo the councils with regional working, which was also rejected by town halls (more on this later). So Alun Davies continues the tradition of local government secretaries by trying to change the face of the Welsh public sector. The opening gambit is that this is the start of the conversation, even though he has been spending lots of face-time with council leaders across Wales in recent months.  Mr Davies was at pains to stress he is not hung up on the numbers, or indeed any element of the process itself. Hence a range of options are being floated that include voluntary mergers happening relatively quickly, a longer and phased process and an all-in-one change that could bring the number down to as few as ten. One of the time-frames for change is 2026. In the context of some of the deadlines facing the Brexit process at the moment, this feels like long grass territory. Many of the combinations will be familiar from a few years ago. They will also be familiar to many from more than twenty years ago by recreating the old counties like Dyfed and West Glamorgan. Crucially, Alun Davies says he will not force through changes that go against the overwhelming view of local authorities across Wales. On that basis, the statement from the Welsh Local Government Association, which does not give an inch, would appear to leave the plans dead in the water before they have got out of the blocks. The question is whether he has a back up plan if council leaders dig their heels in hard and early.  We should get more of an idea on Friday when he addresses leaders for the first time since announcing the plans. I am told a number of voluntary mergers may be on the cards if enough extra money is laid on the table by the Welsh Government but there is no appetite to bring the numbers down to anything like 10. If the Alun Davies plan does not get any kind of traction then it will make the third attempt at change look ill-advised at best, and naïve at worst. But there are dangers for local government as well in all of this. In rejecting this after also turning down the previous options, they risk the accusation that they are not interested in reform. This is where the pressure point will come from Cardiff Bay.  There is a clear sense from the Welsh Government that it is unacceptable for councils to simply reject what is on offer and not provide any alternative solutions to the financial problems they face. At a point in time when their finances are under severe pressure, ministers will argue they are at least trying to address the problem. And this is where déjà vu kicks in, councils will respond by saying re-organisation costs money which they can ill-afford to divert from services. There is one central claim that is puzzling. Alun Davies repeats the mantra that literally no-one believes the current structure is one that works.  Well if that is the case, why is it that change has proven to be so difficult? On a strictly theoretical basis, he is right. If everyone had a blank sheet of paper they would not come up with the current structure. But that is not the same as then interpreting that as an admission that things need to change right now. A final point: one senior figure in local government told me the rejection of the Mark Drakeford regional working model is not strictly true. The feeling is a huge amount of work has gone into this approach and this is the direction they want to pursue, rather than dusting off the old merger plans. This will be one of the messages put to Alun Davies when he walks into the lion's den on Friday to address the council leaders at Cardiff City Hall."
risk appetite,Saudi Aramco flotation values oil giant at $1.7tn,2024-09-15,2019-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50450527,"Saudi Arabia has placed a preliminary valuation on state oil company Aramco of between $1.6tn (£1.22tn) and $1.7tn. The company has published an updated prospectus for its initial public offering (IPO), seeking more than $25bn for the sale of 1.5% of its shares.  That would make it potentially the world's biggest IPO, coming from the world's most profitable company  It is short of the $2tn valuation that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was reportedly keen to achieve. ""The base offer size will be 1.5% of the company's outstanding shares,"" the state-owned energy giant said in a statement that set the price range at 30-32 Saudi riyals per share ($8-$8.5). That could value the IPO at as much as 96bn riyals ($25.60bn) at the top end of the range. If priced at the top end, the deal could just beat the record-breaking $25bn raised by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Individual retail investors, as well as big institutions, will have a chance to buy shares. Aramco had initially been expected to sell some 5% of its shares on two exchanges, with a first listing of 2% on the kingdom's Tadawul bourse, and then another 3% on an overseas exchange. The firm says there are now no current plans for an international sale, with that long-discussed goal now seemingly being put on ice. Aramco called off a number of so-called roadshows for the shares, aimed at enticing foreign buyers, the Financial Times reported.  European meetings were cancelled on Monday after similar pitches in Asia and the US were dropped at the weekend, the newspaper said. The crown prince is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries. Analysts S&P Global Ratings said the stock market debut could enable Saudi Arabia to strengthen its financial position.  ""If subsequently effectively deployed, the funds raised could be used to support longer-term economic growth in Saudi Arabia,"" it said. In its prospectus released last week, the company lists a variety of investment risks ranging from terrorist attacks to geopolitical tensions in a region dominated by Saudi-Iran rivalry. The 600-page prospectus also includes the government's control over oil output as another potential risk. After the flotation, Aramco will not list any more shares for six months, the prospectus says. Although one of the attractions for investors is the potential of high dividends, the document said Aramco has the right to change dividend policy without prior notice. Aramco has hired a host of international banking giants including Citibank, Credit Suisse and HSBC as financial advisers to assess interest in the share sale and set a price. Based on the level of interest. The sale of the company, first mooted four years ago, has been overshadowed by delays and criticism of corporate transparency at Saudi Arabia's crown jewel.  Aramco last year posted $111bn in net profit. In the first nine months of this year, its net profit dropped 18% to $68bn. A third of Aramco's shares - about $8bn worth - will be sold to the man and (the prospectus says) even the divorced woman on the street, giving local Saudi Arabians a stake in their nation's cash cow for the first time.  A TV and billboard advertising campaign, as well as social media, is stoking enthusiasm on the ground and demand is expected to be high.  For the remaining $16bn, the oil giant is turning to institutional investors. And a source close to the company says there has been sufficient interest that they're confident they can cover most of this off within the Gulf.  But there will be disappointment amongst officials if global demand is not there for the jewel in Saudi Arabia's crown.  A fossil fuels company owned by an absolute monarchy in a volatile region are not an easy sell for many Western firms, pursuing the latest trend in investment policy of ""ESG"" (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria. Norway's sovereign wealth fund is among those to already rule themselves out from investing.  But the promise of sharing the promised annual $75bn cash dividend pot might be too good for some to miss, according to James Bevan, Chief Investment Officer at CCLA Investment Management (one of the UK's largest charity fund managers).  Given his firm's focus, he is not looking to invest in the shares but explains why some are. ""It's a 'risk' in the eyes of some investors to be very underweight in oil and gas, and Aramco may be a means of plugging a sector gap with perhaps less worry than associated with holding Gazprom,"" he says. Investors follow indexes - such as the FTSE 100 - which are made up of array of types of industries and so some feel oil and gas needs to be correspondingly represented in their portfolio. As Aramco's big sales pitch road show kicks off, the real test of investor appetite for the company will begin. "
risk appetite,Why I injected myself with an untested gene therapy,2024-09-15,2017-11-21,By Jessica Lussenhop,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41990981,"The moment Tristan Roberts became the first human to inject an untested, experimental gene therapy into his stomach fat, he was sitting on a leather couch in his friend-slash-yoga instructor's living room, not on a doctor's examining table. The glass coffee table in front of him was strewn with syringes. A Chihuahua mix wearing an inflatable recovery collar snored beside him. The event was livestreamed on Facebook, and hundreds tuned in (later, Roberts' mother watched, though she was ""not thrilled"" with his decision). On Roberts' right was Aaron Traywick, head of Ascendance Biomedical, the nascent company behind the treatment. A network of unnamed researchers around the US assembled the vials in front of them.  ""We do not advise that anyone watching this video do what is about to be done here,"" said Traywick, who is not a scientist and identifies primarily as a ""community organiser"".  ""Tristan Roberts is completely within his rights according to the FDA and the rule of law in this nation… to self-experiment on himself in any way that he deems medically appropriate. It is his body and it is his right."" Roberts - a wiry 28-year-old computer programmer with a mop of dirty blonde hair - also has no formal training in medicine or genetic engineering. That's partly the point. He and Traywick are members of a growing community of biohackers, the do-it-yourself movement in biology, medical science and genetics that has sprung up outside the confines of universities and pharmaceutical firms.  There are now biohacking conferences and community biohacking spaces in Silicon Valley, Boston, New York City and Austin, where high school students, biomedical start-up owners and professional scientists gather to educate and experiment together. Their simplest experiments include making glow-in-the-dark beer; the most lofty aim to cure disease, clean up oil spills, and defeat the aging process. What Roberts was about to do has been characterised by scientists and bioethicists as everything from ""fringe"" to  ""risky"" to ""frightening"". The harshest assessment came from Scott Burris, an expert on HIV public health policy at Temple University. ""This is delusional behaviour,"" he said. ""It's not plausible to me that this guy is even on planet Earth."" But Roberts believed these voices were too cautious, too hemmed in by convention. ""We may be risk takers but we're not stupid,"" he said. ""I think we're heading towards a part of time where patients and test subjects are able to have a greater stake in the outcome of the experiment."" Roberts is not the first person to inject himself with an unregulated gene therapy. At least three individuals have publicly attempted to augment themselves with genes that will inhibit cell death or boost muscle growth, and self-experimentation is also happening in private. But Roberts is the first person to do so publicly in search of a cure.  Six years ago he was diagnosed as HIV positive. Two years ago, he stopped taking conventional antiretroviral drugs.  His reasons were manifold - he hated the side effects, feared that missing a single dose could build up the virus' immunity. But he also rejects the idea of being on medication for the rest of his life. Roberts wants to be cured. ""I'm excited about the possibility of potentially curing this, maybe for a few months, maybe for a few years - maybe indefinitely,"" he said. ""But there's only one way to find out."" Roberts filled one of the syringes from the vial, lifted his T-shirt, and expelled a breath sharply. ""I want to dedicate this to all the people who have died while not being able to access treatment,"" he said. Then he pinched a thin fold of skin on the right side of his bellybutton and inserted the needle.  The tiny amount of liquid Roberts injected into the fat cells under his skin contained trillions of plasmids, hoop-shaped pieces of DNA containing a section that should trigger production of the antibody N6. A US National Institutes of Health (NIH) study showed N6 neutralised 98% of the HIV virus in lab conditions. The antibody came from a single person, one of the tiny number of HIV patients known to scientists whose bodies somehow manage the virus on their own. Roberts' hope, and the hope of the treatment's creators at Ascendance, was that the plasmids would successfully cross into the nuclei of Roberts' cells and coax them into producing N6 antibodies. The goal is a ""moonshot"" - a cure for HIV, and one the biohackers believe they can bring to market faster and more cheaply than institutions hampered by regulations and corporate concerns over profitability. ""DNA is a language and I believe people that already live in this generation will learn to be poets of that language,"" Machiavelli Davis, a friend of Roberts who helped develop the treatment, said on the Facebook Live.  Many scientists and bioethicists argue that experiments like this one are too amateur to produce any meaningful results, that the dangers of self-experimentation outweigh the speculative benefits, or that patients who try self-experimentation may have no idea what they're signing up for.  ""I strongly fear that, without a robust structure for conducting risk-assessment and handling risk and liability issues, the Ascendance Biomedical model will only transfer all these heavy, complex responsibilities to individuals at their own cost and peril,"" wrote Eleonore Pauwels, a science policy expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and an expert in genomics.  But now that anyone can obtain a custom gene sequence with the ease and convenience of online shopping, people like Roberts can play in a genetic arena that was once walled off.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can crack down on unlicensed human testing, and the sale of gene-editing products or kits intended for self-experimentation is against the law. But whether or not the act of self-administering an untested drug is illegal is a grey area amateur scientists and biohackers are eagerly taking advantage of. ""We've been living in a medical system that is very paternalistic, where you don't learn what happens in your body. What you see happening now, it's the rise of the new bio-citizen,"" said Pauwels. ""How do you democratise [medicine] without taking an enormous amount of risk? It's a big question."" Three weeks later, Roberts walked into the chilly offices of a blood testing facility in downtown Washington DC for his second blood test since self-administering the treatment. In a few days, he'd be able to see if the treatment was having any effect on the virus. A tall lab technician in a papery smock sat Roberts in a padded chair and deftly collected three vials of Roberts' blood in under a minute. ""I'm excited to see the results, but at the same time it's tempered by a bit of non-attachment. It's rare that you get things right on the first shot,"" said Roberts. ""I'm in this for the long haul."" Roberts' friends and family were nervous about his desire to become ""patient zero"", but knew better than to try to talk him out of it. A few years ago, he left a $75,000-a-year computer programming job after he said the money and the comfortable apartment weren't making him happy.  He has no permanent address, floating between his boyfriend, his family and friends' homes. For his freelance programming work, he insists on being paid only in cryptocurrency, though that presents its own logistical challenges. He nearly couldn't pay for the bloodwork because he was having problems quickly converting his Bitcoins into dollars. Last year, during a protest through downtown DC, police officers arrested Roberts after they said he spray painted the word ""CORRUPT"" on FBI headquarters.  ""Occupy the city!"" he yelled just before the officers pushed his head into the car. (He did community service in exchange for a clean record.) Despite his appetite for risk, Roberts was feeling uneasy in the three weeks since injecting the plasmid treatment. First, the skin on his back broke out in large red bumps. He figured he was bitten by mosquitoes, but couldn't be sure. Then he was felled for four days by a strange, feverish feeling, a loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal issues.  ""I'm fricking terrified it might be the plasmid,"" he said. ""I'm 98% certain this is fine. But there's still this 2% that's like - this could be something terrible."" The nightmare scenario would be that the plasmid was replicating out of control. If he went to the emergency room, could the doctors there be expected to help when they had no understanding of the substance he'd injected?  Then again, he thought, was this a sign that the treatment was actually working? After a few days, the symptoms subsided, leaving Roberts to wonder what was happening inside him. By the time he took the blood test, the Facebook Live video of the injection had been viewed more than 20,000 times. Mark Connors, the lead NIH scientist who discovered the N6 antibody, was among the viewers.  Connors was unimpressed with the scientific reasoning behind the treatment.  ""These seem like very smart young men and they have command of some of the facts, but not all the facts,"" he said. While N6 is more versatile than any other HIV antibody previously discovered, Connors said it can't wipe out the virus all on its own, and there is a debate raging in the field about whether or not antibodies alone will ever be able to cure the virus. HIV's protein envelope continuously mutates, shifting into forms that prevent our antibodies from binding to and neutralising it. As potent as N6 is, HIV can still develop a resistance to it, making it a poor candidate as a ""monotherapy"" or stand-alone treatment, said Connors. ""For the most part, the rules aren't what take so long [in drug development],"" he added. ""It's not the FDA sitting on drugs. The reality is this is a deliberative process."" Another thing that concerned scientists about Ascendance was the lack of detailed information on the company's website - there's no phone number, nor a list of employees or advisors. Traywick said this is in part due to proprietary reasons and in part because the company is still so young. But he also said he needs to obscure the identities of the working scientists who are biohacking for Ascendance on the side, to avoid opening them up to legal or reputational risk.  Traywick put the BBC in touch with the researcher who assembled Roberts' treatment by phone, though he refused to give his name or location in the US. He codenamed him ""M McConaughey"" - a reference to actor Matthew McConaughey's portrayal of the 1980s amateur HIV researcher in the film The Dallas Buyers Club. In a call, ""McConaughey"" actually disagreed with Traywick and Roberts' decision to livestream the first injection, and with throwing the word ""cure"" around. He agreed with Connors that this first dose is unlikely to have an impact, and worried that the livestream set up unrealistic expectations. ""Even when you're doing everything you can to make things quick, you can't be nature,"" he said. ""Biology is very slow and difficult."" Among the tiny handful of biohackers and researchers who have publicly self-experimented with gene therapy, there is disagreement over whose science is sound. Josiah Zayner, chief executive of a company that sells do-it-yourself gene-engineering kits, has injected himself with gene therapies in front of live audiences, but he refused to comment on Ascendance or Roberts, writing that they have ""very little idea what they are doing"".  Brian Hanley, a microbiologist who gave himself a gene therapy designed to increase his stamina and life span, hates being called a biohacker. While he sees little problem with scientists experimenting on themselves, he fears that biohackers who promote self-experimentation will encourage total amateurs to take risks they don't understand. ""[They] could give themselves a significant issue, potentially including dying from it,"" said Hanley. ""The biggest danger is you could infect yourself with something."" George Church, a pioneer in genome sequencing who has become a de facto sounding board for people interested in self-experimentation, said that while he always recommends caution, clinical trials and the involvement of physicians, sometimes startling results can come from a single patient. He pointed to the example of Barry Marshall, a physician who in the mid-1980s proved that ulcers are caused by bacteria - by drinking an infectious broth. ""It was dramatic enough that it led to his Nobel prize,"" said Church. ""Anything is possible."" On yet another friend's couch in a tidy townhouse in Arlington, Virginia, Roberts prepared to go on Facebook Live again to share the results of his blood tests. He had purposefully not looked at the data yet. The room was full of people. A film crew for a forthcoming documentary series on biotech prepared to capture his reaction. Aaron Traywick watched from the kitchen, and three of Roberts' friends whispered in the background. ""My greatest fear of turning out to be Geraldo Rivera is popping up,"" Roberts said. ""He goes to reveal what's inside Al Capone's vault and it's just some trash, some empty beer bottles."" Without the means to test for the presence of N6 in Roberts' blood, they were relying on his viral load count. The day before injecting the treatment, his blood contained 11,912 copies of the virus per millilitre. He hoped to see that the viral load dropped to 2,000 copies or less. If it was in the 2,000 to 8,000 range, conclusions would be hard to draw. A flat or increased viral load could indicate the treatment had failed.  Although Roberts enthused about a patient-controlled future when the democratisation of medicine has toppled big pharma, this was obviously also personal. He admitted to fantasising about telling his parents over Thanksgiving dinner that the treatment had worked.  He also recalled getting a paper cut soon after he first found out he was HIV positive. Looking down at his hand, he saw his own blood as a poison. ""That's what I'm looking forward most to helping heal,"" he said. ""It's not necessarily the infection itself, but the possibility of harming others."" After greeting the audience on Facebook Live (which again included his mother), Roberts told them: ""I think it's time."" He opened the documents sent from the lab and frowned slightly as he read. Then he laughed. ""Alright, so - yeah, this was not what we were hoping for."" According to the test results, Roberts' viral load rose from 28,800 on week two to 36,401 on week three - still low levels, but not the desired results. His count of CD4 helper T-cells - the immune system cell that HIV attacks - was higher than he'd ever seen it, but there was no way to know what that meant. ""More data is necessary,"" Traywick chimed in from off-camera. Then he sat down next to Roberts, joking: ""We didn't kill you."" After they switched off the broadcast, Traywick slumped backwards in his seat. One of Roberts' friends quietly slipped the magnum of sparkling wine that had been sitting on the kitchen counter into the refrigerator. They opened a bottle of red instead. Traywick said that this is part of his vision for the company - one that shares its failures publicly just as readily as its successes.  ""I am a little bit let down,"" said Roberts, sipping from his glass. ""It's hard.""   Despite the initial failure, Roberts said he believes that the gene therapies that he and others are testing will hold the key to obliterating HIV, as well as other diseases that have stumped the medical field. ""It's opened up so many possibilities, it's redefining what it means to be human."" In December, Ascendance's researchers will release a second version that contains 10 to 100 times the number of plasmids; Roberts plans to inject that as well. He has no plans to return to medication and said he fully expects to be cured someday. Connors, the NIH researcher, tuned in to Facebook to watch Roberts get his results. He disagreed with the biohackers' belief that traditional research methods move too slowly - human trials of N6 injections are set to being in early 2018 - and he said that he wished Roberts would go back on anti-virals.  ""It kind of breaks my heart,"" he said. But, he added, Roberts actually has something in common with the patients whose bodies naturally create antibodies like N6 and others currently being studied as a means to combat the virus.  ""The people who make up the cohort are people who refuse treatment,"" he said. ""They have a similar independent streak."""
risk appetite,Russia and West talk all week but war risk remains,2024-09-15,2022-01-14,By Paul Adams,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59985589,"Is Europe a safer place after a week of diplomacy that has criss-crossed the continent? The short answer is probably no. From marathon talks in Geneva between the US and Russia, to the first meeting of the Nato-Russia Council in more than two years, to a session of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe in Vienna, grievances have been aired, red lines drawn, accusations levelled. Wendy Sherman, Washington's veteran negotiator, spoke of ""a better understanding of each other and each other's priorities and concerns"", after almost eight hours of talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Monday. For his part, Mr Ryabkov said the Americans had ""considered our concerns seriously"". When the focus shifted to Nato, the Alliance's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke of ""a general willingness and support of the idea of dialogue"" from his Russian interlocutors. At a time when 100,000 Russian troops maintain their menacing presence on Ukraine's northern and eastern borders - the comings and goings of specific units and pieces of equipment minutely analysed for clues as to the Kremlin's true intentions - the fact that so much time has been spent talking this week is positive. It seems too early to talk about a process. Mr Stoltenberg said the Russians were not yet ready to agree to a schedule of further meetings. Mr Ryabkov appeared to pour cold water on the idea of more dialogue. ""I do not see reasons to sit down in the coming days,"" he told Russian TV, ""to gather again and start the same discussions."" The reality is that no-one has really agreed what these talks are about. For the West, it's all about preventing a Russian military incursion into Ukraine. For Russia, it seems to be about stopping Nato in its tracks: preventing Ukraine from ever joining and, beyond that, rolling back the Alliance's presence and activities on the territory of the old Soviet empire. When Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, spoke to journalists after Wednesday's meeting at Nato, he launched into a protracted litany of grievances about the Western alliance's behaviour since the end of the Cold War. He sought to portray Nato as an aggressive presence in Europe, with Russia as the continent's only real peacekeeper. If Nato tries to contain Russia, he warned, ""there will be a policy of counter-containment"". ""If there is deterrence, there will be counter-deterrence."" In the Kremlin's world view Russia is threatened, not threatening; Russia's troops are minding their own business on Ukraine's border, while Nato's modest presence in countries bordering Russia is unacceptable. It's head-spinning stuff at times, but stems from a lingering, deep-seated resentment at the collapse of Russia's sphere of influence at the end of the Cold War, and what Moscow sees as the speed with which Nato took advantage. The West's response so far, apart from the threat of ""massive"" consequences should Russia invade Ukraine, is to offer reciprocal ""risk-reduction"" measures, including the placement of missiles in Europe and greater transparency on the size and scope of military exercises. But most of this is about repairing the fraying edges of Europe's existing security architecture, rather than inventing a radically new one - something for which there is no appetite within Nato.  And so, for the time being, the two sides are talking across each other, with no guarantee that even this dialogue of the deaf will continue. Ms Sherman noted that the Russian side had not ruled out holding more talks, but warned that if Russia walked away, it would be ""quite apparent that they were never serious about pursuing diplomacy at all"". At the end of this big week of diplomacy, Polish Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairman Zbigniew Rau warned that the risk of war was greater now than at any time in the last 30 years. It's hard to disagree. "
risk appetite,Tiger at US zoo tests positive for coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-04-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52177586,"A four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus. The tiger, named Nadia, is believed to be the first known case of an animal infected with Covid-19 in the US. The Bronx Zoo, in New York City, says the test result was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa. Nadia, along with six other big cats, is thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zoo keeper. The cats started showing symptoms, including a dry cough, late last month after exposure to the employee, who has not been identified.  ""This is the first time that any of us know of anywhere in the world that a person infected the animal and the animal got sick,"" Paul Calle, the chief veterinarian at the zoo, told Reuters news agency on Sunday.  There have been isolated instances of pets testing positive for the coronavirus elsewhere in the world, but experts have stressed there is no evidence they can become sick or spread the disease.  Mr Calle said he intends to share the findings with other zoos and institutions researching the transmission of Covid-19. ""We tested the cat [Nadia] out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about Covid-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" the zoo said in a statement. Nadia, her sister Azul, as well as two Amur tigers and three African lions who showed symptoms, are all expected to make a full recovery, the zoo said. The big cats did have some decrease in appetite but ""are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers"", it said. The zoo said it is not known how the virus will develop in animals like tigers and lions since various species can react differently to new infections, but all the animals will be closely monitored.  None of the zoo's other big cats are showing any signs of illness.  All the tigers showing symptoms were housed in the zoo's Tiger Mountain area. It is unclear if the others will be tested. All four zoos run by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City, including the Bronx Zoo, have been closed to the public since 16 March.  New measures will now be put in place to protect the animals and their caretakers at all the facilities.  This coronavirus was first detected in humans in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.  The coronavirus (called Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19) is thought to have originated in wildlife and been passed to humans via a live animal market in Wuhan. The pandemic has been driven by human-to-human transmission, but the infection of Nadia raises new questions about human-to-animal transmission. There have been less than a handful of isolated reports of companion animals testing positive for coronavirus, including two dogs in Hong Kong.  There is ""no evidence that any person has been infected with Covid-19 in the US by animals, including by pet dogs or cats,"" the zoo's statement noted. That is also the view of the World Organisation for Animal Health and  the World Health Organization (WHO), which says there is no evidence that pet dogs or cats can pass on the coronavirus. The World Organisation for Animal Health says studies are under way to understand the issue more.  and urges anyone who has become sick to limit contact with pets. Dr Sarah Caddy, Veterinarian and Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, is among experts to respond to the reports. ""It is surprising that the tiger has become infected with what must have been a fairly low dose of virus - we can assume the tiger did not have continual close contact with the asymptomatic zoo keeper,"" she said about the transmission.  ""It is also interesting that the tiger showed clinical signs consistent with Covid-19 in humans. Although scientific proof is lacking, the chance this is just a coincidence is low."" Conservation experts have warned that the virus could pose a threat to some wildlife like the great apes - and have said measures are needed to reduce the risk of wild gorillas, chimps and orangutans."
risk appetite,Should we be worried by ever more CCTV cameras?,2024-09-15,2019-11-18,By Ivana Davidovic,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50348861,"It is all quiet on a mid-morning weekday at the CCTV monitoring centre of Southwark Council, in London, when I pay a visit.  Dozens of monitors display largely mundane activities - people cycling in a park, waiting for buses, coming in and out of shops.  The manager here is Sarah Pope, and there is no doubt that she is fiercely proud of her job. What gives her a real sense of satisfaction is ""getting the first glimpse of a suspect… which can then guide the police investigation in the right direction,"" she says. Southwark shows how CCTV cameras - that fully adhere to the UK code of conduct - are used to help catch criminals and keep people safe. However, such surveillance systems do have their critics around the world - people who complain about a loss of privacy and an infringement of civil liberties.  Manufacturing of CCTV cameras and facial recognition technologies is a booming industry, feeding a seemingly insatiable appetite. In the UK alone, there is one CCTV camera for every 11 people. All countries with a population of at least 250,000 are using some form of AI surveillance systems to monitor their citizens, says Steven Feldstein from the US think tank Carnegie. And it is China that dominates this market - accounting for 45% of the sector's global revenue.  Chinese firms like Hikvision, Megvii or Dahua might not be household names, but their products may well be installed on a street near you.  ""Some autocratic governments - for example, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia - are exploiting AI technology for mass surveillance purposes,"" Mr Feldstein writes in a paper for Carnegie. ""Other governments with dismal human rights records are exploiting AI surveillance in more limited ways to reinforce repression. Yet all political contexts run the risk of unlawfully exploiting AI surveillance technology to obtain certain political objectives,""  One place that offers an interesting insight into how China has rapidly become a surveillance superpower is Ecuador. The South American country bought an entire national video surveillance system from China, including 4,300 cameras.  ""Of course, a country like Ecuador wouldn't necessarily have the money to pay for a system like this,"" says journalist Melissa Chan, who reported from Ecuador, and specialises in China's international influence. She used to report from China, but was kicked out of the country several years ago without an explanation.  ""The Chinese came with a Chinese bank ready to give them a loan. That really helps pave the way. My understanding is that Ecuador had promised oil against those loans if they couldn't pay them back."" She says a military attaché in the Chinese embassy in Quito was involved.  One way of looking at the issue is not simply to focus on the surveillance technology, but ""the export of authoritarianism"", she says, adding that ""some would argue that the Chinese are far less discriminating in terms of which governments they're willing to work with"". For the US, it is not the exports so much that are a concern, but how this technology is used on Chinese soil. In October, the US blacklisted a group of Chinese AI firms on the grounds of alleged human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang region in the north-west of the country.  China's largest CCTV manufacturer Hikvision was one of 28 firms added to the US commerce department's Entity List, restricting its ability to do business with US companies. So, how will this affect the firm's business?  Hikvision says that earlier this year it retained human rights expert and former US ambassador Pierre-Richard Prosper to advise it on human rights compliance. The firms adds that ""punishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the US government, hurt Hikvision's US businesses partners, and negatively impact the US economy"". Olivia Zhang, the US correspondent for Chinese business and finance media firm Caixin, believes there could be some short-term problems for some on the list, because the main microchip they used was from US IT firm Nvidia, ""which would be hard to replace"". She says that ""so far, no-one from the Congress or the US executive branch has offered any hard evidence"" for the blacklisting. She adds that Chinese manufacturers believe the human rights justification is just an excuse, ""the real intention is just to crack down on China's leading tech firms"".  While the surveillance producers in China bat away criticisms of their involvement in the persecution of minorities at home, their revenues rose 13% last year.  The growth this represents in the use of technologies like facial recognition poses a big challenge, even for developed democracies. Making sure it is used lawfully in the UK is the job of Tony Porter, the surveillance camera commissioner for England and Wales.  On a practical level he has many concerns about its use, in particular because his main goal is to generate widespread public support for it.  ""This technology operates against a watch list,"" he says, ""so if the face recognition identifies somebody from a watch list, then a match is made, there's an intervention."" He questions who goes on the watch list, and who controls it. ""If it is the private sector operating the technology, who owns that - is it the police or the private sector? There are too many blurred lines."" Melissa Chan argues that there is some justification for these concerns, especially with regard to Chinese-made systems. In China, she says that legally ""the government and officials have a final say. If they really want to access information, that information has to be handed over by private companies."" It is clear that China has really made this industry one of its strategic priorities, and has put its state might behind its development and promotion.  At Carnegie, Steven Feldstein believes there are a couple of reasons why AI and surveillance is so important to Beijing. Some are connected to ""deep rooted insecurity"" over the longevity and sustainability of the Chinese Communist Party. ""One way to try to ensure continued political survival is to look to technology to enact repressive policies, and suppress the population from expressing things that would challenge the Chinese state,"" he says. Yet in a wider context, Beijing and many other countries believe AI will be the key to military superiority, he says. For China, ""investing in AI is a way to ensure and maintain its dominance and power in the future"" ."
risk appetite,Teachers 'face weekly violence from pupils',2024-09-15,2019-04-19,By Katherine Sellgren,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-47964155,"Many teachers are experiencing violence and abuse from pupils, a survey of teachers suggests. Nearly a quarter (24%) of teachers say they face violence once a week, the poll of nearly 5,000 members of the NASUWT teachers' union finds. Four in 10 (42%) have been threatened verbally. ""Verbal abuse is now part of the daily working landscape for a primary teacher,"" one teacher said.  The Department for Education said such violence was ""completely unacceptable"". ""Having taught for almost 40 years I have witnessed a demonstrable and seemingly unstoppable deterioration in pupil behaviour,"" one teacher told NASUWT researchers.  ""Moreover, teachers are, it seems, now expected to tolerate verbal abuse and threats as 'par for the course' and, quite literally, 'an occupational hazard'. There appears to be no appetite for tackling the issues that face teachers in the classroom.""  Another teacher said: ""Even though I work in a PRU [pupil referral unit] where children exhibit these sort of behaviours I am aware that we are seeing an increasing number of younger children who seem to be physically and verbally abusive to staff."" One said: ""I'm a former rugby player and have been more protected against physical violence and verbal intimidation on the pitch than I feel at work."" And another added: ""My school has become a frightening place over the last few years and I often try to only go on the corridors at times when I expect them to be quiet, as I simply assume I will be stampeded, pushed or sworn at."" Official figures from the Department for Education showed that in the academic year 2016/17, 655 pupils in England were excluded for a verbal assault against an adult, while 59,675 were given a fixed-term exclusion. The statistics show 745 were permanently excluded for a physical assault against an adult and 26,695 were excluded for a fixed period. These figures were higher than the previous year 2015/16. The NASUWT, which represents teachers across the UK, discussed the issue of discipline at its annual conference in Belfast on Saturday. Delegates passed a motion saying the union would ""defend members through all legitimate means, up to and including industrial action"". The union's general secretary, Chris Keates, said: ""No teacher should ever have to go to work with the expectation of being verbally or physically abused, but it is clear from this survey that for too many teachers this is the day-to-day reality. ""It is simply unacceptable that employers are failing in their legal duty of care to provide a safe working environment. ""Why is it that hospitals, job centres, railway stations and many other workplaces are now littered with posters in which employers make clear that abuse of staff will not be tolerated and yet the most teachers get is fault finding and blame. ""The school system is riven with poor and unacceptable employment practices that are putting teachers at risk and ultimately driving them out of the profession."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""Teachers and school staff have a right to be safe while doing their jobs and any form of misconduct, particularly violence towards them, is completely unacceptable. ""The majority of schools provide a safe environment for pupils and teaching staff, and it's important that they remain as such. ""We are committed to tackling bad behaviour in schools, have made great strides in empowering teachers to tackle this issue and have recently announced a £10m investment to support schools to share best practice in behaviour management."" DfE guidelines say teachers in England have the ""statutory authority"" to discipline pupils whose behaviour is unacceptable or who break the school rules. This power also applies to all paid staff (unless the head teacher says otherwise) with responsibility for pupils, such as teaching assistants. The guidance states that: "
risk appetite,"Public need 'home truths' on economy, says Hammond",2024-09-15,2021-02-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56182669,"Former Chancellor Lord Hammond has said the government must risk unpopularity and tell ""some difficult home truths"" about the state of the economy.   He told the BBC that dealing with the pandemic had been the financial equivalent of ""fighting a war"". But giving money away was easier than collecting it for ""a populist government"", he added. A No 10 spokeswoman said she ""doesn't recognise"" his characterisation of a government reluctant to be unpopular. She added that the pandemic had shown Boris Johnson was ""a prime minister that is prepared to take difficult decisions and is weighing up very hard choices at the moment"". The Budget on Wednesday comes amid rising unemployment and follows the biggest UK annual economic shrinkage on record. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Hammond - who resigned as chancellor when Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019 - said the economy had taken a ""huge hit"" from Covid-19, but should ""bounce back"". There had been ""long-term scarring"", with sectors like aviation and hospitality suffering ""permanent damage"", and transport and retail ""changed forever"", he added. Official figures show the UK economy contracted by 9.9% in 2020 - more than twice as much as in any previous year on record. On Tuesday, it was revealed unemployment had risen to 5.1% in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. And the national debt - worsened by furlough, other pandemic help schemes and falling tax takes - stands at more than £2 trillion. Lord Hammond said it was unlikely in the ""foreseeable future"" that ministers would be able to ""do anything that will actually see the debt starting to fall"". ""But what matters is not the absolute size of the debt, but the size of the debt relative to our economy,"" he said. ""If we can grow the British economy over the coming years, then just as we did after the Second World War, we can make the debt fade in significance, because, although it stays the same in absolute terms, it becomes a much smaller percentage of our national economy."" Philip Hammond has never been Boris Johnson's number one fan, to put it mildly. They clashed on Brexit, with the former chancellor being booted out of Parliamentary Conservative Party during the wild political autumn of 2019. But even though he is back in the party fold, and with the ermine of a Tory member of the House of Lords no less, the former occupant of No 11 isn't mincing his words. While he sticks to the broad consensus backing the government's massive emergency economic support during the pandemic, Lord Hammond looks very pointedly to the challenges that will come next, questioning whether Downing Street will have the right priorities. His not very subtle implication: Downing Street would rather be popular than do the right thing. Read more from Laura here. Lord Hammond said the challenge facing the government was ""how to move out of this crisis period"".  He praised Mr Sunak for getting the economic response right so far and said he was ""very confident"" his instincts were ""the right ones"".  But he said his fear was ""that as a populist government, giving money away is always easier than collecting it in"", and warned that ministers had ""made very extravagant commitments to the British electorate in good faith before the coronavirus crisis"". ""Not all of those commitments can now sensibly be delivered on and that's going to be a big challenge for a government that regards its short-term popularity as very, very important,"" Lord Hammond added. He said he was ""not sure"" the current ""top leadership"" had the ""appetite for being unpopular, in order to do the right thing"". The prime minister has said the chancellor will set out the government's plans to ""build back better"" in next Wednesday's Budget.  Mr Sunak has promised to lay out the ""support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery"", adding: ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy."" A Treasury spokesman added: ""The chancellor has always put protecting jobs and livelihoods at the heart of everything he has done and that will not change. ""This Budget will give people the reassurance they need in the immediate term, and he will be honest with the British people about how we are going to recover beyond this crisis."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""not the time"" for tax increases for individuals or businesses, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. James Green, who runs the Whitstable Oyster Company in Kent, says the impact of the pandemic has been ""tough"". ""Obviously there's Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, which affected us, the restaurant side of the business and the oyster sales. We were open over the summer. We were busy, like most coastal places, and then we shut again in November."" But Mr Green adds: ""For the oyster side of the business the impact of Brexit is probably had more of an effect than Covid-19, I would say."" As a result of Britain leaving the single market, he says he has tons of oysters sitting on his farm that he cannot sell either to France or domestically.  Mr Green says the chancellor should give the shellfish industry ""some help to get us through now - otherwise there won't be one"". "
risk appetite,Hepatitis C home test kits available in England,2024-09-15,2023-05-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65571131,"Home test kits for a virus which attacks the liver are now available to order online in England, as the NHS tries to reach those needing treatment. Hepatitis C tends to affect current or past drug users and people who have had contact with infected blood through a tattoo or medical procedure abroad. It can lead to liver disease and cancer, but symptoms often go unnoticed for many years. The NHS website says it can usually be cured by taking a course of tablets. More than 70,000 people are thought to be living with the virus in England. Some may not know they have it, so would be unlikely to go to their GP for a test. Shabana Begum, 55, from Yorkshire, found out she had hepatitis C in 2004 after feeling constantly unwell. ""Every hair on my body hurt, I had insomnia, flu-like symptoms and I was seeing my GP every three or four days,"" she said. Shabana would cry for hours on end because her whole body was in pain. She was told she had been living with the virus for 15 to 20 years, and was able to link it to injections she had received when she moved to Pakistan as a teenager. She remembers the corroded metal syringes that were used at the time, and now spends her time warning others to be cautious when travelling to South Asia, where hepatitis C is regularly found. ""It can be transmitted at the barber's, when getting piercings, a tattoo or other procedures using syringes,"" she says. She also goes into communities to promote free, confidential testing. ""For people who feel they don't have time to see their GP or go to community events, they can log in online and just order a test.""  The home tests involve a tiny amount of blood from a finger prick being dropped into a test tube, which must then be posted to a lab for analysis. Those who receive a positive test result will then be contacted and referred for treatment, NHS England says. Rachel Halford, from charity The Hepatitis C Trust, said it had never been easier to find out if you have hepatitis C. She said people could be exposed to the virus in a number of ways ""including having a blood transfusion before the early 1990s, having medical treatment or a tattoo abroad, or via injecting drugs use"".  The disease is endemic in some countries in South Asia including Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, making the risks of being infected higher. She told BBC Breakfast: ""I think one of the problems about Hepatitis C is you can have it for a long time without knowing that you've got it, because the symptoms are very similar to other things.  ""So this is a really easy and safe and confidential way to get a test."" Most people do not seem to experience any noticeable symptoms when first infected. Some 25-35% do, but the symptoms often resemble other illnesses. They can include: About 20% of people who develop symptoms experience jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes).  Source: The Hepatitis C Trust It is estimated that there were 74,600 people living with hepatitis C in England in 2021 - many fewer than just five years before, thanks to better access to antiviral treatments. Deaths from the virus have also fallen - by a third, from 482 in 2015 to 314 in 2020 in England, and by a similar amount in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there is concern that a lack of access to drug services during the Covid pandemic may have halted further progress.  NHS national medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said the NHS was ""on track"" to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030. ""As patient numbers get smaller and each remaining case becomes harder to find and cure, it's vital we offer easy-to-access self-test kits - especially for those who have been exposed to the virus but may be reluctant to come forward,"" he said. In the UK in the 1970s and 80s, about 3,000 people died after being given blood products via NHS treatments containing HIV and hepatitis C. A public inquiry on the contaminated blood scandal started in 2019 and is still running."
risk appetite,"Election in NI is last resort, says ex-Tory leader",2024-09-15,2022-11-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63499549,"Another Stormont assembly election is the ""last resort"" for trying to resolve the political crisis, a former leader of the Conservative Party has said. Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he did not think people in Northern Ireland wanted another election so soon after the previous poll last May. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has said he will call an election, with the deadline to restore devolution having passed last week. But he has not set a date for a vote. On Wednesday Northern Ireland Office Minister Steve Baker said a date for another Stormont election would be confirmed soon. The leaders of the Stormont parties who would sit on the Northern Ireland Executive met Mr Heaton-Harris on Tuesday but they said he gave no clarity about when an election might be held. Devolved government in Northern Ireland has not functioned properly since February. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has blocked the restoration of power-sharing in its protest against the post-Brexit trading arrangement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Sir Iain Duncan Smith told BBC News NI that there was no appetite for an election in Northern Ireland. ""It's the last resort, frankly, and I don't think people want it,"" he said on Thursday. ""The great elephant in the room of all of this is the [Northern Ireland] Protocol itself,"" he said. He urged the EU to be open to finding a resolution with the UK over the post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland. ""At the moment they sort of refuse to discuss the ending of the protocol and the institution of a better way of doing things,"" said Sir Iain. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland aligned with some EU trade rules to ensure that goods can move freely across the Irish land border after Brexit. Unionist parties argue that it has undermined Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border with England, Scotland and Wales. The DUP has refused to return to Stormont until the protocol is scrapped or changed. The UK wants a fundamental rewrite of the treaty while the EU believes sufficient ""flexibilities"" can be found within the existing text. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said the prospect of an election ""should be taken off the table"". ""The sensible thing to do would be to introduce legislation to avoid this [election] and get serious about people getting back into government,"" said the Foyle MP. He said he believed talks between the UK and the EU over the protocol would ""bear some fruit"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said that avoiding an election would allow the UK-EU negotiations ""to continue in earnest"". He added: ""Any progress potentially stands to be put at risk by needlessly calling an assembly election that will change nothing but stands to further undermine the return of devolution and cost the taxpayer £6.5m."" After Tuesday's talks with the Northern Ireland secretary, Sinn Féin vice-president said the public had been ""left in limbo"" with no clarity about an election. The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson urged the government to have a ""razor-like focus"" on getting a solution to his party's concerns about the protocol. Naomi Long, the Alliance Party leader, said the Northern Ireland secretary was ""clearly taking time"" over what to do next. The most recent assembly election in May resulted in Sinn Féin winning the most seats for the first time. That meant Ms O'Neill was entitled to the role of first minister. The DUP was the second-biggest party but it refused to nominate a deputy first minister, meaning a ruling executive for Northern Ireland could not be formed."
risk appetite,'Multiple medicines' side-effect risk for over-65s,2024-09-15,2019-08-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-49433927,"Two million older people are risking side-effects from taking multiple medications, a charity has warned. Age UK says more than one in 10 over-65s in England take at least eight prescribed medications each week. While many are vital for those with complex conditions, the charity says one in five may be inappropriate. GPs said no-one should be taking unnecessary medicines but people should not stop taking their medication without first talking to a doctor. Age UK says older people should not worry about taking many medicines - if they are appropriately prescribed and correctly managed. But the way the body processes medicines changes with age, so they may be more susceptible to side-effects, including: The charity wants older people to be fully involved in decisions about what they are prescribed, and for doctors to regularly review what patients are taking. Jane, 77, had been prescribed 17 different medicines, five of which have to be taken at least five times a day. She has 10 long-term conditions, including epilepsy, high blood-pressure, an underactive thyroid, osteoarthritis and psoriasis. Her GP asked for the medications to be dispensed into blister packs, with all the appropriate tablets for each day put into their own separate pack. But this didn't work for Jane and she stopped taking her medicines altogether. When a pharmacist went through what Jane was taking, they found seven of the 17 could be discontinued. They also stopped using the blister packs. Jane's blood pressure is now under control, she is having better treatment for her other conditions, and she's happy and more confident about the medicines she is taking. 'Fewer pills' Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: ""Our strong advice to older people is never to stop taking any of your medications off your own bat but to talk to your GP if you have concerns and to ask for a review if you haven't had one for a year or more.  ""Everyone's needs change over time and new treatments are always becoming available, so it is well worth your doctor looking at whether your medicines are the best they can be and, indeed, whether they are all still necessary.  ""Most older people would agree that the fewer pills they have to pop, the better."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said family doctors only prescribed a medication after weighing up the risks and benefits for the patient. ""Of course, we don't want to see people taking unnecessary medications - this is not good for the health of our patients or for NHS resources - and it is normal practice for any long-term prescriptions to be kept under review and reduced or discontinued if no longer necessary,"" she said. ""With many older people living with multiple and complex health conditions, prescriptions for more than one medication will often be vital and no course of treatment should be stopped without the advice and support of a GP or other suitably qualified healthcare professional."""
risk appetite,How long will it last? Your heatwave questions,2024-09-15,2018-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44934717,"After a brief burst of heavy rain last weekend, the summer heatwave is returning to some parts of the UK. Temperatures are forecast to rise again across southern England, with the hot weather set to continue into the first half of next week. Meanwhile, Europe is bracing itself for the hottest-ever temperatures with Spain and Portugal predicted to break the 48C (118.4F) record set in Athens in July 1977. As many struggle to stay cool this summer, here are some of the questions you've been asking Google. The hot weather is set to persist in the south of the UK throughout the weekend, says BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne. Temperatures are expected to reach highs of 33C in London on Friday before dropping back slightly to 29-30C on Saturday and Sunday. ""The weekend as a whole across the UK will be largely fine and warm with spells of sunshine,"" he says - although the exception will be the north-west of Scotland which will see showers. BBC Weather: UK forecast The heatwave in the south-east is forecast to continue into the start of next week with highs of up to 32C - although the Met Office said it is unlikely to be record-breaking. But from Wednesday, the weather will become fresher as an area of low pressure develops and for the rest of the week temperatures look set to return to more ""normal levels"" of mid to low 20s. For the middle weeks in August, Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell predicts a return to the ""typical British summer"" with some more unsettled weather and a risk of showers. Temperatures will be closer to 20-22C in southern areas and 16-18C in the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Hotter temperatures could return at the end of August as the weather becomes less changeable, Ms Mitchell said, although the outlook is still uncertain. The hottest day so far of 2018 was Thursday 26 July, when temperatures reached 35.3C in Faversham, Kent. But it still did not top the UK's highest ever recorded temperature of 38.5C (101F), also in Faversham in Kent in August 2003. Provisional figures from the Met Office had suggested that Scotland experienced its hottest ever temperature in June, when 33.2C degrees was measured in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. But the Met Office later rejected this figure because a stationary vehicle with the engine running was parked near to the thermometers that measured this temperature, potentially contaminating the result. So Scotland's high of 32.9C recorded in August 2003 at Greycrook in the Borders still stands. Forecasters say the all-time temperature record in Europe could be broken in the coming days. The current European record is 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in July 1977. Hot air sweeping in from Africa is causing temperatures to rise in Spain and Portugal and temperatures are forecast to rise to up to 47C in parts. The Association of British Travel Agents urged holidaymakers visiting the areas to ""copy the locals"". ""Avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day, drink lots of water and apply plenty of sun cream,"" a spokesman said. ""If you go to the beach, go early and when it feels like it's getting too hot leave, just as the locals do, and go and have a nice lunch in the shade."" You can't fail to notice how brown the UK landscape has become this summer. But, says the Royal Horticultural Society, brown lawns look a lot worse than they are and they should recover rapidly with renewed rainfall. When mowing dry lawns, the RHS advises gardeners to raise the height of cut on mowers to avoid weakening the grasses. Allow the clippings fall back onto the lawn - this will slow down the evaporation of water from the soil surface. The RHS also suggests watering the lawn (provided there are no hosepipe restrictions in force) in early morning, evening or even at night to reduce water wastage from evaporation. Find some more RHS advice here In pictures: The dried parks and parched lawns of Britain When there's warm weather, a false social media story about petrol tanks exploding in hot conditions tends to resurface. This is a complete myth, says the AA's head of road safety, Ian Crowder. ""Cars operate perfectly well in temperature extremes across the world - whether inside the Arctic Circle or in equatorial countries,"" he says. ""Cars fuel tanks are designed with a venting system that allows for the relatively small expansion and contraction of the fuel between temperature extremes. ""There is absolutely no risk that simply filling the tank will increase the risk of an explosion."" The NHS suggests keeping rooms cool by using shades or reflective material outside the windows - or light-coloured curtains which are closed. ""The most sensible option is to use a [electric] fan,"" says Mary Morrell, professor of sleep and respiratory physiology at Imperial College London. ""It will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating."" Thin cotton sheets rather than nylon bedding are also recommended. Prof Kevin Morgan, director of the Clinical Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University, says a lukewarm shower before bed is preferable to a cold shower. Read the BBC Magazine article on sleeping during hot weather  The NHS recommends keeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight and older infants out of the sun as much as possible, particularly in the summer and between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. Sun cream with a high sun-protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids.  The NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual but will not need water as well as breast milk.  If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. Rachel Frost, from Birmingham Dogs Home, has some advice for keeping canines cool this summer. And the RSPCA has released a series of tips for keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave. Read more: Keeping animals cool in the heatwave The NHS says heat exhaustion is not serious and usually gets better when you cool down. But if it turns into heatstroke it needs to be treated as an emergency. Signs of heat exhaustion include dizziness and confusion, loss of appetite, feeling sick and intense thirst. Children may become floppy and sleepy. Signs of heatstroke include temperature of 40C or above, shortness of breath and seizures. The NHS website has the full list of symptoms - and most importantly advice on how to prevent both conditions. Unfortunately for those seeking a day off there are no laws in the UK about when it is too hot to work (or too cold). Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. Londonderry-based employment law specialist Martina McAuley says: ""Employers do need to consider the impact of workplace temperature and have a general duty to ensure the safety, health and welfare of all employees."" But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures.  Read more: When is it too hot to work?

risk appetite,Why is the UK rolling out the red carpet for the Saudi Crown Prince?,2024-09-15,2018-03-07,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43235643,"Mohammed bin Salman is just 32 years old. He is Saudi Arabia's crown prince - not its head of state - and he has only been in his post for nine months.  Yet when this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. There'll be lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, and dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge at Clarence House. There will be meetings with the prime minister at Chequers and Downing Street. And garland upon rhetorical garland of praise will be placed at his feet. MBS - as he is known - will be granted this warm welcome not just because he is the de facto leader of his country. But also because Saudi Arabia has had a long alliance with the UK, a relationship that will take on a different shape after Brexit. For now, the relationship is based on deep and close security links. Saudi Arabia shares intelligence which the prime minister says has saved British lives on British streets.  The Saudis are keen on UK cyber expertise to help them tackle the threat from Iran. There is also a close defence relationship with Britain selling - controversially - billions of pounds worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, on which ministers insist tens of thousands of British jobs depend.  But this visit will not just be a case of two allies refreshing their relationship.  The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well.  The UK certainly supports the reforms that this young leader is introducing at an astonishingly fast rate. He is liberalising what has been for many years a deeply conservative country.  Women are being allowed to drive and go to football matches. Cinemas are being opened. There has been a crackdown on corruption with senior figures detained and forced to put billions back into state coffers.  The Crown Prince has pushed back at the clerics who have held such sway for so many years, making the case for a more liberal vision of Islam. He has begun a process - known as the 2030 Vision - to try to make his country's economy less dependent on oil and more broad-based and market-orientated.  All this the British government supports, looking for opportunities for British businesses in the provision of education, entertainment, tourism and healthcare - all areas where officials believe the UK has expertise and a comparative advantage. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia.  In particular, the British are keen to persuade the Saudis to float part of their massive state oil group, Aramco, on the London Stock Exchange.  This would be a hugely lucrative deal that has not surprisingly also attracted the attention of other global financial centres.  Some MPs worry that the UK may water down its corporate governance rules to secure the listing. UK officials do not expect any early decision on this, but they will use the visit to make the case for London. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list.  But amid the diplomatic love that will be showered upon the Crown Prince, there will also be an appetite for reassurance. There are nerves about what some see as a young man in a hurry.  Some are concerned about reforms being forced on a conservative society so quickly that there could be a backlash at home.  Others worry about an anti-corruption drive that has made international investors nervous. Cracking down on graft is one thing, arbitrary detention of businessmen and confiscation of assets is another. The Saudis are keen, analysts say, to show that they are committed to a level regulatory playing field.  British diplomats have also been concerned by what some see as Mohammed bin Salman's impulsive foreign policy, in particular his feud with the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, who recently withdrew his resignation, a month after saying he was quitting in a shock announcement in Saudi Arabia.  Pushing back against Iranian influence in the region may be understandable, but not if it provokes yet more instability. The fear, say analysts, is that the Crown Prince is good at starting things, but less good at de-escalating them and managing risk.  And then, of course, there are the issues on which the two countries have substantial differences.  The British government supports in principle the Saudi-led military campaign to restore the internationally-recognised government in Yemen, and accepts what it sees as Riyadh's legitimate security concerns.  But the UK has worries about the way the Saudis are prosecuting the campaign, particularly the excessive use of force and the thousands upon thousands of civilian deaths.  Thus far, all attempts to bring an end to what has become a proxy conflict with Iran have failed.  The Saudis continue to blame the continuing conflict on the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, but privately the UK is still looking to play a role in finding some kind of political solution.  Britain is also keen to see an end to the standoff between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies. For now, the Saudis appear happy with a status quo that they believe keeps Qatar on the back foot.  The UK is also at odds with the Saudis over the Iran nuclear deal, which Riyadh opposes. If the Saudis push back against Iran too firmly, there are fears that the nuclear deal could be endangered.    And then there is Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Campaigners are concerned about what they see as Saudi Arabia's repressive actions, such as the detention of political activists and its widespread use of corporal and capital punishment. For all the Crown Prince's liberalisations, Saudi Arabia remains an autocratic monarchy which opposes dissent.  Theresa May says she will talk ""frankly and constructively"" about what she calls ""issues of concern including regional security and the conflict and humanitarian situation in Yemen"".  But that will not stop substantial demonstrations taking place throughout this visit. Many campaign groups are planning protests outside Downing Street.  Politicians are expected to join them. Their focal point will be the £4.6bn worth of aircraft, helicopters, drones, grenades, bombs and missiles which the Campaign Against the Arms Trade claims Britain has sold to Saudi Arabia since its bombardment of Yemen began in 2015.  How the British government and the Saudi prince respond to this will be a key test of this visit.  The hope within the British government is that this will not sour an already sensitive visit on which much is at stake.  The Crown Prince wants to reassure global allies about his reforms and project a little Saudi economic leadership. And Britain wants to broaden its economic base after Brexit, and show its allies that it can remain a reliable partner in business and diplomacy. "
risk appetite,Trial to help diabetics lose weight in their sleep,2024-09-15,2022-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-61864181,"People with type 2 diabetes could be helped to lose weight while they sleep in a new treatment being tested by scientists. University of Portsmouth researchers need volunteers to see if breathing lower amounts of oxygen (hypoxia) improves blood glucose levels. Previous evidence has shown hypoxia can reduce appetite and burn more calories in people with type 2 diabetes. Volunteers will sleep at home in a tent set up by the study team.  Over the next 20 years, the number of people living with type 2 diabetes is expected to reach 700m worldwide and researchers say creating a range of potential treatments for the condition is vital. The study will investigate if sleeping in a special tent that creates a lower oxygen environment, is effective at improving blood glucose control and has an impact of weight loss. Dr Ant Shepherd, senior lecturer in the university's school of sport, health and exercise science, said: ""Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that causes blood glucose levels to become too high. ""For many people, it is a long-term condition which can negatively impact their everyday life and put them at a greater risk of developing other serious health complications, such as heart disease or eye problems. ""It is vital that we find other successful interventions to help us treat and manage the condition, reducing the cost to the NHS and making people's day-to-day lives better."" Throughout the trial, volunteers will be asked to wear smart monitors, keep a food diary and provide blood, urine and stool samples. They will also have body composition scans and their blood glucose levels tested, to help researchers understand the body's response to hypoxia. Dr Shepherd added: ""There's already quite a lot of evidence from other studies which shows that hypoxia improves the control of blood glucose levels and results in weight loss. ""We're not entirely sure why this happens, but we think it's likely to be because it helps you burn more calories and appetites become suppressed so that people don't feel as hungry."" Trial participant Janet Rennell-Smyth said: ""It doesn't feel claustrophobic and, when you get used to the noise of the machine, it feels no different.  ""I'm enjoying participating in the study that may give us, in future, alternate treatments for this disease""  Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

risk appetite,Kuaishou share price surges on market launch,2024-09-15,2021-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55882760,"Shares of the Chinese short-form video app Kuaishou surged more than 190% on the company's launch on Hong Kong's stock exchange on Friday.  Shortly after the company listed, shares were selling at more than HK$300 ($38.07; £28.31), nearly triple the list price of HK$115.  Kuaishou is one of the most hotly-anticipated initial public offerings this year and has raised $5.4bn (£4bn). The app has a massive user base in China and competes with TikTok. The company's listing is a key test of investors' appetite for Chinese tech companies as Beijing steps up scrutiny of the sector.  When it was created in 2012, Kuaishou was originally a mobile app for making GIF animations.   Now, it is a short-form video platform that competes with ByteDance's TikTok app, but is also popular for livestreaming.  In documents tendered with the Hong Kong stock exchange, Kuaishou said it aimed to be ""the most customer-obsessed company in the world"". Kuaishou claims 305 million daily active users, who spent an average of 86 minutes or more on the app.  Content creators made up about 26% of the app's 769 million monthly active users.  The app is particularly popular in China's second and third tier cities, and in rural areas too, where it is often used for group chats and messaging, as well as for videos.  ""Some people use Kuaishou more like they use WeChat. Kuaishou has a lot more functionality than TikTok,"" said Rui Ma, a Chinese tech analyst with Techbuzz China.  In addition to its popularity, the company's revenues grew from $1.3bn in 2017 to $6.2bn in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. However, it's still not turning a profit. The company reported a loss of $1.1bn over that period.  Currently, Kuaishou makes most of its money from livestreaming e-commerce, often featuring celebrities showcasing products to bring in buyers.   It also makes money from virtual gifts, and has increasingly turned to online marketing services, which accounted for 33% of its business in the first three quarters of 2020.  If TikTok epitomises the eccentricities of urban millennials - Kuaishou is the short video app for everyone, no matter where you're from.  Scroll through and you'll find farmers and merchants from villages and lower-tier cities, livestreaming a glimpse of their daily lives.  This is the key difference, the app's young founders say, between it and other social media platforms.  They claim Kuaishou is a more accurate reflection of modern China - where there's a growing sense of inequality between rich and poor, city-livers and rural dwellers, the haves and the have-nots.  The big draw for investors has been the app's ability to tap into these rural markets.  Kuaishou makes money is by allowing livestreamers to sell their products online, and for users to purchase virtual gifts for other users.  But turning these users into real profit will be a challenge.  Despite soaring revenues, Kuaishou is struggling to make a profit.  In its filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the company says this is a key risk: ""the fact that we incurred net losses during the track record period and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future."" Investors should also pay attention to the changing regulatory environment in China.  Big tech firms like Ant Group are under the spotlight for monopolising the wallets of Chinese internet users.  Livestreaming services and virtual gifting have already caught the attention of Chinese regulators. Kuaishou may not be far behind.  Although the company isn't yet profitable, Rui Ma said Kuaishou's main strength has been its ability to monetise video content.  Many video apps have a big user base, but only a few have figured out how to make money from them.  ""Kuaishou is one of the best companies in capturing those monetisation opportunities. They've been very good at executing, despite all the competition. I think I'm cautiously optimistic,"" said Rui Ma.   It's customer base outside the major cities is also likely to be an advantage, she said, because they have used the app for many years and are likely to remain loyal.   "
risk appetite,Weight-loss jabs investigated for suicide risk,2024-09-15,2023-07-10,By Michelle Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66119059,"Europe's drugs regulator has told BBC News it is conducting a review of some weight-loss jabs after being alerted to a possible link to thoughts of suicide and self-harm among users.  Member state Iceland notified the European Medicines Agency after seeing three cases.  The safety assessment will look at Wegovy, Saxenda and similar drugs, such as Ozempic, that help curb appetite.  Product leaflets already list suicidal thoughts as a possible side effect. Suicidal behaviour is not currently listed for these prescription drugs. The EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), which is conducting the review, will consider whether other treatments in same broader category of medicines, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, also need assessing. But initially, it will assess only the risks of using weight-loss medication that contains either semaglutide or liraglutide.  An EMA official said: ""The review is being carried out in the context of a signal procedure raised by the Icelandic Medicines Agency, following three case reports.  ""A signal is information on a new or known adverse event that is potentially caused by a medicine and that warrants further investigation.  ""The case reports included two cases of suicidal thoughts - one following the use of Saxenda and one after Ozempic.  ""One additional case reported thoughts of self-injury with Saxenda. ""The EMA will communicate further when more information becomes available."" Social media posts about people, often celebrities, shedding large amounts of weight has led to big demand for these types of treatment. Saxenda and Wegovy are approved and licensed for weight loss. Wegovy is not yet available in the UK - but the prime minister has said GPs in England may soon start offering it to some patients, as well as specialist weight-management clinics. Ozempic is for people with diabetes to help control blood sugar as well as weight but contains a lower dose of the same medicine, semaglutide, as Wegovy. And with some people without diabetes buying the pre-filled pens to lose weight, there have been continuing global shortages. All medicines have potential side effects. For weight-loss drugs, which should be used alongside a healthy diet and exercise, more common ones include: Depression or thoughts of suicide is listed in the product-information leaflet, which advises users: ""You should pay attention to any mental changes, especially sudden changes in your mood, behaviours, thoughts, or feelings. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any mental changes that are new, worse, or worry you."" Prescribers are also advised to monitor for this.  Manufacturer Novo Nordisk is working with the EMA and says patient safety is a top priority. A representative said: ""GLP-1 receptor agonists have been used to treat type-2 diabetes for more than 15 years and for treatment of obesity for eight years, including Novo Nordisk products such as semaglutide and liraglutide that have been in the UK market since 2018 and 2009 respectively.  ""The safety data collected from large clinical-trial programmes and post-marketing surveillance have not demonstrated a causal association between semaglutide or liraglutide and suicidal and self-harming thoughts.  ""Novo Nordisk is continuously performing surveillance of the data from ongoing clinical trials and real-world use of its products and collaborates closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety and adequate information to healthcare professionals.  ""EMA continuously monitors for safety signals and so does Novo Nordisk.  ""Novo Nordisk remains committed to ensuring patient safety."" The UK's drug regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it was monitoring the situation. Dr Alison Cave, MHRA Chief Safety Officer, said: ""As part of our close monitoring, any emerging evidence is routinely considered alongside other sources of information, including suspected adverse drug reactions. We will communicate any new advice to healthcare professionals and patients if appropriate. ""If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm, please seek immediate medical assistance. ""We ask everyone to report any suspected side effects using our Yellow Card scheme website."" If you have been affected by any of these issues, visit BBC Action Line, where you can find support."
risk appetite,Chemotherapy halted by hospital staff shortage,2024-09-15,2021-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-58669392,"A hospital trust has had to cancel chemotherapy treatments for some cancer patients due to a serious shortage of specialist staff.  Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs two hospitals in the city, said it postponed treatments for 49 patients on one day this week.  The problem has been caused by short and long-term sickness, and vacancies. The trust said it was ""deeply sorry"" and had ""prioritised care based on the likely clinical benefit"". Simon Roe, clinical director of cancer and associated services at the trust, which runs the QMC and City hospitals in Nottingham, gave a ""heartfelt apology"" to patients who had been affected.  ""From the beginning of this month we have faced a really challenging situation with staffing levels on our chemotherapy suites, which has mainly affected specialist nurses that we need to administer the chemotherapy,"" he said. Mr Roe said the trust was 30% down on the number of specialist nurses needed to run a full service. On Thursday he said staff had called 49 patients to cancel their treatment, representing about 10% of their patient list.  ""It has been incredibly difficult for our patients, their families and for the staff involved in this service,"" he said.  ""They have worked extremely hard over the past 18 months to maintain our cancer services so to be in this situation is really, really difficult and extremely upsetting for members of the team."" The trust said it was using guidance produced by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) during the pandemic to select which patients would have their treatment delayed.  Medical director Dr Keith Girling said: ""Our clinical teams are prioritising care based on the likely clinical benefit. We are deeply sorry for the concern and upset this will cause."" Mr Roe said staff were ""doing absolutely everything we can to get the service back up and running"" and he was optimistic they could offer treatments to everyone again soon. Annie Walton, head of the Nottingham Maggie's Centre, which provides free cancer support said they had seen a mixed response from patients.  ""Some are disappointed, very upset and some are angry, but some are quite relieved that they are having a break and the choice has been taken away from them,"" she said. ""With chemo comes a multitude of problems - memory loss, mobility problems, fatigue, nausea, appetite loss - and some people are looking for some quality end-of-life in the last years of their life, so they are relieved.  ""The pandemic has been really difficult for patients with cancer and their families, and now a lot of hospitals are struggling to roll out full programmes of cancer treatment.

Whitmore Park Primary School was closed on Monday to complete a ""deep clean"" which began at the weekend. It is expected to reopen on Tuesday.  Head teacher Jacqueline McGibney said the school was working with Public Health England (PHE) ""who have advised us that the risk to children is low"". PHE said the child's infection was travel-related and an associated pupil was being tested.  Ms McGibney said the school in Halford Lane had been keeping parents informed.  ""We have a well-managed cleaning regime which follows the advice of the [city] council's environmental health team,"" she added. PHE said the infection was believed to be travel-related and the child has been receiving antibiotics and was ""feeling much improved"". A small number of close contacts have been asked for blood and stool samples, for lab testing, it added. Angela Cartwright, from PHE West Midlands Health Protection Team, said: ""The risk to other children at the school is low, but as a precaution, we are testing a small number of close contacts.  ""If typhoid fever is left untreated, symptoms will worsen over time, and there is a risk of developing serious complications - so it's important for people with symptoms to contact their GP or call NHS111.""

risk appetite,Tiger at US zoo tests positive for coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-04-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52177586,"A four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus. The tiger, named Nadia, is believed to be the first known case of an animal infected with Covid-19 in the US. The Bronx Zoo, in New York City, says the test result was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa. Nadia, along with six other big cats, is thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zoo keeper. The cats started showing symptoms, including a dry cough, late last month after exposure to the employee, who has not been identified.  ""This is the first time that any of us know of anywhere in the world that a person infected the animal and the animal got sick,"" Paul Calle, the chief veterinarian at the zoo, told Reuters news agency on Sunday.  There have been isolated instances of pets testing positive for the coronavirus elsewhere in the world, but experts have stressed there is no evidence they can become sick or spread the disease.  Mr Calle said he intends to share the findings with other zoos and institutions researching the transmission of Covid-19. ""We tested the cat [Nadia] out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about Covid-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" the zoo said in a statement. Nadia, her sister Azul, as well as two Amur tigers and three African lions who showed symptoms, are all expected to make a full recovery, the zoo said. The big cats did have some decrease in appetite but ""are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers"", it said. The zoo said it is not known how the virus will develop in animals like tigers and lions since various species can react differently to new infections, but all the animals will be closely monitored.  None of the zoo's other big cats are showing any signs of illness.  All the tigers showing symptoms were housed in the zoo's Tiger Mountain area. It is unclear if the others will be tested. All four zoos run by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City, including the Bronx Zoo, have been closed to the public since 16 March.  New measures will now be put in place to protect the animals and their caretakers at all the facilities.  This coronavirus was first detected in humans in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.  The coronavirus (called Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19) is thought to have originated in wildlife and been passed to humans via a live animal market in Wuhan. The pandemic has been driven by human-to-human transmission, but the infection of Nadia raises new questions about human-to-animal transmission. There have been less than a handful of isolated reports of companion animals testing positive for coronavirus, including two dogs in Hong Kong.  There is ""no evidence that any person has been infected with Covid-19 in the US by animals, including by pet dogs or cats,"" the zoo's statement noted. That is also the view of the World Organisation for Animal Health and  the World Health Organization (WHO), which says there is no evidence that pet dogs or cats can pass on the coronavirus. The World Organisation for Animal Health says studies are under way to understand the issue more.  and urges anyone who has become sick to limit contact with pets. Dr Sarah Caddy, Veterinarian and Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, is among experts to respond to the reports. ""It is surprising that the tiger has become infected with what must have been a fairly low dose of virus - we can assume the tiger did not have continual close contact with the asymptomatic zoo keeper,"" she said about the transmission.  ""It is also interesting that the tiger showed clinical signs consistent with Covid-19 in humans. Although scientific proof is lacking, the chance this is just a coincidence is low."" Conservation experts have warned that the virus could pose a threat to some wildlife like the great apes - and have said measures are needed to reduce the risk of wild gorillas, chimps and orangutans."
risk appetite,Stranger Danger,2024-09-15,2020-05-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52839660,"What's stopping you getting on a bus or train? The rules, telling you that you should 'Stay At Home'? Or self-interest, because it's a risky world out there, and Covid-19 could be lurking anywhere? To listen to governments north and south, the two are being conflated. It's in your interests, and those of the whole community and society, they're saying, that you stick to the rules that we're giving you. And for many, that suits them just fine. The latest move into a phase of easing lockdown combines rules - new and continuing - to limit infection with a need to boost public confidence. The government has a role in both. Even where there is limited value to wearing a face-mask, the element of reassurance they give people is cited as the main reason why they are being strongly recommended on public transport. (But not legally required, points out Scottish Labour, with an attack on the Scottish government for leaving transport workers to enforce safety.) Two weeks ago, 43% of people surveyed for Transport Focus thought they would be more likely to use public transport if other people were wearing a mask. That has risen to 60%, after the advice shifted to favouring face covering in confined spaces such as shops, and as people have become more used to seeing face-covering as the norm. Other industries are throwing a lot of effort into getting an understanding of their customers' view of risk, as businesses seek to re-open. Arts companies have been keen to find out from me, and numerous others on emailing lists, the conditions under which I'd go back to a theatre or concert, and when I might be willing to start booking. One such market research for the tourism industry, carried out by 56 Degree Insight, found in early May that potential Scottish staycationers tend to want to avoid public transport in favour of private cars. They are averse to flying overseas and busy places, and put hygiene higher up their list of priorities for their destination.  They (or we) intend to take it one step at a time, starting with day trips when allowed to. Then on to short breaks or a holiday in Scotland, spreading horizons to the rest of the UK more than Scots want to go overseas.  On the survey's so-called 'desirability index', the day trip scores 71, and the overseas holiday only 44. Changed days. Respondents liked the idea of self-contained self-catering, in caravans or camping, allowing families to cut off from other people. There's less appetite for going out for meals while renting on holiday. The preference is for the countryside and beaches, rather than cities and towns. None of these findings will come as a surprise, but it's not good news for the immense tourism infrastructure in cities including Edinburgh, which will be without its festivals this summer. There's reduced interest in indoor activities such as visits to arts and cultural venues. Purpose-built attractions will have less appeal, post lockdown. Attendance at events and festivals and mixing with locals both have much less appeal now than previously. ""Given the importance of Scotland's 'friendly welcome' messaging, navigating around this will require a lot of thought,"" the survey compilers observe. In general, the survey found that 11% of people are nervous and very wary of a return to travel, while 17% of those surveyed said nothing has changed, and they'll return to the way things were before. We've been asking similar questions of the public, or at least Ipsos Mori was doing so last week on behalf of BBC Scotland. The results of that survey support that view that people are roughly evenly split on whether things have all changed, or they're going to be much the same. Do you expect to go back to the things you did before, once restrictions are lifted? The 'as you were' side edged it by 49% to 48% for 'unlikely'. Do you expect to go back to restaurants and bars? Only 38% say that's likely, rising to 52% for adults aged up to 34.  Think about that: of young adults, only half are likely to go out to bars and restaurants. Enticing more of them to do so is not going to be straightforward.  Nor is drawing people back into shops when the experience starts with a queue and instructions to shop alone, in an environment full of bright yellow warnings of invisible risk. Persuading the government to let business premises open up for trading is only the first part of the challenge. It's the relatively straightforward one.  Getting over customer hurdles of anxiety and fear will be more complex and nuanced, and doing so will surely take a lot longer."
risk appetite,Is Brighton boss Potter an England manager in the making?,2024-09-15,2021-10-29,Sean Cole,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59037905,"Brighton are fifth in the Premier League and will go into the top four if they cause an upset and win at Liverpool on Saturday A remote club in the fourth tier of Swedish football was not the ideal starting point for an aspiring manager, but Graham Potter was just grateful for the opportunity. It was a leap into the unknown and he could have sunk without trace. Instead, Potter guided Ostersunds FK to three promotions in five seasons, followed by a first major trophy and a spot in the Europa League.  His prospects were transformed beyond recognition. Douglas Bergqvist, a young defender who had lost his way in the English system, had his career revived by Potter after leaving Exeter City to join Ostersund in February 2014. ""I didn't really feel I was getting my due. The first conversation I had with Graham, he basically sold me the dream. They were in the second tier and maybe it was a far-fetched plan, but it all came true,"" says Bergqvist. ""I don't think it will be replicated in Swedish football, especially of that magnitude and how quick it all went."" Bergqvist was one of several players who had grown disillusioned with a lack of progress, embracing the possibility of a fresh start in Sweden. Potter made them feel valued in a way others hadn't. ""A lot of us were lost, doubted, rejects. He loved a turnaround story and changing people for the better. He's someone who changed, not just my football career, but my life. I became a more mature and respectful human being. He cared more about you as a person than your football skills."" Thoughtful and compassionate, Potter helped to create a supportive culture at Ostersund, where people were encouraged to be open with each other. It was a stark contrast to the mentality of an old-fashioned English dressing room. ""Moving away from home, some things were difficult off the pitch,"" explains the 28-year-old. ""He was very big on helping on the mental health side. It wasn't talked about as much then as it is nowadays. He helped me and a lot of other boys. ""We had a very good environment. No matter how good you were as a footballer, if you didn't fit into the group then he found a different solution for you. No player was bigger than the team."" Bergqvist forged a close relationship with Potter and they've stayed in touch. At the end of his second season with the club, Ostersund won promotion to the top division for the first time. They weren't overawed and continued to play on the front foot, controlling games against teams with much greater resources. In April 2017, they won the Swedish Cup. ""We played a very possession-based type of football. Very methodical and forward-thinking. It was high risk, but high reward,"" says Bergqvist. ""He was just two, three, four steps ahead. He always knew what the opposition were going to do. He played different systems and was able to change personnel. He was a tactical genius."" Ostersund shot to prominence with their run to the last 32 of the Europa League, which included positive results against Galatasaray, Hertha Berlin and Athletic Bilbao. They were eventually knocked out by Arsenal, despite winning 2-1 at Emirates Stadium. Potter led Ostersund to the most successful period in their history That summer, Potter took over at Swansea City, who were looking to rebuild on their return to the Championship. He was still relatively unknown in the UK, but quickly won over his new players. ""We had a big meeting and I remember his exact words were 'this isn't a dictatorship',"" says striker Oli McBurnie. ""He wanted to help us as much as we'd help him. He wanted to help you improve as much as a person as he did as a player. I'd never really had that from any manager before. ""The club had just been relegated and a few big names had gone. It was a bit up in the air. He brought in a lot of players from the under-23s. He was really keen on developing players. If they earned the opportunity to play, he was more than happy to give it to them."" McBurnie was one of the biggest beneficiaries. After three years on the fringes he was entrusted to lead the line for the Swans and enjoyed the best season of his career, scoring 24 goals in 44 games. ""He's the best manager I've ever had on a personal level, by far. He cared so much about your wellbeing. Football's a results-based business and you're almost seen as pieces of meat sometimes. He went the extra mile to help me with things he didn't have to,"" recalls the Scottish striker. ""He had a lot of trust in me. He gave me that opportunity and gave me the confidence throughout the whole season to just keep going. The way we played football definitely suited me as well."" Potter restored Swansea's identity as a passing team, which had served them so well on their rise through the divisions. He encouraged his players to be brave and stick to the plan. ""He cared so much more about the performance than the result,"" adds McBurnie. ""I remember one game at Nottingham Forest. We lost 2-1 but we'd absolutely battered them. He was happier with that than games where we'd got a result but hadn't played the way he wanted. ""His philosophy was that if you get the performance right, then more times than not the result would look after itself. It was a breath of fresh air."" Potter's sole season in charge ended with a 10th-placed finish, nine points shy of the play-offs. His side were entertaining to watch but hit their stride too late to challenge. Before they could build on that, the Premier League came calling. ""Everyone in that Swansea team thought he'd do well at Brighton,"" says McBurnie. ""He plays football the right way. He has the right outlook on football and life. He's such a good person that boys will always play for him. They're great ingredients for a manager."" Brighton had been at constant threat of relegation for the previous two seasons. When Potter replaced Chris Hughton in May 2019, he was tasked with pushing them up the table while introducing a more adventurous style of play. ""I was impressed with how he saw the game and how he liked to play,"" says Dale Stephens, who has since joined Burnley. ""He took over a team that was really good defensively but probably lacked a little bit going forward. ""He wasn't going to change everything within two weeks. He knew it was going to be a process, but from early on you could see where he wanted the team and the club to go."" Throughout pre-season, Potter worked to implement a more fluid attacking system. On the opening day, everything came together at Vicarage Road, giving an early indication of what this revamped Brighton were capable of. ""We had all these new ideas and they're obviously going to be tested in the first game,"" Stephens recalls. ""We went to Watford and won 3-0. That breeds belief within the team that we're doing the right things and we're on the right track."" When Brighton's form dipped, the players never panicked. Potter's belief was unwavering and his preparation as thorough as ever. ""There was no stone left unturned,"" says the midfielder. ""From Monday morning, you knew your job clearly. He'd challenge you every week. You could be playing one system one week and then a different system the week after. ""He'd study a team with his backroom staff, and we'd have a clear plan. He didn't leave anything to chance. You could still lose, but he had a logical idea and gave it everything in terms of regular video meetings and showing clips of what he wanted."" Potter had enjoyed success with younger, more impressionable players at Ostersund and Swansea. Brighton had a more experienced squad, but they responded to his approach with the same enthusiasm. ""I was 30 years old and was still learning a lot about the game,"" adds Stephens. ""He's whetted my appetite for becoming a manager. ""I really enjoyed working with him. No matter who you played against, he had a plan."" The Seagulls finished 15th and 16th, with the same points tally, in the past two seasons, but their performances always gave them the belief that results would improve. Now they have and Brighton are flying high in fifth place going into Saturday's Premier League trip to Liverpool. Although Potter, 46, is thriving at Brighton, many believe he has the potential to go even further. Several of his former players see him as a future England manager. ""I wouldn't say anything's too big for him. I could see him taking over the England job one day - he can go all the way. The only thing is if people at the top level are willing to buy into him and his vision,"" says Bergqvist. ""At Swansea, we all said we could see him being England manager,"" agrees McBurnie. ""We believed in him that much. I honestly think he could go as high and as far as he wants. I don't think there's much that could stop him.""

risk appetite,Limited progress at virtual UN climate talks,2024-09-15,2021-06-18,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57520510,"Exhausted delegates have concluded three weeks of virtual climate negotiations with little progress on key issues.  The UN subsidiary bodies meeting was meant to clear the decks ahead of the major COP26 gathering in Glasgow in November.  But technical glitches, and multiple time zones scuppered attempts to find common ground. Ministers from 40 countries will meet in July to push the process forward.  Developing nations are also concerned that a lack of vaccines may limit their ability to take part in the Glasgow conference.  But the UK says it will ensure all accredited delegates will get their jabs ahead of the summit.  Thanks to the pandemic, this virtual gathering was the first significant meeting of UN negotiators since December 2019, when COP25 ended in Madrid. That meeting had failed to find a way forward on a number of important technical questions including the role of carbon markets in curbing climate change.  Despite an extended session that ran for three weeks of talks, these important issues have still not been resolved.  The challenges of delegates in differing time zones with varying internet connections made these difficult negotiations a real struggle.  ""I think this was technically challenging for many parties, connectivity problems compounded and complicated the trust deficits that exist,"" said Quamrul Chowdhury, a climate negotiator from Bangladesh. ""Even the low hanging fruits couldn't be harvested,"" he told BBC News.  As well as the technical challenges, there were issues with access for observers with China objecting to their presence at talks on transparency. With little movement from the negotiators, it will require ministerial intervention to push the process forward. ""The past three weeks have made one thing very clear - the most dangerous stumbling blocks on the road to COP26 are political, not technical,"" said Jennifer Tollmann, a senior policy advisor at environmental think-tank E3G. ""Parties know each others' positions, it's the will to find compromise options that drive ambition that's frequently missing."" The technical challenges mean there is a strong appetite among delegates for face to face talks in Glasgow.   However the question of Covid-19, especially in developing countries is a key issue of concern for many. ""Covid-19 remains a serious concern for many of us, and travel restrictions continue for many countries,"" said Ambassador Diann Black-Layne of Antigua and Barbuda, who is a lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.  ""A significant portion of our membership face onerous travel restrictions regardless of their personal vaccination status. Some islands in the Pacific have just two flights per month, with one month of quarantine, while other islands still have closed borders. This will not change unless their entire populations have vaccine access.""  But UK minister Alok Sharma, who will chair the global gathering, told a news conference that delegates unable to get jabs from their own countries ""will get support from us"". Details are still being worked out in discussions with the UN, according to Mr Sharma.  The incoming COP president says that he hopes to speed up the climate talks process by hosting a ministerial meeting in London in July with representatives from about 40 countries.  Across all these meetings, one issue keeps coming to the surface and that's the question of finance. The richer nations have promised $100bn a year in climate finance from 2020.  The developed world has still not succeeded in raising that total.  ""History will not be kind to rich nations if they do not step up and fulfil their climate action commitments,"" said Harjeet Singh, with climate campaign group Climate Action Network International. ""We are already at a point where the world faces multiple crises, and the reality is that the rich world are offering a bandage when surgery is needed."" Follow Matt on Twitter."
risk appetite,What you need to know about Softbank's IPO,2024-09-15,2018-11-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46189850,"Japan's Softbank plans to list its mobile unit in Tokyo next month in what could be one of the world's largest stock offerings.  The 2.4 trillion yen ($21bn) float is part of Softbank's broader move away from telecoms towards tech investing. If demand triggers an additional offering, the IPO could rival Alibaba's record $25bn listing.   Led by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, the firm has built up a high-profile portfolio of tech investments.  ""Over the last several years, Softbank has gradually been transforming away from telecommunication to more of a venture capital company,"" Marc Einstein, analyst at ITR Corporation in Tokyo said. ""What we are seeing now is a step in that direction,"" he said.  Softbank began as a Japanese telecoms company but has since become a technology conglomerate through various deals and investments.  The firm, run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, moved into robotics and developed the human-like Pepper in 2014. Some of its deals include buying UK chip firm ARM Holdings for £24bn ($30.1bn), investing $1bn in satellite start-up OneWeb, and setting up a venture fund with Saudi Arabia. Softbank has also shown an appetite for investments in ride-sharing, backing China's Didi Chuxing and South East Asian taxi-hailing app Grab. It also has a large stake in Uber. It previously acquired Vodafone's Japanese operations and the US telecoms company Sprint. Self-driving technologies have also attracted investment from Softbank, including a partnership with Toyota to develop transport services using autonomous vehicles. Mr Son founded Softbank and has guided it to become one of the world's biggest technology companies.  The entrepreneur - who is Japan's richest man according to Forbes - is known for having an eye for firms with big potential and for spotting transformative industries and trends.  He was an early investor in Chinese internet giant Alibaba and saw the potential in e-commerce before many others. ""He is kind of our Steve Jobs [or] Bill Gates in Japan,"" Mr Einstein said.  Mr Einstein said he was a sort of a ""maverick"", someone who acted quickly much in contrast to Japan's more conservative and deliberate business culture. ""He has made more money than others in Japan but also lost more,"" Mr Einstein said. ""He is seen as visionary and someone not afraid to take risk."" But Mr Son attracted attention in recent weeks over his firm's ties to Saudi Arabia through its Vision Fund.   The investment vehicle focuses on emerging technology and has around $90bn at its disposal.  Saudia Arabia is the fund's major investor and other backers include Apple and Foxconn. The Vision Fund holds investments in WeWork, Slack and Nvidia.  It has also invested in India e-commerce company Flipkart, robotics firm Brain Corp and vertical farming start-up Plenty in California. But global outcry over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last month put Softbank's close relationship with Saudi Arabia in focus. Mr Son was among a string of executives to withdraw from an investment forum in Riyadh last month in the wake of the journalist's disappearance.  He later condemned the murder, but said his company must continue to work with Riyadh.  Mr Einstein did not expect Softbank's links with the Saudi government to affect the performance of its upcoming IPO. Softbank aims to raise 2.4 trillion yen ($21bn) through the share listing.  It will offer 1.6bn shares at a provisional price of 1,500 yen per share, according to reports.  If market demand is strong, it could trigger an ""overallotment"" of 240 billion yen, the reports said. With the additional allotment, the initial public offering could come near to Alibaba's record $25bn IPO in 2014. The funds Softbank secures should fuel its next wave of tech investments.  ""They are going to raise lots of money with this IPO and they are going to invest in all sorts of tech companies all over the world,"" Mr Einstein said. "
risk appetite,Keisha author says she felt shame at her viral story,2024-09-15,2021-10-14,By Kirsty Grant,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-58872982,"When Jade LB was given a laptop for her 13th birthday, she sat in her home in Hackney, north-east London, and began writing a story. Her main character was 17-year-old Keisha, a black girl from inner city London whose life was full of sex, violence and alcoholism. It was 2005 and Jade didn't have internet at home, so at first the story of ""Keisha the Sket"" lay dormant on her laptop's notes page.  A year later, she posted chapters on social media site Piczo. The story - written almost entirely in text speak and London slang - began to gain traction. In lunch breaks at school, pupils with enough credit on their phone would pass chapters on to one another. The story was sent from friendship group to friendship group via BlackBerry messenger, Bluetooth, and MSN, across London and beyond. Before the age of shares, likes, and retweets, Keisha's story had gone viral. The appetite for new chapters of the story was so big, Jade says she even received ""threatening messages"" hurrying her to post the next part. Now, it's a fully formed book, being published by Stormzy's branch of Penguin Random House, Merky Books. Jade's always kept her identity private but for the first time, she's spoken out about what the writing process was like. Jade tells Radio 1 Newsbeat the honest way she wrote about women's sexuality ""went against the grain"". ""It went against what young boys at the time were learning - they were learning that girls aren't sexual."" The story describes Keisha's first sexual encounters in graphic detail. It tells of her inner turmoil at developing a sexual appetite, but not wanting to appear a ""sket"" - a slang word for a promiscuous woman - among boys in her area. Jade says she was writing about ""a world [she] was observing"". But as the story reached more people, Jade became more and more concerned about what's she'd written. ""I really felt shame,"" she says. ""Particularly with guys, I thought 'Oh my god, you know, I've written about sex'. ""[Keisha] is considered promiscuous. I presumed it would [appear to be] a reflection of me, and it would be a lot of work to persuade someone otherwise."" Jade stopped telling anyone that she was the writer, and hoped nobody else would bring it up. But over the past decade, conversation on social media has sporadically turned to the legendary story. And Jade would get messages from friends from time to time to tell her that her character was, yet again, trending on Twitter. She continued to keep a low profile while people online pondered who was behind their favourite nostalgic story.  As Jade got older, she started going to therapy.  There, she explored why she had supressed her link to the story for so long. In the end, she decided she was ready to come back to it.  And she wasn't short of offers. The book has now been published by Merky Books.  It comprises of a reflective author's note, the original script in text speak from 2005, and a rewrite in standard English. Jade says: ""I wanted to leave it raw as it was, because it's a time capsule. It's got nostalgic value."" She hopes publishing both versions of the book will make it ""able to be accessed by way more people"". Reading back some of the scenes made Jade ""really stunned by [by her] apparent savviness"". ""After the gang assault, Keisha effectively goes back to some semblance of normalcy,"" Jade writes in the prologue. ""At the time, I didn't feel very hyper aware of these things."" Jade says the reason she kept the plot line the same is because it draws on real experiences of young black women. ""That's the truth, and that's what happens. Girls that look like me and Keisha bury violations and move on."" Over the past 10 years, Jade has gained two degrees and worked with young women at risk of sexual exploitation.  She currently teaches African politics part-time at a London university. ""I've got a very different understanding of the world of my own girlhood, of girlhood more generally, I've had so many different experiences. ""I thought it was important to retell the story and add some layer and texture. I wrote some things out from under my skin."" Jade says she's an ""advocate"" for telling stories from ""marginalised communities"", something Merky Books prides itself on. She says: ""There is a way in which understanding people and understanding people's stories and where they come from invokes empathy."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

risk appetite,How to look after yourself in hot weather,2024-09-15,2018-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44937692,"Experts are warning that a summer heatwave across Europe could lead to a surge in coronavirus infections. In England, a hot spell has seen beaches on the south coast inundated with visitors. Some say they are desperate to see the sea after months of lockdown and restrictions on travelling abroad. But even if you can enjoy the weather and manage social distancing, you could be vulnerable to heat exhaustion.  You should cool off immediately if you have the following symptoms: headaches, feeling dizzy, loss of appetite, nausea, excessive sweating, cramps, fast breathing and intense thirst. If your body's temperature hits 40C (104F), heat-stroke can set in, which requires urgent medical help. Danger signs include sweat stopping - the person may feel hot, but dry - and breathing difficulties. Heat-stroke can lead to loss of consciousness and serious complications, including permanent damage to vital organs or even death. Those most vulnerable include the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors.  Read more: NHS advice on heat exhaustion  Because our bodies sweat more in hot weather, it is really important to replenish lost water levels. Our physical thirst is not a very reliable indicator of how dehydrated we are (urine colour is better), so you should try to drink plenty before you feel parched.  Try not to drink too much caffeine or alcohol, as they are diuretics that can increase dehydration. Foods with high water content such as strawberries, cucumber, lettuce, celery and melon can also help you stay hydrated.  Try to avoid large, heavy meals laden with carbohydrates and protein because they take more digesting, which in turn produces more body heat. Although it may not be what you fancy on sweaty days, scientific research suggests spicy and hot foods can actually help cool you down. If you're experiencing high temperatures you are not used to, try to keep your activity levels low for the first few days and let your body acclimatise.   If you need to travel around, try to do it when the weather is at its coolest: early or late in the day.  If you chose to exercise in heatwaves, listen to your body - it will be under greater strain than in usual conditions so your usual limits may be different.  If you do intensive exercise, drink lots of water. Isotonic sports drinks can also help ensure you are rehydrating properly.  In general, stay in the shade or in air-conditioned places as much as possible, especially at the hottest part of the day. Cold showers and blotting with damp, cold materials can also work wonders.  Dressing for the weather may sound obvious, but clothes can make a real difference to how our bodies handle heat. Avoid the temptation to strip off, because you may be at greater risk of sunburn, which can affect your body's ability to cool itself.  Wear light colours (dark colours absorb more of the light, converting it into heat) and loose garments that can allow air to get in. Hats with ventilation will help and fabric choice is key - materials like cotton and linen are more breathable, absorbing sweat and encouraging ventilation. At night, fabric is critical again. Lightweight materials for bedding and nightwear can help you keep cool - as can sleeping naked and avoiding sharing space with partners. Putting your sheets in the freezer for a bit before you go to bed can help you stay chilled through hot nights. If you're eco-conscious then you'll want to stay away from air conditioning - which, thanks to the immense amounts of electricity needed to power them, have been linked to greenhouse gas emissions. But in a heatwave, this is easier said than done. However, there are some small, environmentally friendly things you can do to keep yourself cool. Try keeping your face creams and gels in the fridge, so when you apply them to your face they'll feel nice and cool. And while you may want to let the sunlight stream in, leaving your curtains drawn through the day will help to minimise heat in bedrooms - especially if they're light-coloured blackout curtains. Unplugging any unnecessary electrical items will help too. Keeping a damp towel and water spray bottle handy can also help - and for an even cooler fix, fill up a hot water bottle with ice. Fans are also a good, if obvious, alternative to air conditioning - and placing a bowl of ice at an angle in front of your fan can help cool the air even more. Weather conditions can play a large role in the ability of wildfires to spread.  In hot weather, dry vegetation ignite and burn faster, causing fires to grow rapidly.  People should be extra careful discarding items such as matches and cigarettes, and local guidance on plant maintenance and burning waste should be followed. If you see a fire that is unattended or appears out of control, you should contact emergency services immediately. National Geographic recommends learning your evacuation route in advance if you live in a risk area. Clearing a trench around your property and keeping emergency supplies handy is also a good idea. If evacuating, close all windows shut off gas supplies and remove combustibles. Filling vessels like bathtubs and bins with water can also deter fire spread. If you are caught near a fire, stay calm and seek out somewhere like a river to protect yourself.  If this isn't possible, find a spot without vegetation and lie face-down, if possible covered in something damp. A wet cloth over your mouth will help prevent smoke inhalation while breathing."
risk appetite,Hepatitis in children: How many cases are there?,2024-09-15,2022-04-08,By Jim Reed and Philippa Roxby,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61025140,"Health officials are continuing to investigate a sudden surge in cases of hepatitis or liver inflammation among young children in the UK and around the world.   Several possible causes are being looked at, but it looks likely that a common virus which usually causes colds, vomiting and diarrhoea has a role to play. A return to normal social mixing after the pandemic could also be a factor. Hepatitis is the catch-all term to describe inflammation of the liver tissue.  It is often caused by a viral infection - but also by exposure to some chemicals, alcohol, drugs and certain genetic disorders.  The most common forms of hepatitis - known as A to E - are caused by specific viral infections. However, those viruses have not been detected in these cases in children. Scientists are now focusing on one particular adenovirus as the underlying cause but it doesn't usually cause severe hepatitis, so there must be something else going on. A ""signal"" indicating a small but unusual rise in cases in previously healthy young children was first picked up in Scotland. That triggered an investigation by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) which has now looked back at hospital admissions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since January.  It is now looking into at least 163 cases in children under 10, with the majority children younger than five years old. They had initial symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea followed by yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, called jaundice. Of the confirmed cases, 118 live in England, 22 in Scotland, 13 in Wales and 10 in Northern Ireland. Most have a mild form of the condition, although 11 have needed a liver transplant. After the UK started reporting a sharp rise in cases of acute severe hepatitis, although in relatively small numbers, awareness increased in other countries and they also started looking for the same condition in children.  As of 1 May, at least 228 probable cases of hepatitis in 20 countries have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). It says another 50 cases are under investigation. The majority have been detected in Europe, including Ireland and the Netherlands, but some are also in the Americas, the western Pacific and south-east Asia. The death of one child from hepatitis has been reported. Scientists are still investigating if there has been a rise in hepatitis in children or an increase in awareness of these hepatitis cases which would go undetected in a normal year.  But there is no reason to believe the rare liver condition itself is spreading around the world - it's simply being spotted in children in different countries. Scientists are looking at adenovirus which was detected in around three-quarters of the UK children with confirmed hepatitis who were tested. Adenoviruses are usually spread by close personal contact and can cause sickness, diarrhoea and colds. There are more than 50 types. One particular type called F41 is interesting scientists. Genetic analysis has also detected another virus called AAV2 in some samples.  Health officials believe adenovirus is likely to be making a comeback after virtually disappearing during the first year of the pandemic, or it may have developed a different strain. Its impact on young children's immune systems, who have no previous exposure to adenovirus or protection against it, could to be behind the current surge. Lab data in the UK shows that common viruses are now spreading in children, particularly the under-fives, at a higher level than in previous years. UK health officials say the likelihood of your child developing hepatitis is ""extremely low"". They say any children with symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea should stay at home until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped. And making sure children wash their hands thoroughly can help to reduce the spread of lots of common infections. No - none of the children had been vaccinated. Covid vaccines are only available from five years old in the UK, meaning many of the children diagnosed with hepatitis would not have been eligible.  Around 16% of cases were positive for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) when admitted to hospital, but because there was lots of Covid around at the time, health officials say this is not unexpected. UK health officials say they are looking at previous Covid infections in the children affected as well as the possible emergence of a new variant of adenovirus. It says it is continuing to investigate a wide range of other infections and causes. Studies suggest small numbers of babies and children infected with Covid have needed treatment for hepatitis in other countries such as the US as well as Brazil and also India. In most of those cases, the patients recovered quickly and were discharged in days. Parents, GPs and other healthcare workers have been asked to look out for the symptoms of jaundice, a yellow tinge to the skin and other parts of the body, which is most easily seen in the whites of the eyes.  Other symptoms of hepatitis in children include: "
risk appetite,Growing firms: Mend the gap,2024-09-15,2018-09-07,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-45448377,"Time was when government was meant to get out of ""picking winners"" and investing in private companies. It had, for too long, been associated with picking losers, and running into ruinously expensive commitments. That time was when ministers could direct investment decisions and pay policy in state enterprises from steel to shipyards to coal to the electricity providers and telecoms. In Britain, that sort of intervention got a bad name. The Thatcher revolution was all about ""rolling back the frontiers of the state"" to let the market decide. Well, those days are gone now. It's been noticed that other countries have done rather well by investing and by government lending - particularly where it does so in the strategic sectors where it is reckoned that the country has the makings of a comparative advantage over others. The Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB) is being set up by the Scottish government to take a more interventionist role. It's been talked about a lot, and taken a long time to reach the starting gate, though bits of what it does have been done by Scottish Enterprise for some time. A consultation on the SNIB got under way this week. Finance and economy secretary Derek Mackay bigged it up as something with ""the potential to help transform Scotland's economy"".  It will be long-term, patient and mission-oriented. That's a reference, first, to the short-term shortcomings of conventional lending and investing in the financial marketplace, at least in the UK.  Being ""mission-oriented"" sounds like the influence of Mariana Mazzucato, the London-based economist who is an economic adviser to Nicola Sturgeon, who argues strenuously for recognition and enhancement of the role of the state as an investor and shaper of the economy.   I interviewed her earlier this year. Also advising the European Commission on mission orientation, she believes that government should set the big objectives, as President Kennedy did when he set the target of putting a man on the moon by 1970. The missions in mind include ""transitioning to a low carbon economy; responding to an ageing population and wider population health; and promoting inclusive growth through place-making and regeneration"". In the consultation, you're invited to add to that list. ""The Bank will serve businesses who wish to innovate and grow but find the traditional routes to finance challenging,"" said Derek Mackay. ""By providing a single point of access to investment, and adopting a strategic focus and risk appetite that is different, the Bank can fuel the economy and catalyse additional private sector investment."" Business finance in numbers: Source: British Business Bank The Scottish government is committing £2bn over 10 years as initial capital for the SNIB, intended to lever in lots of additional private investment.  And while there may be widespread agreement that this seems a sensible way to go, there are some politically tricky questions - how much should this state bank pay its top executives, and with what bonus structure, if it's going to get financiers of a high calibre? And will all RSIB be constrained by the Scottish government's future policies on pay restraint for the public sector? There are foreign precedents for this. KfW are the initials of something unpronounceable in German. European state aid rules are thrown up by British critics of Brussels, while they have been more imaginatively interpreted by other Europeans. Even in free market America, there is a government bank for supporting small business among other sectors such as housing. And there are a couple close to home. The European Investment Fund has big British contributions, and also big British beneficiaries. At least the latter is going to slow to nothing much, under Brexit plans, though the deal - if there is one - may include a continued contribution from the UK. There is also the British Business Bank, set up in 2014, but little known beyond around a hundred lenders through which it provides its funding wholesale.  Under Conservative ministers, the language of intervention in the market is a lot less prominent, and if there are sectors which are overweight in its lending portfolio, that's not by design but by coincidence.   It has become the largest venture capital investor in the UK. It operates, goes the blurb, where there is clear market need ""crowding in and not crowding out private sector activity"". That's to say: it is not in the same territory where mainstream lenders fund blue chip firms. It is seeking to identify areas where finance is hard to come by, often within the growth path of a growing company. Much of its activity so far has been around ensuring a good supply of funds through these lenders. And 96% of lending is being carried out through channels other than the four big high street banks. Clydesdale is one of those that works alongside the British Business Bank. The emphasis is shifting, towards more effort to stimulate demand for what it can offer. So it's going a bit more retail. On Friday in Glasgow, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were invited to hear what it does and to say what they want from it, alongside Scotland's lenders and fund-managers. Those that don't yet exist are also welcome to take a nosy at what it's all about. It is in the market for loans of as little as £500 from its start-Up fund. That comes with some mentoring advice. The typical loan in that category is for £7500.  In Scotland, 3,334 companies have been supported since that fund began in 2012 (it pre-dated the British Business Bank), totalling £23.3m in loans. Presiding over the Glasgow bit of the roadshow proceedings was Lord Smith of Kelvin, sometimes known as Robert Smith and in his home city.  An accountant and former fund management boss, he has occupied an astonishing number of chairs in Scotland; Weir Group, SSE, Alliance Trust, the Green Investment Bank, the organising committee of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, the commission that bore his name which drew up the plans for devolving greater powers to Holyrood and, for the past year or so, the British Business Bank. I met him ahead of the meeting with SMEs, to hear what he has in mind for this push into lending, where more stimulus is needed.  ""The message is that there is finance available - risk finance, long term finance - available to small and medium-sized companies,"" he told me. ""We're ensuring that's available through a whole range of providers. I want to hear from businesses and from financial advisory people: What are the impediments to help these small businesses get started and grow?"" In Scotland, one of the stronger bits of start-up funding is the ""angel"" community - typically those with a few million available for risk investing in new ideas, who can put in not just their money but their expertise as experienced entrepreneurs.  This is a small enough country that they know each other, and can collaborate all the more easily.  Some 8% of UK angel investors are located in Scotland. Venture Capital funds, however, are hard to find north of the Cheviots. That tends to require a trip to London, or further afield, and it is perceived as a significant gap in the Scottish business growth support network. The British Business Bank has given itself the explicit task of ensuring it gets out to the regions of England more, and creating networks of investing angels is one of the things it wants to do.   While Scotland has policy infrastructure in place, through Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the English regions need more of a helping hand.  So far, the Business Bank is working alongside the Midlands Engine, the Northern Powerhouse and a partnership set up for Cornwall and the Scilly Isles. Patience is one of the virtues the British Business Bank wishes to emphasise more, just as SNIB wants to take a longer-term view than conventional lenders in the market place. So patient capital is being given a boost, with the intention of leveraging as much as £13bn from financial partners.  Get that right, and the hope is that the market for longer-term financing could be stimulated into activity without the need for government help. But that day is some way off. ""When we talk about patient capital,"" explains Lord Smith ""a business goes for a number of years, it then needs more money to grow and become a very big company.  ""What would be great for Scotland and the UK, if these small companies grew and grew and grew, and didn't sell out after a while for want of forward finance."" ""In America, you'll find a third, fourth, fifth, sixth round financing. It's much more common that you'll find in the UK, and we're identifying fund managers in whose funds we'll place some of our money if they're patient capital providers."" The problem he identifies is a familiar one to watchers of the Scottish economy. Make your first three or four million, and it's tempting to get out and buy the yacht. That's one reason why Scotland has yachts, and not many medium-to-large home-grown companies. ""I think it's a mixture of a shortage of that third or fourth round funding, but also a mindset in entrepreneurs, says Lord Smith. ""I'd like to see they can grow their companies bigger and more internationally than they currently do.  ""And yet in Scotland we've got one or two of these unicorns - going from start up to unicorns worth $1bn in a relatively small number of years. I'd like to see more of those, because that's what attracts investment in jobs, and the wealth of the nation."""
risk appetite,Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction',2024-09-15,2019-05-06,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48169783,"On land, in the seas, in the sky, the devastating impact of humans on nature is laid bare in a compelling UN report.  One million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction. Nature everywhere is declining at a speed never previously seen and our need for ever more food and energy are the main drivers. These trends can be halted, the study says, but it will take ""transformative change"" in every aspect of how humans interact with nature. From the bees that pollinate our crops, to the forests that hold back flood waters, the report reveals how humans are ravaging the very ecosystems that support their societies. Three years in the making, this global assessment of nature draws on 15,000 reference materials, and has been compiled by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It runs to 1,800 pages.  The brief, 40-page ""summary for policymakers"", published today at a meeting in Paris, is perhaps the most powerful indictment of how humans have treated their only home. It says that while the Earth has always suffered from the actions of humans through history, over the past 50 years, these scratches have become deep scars. The world's population has doubled since 1970, the global economy has grown four-fold, while international trade has increased 10 times over.  To feed, clothe and give energy to this burgeoning world, forests have been cleared at astonishing rates, especially in tropical areas.  Between 1980 and 2000, 100 million hectares of tropical forest were lost, mainly from cattle ranching in South America and palm oil plantations in South East Asia.  Faring worse than forests are wetlands, with only 13% of those present in 1700 still in existence in the year 2000.  Our cities have expanded rapidly, with urban areas doubling since 1992.  All this human activity is killing species in greater numbers than ever before.  According to the global assessment, an average of around 25% of animals and plants are now threatened.  Global trends in insect populations are not known but rapid declines in some locations have also been well documented.  All this suggests around a million species now face extinction within decades, a rate of destruction tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years.  ""We have documented a really unprecedented decline in biodiversity and nature, this is completely different than anything we've seen in human history in terms of the rate of decline and the scale of the threat,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, from the University of Minnesota and a co-ordinating lead author of the assessment.  ""When we laid it all out together I was just shocked to see how extreme the declines are in terms of species and in terms of the contributions that nature is providing to people."" The assessment also finds that soils are being degraded as never before. This has reduced the productivity of 23% of the land surface of the Earth.  Our insatiable appetites are producing a mountain of waste.  Plastic pollution has increased ten-fold since 1980.  Every year we dump 300-400 million tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes into the waters of the world.  The report's authors say there are a number of direct drivers of which land use change is the primary one.  This essentially means the replacement of grassland with intensive crops, or replacing ancient woodland with a plantation forest, or the clearing of forests to grow crops. This is happening in many parts of the world, especially in the tropics.  Since 1980, more than half of the increase in agriculture has been at the expense of intact forests.  It's a similar story at sea. Only 3% of the world's oceans were described as free from human pressure in 2014.  Fish are being exploited as never before, with 33% of fish stocks harvested at unsustainable levels in 2015. Live coral cover on reefs has nearly halved over the past 150 years.  Pushing all this forward, though, are increased demands for food from a growing global population and specifically our growing appetite for meat and fish. ""Land use now appears as the major driver of the biodiversity collapse, with 70% of agriculture related to meat production,"" said Yann Laurans from IDDRI, the French policy research institute. ""It is time to reconsider the share of industrial meat and dairy in our diet."" The other key factors are the hunting and the direct exploitation of animals, climate change, pollution and invasive species.  The report finds that many of these factors work together to make matters worse. At the report's launch, Kai Chan, a co-ordinating lead author from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said: ""No previous assessment has considered at this scale the simultaneous challenge of protecting nature, maintaining water, feeding the planet, supplying energy, while mitigating climate change... this is the most exhaustive report to have ever done that."" Species extinction risk: Approximately 25% of species are already threatened with extinction in most animal and plant groups studied. Natural ecosystems: Natural ecosystems have declined by 47% on average, relative to their earliest estimated states. Biomass and species abundance: The global biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%. Indicators of vertebrate abundance have declined rapidly since 1970. Nature for indigenous people: 72% of indicators developed by local communities show ongoing deterioration of elements of nature important to them. It all depends on what we do. The authors looked at a number of scenarios for the future, including business-as-usual, but also examining options that were more based on sustainable practices.  In almost all cases, the negative trends for nature will continue to 2050 and beyond.  The only ones that didn't continue towards ecological disaster involved what the scientists term ""transformative change"". The study doesn't tell governments what to do, but gives them some pretty strong hints.  One big idea is to steer the world away from the ""limited paradigm of economic growth"".  They suggest moving away from GDP as a key measure of economic wealth and instead adopting more holistic approaches that would capture quality of life and long-term effects.  They argue that our traditional notion of a ""good quality of life"" has involved increasing consumption on every level. This has to change. Similarly, there must be change when it comes to financial incentives that damage biodiversity.  ""Crucially, governments must end the destructive subsidies, including for fossil fuels and industrial fishing and agriculture,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development.  ""These drive the plundering of the land and ocean at the expense of a clean, healthy and diverse environment on which billions of women, children and men depend now and in the future."" The amount of land and sea that is under protection needs to increase rapidly, with observers saying that a third of our lands need to be preserved.  ""We need to secure half of the planet by 2050 with an interim target of 30% by 2030,"" said Jonathan Baillie, from the National Geographic Society.  ""Then we must restore nature and drive innovation. Only then will we leave future generations a healthy and sustainable planet."" Climate change is a crucial underlying factor that's helping to drive destruction around the world.  Greenhouse gas emissions have doubled since 1980 and temperatures have gone up 0.7C as a result. This is having a big impact on some species, restricting their ranges and making extinction more likely. The global assessment finds that if temperatures go up by 2C, then 5% of species are at risk of climate-driven extinction, rising to 16% if the world warms by 4.3C. ""Of the prioritised list of proximate drivers of biodiversity decline, climate change is only number three,"" said Prof John Spicer from the University of Plymouth. ""Climate change is certainly one of the greatest threats that face humankind in the near future - so what does that tell us about the first and second, changes in land/sea use, and direct exploitation? The current situation is desperate and has been for some time."" The report's authors hope that their assessment becomes as critical to the argument about biodiversity loss as the IPCC report on 1.5C has done to the debate over climate change.  The idea of transformative action is not just confined to governments or local authorities. Individuals can certainly make a difference. ""We know that the way people eat today is often unhealthy for them and for the planet,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, one of the report's authors.  ""We can become healthier as individuals by eating more diverse diets, with more vegetables, and we can also make the planet healthier by growing that food in more sustainable ways."" As well as consumer and lifestyle choices, other authors believe people can make a difference through politics.  ""It might be more important for society to invest more in renewables than coal,"" said Dr Rinku Roy Chowdhury, from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. ""So how do you that? Through individual behaviour, through the polling booth. ""Rather than just conserving energy by turning my lights off, some other less obvious means might be through political action.""

risk appetite,Testing of pupils after TB case found at school,2024-09-15,2023-07-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-66092029,"All pupils and teachers who had contact with a confirmed case of tuberculosis (TB) at a school in Newport will be offered a test. Public Health Wales confirmed a singular TB case at The John Frost School in Newport. It said there is ""nothing to suggest that the case contracted TB at the school"", but attended the premises when they unknowingly had the infection. No outbreak has been declared and investigations are ongoing. James Adamson, from Public Health Wales (PHW) said: ""This is a routine process, and if any other positive TB infections are identified as a result, appropriate treatment will be offered.  ""TB is difficult to transmit. It requires close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual for a person to become infected. ""In this instance, and to limit the potential spread of infection, we are treating all pupils and teachers who may have had contact with the individual as close personal contacts. ""I would stress that the risk of infection with TB to the general public remains very low however, we encourage parents, pupils and staff members to be aware of the symptoms."" The symptoms of active TB include weight loss, night sweats, a fever, tiredness and fatigue, loss of appetite and swellings in the neck, according to PHW. Another can be a persistent cough lasting more than three weeks, usually one that brings up phlegm, which may be bloody."
risk appetite,Saka or Haaland as captain? Fantasy football returns,2024-09-15,2023-08-09,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66393095,"The first Fantasy Premier League deadline of the new season is almost upon us so the time for tinkering with all those drafts is almost over.  Can you fit Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah into the same team without leaving yourself exposed with a weak substitutes' bench? What if you want Trent Alexander-Arnold as well? Is Bruno Fernandes too good to ignore at £8.5m? Should you have three Arsenal players from the start? And who are the best differential picks to try to give you that edge over your mini-league rivals? Those are some of the key questions we've all been wrestling with and I've also been discussing them with Chris Sutton and Statman Dave in the latest episode of our Fantasy 606 podcast which is back on the BBC Sounds app for its fifth season. Fantasy 606 podcast: Deadline day approaching! What records can Haaland break this season? All of us have gone for Haaland and as I write this, none of us have gone for either of the Liverpool men although I find myself wavering on the Salah front. Salah is so tempting because he's such a good captaincy option in gameweek two when Liverpool are at home to Bournemouth, and his stellar FPL history gives him a reassuring reliability that none of the cheaper Liverpool attacking options can match. I can squeeze him in if I go for Brighton's Joao Pedro as my second striker but it leaves me with a budget bench of George Baldock, Marvelous Nakamba and Divin Mubama and it potentially uses up all £100m of my budget when I would like to have £0.5m to spare for transfers in the first few gameweeks. We all own Bukayo Saka who looks like a steal at £8.5m, and Dave and I have both paired him with Gabriel Martinelli for an Arsenal attacking double-up. Dave's also got a Manchester United attacking duo with both Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford, hoping to profit from the first two home games against Wolves and Nottingham Forest. Can Bukayo Saka steer Arsenal to the Premier League title this season? Chris, who always likes to do something a little bit different, has gone for the Tottenham duo of Son Heung-min and Richarlison in his midfield in the expectation Harry Kane will make the move to Bayern Munich.  That may change come deadline time but Chris is convinced Spurs will score plenty of goals under their new boss Ange Postecoglou. So what are the big calls for gameweek one? The obvious answer here is Haaland as Manchester City start the defence of their title away to Burnley on Friday but I'm toying with the idea of giving the armband to Saka for Arsenal's home game against Nottingham Forest.  Haaland's record away from home in the Premier League isn't quite as impressive as at Etihad Stadium and I do expect Arsenal to start the season with a bang. It's always a risk going against Haaland but it would give you an early edge on the rest of the field if it comes off. Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes are both captaincy options for Wolves' visit to Old Trafford and Brighton will be strong favourites to beat Luton at home so if you have a healthy appetite for risk, then take your pick from options such as Kaoru Mitoma, Solly March or Joao Pedro. You always have to consider a run of fixtures at the start of the season when picking your initial squad and I like the look of Arsenal, Brentford, Brighton and Manchester City in particular. An Arsenal defender and two attackers looks like the way to go although Ben White has been overpriced at £5.5m.  Brentford's new goalkeeper Mark Flekken could be one to consider at £4.5m if David Raya moves to Arsenal and Bryan Mbeumo (£6.5m) is understandably a popular pick but we need to hear from Thomas Frank whether he's going to be fit for the opening game against Tottenham. Choosing your other Manchester City assets after Haaland involves the usual game of Pep roulette - I like Phil Foden as the midfield pick although Jack Grealish looks a more certain starter, while Statman Dave has gone for John Stones in his backline who may be able to offer the most attacking threat if he continues to step into midfield as we saw last season. This is the one every manager wants to nail at the start of the season because a lot of FPL teams are going to be so similar but it's so difficult to predict.  I'm just going to chuck a few names out there - Pascal Gross or March from Brighton, Yoane Wissa at Brentford, any of the Liverpool trio of Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota or Cody Gakpo, Kai Havertz in his new role at Arsenal and Statman Dave also mentioned Aston Villa's Moussa Diaby in the podcast.  Saka as captain over Haaland. Alistair Bruce-Ball presents the Fantasy 606 podcast alongside former Premier League winner Chris Sutton and Statman Dave.

risk appetite,Why is the UK rolling out the red carpet for the Saudi Crown Prince?,2024-09-15,2018-03-07,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43235643,"Mohammed bin Salman is just 32 years old. He is Saudi Arabia's crown prince - not its head of state - and he has only been in his post for nine months.  Yet when this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. There'll be lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, and dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge at Clarence House. There will be meetings with the prime minister at Chequers and Downing Street. And garland upon rhetorical garland of praise will be placed at his feet. MBS - as he is known - will be granted this warm welcome not just because he is the de facto leader of his country. But also because Saudi Arabia has had a long alliance with the UK, a relationship that will take on a different shape after Brexit. For now, the relationship is based on deep and close security links. Saudi Arabia shares intelligence which the prime minister says has saved British lives on British streets.  The Saudis are keen on UK cyber expertise to help them tackle the threat from Iran. There is also a close defence relationship with Britain selling - controversially - billions of pounds worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, on which ministers insist tens of thousands of British jobs depend.  But this visit will not just be a case of two allies refreshing their relationship.  The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well.  The UK certainly supports the reforms that this young leader is introducing at an astonishingly fast rate. He is liberalising what has been for many years a deeply conservative country.  Women are being allowed to drive and go to football matches. Cinemas are being opened. There has been a crackdown on corruption with senior figures detained and forced to put billions back into state coffers.  The Crown Prince has pushed back at the clerics who have held such sway for so many years, making the case for a more liberal vision of Islam. He has begun a process - known as the 2030 Vision - to try to make his country's economy less dependent on oil and more broad-based and market-orientated.  All this the British government supports, looking for opportunities for British businesses in the provision of education, entertainment, tourism and healthcare - all areas where officials believe the UK has expertise and a comparative advantage. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia.  In particular, the British are keen to persuade the Saudis to float part of their massive state oil group, Aramco, on the London Stock Exchange.  This would be a hugely lucrative deal that has not surprisingly also attracted the attention of other global financial centres.  Some MPs worry that the UK may water down its corporate governance rules to secure the listing. UK officials do not expect any early decision on this, but they will use the visit to make the case for London. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list.  But amid the diplomatic love that will be showered upon the Crown Prince, there will also be an appetite for reassurance. There are nerves about what some see as a young man in a hurry.  Some are concerned about reforms being forced on a conservative society so quickly that there could be a backlash at home.  Others worry about an anti-corruption drive that has made international investors nervous. Cracking down on graft is one thing, arbitrary detention of businessmen and confiscation of assets is another. The Saudis are keen, analysts say, to show that they are committed to a level regulatory playing field.  British diplomats have also been concerned by what some see as Mohammed bin Salman's impulsive foreign policy, in particular his feud with the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, who recently withdrew his resignation, a month after saying he was quitting in a shock announcement in Saudi Arabia.  Pushing back against Iranian influence in the region may be understandable, but not if it provokes yet more instability. The fear, say analysts, is that the Crown Prince is good at starting things, but less good at de-escalating them and managing risk.  And then, of course, there are the issues on which the two countries have substantial differences.  The British government supports in principle the Saudi-led military campaign to restore the internationally-recognised government in Yemen, and accepts what it sees as Riyadh's legitimate security concerns.  But the UK has worries about the way the Saudis are prosecuting the campaign, particularly the excessive use of force and the thousands upon thousands of civilian deaths.  Thus far, all attempts to bring an end to what has become a proxy conflict with Iran have failed.  The Saudis continue to blame the continuing conflict on the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, but privately the UK is still looking to play a role in finding some kind of political solution.  Britain is also keen to see an end to the standoff between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies. For now, the Saudis appear happy with a status quo that they believe keeps Qatar on the back foot.  The UK is also at odds with the Saudis over the Iran nuclear deal, which Riyadh opposes. If the Saudis push back against Iran too firmly, there are fears that the nuclear deal could be endangered.    And then there is Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Campaigners are concerned about what they see as Saudi Arabia's repressive actions, such as the detention of political activists and its widespread use of corporal and capital punishment. For all the Crown Prince's liberalisations, Saudi Arabia remains an autocratic monarchy which opposes dissent.  Theresa May says she will talk ""frankly and constructively"" about what she calls ""issues of concern including regional security and the conflict and humanitarian situation in Yemen"".  But that will not stop substantial demonstrations taking place throughout this visit. Many campaign groups are planning protests outside Downing Street.  Politicians are expected to join them. Their focal point will be the £4.6bn worth of aircraft, helicopters, drones, grenades, bombs and missiles which the Campaign Against the Arms Trade claims Britain has sold to Saudi Arabia since its bombardment of Yemen began in 2015.  How the British government and the Saudi prince respond to this will be a key test of this visit.  The hope within the British government is that this will not sour an already sensitive visit on which much is at stake.  The Crown Prince wants to reassure global allies about his reforms and project a little Saudi economic leadership. And Britain wants to broaden its economic base after Brexit, and show its allies that it can remain a reliable partner in business and diplomacy. "
risk appetite,New guidance to help flat owners stuck in 'limbo',2024-09-15,2021-03-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56315729,"New guidance has been released aimed at reducing the number of wall safety surveys being requested by banks and building societies on blocks of flats.  Thousands of flat owners have been unable to sell or remortgage because they cannot get the checks done. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said it would help lenders save time when the inspections were not needed.  Most lenders are likely to follow the advice but there is no guarantee. The checks were first developed to assess the potential financial impact of cladding on high-rise flats, after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. But after the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers. Hundreds of thousands of leaseholders have since been asked for EWS1 external wall safety forms when they sell or remortgage. This requires a specialist survey - but there haven't been enough qualified surveyors to do the checks, leaving thousands of owners ""in limbo"", according to the government.  Some owners have also reported being asked for EWS1s when there appears to be little or no flammable materials attached to their building. RICS said its new guidance would clarify types of properties which will, and will not, require additional inspections to speed up mortgage approvals.  It said the guidance was the result of ""painstaking"" consultation with valuers, leaseholders, lenders' fire safety experts and government. ""This announcement is a crucial step in unlocking the market, by ensuring that only those buildings where there are risks of costly remediation as a result of safety concerns from cladding are subject to additional checks,"" said Dame Janet Paraskeva, chair of the RICS Standards & Regulation Board. ""The guidance is anticipated to result in a reduction in the number of EWS1 requests which will therefore allow more focus on the assessments of higher risk buildings, which should speed up the overall process whilst ensuring appropriate protection for lenders and purchasers."" Last year the government tried to solve the backlog by saying that flats in buildings without cladding would no longer need EWS1 checks.  But mortgage lenders refused to recognise the directive.  Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said RICS' new guidance would mean ""nearly 500,000 leaseholders will no longer need an EWS1 form - helping homeowners to sell or re-mortgage more quickly and easily"". He added that the government had paid for an additional 500 surveyors to be trained to carry out EWS1 checks when they are necessary. ""The government has also provided an unprecedented investment of £5bn to protect leaseholders from the costs of cladding remediation,"" he said. In a joint statement, UK Finance and the Building Societies Association, which represent lenders, said that they expected many lenders to follow the guidance ""which should see the number of EWS1 requests fall"".  But they added that it was still a decision ""for each lender to make based on their own risk appetite"". RICS said it would work with the government and other stakeholders to ensure the guidance is implemented by 5 April.  It will also publish advice for buyers and sellers about the risks associated with multi-story, multi occupancy buildings.  NHS worker Holly Ciesielczuk bought 75% of her first-floor flat in Redbridge in March 2019, under shared ownership. But when she tried to borrow more money to increase her share of ownership a year later, she hit a stumbling block. Following their initial survey, her mortgage lender requested an EWS1 form, which can be obtained following an assessment of a building's external walls. The reason Holly was given by her lender was that a balcony on the building had a wooden floor. However, she says her housing association would not agree to an EWS1 because, it said, the building was not high enough to meet the criteria. The lender refused a mortgage without it, as did the next bank she tried. The combination of this and her partner's cancer diagnosis took its toll. ""I properly broke down. If I knew how much stress this was going to cause, I would never have bought my flat,"" she told the BBC. She remains unable to get a new mortgage but holds out hope.  ""Naively or optimistically, I hope the guidance will provide clarity about whether I will be able to get a mortgage,"" Holly says."
risk appetite,Trading three months after Brexit,2024-09-15,2021-03-31,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-56593191,"Duncan Ross is a specialist at growing biodynamic and organic herbs in a walled garden on the Black Isle, overlooking the Cromarty Firth. In the pure Highland air, he could get premium prices in Germany for plants such as arnica. But even before he encountered the paperwork for consignments being sent to the European Union, he stopped the trade - cutting off around a fifth of his business. For a small business, the certification each time a consignment was required wasn't worth his time.  So he didn't have to encounter another obstacle to sending plants - that every product with Great British soil attached to it is simply banned from entering the EU. It was trusted as safe in December, but no longer.  At Glendoick nursery near Perth, Ken Cox supplies planted flowers such as rhododendrons to a gold-plated customer base of display gardens. He says he has lost 30% of sales that used to go to the rest of the EU. Without it, he told BBC Scotland: ""I don't think it's going to be sustainable. ""We've been sending plants to Europe for 30 years. If there are bugs in the soil, they'll have got them a long time ago, so this is really just a bureaucratic thing."" Those rules should apply to Northern Ireland too; nothing with earth attached, no live sheep, no seed potatoes and no minced meat.  However, the anomalies at the Cairnryan to Larne and Belfast crossing are among those rules to which the British government signed up but is now refusing to implement. The grace period for introducing customs checks in the province has been unilaterally extended by Whitehall. The EU is crying foul, and suing under the terms of the Christmas Eve deal. With chief negotiator Lord David Frost now installed as Brexit minister, and telling Brussels to get over its resentment of Brexit, abrasive relations have been getting rawer.  Three months since Britain left the single market and customs union, and Brexit continues to be a headache for exporters and some importers.  On the upside, there are no backlogged queues at ferry ports in Kent. Vast car parks prepared for slowed customs processes have been stood down. Some international companies are choosing to locate bases in Britain, where they previously operated from the EU. Investment in British technology and science is looking healthy, helped by the success of its pharma sector in developing a Covid vaccine. There are other signs of progress, with the UK government making moves towards trade talks in the Pacific. The new Biden administration in Washington sounds more positive about a deal than some in Britain had feared. One legacy trans-Atlantic trade battle over airliners has been paused by the US, EU and UK, giving space to get it resolved. But as the senior UK minister Michael Gove was told in a recent meeting with Scottish engineering firms, ""it's much easier to sell to an existing European customer than to find a new one elsewhere"". The Brexiteer dream of a shift beyond Europe to ""global Britain"" is ringing hollow for those who find it more difficult to sell to the European Union, without seeing new opportunities coming from elsewhere. Many who could sell beyond Europe were already doing so, and Brussels offered little hindrance. Much of the trade in services remains in limbo. Due to Covid, those that require specialist workers to get to clients on the continent have found it difficult, if not impossible, to move people around. That has delayed the onset of problems with work permits.  At the start of the year, the finance sector in London quickly lost the dominance in European share trading to Amsterdam. Rules for other specialist financial services are still being fought over.  The pledge to get a Memorandum of Understanding for the basis of financial trade post-Brexit resulted last week in a technical agreement to set up a forum for further ""dialogue"". The trade in goods remains the focus for a lot of the difficulties.  So far, we only have official figures for export of goods to the EU during January, down by 41% overall.  For food, they were down 63%.  Meat was down 59% and seafood by 83%. That looks catastrophic and Brexit critics seized on it as evidence of the problems they had forecast. But the numbers fail to take account of a return to lockdown on both sides of the English Channel, or to the extensive stockpiling that preceded the end of the Brexit transition period. Future export numbers will be closely watched. Unable to stockpile, seafood was first into the border customs clearance in early January. The industry is working through the difficulties with form-filling for Export Health Certificates, but is still struggling with rules being applied in different and sometimes contradictory ways at different ports and by different customs officials. Larger companies can get their consignments through in single truckloads. That is true of Scottish salmon, but delays mean it cannot guarantee delivery times for early-morning markets. Fish in trucks for longer are worth less. And without guaranteed delivery times, the risk is of EU customers looking elsewhere, to suppliers who can be relied upon.  Smaller-scale fish exporters take a pallet or five at a time, and multiple consignments require multiple certificates.  Just one of them using the wrong page numbering or ink colour can hold up the others.  So prices of shifting pallets have gone up. Some hauliers simply refuse to take produce from Britain back into France, because it's easier to go empty than to get delayed. That is the hauliers' explanation for traffic flows returning close to normal levels. The lorries are often far from full. Three months on, delays to seafood carry a new risk.  With spring, temperatures are rising, and shellfish is at higher risk of going off. Upstream in the fishing industry, Elspeth Macdonald of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, says the Covid impact on demand for fish from restaurants has allied with unpredictability of wholesaler customers getting their produce into the European Union as two parts of a continued slowdown of fishing effort. The other part is that quota negotiations are still going on - the first of their kind between the EU and UK. An overall deal was approved on Christmas Eve, which dismayed the industry by retaining European boats in UK waters for more than five years. That left a lot still to be thrashed out, and that process is taking longer than the industry expected. ""Vessels are working with provisional quota, and there's caution ahead of that negotiation concluding"" says Ms Macdonald. ""Because of prices, logistics and quotas, some boats are taking the opportunity to get repairs."" The red meat exporters have similar problems, though there are fewer smaller companies using ""groupage"" of multiple loads on one truck. One company that does is specialist butcher supplier MacDuff in Lanarkshire.   With an estimate of only around 30% of the usual red meat exports going to European markets, the puzzle for economists is why that hasn't left a glut in the market, and a cut in prices.  To farmers, sheep and cattle prices are looking unusually healthy. The answer seems to be that lockdown has increased the British appetite for home-grown butcher meat, though some slaughter has been delayed, at the risk of animal welfare issues. But it's not all about food. At Scottish Engineering, chief executive Paul Sheerin cannot find any positives that have come out of Brexit, and some of his members feel their plight is being ignored in favour of the food sector.  Engineered goods obviously don't have the same short shelf-life, and trucks carrying them are often passed by those with more urgent need to unload. Scottish engineering firms tend to be smaller and send exports in a few pallets of groupage.  Similar problems to food arise with that. I'm told one truckload from Scotland was delayed for three and a half weeks by problems at EU customs. The price of transporting a pallet into the EU went up about five-fold earlier this year. That has subsided, but prices remain two to three times higher than they were last year. At Terasaki Electric, subsidiary to a Japanese parent firm, 115 workers make components for the energy sector, selling 80% of output for export to the EU and beyond. They located on Clydebank to be near the shipyards. That was 50 years ago, and the company has stayed longer than the yards did. Managing director Vaughan Turner says Brexit has been ""hectic and difficult to manage. We had prepared for Brexit quite well, but when the deal came along, it was different to what we expected.  ""Product standards are the same in the UK as in the EU, so that's a positive point. However since Brexit, the requirements for documentation, procedures for clearing goods, in and out, have changed. That takes longer. That costs more. Freight takes longer, so we have to invest more in inventory."" There are also complex Rules of Origin. A component with materials from outside the EU or UK can carry tariffs, at varying rates, depending how much the materials are altered before being re-exported. So importing an item from Germany, processing it and returning it, can bring a hefty charge on the final leg of that journey. ""Our customers have been quite positive, given that we've been with them for many years,"" says the factory boss.  ""But you can definitely see a sway in sentiment towards procuring in the EU. It's costing our clients more too. It's easier, it's cheaper, and this is a big risk for us. If that sentiment takes hold, potentially some of our clients will require to trade with us in the EU, so some of our activity should shift from here to the EU"". ""I don't see any advantage in Brexit. Our non-EU business has remained the same, and there is nothing coming down the road to support that business."" Brexit remains a work in progress - its effects often masked by the Covid crisis. With more movement of people, and opening up of commerce, the impact of this enormous shift in Britain's economy is likely to become clearer in the coming months."
risk appetite,Australia PM regrets handling of bushfire crisis,2024-09-15,2020-01-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51080567,"Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has expressed regret over his handling of the bushfire crisis ravaging the country.  The PM has faced mounting criticism over his government's response to the bushfires and its climate policy. Since September, bushfires have killed at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of homes. On Sunday, Mr Morrison conceded there were ""things I could have handled on the ground much better"". In recent weeks, Mr Morrison has been heckled by locals when visiting fire-hit communities in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, where the worst blazes are concentrated. In the town of Cobargo in New South Wales, one woman demanded more resources for the fire service, while others called Mr Morrison an ""idiot"" and said ""you won't be getting any votes down here"". ""These are sensitive environments, they are very emotional environments,"" Mr Morrison said in a TV interview with ABC.  ""Prime ministers are flesh and blood too in how they engage with these people."" Acknowledging the pressure fire services were facing, Mr Morrison said there was a ""new appetite"" for the government to take a more direct role in responding to the disaster. The PM said he would seek a royal commission review - a type of public inquiry - into the country's response to the bushfire crisis. Last month, Mr Morrison was criticised for going on holiday to Hawaii as the bushfire crisis worsened. The rising public anger at his absence eventually forced him to cut that trip short. Mr Morrison's government has been accused of not doing enough to address climate change, which experts say could increase the intensity, frequency and scale of bushfires.  But in the interview, the PM defended his government's approach, which he said took into account the effect of climate change on the bushfires. ""We're living in longer, hotter, drier summers,"" the PM said. ""This is obviously affected by the broader changes in climate."" Pressed on his plan to reduce carbon emissions, Mr Morrison insisted his government was on track to ""meet and beat"" its targets. Under the Paris climate agreement, Australia has pledged to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  However, Mr Morrison said a ""global solution"" was needed to tackle climate change. Tens of thousands of people across Australia took part in climate change protests on Friday. In cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, demonstrators turned out to press Mr Morrison's government to make a quick transition away from fossil fuels. Bushfire conditions eased on Saturday, giving firefighters temporary respite in areas where blazes are still raging. But with more hot weather expected next week, the risk was far from over, authorities warned. Authorities have warned that the huge fires, spurred by high temperatures, wind and a three-year-drought, will persist until there is substantial rainfall. More than 123 fires are still burning across New South Wales, with 50 said to be uncontained. According to NSW Rural Fire Service, more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed so far during this fire season. In Victoria, there were 32 bushfire warnings in place as of Saturday. A firefighter died while tackling a blaze in the state on Saturday, bringing the death toll from this season's bushfires to 28."
risk appetite,The appetite for protein bars gives much to chew on,2024-09-15,2022-02-17,By Katherine Latham,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60300079,"From snack bars to shakes, bagels, coffee and even bottled water, food manufacturers are adding protein to an ever-growing list of products. This protein-supplements industry is now worth billions, but does it live up to the hype? And what are the health implications of all this extra protein in our diets? Nicola Graham, a self-proclaimed fitness fanatic, is committed to a high-protein diet. The 38-year-old from London says she notices quicker recovery from exercise when she consumes protein supplements plus diminished appetite. ""This year I'm running the London Marathon, and cycling the coast of Ireland. Achieving 120g of protein a day - necessary for the excessive exercise I do - can only be realistically achieved through protein supplements."" Ms Graham uses the word ""realistically"" there, but she might actually be suggesting palatable or convenient for her, as in order to get 120g of protein you would need to consume 17 large hen's eggs, or 500g of lean beef mince. And she adds that changing her diet has not been without difficulty, experiencing some ""serious stomach upsets"" along the way. ""Now, I look for good quality ingredients,"" she says. ""There is so much rubbish on the market, with added sugars and fillers, they give good supplements a bad name."" Ms Graham is far from alone in increasing protein in her diet. The global market for protein bars alone is due to rise to $7bn (£5.2bn) by 2027, up from $4.7bn in 2019, according to one report. New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. Yet, do most of us, the ones not putting our muscles through endless exercise, actually require more protein than we already consume from our regular meals from foods like chicken, fish or eggs? The British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) doesn't think so. It says that average daily protein intakes in the UK are above the recommended levels for all age groups. Meanwhile, in the US, average protein consumption is reported to be twice the recommended amount. Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist at the BNF, says that while protein is essential, it needs to be part of a balanced diet. And she warns that, for some people, there can be health risks if they eat too much of it. ""Proteins are vitally important - for organs like our brain and heart, the antibodies in our immune system, the haemoglobin that carries oxygen in our blood, and to keep our muscles and bones healthy,"" she says. ""The issue is, when high protein intake disrupts the balance of the diet overall. It is important to consume a variety of foods from each of the main food groups to provide all the nutrients we need for good health. ""And there have been concerns about the potential health effects of very high protein diets. Although risks to health from high protein intakes appear to be unlikely for most people, it can be a concern with some underlying conditions, for example, kidney disease."" The official guidance from the NHS also warns against excessive protein consumption, saying that in addition to worsening existing kidney problems it can increase the risk of osteoporosis - a health condition that weakens bones. Yet, other studies show that protein-rich diets, and particularly those based on plant-based protein, may lower the rate of mortality. Erin Moroney says that sales of her vegan and protein biscuit brand, Nibble, increased fourfold in 2020, as the pandemic made more people focus on eating and living more healthily. She says she came up with the product back in 2017 after discovering she wasn't eating enough protein. ""I was on a mission to qualify for the Boston Marathon,"" says the 48-year-old. ""I found that I wasn't getting anywhere near enough protein for my level of activity. ""In fact, I wasn't getting the minimum required if I hadn't been training at all."" After increasing her protein intake she says that she felt like a new person. ""My energy came back."" Several studies show that protein may be helpful for weight loss, as it can make you feel fuller for long than carbohydrates. Cheshire-based, Liz Boote, is one person who used protein-supplement products to try to lose weight. In her case, she tried shakes make from cow's milk whey. ""We have three children, and I was finding it hard to lose my post-pregnancy weight, so I tried whey-based shakes,"" she says. ""But they were full of added sugar, artificial sweeteners, gums and fillers. ""I worried that they may help me lose weight - but at what cost to my health?"" The issue helped Ms Boote to notice a gap in the market for a different kind of protein shake. So in 2020 she launched Protein Rebel, which is made from plant and insect (crickets) protein. ""There is increasing awareness of the importance of plant-based foods and 'cleaner' ingredients,"" says Ms Boote. ""Crickets need considerably less land, water and feed than the cows used to produce whey - and produce less CO2."" Lee Chambers, 36, of Lancashire, also took protein supplements to help him lose weight. He says that they helped him to lose almost five stones in 18 months. Yet, he cautions that for some people protein supplements become the main thing that they eat. ""I've seen in others how it's become a staple of their diet, rather than the supplement it was intended to be,"" he adds. One study in the US has even warned that protein supplements can become part of an eating disorder pattern in men. Ms Benelam says that if a person wishes to up their protein intake then naturally sourced proteins are best, as they offer additional nutritional benefits.  ""Foods that provide protein are often sources of other nutrients - like omega 3s and iodine from fish, calcium and riboflavin from dairy products, iron and zinc from meat, and thiamine, folate and fibre from pulses,"" she says. ""And most of us are getting enough from our diets already and don't need protein supplements."" Yet millions of people are now taking protein supplements, as the market continues to grow strongly. As Ms Graham prepares for her next run, she says: ""Personally, I think a good quality protein shake is a must for all fitness bunnies."""
risk appetite,'This town got stuck in time but now I love it',2024-09-15,2021-07-24,By Zoe Applegate,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-56744949,"With its golden sands stretching for miles and two piers dating back to the 19th Century, the Norfolk resort of Great Yarmouth was once a mecca for fishermen and holidaymakers. Its fortunes have since waned, with areas of real deprivation. But could the seaside town be bouncing back?  In its fishing industry heyday, boats full of herring would be loaded onto the quayside.  The silver darling, as it was then known, was the town's lifeblood and it was said you could cross the River Yare by walking on the decks of the drifters. Today, work has started on bridging the port in a different way. It is hoped a £120m third river crossing, linking the south of the town and the A47, will relieve pressure on the existing bridges. But this scheme is just one of many big money investments in an area hoping to become the UK's City of Culture in 2025. The title could be very important for the town, where a quarter of neighbourhoods are among the most deprived in England. Earnings, life expectancy, GCSE results and major health measures are all worse than the national average.  One person trying change this is Ruben Cruz. He was 16 when he emigrated from Portugal to join family in Great Yarmouth.  He enrolled on a performing arts course in Norwich but later returned to the seaside town as he liked the community feel. The dancer and curator set up the Reprezent Project social enterprise, which runs arts events and workshops for young people. ""I think these are massive changes,"" the 26-year-old says. ""It is very important to invest in Yarmouth - they have been investing so much, but they have got to do so much. ""It got stuck in time - it used to have the fishing industry - but we need to look at new ways of attracting people. ""It's a place of promise."" He brought Canadian artist Brent Ray Fraser to the town in 2018 for its annual graffiti festival to inspire young people. ""We wanted to bring that guy because we were having issues [with groups of youngsters] outside McDonald's. ""We engaged with them... sometimes you have to take a big step."" Reprezent has painted nine murals across Great Yarmouth, to help give young people pride in their town.  ""We want people to find art. We want to do something amazing for the community that people can enjoy every day. ""Everything I'm doing is to make an example for my three-year-old son... I found myself here and I'm loving it."" At a glance: What is happening in Great Yarmouth? After years working in London and Italy, fashion designer Sophie Miller returned to her home town and later launched the heritage brand Yarmouth Oilskins for its 123-year-old parent company Yarmouth Stores. ""From a designer's point of view, it's like a treasure trove - because we've been in our building for over 100 years we've been so lucky… we have rails of clothes going back 100 years,"" she says. Waxed coats, denim smocks and bucket hats, based on patterns found at its quayside factory and hand-sewn by a 20-strong team, have proved a hit in Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Australia. ""In Asia they have an appetite for all things British and they are passionate about history. ""The workwear trend is really big there."" The label, which produces about 18,000 unisex garments a year, has also just had a New York boutique join its stockists.  She says some people ""talk Yarmouth down"" but she believes the investment is giving people more confidence. ""It's really important and provides a positive message, which gives the ripple effect for businesses. ""It will take a bit more momentum - that's not going to be overnight, but in five years we'll be in good stead,"" she says. Florist Caroline Gummer had been going to Great Yarmouth on holiday for years and decided to relocate there from Kent. After adopting three children she realised her dream and opened a town centre shop - just six months before the first lockdown. ""As a family we went from nought to three children overnight, but I couldn't work a normal job with all the extra bits that come with adoption,"" she says. By last autumn, she was becoming disenchanted by the number of neighbouring empty premises in the Victoria Arcade. ""I was tired of the negative comments - nothing's open, nobody comes down here, there's nothing in Yarmouth,"" she says.  So she asked the landlords if she could advertise shops on social media and have the keys to show potential clients.  It resulted in nine shops opening and the arcade is now almost full again. ""I'm ever so happy it's revitalised. ""This is a dream and one I would never have achieved in Kent due to the prices of shops - it's exactly where I want to be, doing what I want to do, living in a place I love,"" she says. Former town mayoress Sara Smith set up her café perched on the edge of the resort's golden sands and in the shadow of Great Yarmouth's famous Pleasure Beach in 1999.  She gets up at 06:00 through the summer to meet the demand for freshly-baked goods at Sara's Tea Rooms. ""I've never sold a cake in here that I haven't made,"" the 70-year-old says. She launched it with her late husband Tony, a long-serving borough councillor and mayor, and now runs it with her son Matt, 42. The pair have been buoyed this year by the string of investments, in contrast to their feelings last year. ""I spent three months on the verge of a breakdown, of 'are we going to get through this?',"" Matt says.   ""Last season we ran with six tables inside, we would normally have 23 inside - we lost two-fifths of our seats. ""Did we earn a living out of it? Yes. But at the start... it was a time of massive panic."" He says visitor numbers are currently looking good, partly due to the arrival of the big wheel. ""Not everybody wants to ride it, but everybody wants to look at it. ""And I think what they've done with the Marina Centre will be a massive, massive boost... the building felt tired and unloved."" More people are set to holiday at home this summer, but do they think the trend will continue? ""Next year there will be more people going abroad - and we will be competing with that - but we will have done the work, so people will say 'I've been there during Covid times and I'm going to go abroad, but I'm also going to go there,"" Matt says. ""So many people over the years have put Great Yarmouth down, but it is a place to be proud of,"" Sara says. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

risk appetite,Why is Israel-Palestinian violence surging?,2024-09-15,2023-02-28,By Raffi Berg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64757995,"There has been an intensification of violence between Israel and the Palestinians since the start of this year, with deaths mounting on both sides. Here is a brief guide to what is going on. The current violence is mainly taking place in the West Bank and East Jerusalem - areas occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. While the starting point is debatable, it began to escalate in March 2022. In a period of days, Israel was rocked by a series of deadly Palestinian attacks and the Israeli military launched an open-ended operation in the West Bank in response, resulting in near nightly raids into the occupied territories.   There have been many individual injuries and deaths resulting from Israeli military operations and Palestinian attacks over the past year, but what marks this period of violence out is both the scale of the loss of lives and the number of incidents in which multiple people have been killed.  Last year, at least 146 Palestinians - militants, civilians and attackers - were killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank and East Jerusalem - more than any time since UN records began in 2005. Meanwhile, 29 Israelis and two foreign nationals - all but four of whom were civilians - were killed in attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs. This was deadliest year for Israelis since 2015.  Already in the first two months of this year, the death toll - 60 Palestinians and 14 on the Israeli side - has been higher than any similar period in 2022, swelled by some of the bloodiest incidents in years.  In one Israeli military raid in Nablus in February, 11 Palestinians were killed in the ensuing violence, with dozens more injured by bullets, according to the Palestinian health ministry. In another raid and gun-battle in Jenin the previous month,10 Palestinians were killed.  Israelis have also reeled from a spate of particularly deadly attacks: seven civilians were shot dead outside an East Jerusalem synagogue in January, while in another incident in February three were killed in a ramming attack at a bus stop on the outskirts of the city. Many others have been killed and injured on both sides in near-daily incidents, fuelling what is often described as a cycle of violence. Each side blames the other, but there are also longer-term underlying causes.  Palestinian attackers and those who support them say they are fighting Israel and the occupation and avenging Israeli assaults. Some of the attacks have been carried out by ""lone wolves"" - individuals who were not acting on the orders of an organisation. Israel accuses the Palestinian Authority (PA) - the Palestinians' governing body in the West Bank - of inciting such attacks.  Other attacks have been carried out by Palestinian militant groups, including the newly formed Lions' Den, whose popularity on the Palestinian street has surged. Israel says its ongoing operation in the West Bank, called ""Break the Wave"", is targeting militant groups with arrest raids to stop them from launching attacks. The raids, however, are often taking place in densely populated refugee camps and other urban areas, where they meet resistance from gunmen and often turn bloody.   Not in the short-term. Israel says it has to continue its operations to weaken the militant groups and thwart attacks, while Palestinians say the attacks are a response to Israel's actions and overwhelmingly more powerful military. There is also no political peace process which could offer the prospect of a permanent solution, leaving decades-old grievances - the Palestinians' want of a state and Israel's want of security chief among them - festering. The PA - derided and seen as complicit in Israel's military occupation by many Palestinians - shows no appetite to act against militants, a move which would be unpopular among ordinary Palestinians and put its own survival at risk. Israel's new hard-line, right-wing government is also intensifying measures against Palestinian violence, including accelerating demolitions of attackers' homes, allowing for attackers to be deported, and expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank.   The ongoing expansion of Jewish settlements on land Palestinians claim for a future state is seen by them as a root cause of their long conflict with Israel. Settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. A faint flicker of hope lies with US-brokered talks, which brought Israel and the Palestinians face-to-face in the first meeting of its kind for years in Jordan on Sunday in an attempt to de-escalate tensions, with an aim for the two sides to meet again in March."
risk appetite,UK's special forces set for new Russia mission,2024-09-15,2019-06-13,By Mark Urban,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48624982,"The SAS and other UK Special Forces (UKSF) are poised to receive a new mission countering Russian and other forces around the world. The plan is called 'Special Operations Concept' and has been drawn up by the senior officer in charge of the special forces, the Director Special Forces (DSF). According to people familiar with what's in it, part of the concept involves changing both the structure of the military's secretive units and what they do. The plan is currently being considered by military chiefs, Whitehall insiders tell me, and will soon be sent to ministers and is likely to be approved. The Ministry of Defence has said it does not comment on the UK Special Forces. UK Special Forces are meant to provide more options for low-profile actions in places where overtly committing conventional troops would be difficult. For example, under the new plan, an operation might be mounted in a Baltic republic or African country in order to uncover and pinpoint Russian covert activities.  Then a decision would be made as to whether to make public what had been learned, or to cooperate secretly with local security forces in order to disrupt it.  The new missions would take UKSF units in a less ""kinetic"" or violent direction - after almost 20 years of man-hunting strike missions in the Middle East and Afghanistan - and into closer cooperation with allied intelligence agencies and MI6.  ""The counter-terrorist task is drawing down, while the need to confront dangerous international behaviour by peer adversaries is increasing,"" says one source.  Following the defeat of the last pocket of Islamic State group, missions in Syria and Iraq are declining.  And so in staking out new territory, the DSF seems to be trying to give new priorities to the units under their command at a time of financial stringency.  There are three main elements of the UK's Special Forces: the regular Special Air Service regiment (22 SAS), the Special Boat Service (SBS), and Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR).  The role of the SRR, which carries out covert surveillance, would grow under the Special Operations Concept.  Military chiefs believe Russia has been using its military intelligence arm, the GRU, effectively in Ukraine, Syria and Africa.  ""Right now, you do nothing or you escalate,"" one senior officer says.  ""We want to expand that competitive space."" The UK government has said the GRU was behind the 2018 Salisbury attack, in which Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a nerve agent. At a London conference earlier this month, Chief of General Staff General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith referred to ""authoritarian regimes"" rather than mentioning Russia by name, noting they had managed to ""exploit that hybrid space between those two increasingly redundant states of 'peace' and 'war'"".   This type of unstated conflict between states is often referred to as ""the grey zone"".  Recent attacks on tankers in the Gulf are an example of this, with states - believed to be Iran, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates - acting covertly, either directly or through proxies.   Experts across the West are seeking out the right responses to hostile acts that fall short of the threshold of all-out war. Such responses could include an increased emphasis on information and cyber operations.   The SRR is trained in a variety of techniques including physical and technical surveillance, such as planting cameras in insurgent-held territory, eavesdropping and close-proximity hacking.  It remains up for debate whether this new concept would see the stepping up of a shadow war against proxy forces - serving the interests of countries such as China, Iran and Russia - that could occasionally turn violent. British politicians' appetite for risk is limited and the capture of a party of Special Forces operators and MI6 officers in Libya eight years ago showed the potential for embarrassment that comes with such missions.

risk appetite,'I caught Covid twice and worry I'll get it again',2024-09-15,2021-02-15,By Emma Clifford Bell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-56049680,"A Scottish care worker has revealed how she caught Covid twice within seven months. Michelle Lamont, from Ardrossan in North Ayrshire, tested positive for the virus in April 2020. But the 50-year-old was ""stunned"" when routine testing picked up the infection again in November. After becoming ill for a second time, she is now concerned about the possibility of suffering the debilitating symptoms again. Walking her dog along the beach at Saltcoats, Ms Lamont shared her fears with BBC Scotland's The Nine programme. She said: ""I was devastated when I tested positive for the first time,"" she says. ""If I can get it twice, what's to say I can't get it a third time? That plays on my mind."" The first time around, Ms Lamont was exhausted and did not return to work for five weeks. ""It was just horrible. I've never felt so ill in my life,"" she said. ""I had a slight cough and a temperature but the headache was the worst. It was like a migraine, it just didn't go. The palpitations were really hard because it felt like a weight on my chest.  ""It was just a horrible feeling. I had no focus - I couldn't even watch television or listen to music and I had no appetite."" The mother-of-three said she worried more for her family than for herself. She said: ""My oldest daughter, Courtnay, wore PPE and she looked after me. ""I was scared. You're just lying thinking what if I've given this to my family? I've got vulnerable family members as well and I was thinking I'd never forgive myself."" After several months of negative PCR tests and feeling well again, it was ""an absolute shock"" to be told of another positive result.  ""I remember I got tested on a Friday. I felt ok and I had no symptoms at all,"" she said. ""On the Saturday at about 19:00, Public Health Scotland phoned me and said sorry, but you're positive. ""I burst out crying because I thought - I can't go through that again."" Michelle was in the middle of preparing dinner for the family and getting ready for work but had to immediately go back into self-isolation. After several days, Michelle gradually became unwell again.  She said: ""The headache was there and it wouldn't go this time. I had the temperature, the fatigue and the palpitations came back. This time it lasted around 10 days."" She now wants other people to know that it is possible to be re-infected. ""I didn't realise it could happen again and that's with taking all the right precautions. My doctor, she was stunned. People are in denial that it can happen again. They look at you as if you're daft. They don't believe you but yes, it can."" Ms Lamont says she feels lucky to be well again and is looking forward to getting some normality back. She said: ""I just want an end to this, like everyone else. If people follow the rules, I'm very hopeful."" Experts warn some people do catch Covid-19 again - and can infect others. A recent study led by Public Health England (PHE) found that most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months. Past infection was linked to around an 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. However, the new coronavirus has not been around long enough to know a lot about how long immunity lasts. PHE's ongoing study on immunity in healthcare workers found 44 potential re-infections in a group of 6,614 people who had previously had the virus. Researchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. Scientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different. Asked if it was aware of any cases of re-infection, Public Health Scotland said it was looking at possible Covid-19 reinfection and planned to publish a report in due course.  A spokesman added: ""It is too soon to draw any conclusions as to what the findings of this report will be."""
risk appetite,The surprising fate of plastic in old fridges,2024-09-15,2019-11-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50494949,"As a result of Black Friday many old fridges will be replaced. But what happens to your old fridge, which by law must be disposed of by an approved contractor? Dougal Shaw went to the UK's largest fridge recycling plant to find out. It's like a graveyard for fridges.  They are stacked up in columns about six appliances high and this arrangement forms a maze around the industrial site. If you've got rid of an old fridge in the past few years, there's a good chance it's ended up here. The AO Recycling plant in Telford receives 700,000 fridges every year - almost a quarter of the UK's total. The peak season is summer, when fridges tend to fail and get replaced. The other spike is around Black Friday, when many people decide to replace their white goods, if they sniff a deal. The fridges arrive from AO.com's own customers, but also from other retailers and councils. It's been law to dispose of fridges through an approved contractor since 2002 - not least because of the greenhouse gases they contain. Sort then smash Appliances at the plant are first vetted to see if they were retired too early - could they be repaired and resold? If not, their compressor is stripped out. This contains the motor and pump, as well as the refrigerant, the substance which flows around fridges to keep them cool. This needs to be extracted, as it is potentially harmful to the environment.  Then a conveyor belt will tip the fridges into a machine known as Bertha, eight at a time. Bertha is the size of a two-story house and you can't see what goes on inside her. First oxygen is sucked out in a sealed chamber so that further greenhouse gases can be recovered from the fridges' insulation foam. Then the fridges fall into another chamber where huge metal chains, like the kind you see holding ships at the docks, whip the white goods at 500 revolutions per minute. This beating reduces them to shreds of plastic and metal, which machines can then separate. However, this rather crude material does not have great potential for recycling - it can only be used to make a few items, like seed pots for plants, for example. So at the moment the final resting place for old fridges may well be in your garden, or perhaps an allotment. 'The holy grail' The vast majority of new fridges are manufactured from virgin polymer, derived from crude oil, a dwindling natural resource. This is partly because much of the plastic used in fridges needs to be ""food grade"" to meet safety standards - but also, manufacturers don't want to risk the slightest imperfection creeping into their vast production lines, which run on tight profit margins.  Virgin polymers might not be good for the environment, but they are a tried and tested way of getting high quality plastic. ""The holy grail,"" explains John Roberts, founder and CEO of AO.com, ""is to add the material recovered from the old fridges back into the supply chain once again, to make new fridges."" This is why his company has just opened a new factory five minutes' drive from the Telford recycling plant, to see if high quality, food-grade plastic can in fact be recovered from old fridges. The new production line is about half the length of a football pitch. A series of machines tries to whittle down the crude fridge waste to recover just the pure, single polymer, food-grade white plastic they want. Water tanks sift out the denser materials, like metals, which sink. Electrostatic machines can separate the various types of plastic in the mix. An optical machine is also used to sort material by colour - the same kind of machine used in peanut factories for quality testing. What comes out at the end of this process are pellets of white plastic, of high purity. However, they are not yet quite pure enough - each batch is tested and so far the results are in the very high 90s - but not quite 100% food-grade quality plastic. A manufacturer's view If the technique is perfected, is there an appetite to turn fridge recycling into what's known as a circular economy - feeding the old fridge material back into the supply chain? The mood of manufacturers might be changing, according to Hakan Bulgurlu, chief executive of Arçelik, the global white good manufacturers who own fridge brands like Beko and Grundig. His company manufactures more than 18 million new fridges every year. In the past his marketing teams and engineers would tell him that customers want pristine fridges made of virgin polymers, says Bulgurlu. They told him people would dislike the idea of fridges made from recycled materials.  That perception is now reversing, he thinks, as manufacturers realise there is public appetite for white goods that wear their environmental credentials on their sleeves, even if these products cost slightly more. His company tries to use recycled plastic in its production line, he says, but it is a challenge with fridges in particular, because the parts of them which come into contact with food need to be made from food-grade plastic.  By contrast, they have already managed to make a vacuum cleaner that is made of 90% recycled plastic. Beko is investing in bioplastics, made from corn husk, which don't use crude oil and can biodegrade, says Bulgurlu. So far they have made one fridge where 25% of its plastic is sourced this way. The real holy grail, he says, ""is a fridge that you can bury and two years later it has disappeared"". Follow Dougal on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc"
risk appetite,At home with the Pophams as dementia battle goes on,2024-09-15,2021-12-09,Chris McLaughlin,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/59599997,"Alix Popham played for Newport, Leeds, Scarlets and Brive In a house in Newport, three-year-old Darcy Popham plays with her toys in front of the family Christmas tree. Pointing at her dolls' house, she's explaining, with some conviction, why you should never put a table and a bed in the same room. In the room in question, there's a small figure of a bear with a light blue dress on, lying in front of a little table with one arm in the air, apparently in agreement. It seems to make perfect sense to me. ""She's going to big school next year,"" says mum Mel, pulling back her daughter's blonde hair. I suspect both the bears and mum are going to miss her. Dad Alix is never far away. Darcy has his piercing blue eyes, but she won't be following in his footsteps.  ""She's actually a really good football player,"" says the former Wales and Scarlets number eight, with more pride than disappointment. Interior design or football it is, then. Alix, Mel and Darcy Popham are a happy trio.  Yes, they are playing up a little for the TV cameraman, who is doing his best not to step on one of their four pet dogs, but there's no faking what the Pophams have. It's a bond that's been forged, not only in DNA but also in extreme adversity. Just over a year ago, 42-year-old Alix was diagnosed with early-onset dementia. The Pophams have already been open and honest about how their world fell in on them; about how this was not the plan and how they spent weeks in shock and in tears. They invited me to interview them at their home just weeks later - it was as raw and emotional as it gets. Mel even admitted to fainting just hours before we turned up but she was determined that their story should be told.  The story is now well known. Alix and Mel are convinced Alix's condition is the result of years of head knocks sustained on the rugby field and in training. He, and others like him, are taking on the game's governing bodies in a legal fight that could set a precedent about how sport deals with concussion, and compensates those who may now be suffering as a result. Now, more than 150 former players, from journeymen to British and Irish Lions, have joined the fight and a group action is expected to be formally launched this year.  The lawyers will do the hard yards in this particular tussle so Alix is focusing his attention and energy on helping others in a similar position.  Head for Change is a charity set up by Alix and Mel for sportsmen and women who fear they are suffering mentally as a result of concussions. They want it to be seen as a safe space for like-minded people to share, confidentially, what their fears are and hopefully get the help they need. But it is not just former players who are reaching out. ""I've had conversations over the last year with around 20 players who are still involved in the game,"" says Alix. ""They're scared about coming forward and getting tested because they are scared of losing their jobs - that just isn't right."" Others have called him in the depths of despair. ""I've had interventions when people are suicidal and trust me, they are not nice texts to get,"" Alix adds. ""Thankfully we were able to get them the help they needed and things are more positive, but this is a real issue right now."" Talking to Alix and Mel, one year on from the last time, it is clear they have decided to throw themselves fully at this.  The fight with the governing bodies will play out in the courts, potentially over years, but for obvious reasons, for the Pophams, this is a matter of life and death right now. They seem genuinely invigorated by the challenge - like the despair has also delivered them with an opportunity. ""This isn't something we need to focus on when more research comes out - the research is there,"" says Alix. ""One study shows 23% of current players with brain abnormalities - 50% of them are showing a brain that has decreased in size. ""Things need to change as soon as possible."" The tears that Mel could not hold back when she spoke to me last year have been replaced by a torrent of ideas - she is bouncing with enthusiasm and has a huge appetite to make a difference. ""Thinking back to two or three years ago when things were happening to us before the diagnosis, and thinking about how hard that was for both of us, it's really upsetting to think there are others out there going through the same thing - people who aren't aware that help and support is out there. I'm here to say that there absolutely is - do not suffer alone with this,"" she says. Dr Bennet Omalu: Rugby must settle with suing players or risk its future Premier League to trial saliva test to diagnose concussions Concussion in sport: Saliva test is 94% accurate in rugby union trial Alix has already talked about his fears that Darcy will grow up without a dad. He has been candid with me that he might never walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, but is determined to make sure others do not have to feel that pain. He is also encouraged that change is coming, but frustrated that it seems to be taking time. World Rugby has put forward guidelines that would see full contact in training sessions limited to 15 minutes, something Alix and others have been campaigning for. ""There's not much more we can do to make the game safer on a Saturday,"" he says. ""But we can absolutely impact training sessions like the NFL did over a decade - we need to make limited contact in training mandatory."" Calls will be made to see who can be spoken to and contacts will be used to see what avenues can be opened in a bid to get there sooner. Husband and wife drive each other on and it is an impressive dynamic to witness. Change is coming to rugby and right in the eye of the storm, the Pophams are more than playing their part.

""There is nothing to suggest that the person contracted TB at the pub, rather it is thought that they have attended the pub when they unknowingly had the infection,"" a statement said.  Elizabeth Marchant of Public Health Wales said TB was difficult to transmit and requires ""prolonged contact"" with an infectious person, such as living in the same house.  ""I would stress that the risk of infection with TB to the general public remains very low,"" she added. ""The screening being carried out in Tonypandy is a routine part of established infection control procedures, and people invited for screening have been identified as part of the investigations into this case of active TB."" Screening will take place at the pub, and she thanked staff for their help, adding that TB was ""curable with a full course of treatment"". This is not the first outbreak of its kind in recent years.

risk appetite,The truth about baby-led weaning,2024-09-15,2023-07-31,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230728-baby-led-weaning-what-are-the-risks-and-benefits,"Allowing your baby to self-feed is said to help them broaden their palate and control their appetite, but does the evidence back that up – and is it safe? Picture an infant fed her first meal of solid food. If you live in a Western, industrialised country, one image might particularly come to mind: a baby sitting in a high chair, spoon-fed puree by a doting caregiver. But since the early 2000s, growing numbers of parents have been adopting a different approach – one where the child gnaws away on a head of broccoli, corn on the cob or even beef rib, without any caregiver help at all. Often referred to as ""baby-led weaning"" (BLW), this alternative allows children to self-feed, without using utensils, on family foods that are cooked and cut to be safe for infants.  Popularised in 2008 by public health nurse and author Gill Rapley and promulgated by dozens of baby books, nutritionists, and social media accounts, baby-led weaning has seen an increase in parent interest in countries from Brazil to France. ""This is a social media driven invention,"" says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics. Advocates say there are many benefits, from helping children better regulate their appetites to fostering more adventurous eating. But does scientific research bear these findings out? And, perhaps most importantly, is BLW safe? A difficult area of research One challenge in assessing the pros and cons of weaning methods is the lack of high-quality research. For example, a 2022 review by the Committee on Nutrition of the French Society of Pediatrics found that, from 2000 to 2021, there were only 13 studies published on the risks versus benefits of BLW. An additional challenge is that how someone feeds their child generally reflects numerous other characteristics of a family. That means it's hard to know if the outcomes of observational studies are due to the weaning method or something else. Most BLW research has been observational, including 11 of the 13 studies in the French review, meaning it can be hard to unravel other confounding factors that might explain differences. For example, families that pursue BLW tend to breastfeed for longer and have higher levels of education. Even the findings of a randomised controlled study – in which one group of parents is given BLW instructions and a ""control"" group is given traditional feeding advice – must be taken with a grain of salt, the 2022 review warns. ""This is a problem of all studies on nutrition – you cannot randomise,"" says Jean-Pierre Chouraqui, coordinator of the Committee on Nutrition of the French Society of Pediatrics and one of the co-authors of the committee's review. For example, some parents given BLW instructions may find themselves unable or unwilling to follow them. As a result, even the parents who ultimately do adhere to BLW could be different sorts of parents than the control group. It's also difficult for researchers to know if families truly followed these methods for every meal. Confounding matters further, particularly in studies in which parents self-report whether they used BLW or not, is the confusion over what BLW really is. One unpublished survey conducted by the French Association of Ambulatory Pediatrics that was cited in the French Society of Pediatrics' review found that 26% of parents in France said they did BLW with their children. But when questioned, it turned out that just 7% of these parents were following all the BLW tenets: for example, many of them used a spoon or purees at least some of the time. What – if anything – can we conclude from the research that does exist? Baby-led upsides First, there are the benefits for families themselves. Studies have found that families practicing baby-led weaning tend to eat more often together. They also find mealtimes calmer and less stressful. Meanwhile, mothers who do BLW say they feel less pressure and worry around weaning than those who traditionally wean. However, these factors could at least partially result from the types of caregivers who pursue BLW, rather than BLW itself. A parent with a more relaxed approach to mealtimes, and who values having family meals together, might be more likely to do BLW. There are also purported benefits for infants from BLW. Since infants self-feed, proponents say it helps them to learn to listen to their bodies and stop eating when full. This could, theoretically, lead to a lower longer-term risk of conditions like obesity. Some research bears this out. Observational studies have found that BLW infants appeared to have more awareness of when they were full and were less likely to be overweight (although this study relied upon a questionnaire completed by mothers). This difference has been found by other studies to persist into the preschool years, even after variables like socioeconomic status were taken into account. However, one randomised controlled trial of 206 infants in New Zealand found no difference in infant weight or appetite regulation. Another argument is that, by being exposed to more flavours and textures earlier, BLW babies become more adventurous eaters. The New Zealand trial did find this. It tested a ""modified"" version of BLW, in which parents offer one high-iron and one high-energy food at each meal. Parents who did this reported their infants were less fussy and enjoyed food more than the traditionally weaned infants. Another analysis of the same cohort found that, by age two, the modified BLW infants consumed a higher variety of fruit and vegetables than the other babies. However, they were no more likely to eat a larger variety of foods in other groups, like meat and fish. Still, researchers point out that potential benefits of BLW, like early exposure to textures, should also be experienced in traditional weaning. ""We don't recommend doing purees from six to 12 months. Nobody recommends that,"" Corkins says. ""What's recommended is that the purees are only at the very, very, very beginning."" Solid ""morsels"" of food ideally should be offered by eight months, he says. Infants should be eating the same sorts of foods – and be similarly adept with textured and solid foods – by around one year of age, no matter how they were weaned.  Weaning risks One concern, no matter the weaning method, is choking. Babies have some protective reflexes against choking. They include gagging, often mistaken for choking, which is triggered more easily (towards the front of the mouth) the younger they are. The protective reflexes should occur regardless of whether they are consuming a puree or safely cut food. Yet choking remains a real risk. The limited research indicates little risk difference between BLW and other forms of weaning. Another analysis of the New Zealand cohort found that both gagging and choking were common in infants between six and eight months of age – but that incidences of both were equally likely regardless of whether they were fed purees or did BLW. It's important to note that, in that study, parents were given instructions on how to prepare foods to be less risky for choking, and which to avoid completely. A large observational study of 1,151 infants found the same. Another concern is that self-feeding babies may not eat enough, or get enough of the nutrients they need. One observational study found that BLW infants were more likely to be underweight. In contrast, the New Zealand RCT – which told parents to offer high-energy food at each meal – did not. You may also like: Because BLW encourages babies partaking in family meals, infants could end up consuming too much salt or sugar. As a result, caregivers should mindful of how they both prepare and offer food, says Corkins. ""I always have a little bit of a concern, to be honest with you, because we're born with two preferences in our taste buds: we like sweet, and we like salty,"" he says. ""Now, are sweet and salty always good for us? If you put a strawberry on my tray and a piece of broccoli on my tray, which one am I going to put in my mouth? Now the parent has to control this. So maybe what they have to do is just put broccoli on the tray."" What about nutrients? One very small study involving 51 babies found that, while both BLW and traditional-weaning infants generally consume around the same amount of energy, those who fed through BLW had lower intakes of iron, zinc and vitamin B12. However, other research has found that parents who follow strict BLW are more likely to offer iron-rich foods than traditionally weaning families. When the modified version of BLW that emphasised giving iron-rich foods was assessed in the New Zealand studies, there was no difference in infants' iron intake at 12 months, or of measures of iron status in the blood such as haemoglobin levels. Despite these encouraging findings, the differences between BLW and traditional weaning families give nutritionists like Chouraqui pause before recommending BLW to all families. Currently, parents who pursue BLW tend to research the nutritional requirements, he says. But as it becomes more mainstream, that may change, with more infants potentially being exposed to nutritional imbalances. Indeed, this may already be happening: one study found that parents following a ""looser"" version of BLW were four times as likely to give their babies savoury snacks like crisps and crackers compared to those following strict BLW (although, interestingly, they were still less likely to do so than families doing traditional weaning with purees). One approach that could allow parents to incorporate the benefits of BLW, and mitigate the potential risks, may be the ""modified"" form tested in the New Zealand trial. But more research is needed to be confident the findings can be replicated in other cohorts of children and in other countries. ""This methodology could be a perfect way for a safe introduction, but we need more studies to make such a statement,"" says Rosana de Fátima Possobon of the State University of Campinas in Brazil. She co-authored a 2020 review of BLW with her PhD student Melisa Sofia Gomez and other researchers. In the meantime, experts say the type of caregiver behaviour that happens around mealtimes may be just as important as the question of whether or not to pursue BLW. For example,  more responsive feeding and less parent pressure are linked to less fussiness later on – although this does raise the chicken-and-egg question of whether the parent of a picky eater feels obliged to pressure them more. Ultimately, whether they're self-feeding or spoon-fed, infants always should be in control of whether and how much they eat, says Chouraqui. ""This is not baby-led weaning. This is the normal way to do it. The normal way to do it is not to feed them like you feed a goose to make fatty liver,"" he says. ""All paediatricians would say that – never force a baby to eat. ""If a baby does not want to eat, okay – we'll see at the next meal."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,"'Is athletics dying? No, but it needs reviving'",2024-09-15,2022-07-13,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/62063153,"Briton McColgan is set to compete in the 5,000m and 10,000m at the World Athletics Championships, which start on Friday World Athletics Championship Venue: Eugene, Portland, United States Dates: Friday 15 July - Sunday 24 July Coverage: Follow live across the BBC Sport website & app Is athletics a dying sport? Prize money continues to decline. Some meets are held in half-empty stadiums and I feel coverage outside events such as this month's World Championships, the Commonwealth Games and Europeans is scant. Despite the BBC showing each Diamond League event on TV, Red Button or the iPlayer, the season is becoming harder to follow in the media. Events are being removed from those meets to make the schedule more ""snappy"". And long-distance races like mine are being deemed ""too boring"". There's an assumption the public don't have the attention span to watch runners compete for anything longer than four minutes. That's the same public who will happily watch cricket, darts or a Formula 1 race for hours and hours. People love running. You only need to see how many do parkruns every weekend. Thousands upon thousands of potential spectators run 5ks, 10ks, half marathons and marathons yet the vast majority won't really follow the elite end of athletics. But why is that? I can't imagine many Sunday league footballers don't watch the Premier League. Maybe we need to ask those individuals directly why they don't engage with the elite side of a sport they love. I'm wary of pointing out our sport's failings and not offering solutions. That's what I see time and again on social media. But recently I asked on Twitter what we can do to improve things, and was inundated with responses. One of GB's top track athletes sent me a voice note in which he said: ""We are essentially horses. Fans should be able to bet on us."" He is spot on. Maybe we need to give people a reason to be invested in the competition. Sure, it runs the risk of corruption, but just cap the bets so no-one can make or lose a crazy amount. Just enough to make it a bit of fun. Are fire breathers and running through beer tents, like at Night of The 10,000m PBs one solution? Perhaps it's not the events, but how they are showcased? Look at Highgate Harriers' Night of The 10,000m PBs, which has turned UK distance running on the track into a celebration. Just last month, more than 1,000 people crammed on to a tiny, unassuming track in London. There were fire breathers, dancers, magicians and plenty of beer. Spectators could bet and get so involved that they were encroaching on to lane three of the track. The competitors even run through a beer tent! On paper, it sounds like madness but in person, it's a spectacle. As a sport, we need more of this. So why not continue to take pole vault to the streets, and showcase the shot put in the city centre? We could separate events into specific evenings - distance, sprint, throws, jumps. Or we could make meets a day out for families, with fun runs, or junior and masters events. Or could we build more professional teams, backed by the big sporting brands? Just like we've seen in the United States. Folk can follow their favourite teams throughout the season and purchase the kit. Whatever the specific solutions, athletics needs to be marketed better.  Most people are unaware when events are happening outside of major championships. I had one amateur marathon runner tell me on Instagram that he'd love to watch more athletics, but never knows when it's on. We need to be telling the stories of our top athletes all year round. Showcasing all the events they compete in, rather than just once every four years. That's what Formula 1: Drive to Survive has done. Why can't athletics do something like it? What really goes on in the GB squad? How do they react to their contract being cut? How do they deal with injuries? How do they balance becoming a mum and still keeping their identity as an athlete? How does drug testing work? That is stuff that is rarely seen but I believe it's the only way we can engage the next generation of viewers. It doesn't even have to be a full-scale production. The governing bodies could hire a few videographers to follow some of the top athletes and upload weekly videos to social media. It would help people to see the human behind the athlete. Live TV coverage is important, too. If you don't show it, people can't see it. I just don't believe there isn't enough time, or an appetite, for live sport on mainstream channels. BBC Sport showed the British Championships on the Red Button and online - but for me it should be on a main network channel as well. It also needs to be promoted better, be easier to find, and we need the competition timetable, start lists and results. Even as an athletics nut, I struggle to find all that online, so can you imagine how difficult it is for Joe Bloggs? The media play a huge role in all of this. Despite the UK having some of the best female athletes in the world, none are household names. Dina Asher-Smith, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Holly Bradshaw, Laura Muir... their performances should be on the main sports pages and channels. But when athletics is covered prominently, it's usually based in negativity. I'm generally only asked for an interview when something bad has happened - my parents are going through a messy divorce; my house is broken into; I'm viciously trolled online. Last year, I broke Paula Radcliffe's long-standing British 5,000m record, but no-one was interested. Yet a week or so later, journalists were hounding me for a comment on how it felt to be body-shamed online. It's a discussion that comes up frequently among athletes. It's never about performance, unless it's to report a bad one. Why are performances like those of Laura Muir, second left, not celebrated rather than critiqued? I remember joking with Laura Muir when she was fourth in a Diamond League race behind three of the fastest women ever. The times were ridiculous and she had one of the best runs of her career but we knew the reports wouldn't reflect that. We joked about what it would say. 'Muir way off the front' or 'Muir not up to pace'. We burst out laughing when they started to come through because it was something like 'disappointing run and off the podium'. That negative slant becomes seen as the reality but Laura ran a British record so why aren't the reports positive? If they were, we might inspire youngsters to get into athletics. And there is no better time for the sport to do that. This summer sees not one, not two, but three major championships take place. All of which will be televised live on the BBC and in which we have genuine medal contenders. We already have some spectacular road races in the UK. Prestigious ones that are bucket-list worthy. The London Marathon. The Great North Run. People sign up in their droves to get a spot on those start lines. And during the pandemic, we had more newbie runners than ever before. How do we tap in to that potential market? How do we connect the dots? Athletics is a global sport with so much potential. Every nation is represented. Everyone can see someone like them competing. From the hammer throw to the marathon, there's an event for everyone no matter what size or shape you are. How many sports can say that? We need to start showcasing our amazing and unique sport. Reporting the good stories, celebrating the achievements and properly presenting just how incredible our sport is to the world. Because athletics ain't dead.

risk appetite,'Hamilton v Verstappen lives up to billing',2024-09-15,2019-08-04,Andrew Benson,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/49229575,"Lewis Hamilton now has seven victories at the Hungaroring Formula 1 has been waiting for a full-on battle between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen for years now. The Hungarian Grand Prix finally delivered it, and what a treat it was. Verstappen in a slower Red Bull holding off Hamilton in a faster Mercedes, their teams fighting a strategic battle as much as the drivers were scrapping on track - it produced a race that not only thrilled in the moment, but whet the appetite for what might be to come when F1 resumes after the four-week summer break in Belgium on 1 September. Even Hamilton was excited by the battle - which became a reality as soon as the world champion had passed team-mate Valtteri Bottas by Turn Three on the first lap and settled in behind Verstappen. ""As soon as I got into second,"" Hamilton said, ""I was like: 'OK, this whole battle we've been talking about me and Max having we are going to have that today.' And it was really awesome."" As they slugged it out at the front, the two men were in a separate race from anyone else, Hamilton more than a minute ahead of the Ferrari of third-placed Sebastian Vettel by the end of the grand prix. Hamilton always looked quicker, but track position is so important at the Hungaroring, a tight and twisty track in a dusty amphitheatre about 12 miles outside Budapest. Throughout, Hamilton rarely gave Verstappen any breathing space, and the Dutchman defended with maturity and skill. Never more than about two seconds behind, Hamilton ramped up the pressure on Verstappen as the window for him to make a pit stop and rejoin ahead of the Ferraris, then led by Charles Leclerc, approached. Hamilton closed a 20-second deficit in less than 20 laps to pass Verstappen for the lead That forced Red Bull to stop Verstappen as early as they could - to protect against Hamilton stopping first and jumping the Dutchman that way. That early pit stop meant Mercedes could run Hamilton longer, to give him fresher tyres for their fight in the second stint, which at that time was planned to be to the end of the race. After that first stop, Hamilton was all over Verstappen. But after one breathtaking overtaking attempt around the outside of the super-fast Turn Four just failed to come off, he and Mercedes began to doubt he would be able to pass. That was on lap 39, and immediately afterwards the Mercedes strategists began to consider the idea of a second stop. It would lose them 20 seconds, but the idea was that Hamilton would come back at Verstappen like a rocket. They analysed and discussed it for seven laps and then took the plunge, switching from the hard to the medium tyres for the final 22 laps, in which Hamilton would have to make up 20 seconds and pass arguably the most aggressive and uncompromising driver in the sport. It was an unusually bold and aggressive strategy from a team that can tend towards the cautious - and impressively so just a week after they came in for criticism for questionable strategy in the rain at Hockenheim, the team and Hamilton's worst race for years. Hamilton was far from sure it was the right idea. Wolff said: ""I'm happy for the strategy group as in Germany we came under fire for the strategy calls."" ""I definitely was not thinking: 'Genius,' he said. ""Was I thinking: 'Worth a try?' I have a different viewpoint in the car. I came out [from the first pit stop] with six- or seven-lap fresher tyres and at the time I was much quicker and I was like: 'OK, I just have to keep the pressure on.' ""But then they told me we were going two-stop and I couldn't compute how it would work. ""I thought I could make the hards go to the end, so I knew he would be able to do the same. I thought pitting was going to be difficult and I hadn't even had the chance to be thinking what tyre. ""They put me on the medium and it didn't feel great initially and then he started matching my times."" Over the radio, the doubt in Hamilton's mind at the wisdom of the strategy was clear. He needed to close at a second a lap, but after cutting the gap to 16 seconds, Verstappen started doing the same lap times. Hamilton was cooling his brakes, which were on the limit, but once they were back in the right temperature window, he cut loose. ""I was thinking: 'Jeez, this is really risky,'"" Hamilton said. ""In the end you have to just go: 'Go for it, give it everything. Just don't worry if you don't catch him. Just concentrate on putting perfect laps.'"" It was what Mercedes and Hamilton call ""hammer time"". From 15.4 seconds, the gap came down to nothing in 10 laps. ""I saw his times rising and I was like: 'I am going to catch him and as soon as I catch him I am going by, no messing around.' ""And it was such a relief when I got by because it's your dream."" The drive and the win clearly made as big an impression on Hamilton as they did on those watching. ""It feels like a first [win],"" he said. ""I don't know how. I've been doing this a long time - but it feels like one of the first."" Hamilton overtakes Verstappen for late Hungary win Listen: ""Hats off to the strategists, hats off to Lewis Hamilton"" What happened to the woman who beat Hamilton in go-karts? Hamilton may have won in Hungary but fans voted Verstappen driver of the day According to Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff, Hamilton's driving was ""in a different dimension"". In reality, there were two men in that dimension. Verstappen was hugely impressive, too. His pole position on Saturday was stunning, and he lost out to a faster car, driven by a great driver at the top of his game, and a bold strategy to which Red Bull could not respond. ""We were just not fast enough,"" Verstappen said. ""I tried everything I could on that hard tyre to stay alive. Still, second, fastest lap, a good weekend overall. Congrats to Lewis, he was pushing me really hard. I like that. We were just lacking a bit of grip. We tried a one-stop, they had the opportunity for two and that worked out well."" Hamilton praised Verstappen for the way he had conducted himself in the heat of their battle.  ""Strong competitor and great driver at his best,"" Hamilton said. ""It's awesome to see the respect between us, really respectful driving and I hope to continue that. ""He put the car in some good places. I gave him space and more. If we were on the same (championship) points he may have been a lot more aggressive but there was no need for that. It was just making sure when I do finally pull off an overtaking manoeuvre it was a full sweep by."" The respect went both ways. Afterwards, in the news conference, there was a fascinating exchange between the two men when they were asked to give themselves scores out of 10 for the first half of the season. Verstappen took fastest lap and an extra bonus point which takes him to within seven points of second-placed Bottas in the championship standings After Vettel had given himself a five, saying he was ""not happy with the first half - I can do a better job"" - Hamilton gave himself an ""8.9/8.8 - if it wasn't for the last race (in Germany) it would be a little higher. ""It has been the best start of the season we've ever had and one of the best starts I've ever had but there are areas I can continue to work on. That's the great thing about this sport, you can always improve."" Verstappen refused to give himself a number, saying: ""I hate putting a number on it because it reminds me of school which is not that long ago. I am always quite critical, it can always be better. I am never satisfied. It has a been very positive and I've had good results."" So Hamilton did it for him, pointing to the two wins Verstappen had in the three races immediately preceding Hungary. ""Last few races it's high nines,"" Hamilton said of Verstappen. ""I don't remember all the races. But he drove exceptionally and if he continues like that it will be high nines."" Finally, the quality of their race was summed up by their former rival Fernando Alonso, the two-time champion, who retired at the end of last season, watching the race at home.  ""Bravo Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen,"" Alonso wrote on Twitter. ""Pushing 70 laps to the maximum. More than one minute to the third, nearly + one lap and a half to the top five. Both Impressive. Thanks for the show."" Bottas was taken out of contention by a touch with team-mate Hamilton early in the race While Hamilton goes into the summer break with his championship lead extended and a sixth title set to be sealed long before the end of the season, his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas faces a far less comfortable month. He is out of contract this year and Wolff is going to spend the summer break deciding whether to keep Bottas, or replace him with reserve driver Esteban Ocon. So it was a bad time for Bottas to have a race like this. Second out of the first corner, he was fourth by the time he was heading into Turn Four on the first lap, and with a broken front wing, after locking his wheels into both the first two corners, being passed by Hamilton, lightly touching his team-mate and then being overtaken by Leclerc, who broke the Mercedes' front wing in the process. That led to a difficult afternoon fighting back and an eventual eighth place finish. Wolff said: ""I am so sad for him. He was so pumped since yesterday, his qualifying performance was brilliant and he was in the right frame of mind before the race.  ""And then the unfortunate incident in flat-spotting the tyre, touching with Lewis, touching with Leclerc and then suddenly within half a lap all the work is gone and that is just awful for him and I am sorry for him."" Wolff said Bottas' future will not turn on this one performance.  ""We will not be letting one race result influence our decision,"" he said. ""It is more about compounding all data and then making a decision on stability and great personality and a very good driver versus giving youth a chance with all the reward and risk it can bring and we haven't done that yet.  ""We will start the process tomorrow and it will not be an easy one."" Verstappen's father Jos finished on the podium at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 1994 for Benetton, 25 years before his son. Michael Schumacher won that day Changing of the guard? Not yet, according to Hamilton, who took his 81st career win The Verstappen fans packed the grandstands in their thousands at the Hungaroring Formula 1"
risk appetite,Ferrari 'living in denial' over budgets,2024-09-15,2020-04-23,Andrew Benson,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/52401894,"McLaren have been lobbying for lower budgets in F1, which Ferrari oppose McLaren say Ferrari are ""living in denial"" over their opposition to plans to lower Formula 1's budget cap. McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown rejected claims by Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto that F1 should not ""react in a hurry"" to the coronavirus crisis. ""I'm almost at a loss as to what to say to that,"" Brown said. ""We are going through the biggest crisis the world has seen. You have countries and industries shut down."" He added: ""To not hurry to address what is going on is a critical mistake."" F1 discusses Austria season start & two races at Silverstone F1 bosses are in the middle of intense negotiations over the level at which to set the spending restriction for teams when it comes into force in 2021. A cap of $175m (£137.9m) was agreed last October and is in the rules, but teams have already agreed informally to lower that figure to $150m in 2021 and are now debating whether to reduce it further. McLaren say they would be happy with a cap of $100m, pointing out that there are a number of major exemptions to the cap, such as driver and top executive salaries and engine costs that push it many millions higher. But Ferrari have so far opposed any move to go lower, claiming it would dumb the sport down and cause it to lay off too many staff, which is especially complicated for them because of Italian employment law. Ferrari have, though, sought to clarify comments from Binotto, in an interview with the Guardian,, external saying they had been misinterpreted and emphasising that he was not threatening to pull the team out of F1 if a lower cap was imposed. ""He never mentioned Scuderia Ferrari quitting F1,"" Ferrari said. ""On the contrary, he said that we would not want to be put in a position of having to look at further options, besides continuing racing in F1, for deploying our racing DNA, in case the budget cap would be even more drastically reduced, putting at risk hundreds of workplaces."" Brown says F1 could be at risk if it ""goes by its old habits"" Brown said that claiming F1 could take its time over the talks was ""a very poor leadership strategy"". And he repeated warnings made in a BBC Sport interview earlier this month that the sport was threatened by the coronavirus pandemic. ""If F1 goes by its old habits we are all at extreme risk for the future of F1,"" he said. ""But if we think forward and get with the times, we cannot only survive what's going on right now but the sport can thrive and we all win. ""I am all for a good healthy debate, but the comments I've seen being put forward don't stack up, contradict themselves and don't accurately reflect what I think is reality."" Brown rejected Binotto's arguments that F1 would be devalued with a lower budget cap, saying $100m or $125m with all the exemptions was still ""a tremendous amount of money"" and would more than allow it to remain the technological pinnacle of motorsport. F1 has been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus crisis, with eight of the first nine races postponed - with the Monaco Grand Prix cancelled -and has made a series of cost-cutting moves to try to put itself in a strengthened position. The lack of grands prix is a significant threat to the sport and its teams because race-hosting fees and television broadcast rights are its two biggest income streams. Brown's comments come against the backdrop of two significant financial developments from the sport's owner, the US group Liberty Media. It announced on Thursday that it had taken a series of complex measures that have given F1 much greater liquidity to ride out the difficult economic conditions, including paying the F1 Group $1.4bn., external Liberty president and chief executive officer Greg Maffei added that some teams had been given advances on their prize money payments. ""We want to make sure that teams are solvent because they are part of what we need to race successfully in 2020, 2021, and beyond,"" Maffei said. Brown said McLaren were not one of the teams to receive an advance, but added: ""It only demonstrates the dire need the sport finds itself in. I'm glad they have stepped in and helped teams; anyone who is borrowing money is buying some time."" Lewis Hamilton could end up with eight career wins at Silverstone by the end of the 2020 season F1 is trying to work out how it can start the season and plans centre on two races in Austria on consecutive weekends at the start of July followed by two at Silverstone, then a handful more European races before heading off around the world. The season would start with races behind closed doors. Brown said: ""Sport has always been a great healer and I think the appetite for F1, closed doors or not, and sport in general will be awesome. ""But if we end up having no F1 this year, the financial consequences for F1 and the teams would be devastating, just as it would be for any industry shut down for a year and then we would need an additional rethink or solution. ""Your guess is as good as mine as to are we going to go racing.  ""The plan Chase [Carey, F1's chairman] has shared with us is a work in progress but it seems a very sensible plan.  ""Going racing without spectators, certainly in the short term, is realistic. If we thought we were going to go to Austria or the British Grand Prix with 100,000 people that would be naive. He has been speaking with the various governments, so I am pretty optimistic. ""The prize fund that is shared between the teams is about $1bn. That is a massive amount of money that we are all depending on and if it went away or was drastically reduced, we would all have to find solutions to the lack of resources."" Formula 1"
risk appetite,The millions of 'missing' babies after 2008 crash,2024-09-15,2018-09-13,By Kim Gittleson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45478670," In 2008, I was one of the 1.5 million students who graduated from university in the US. And, like everyone else, I was caught off guard. Whatever we expected then, the reality today is that as a generation, we have more debt, fewer children and quite a few scars.  A decade on, there has been quite a bit of handwringing about what's changed since the financial crisis. And I'm convinced that the biggest fallout isn't the increased regulation, or the jailed bankers (or lack thereof), but the impact it had on those of us who were just entering the workforce in 2008. To find out more, I've travelled around the country asking experts and fellow 2008 graduates - what happened to us? In the decade since the recession, American women had 4.8 million fewer babies than demographers were expecting. No, that isn't a typo.  ""Every year when I look at the fertility data I expect the number of births to go up and it hasn't,"" says University of New Hampshire Professor Kenneth Johnson. Prof Johnson says part of the fertility decline is attributable to women in their early and late 20s having fewer children than expected - in other words, my classmates and those who came after us. And it's not getting better. The gap is getting wider - which is why he brings up a historical parallel. ""There were a group of women who were in their early 20s at the beginning of the Great Depression who never made up for the births that they didn't have. ""More of them are childless than any group of American women before or since."" The question, says Prof Johnson, is if we too will simply forego births like the women of the Depression or if we're simply just waiting longer. Nora Carroll graduated from the University of Nevada Las Vegas in 2008 and says she delayed starting a family due to the crash. ""I spent the last decade really concentrating on getting a stable career, saving enough money so I can purchase a house,"" she says. ""All of that just takes time [especially because] being in a lower paying job [it] takes a little bit longer."" She is now expecting her first child. In the UK, research commissioned by the BBC found that people who are 30-39 years old now were worst affected by the financial crisis - losing on average 7.2% in real terms, or £2,057 ($2,684) a year between 2008 and 2017. That's pretty similar to what happened in the US.  Americans born in the mid-1980s have accumulated 34% less wealth than predicted based on previous generations, the St Louis Federal Reserve found. One reason? We started out with less. The average salary of a newly-minted college graduate in 2008 was $46,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was 8% less, adjusted for inflation, than college graduates aged 25 to 34 earned in 2002. Just two out of five millennials are invested in the stock market.  And even those of us who do invest have ventured only about $7,000, according to the Federal Reserve. That's not simply because we're money-strapped. ""Investors' willingness to bear financial risk depends on personal experiences of macroeconomic history"", economists at the University of California-Berkeley have found. In other words, if you are a young person who, say, watched the Dow Jones plummet over 500 points in one day - your appetite for risk is slim. So even though the S&P 500 officially entered the longest bull market in history this summer - rising over 325% since the depths of the financial crisis - well, we haven't really benefited from all those stock market gains. The homeownership rate of millennials between the ages of 25 and 34 was 37% in 2015 - 8% lower than that of prior generations, according to the Urban Institute. In the UK, the home-ownership rate for millennials has nearly halved. There are plenty of explanations - not least fewer children, less wealth and coming of age after the housing market imploded. When we do manage to buy property, it's worth a lot less than the average first-homes of prior generations.  The average median home value for someone aged 18-33 in 2013 was $133,000 compared to $197,000 for the same age group in 2007. Trust in institutions was on the decline well before the financial crisis, but as a generation, our faith is especially low. Just 19% of millennials agree with the statement that ""generally speaking, most people can be trusted"" - compared to 31% for the generation before us, and 40% for our parents' generation, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.  And, no surprise here, when it comes to institutions, we trust Wall Street least of all. ""Wall Street certainly took a hit,"" says Eric Fraser, who graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2008 and took what he thought was an innocuous job in the financial services industry. ""At that time it didn't seem villainous until these names and faces started hitting the news."" That caused him to re-think what it was like to work in the industry. ""I had a bit of hesitation to explain, 'yes I do work in financial services but no I'm not a subprime mortgage lender or anything like that.'"" Today, he says there is one silver lining to having had a front row seat to that dissolution in trust. ""I think entering the workforce around that time really gave me a sense of humility and I don't know if I would have had that same mindset if I had graduated earlier."""
risk appetite,"Lab-grown chicken safe to eat, say US regulators",2024-09-15,2022-11-17,By Shiona McCallum,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63660488,"A meat product grown in a lab has been cleared for human consumption for the first time. The US safety agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has given approval for cell-cultured chicken, after doing a ""careful evaluation"". It has been made in steel tanks by the firm Upside Foods, using cells harvested from live animals. It will be able to be sold to consumers after an inspection by the US Department of Agriculture.  The FDA said it used data and information provided by the company to reach its decision, and had ""no further questions at this time"". The firm's founder and chief executive Uma Valeti said: ""We started Upside amid a world full of sceptics, and today, we've made history again as the first company to receive a 'No Questions Letter' from the FDA for cultivated meat.""  Upside Foods will have a number of hurdles to clear before it can sell its products - for example, the facility where the product is made will need formal approval - but Mr Valeti called the news ""a watershed moment in the history of food"". Several start-up food companies have been trying to develop similar products, which could lead to big savings in carbon emissions and water, as well as freeing up land for nature. Scientists say pressures on the planet could fall by more than 80% with such foods, compared with the typical European diet. Cultured meat products are forecast to take a larger slice of the total meat market in the future. The start-up Eat Just, a competitor of Upside Foods, was the first to receive approval to make artificial ""clean meat"", in Singapore in 2020. Its nuggets are made from animal muscle cells in a lab. Two of the largest companies in the sector are Israel-based Future Meat Technologies and Impossible Foods, whose plant-based Impossible Burger was launched in 2016 and grew in popularity. As a result, the company launched a partnership with Burger King and now Impossible Whoppers are on the menus of most of its outlets in the US.  The Upside Foods FDA approval has been described as a ""major milestone"" in the industry by Ernst van Orsouw, chief executive of Roslin Technologies - a Scottish-based food tech company. ""It is very exciting to see a globally leading regulator now come to the same conclusion that cultivated meat is safe to eat,"" he said.  ""The FDA has been taking a risk-based, science-based and practical approach to regulating this novel food, which can be an excellent guide for other jurisdictions as well."" He said this step ""will spur further investment and innovation"" in the cultured food industry."

The WHO is recommending that travellers to the state and its capital, Sao Paulo, get a yellow fever vaccine before visiting. The warning comes after a significant rise in numbers of suspected and confirmed cases was reported. Local officials say travellers will not be at risk if they stay in cities. Brazilian Health Minister Antonio Nardi said the WHO advice stemmed from ""an excess of concern"". Source: WHO He said that while there had been an increase in the number of reported cases it did not constitute an ""outbreak"". He also said that most people attending Brazil's famous carnival celebrations in February should be safe as they are held in large cities and not the rural and forested areas which have seen the biggest increase in yellow fever cases. However, the WHO's advice is for all travellers to the state to get a vaccination at least 10 days prior to travel and to take measures to avoid mosquito bites. Brazilian health authorities said that since July 2017, 35 cases of yellow fever had been confirmed. Of those, 20 cases proved fatal. Sao Paulo has been the worst-affected state, with 20 confirmed cases.  Mr Nardi said Sao Paulo state authorities would speed up their vaccination campaign with the aim of vaccinating half of the state's population by the end of February.

Medical experts were so sure Anthony Seery would die, his wife Joyce was twice told she could visit him in hospital to say goodbye. But the 58-year-old recovered and is now home in Billingham, Co Durham. He praised NHS staff and sent them knitted dolls and 15 bottles of Prosecco as a thank you. Mr Seery collapsed at home one evening in April and was rushed into the University Hospital of  North Tees in Stockton with dangerously low oxygen levels. The following morning, Mrs Seery was called by doctors who said her husband was ""not going to make it"". ""It was horrendous,"" she said, adding: ""I was pacing up and down waiting for the phone to ring again, but also not wanting it to ring as I didn't want to hear what they might have to say."" Before she could get to hospital, his low oxygen levels started to improve and he was getting better. But several days later she got another call saying ""he is going"" and would she want to go to the hospital and, while wearing protective equipment, hold his hand. ""Straight away I said yes and they said they would call me back with more information, but they never did,"" Mrs Seery said. ""I didn't know it but he was picking up then. I was just clock-watching wondering if he was still here."" After three weeks, Mr Seery was squeezing doctors' hands and soon he was awake again.

risk appetite,Driving aid into a European warzone,2024-09-15,2017-10-08,By John Arkless,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-41516662,"On one trip, Irene John saw a mass grave - each person was clutching X-rays to their chest. They had been told they were being moved from one hospital to another and had to bring their medical records. Instead, they were taken out into the street and shot. In another village the streets were lined with crosses - people had been crucified. It was a horrendous time, but one Welsh woman risked her safety on 43 occasions in order to help others. Croatia today is a popular and beautiful tourist destination, but it was only 26 years ago, on 8 October 1991, when it declared its independence from the crumbling conglomerate state of Yugoslavia. It took another four years - and a bloody war - before they were able to fully establish themselves as a nation away from Serbian rule.  The conflict was deadly and damaging. More than 20,000 people were killed and 10 times that number were displaced from their homes.  Thankfully, Croatia has now recovered and is thriving, helped in part by the efforts of ordinary people who gave their time and effort to take aid to people struggling during the war.  One such person was Miss John from Penylan in Cardiff, whose story began in 1993 when a friend paid her a visit one evening.  ""I hadn't seen him for a long time and in he came and said 'I've come to tell you what I've been doing: I've been on a convoy to Croatia',"" said Miss John, now 76. Her reply? ""Where's Croatia?"" Miss John, after listening to her friend, decided she wanted to help. All she needed was the small matter of a van, a co-driver, medicine and food as well as £500 for the journey.  Determined to go, she quickly raised the £500 with the help of the Townswomen's Guild, who also provided her with food and medicine. The Post Office lent her a van. By September 1993, she was joining the Convoy of Hope en route to the Balkans, but it was tough going: ""They were very good at organising things but after I came home from the second time a friend of mine said 'you look dreadful'. That was when I thought I could organise this better myself.  ""We didn't have any true sleep because we slept on tins of beans in the vans. I thought 'people are coming on this convoy, they're raising the money, they're filling the vehicles, they deserve to sleep in a bed each night'."" Wanting to take control of the situation, she set up and registered the charity Care Cymru and began planning and leading convoys across the continent herself.  Miss John was responsible for negotiating the borders on the three-day drive, which proved particularly difficult in Slovenia, another former Yugoslavian republic.  ""Slovenia was unhappy about a lot of aid going through because they were also experiencing some of the war situation. Sometimes they'd keep you waiting for six or seven hours not allowed to go through and I thought: 'I've got to do something about this.' ""Every time you went into customs or the police they always had football on. I couldn't believe it so I decided I better know a bit about football and tell them about Manchester United and Arsenal. You could see them relax and become not as dreadful as they were after that."" ""We wanted to take the aid to where it was needed. We weren't going to take it to warehouses, we wanted to go to refugee camps or villages which had been bombed out.  ""We also went to a home for disabled people. They were taken there at the age of two or three and left there and never saw their families again. I'd been a social worker for a long time and wanted to see what was happening on the wards.  ""It was a sort of grim castle and you could smell the place before you got near it. The patients never saw anyone else - they wanted to come up to me and stroke my face to see if I was real. It was a very moving experience."" Miss John wrote to makers of pens and pencils for schools and, in one particular village, asked for tools so people could rebuild their homes.  Fighting was still rife at this time and the motorway between Zagreb and Belgrade remained closed for several years. When it finally reopened, Miss John was there with a group of schoolchildren from Dowlais Top who had ""never been out of Merthyr Tydfil, let alone the country"" who got to witness the country as its citizens rebuilt it.  Miss John had to stop driving convoys in 1997 after suffering a heart attack on one journey. She was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital as the convoy left and was picked up and taken home on their way back. But that did not stop her appetite for helping the Croatians.  One time, in the town of Vinkovci, the rebuilt English language school wanted its front door to replicate that of 10 Downing Street in order to pay homage to Miss John and her team from Great Britain.  After a wild goose chase across the media and Downing Street, she was eventually put through to the prime minister's secretary, who asked her if she would like to speak to Tony Blair. Her response? ""I'd love to but I haven't got time!"" Another prime minister inadvertently helped her out of a sticky situation in Croatia.  Stranded by a United Nations roadblock, Miss John stepped out of her van in a blue suit and her blonde hair tightly curled. She walked up to the soldiers, passport in hand, and said: ""Don't you know who I am? My name is Margaret Thatcher and I am the British prime minister. If you don't move this straight away I will want to see your superior officer.""  She said this prompted the soldiers to stand aside and let them through. Despite the horrors she witnessed, the heart attack and negotiating minefields, Miss John said she was ""just doing what had to be done"". She describes herself as ordinary - her story is anything but. "
risk appetite,Kuaishou share price surges on market launch,2024-09-15,2021-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55882760,"Shares of the Chinese short-form video app Kuaishou surged more than 190% on the company's launch on Hong Kong's stock exchange on Friday.  Shortly after the company listed, shares were selling at more than HK$300 ($38.07; £28.31), nearly triple the list price of HK$115.  Kuaishou is one of the most hotly-anticipated initial public offerings this year and has raised $5.4bn (£4bn). The app has a massive user base in China and competes with TikTok. The company's listing is a key test of investors' appetite for Chinese tech companies as Beijing steps up scrutiny of the sector.  When it was created in 2012, Kuaishou was originally a mobile app for making GIF animations.   Now, it is a short-form video platform that competes with ByteDance's TikTok app, but is also popular for livestreaming.  In documents tendered with the Hong Kong stock exchange, Kuaishou said it aimed to be ""the most customer-obsessed company in the world"". Kuaishou claims 305 million daily active users, who spent an average of 86 minutes or more on the app.  Content creators made up about 26% of the app's 769 million monthly active users.  The app is particularly popular in China's second and third tier cities, and in rural areas too, where it is often used for group chats and messaging, as well as for videos.  ""Some people use Kuaishou more like they use WeChat. Kuaishou has a lot more functionality than TikTok,"" said Rui Ma, a Chinese tech analyst with Techbuzz China.  In addition to its popularity, the company's revenues grew from $1.3bn in 2017 to $6.2bn in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. However, it's still not turning a profit. The company reported a loss of $1.1bn over that period.  Currently, Kuaishou makes most of its money from livestreaming e-commerce, often featuring celebrities showcasing products to bring in buyers.   It also makes money from virtual gifts, and has increasingly turned to online marketing services, which accounted for 33% of its business in the first three quarters of 2020.  If TikTok epitomises the eccentricities of urban millennials - Kuaishou is the short video app for everyone, no matter where you're from.  Scroll through and you'll find farmers and merchants from villages and lower-tier cities, livestreaming a glimpse of their daily lives.  This is the key difference, the app's young founders say, between it and other social media platforms.  They claim Kuaishou is a more accurate reflection of modern China - where there's a growing sense of inequality between rich and poor, city-livers and rural dwellers, the haves and the have-nots.  The big draw for investors has been the app's ability to tap into these rural markets.  Kuaishou makes money is by allowing livestreamers to sell their products online, and for users to purchase virtual gifts for other users.  But turning these users into real profit will be a challenge.  Despite soaring revenues, Kuaishou is struggling to make a profit.  In its filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the company says this is a key risk: ""the fact that we incurred net losses during the track record period and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future."" Investors should also pay attention to the changing regulatory environment in China.  Big tech firms like Ant Group are under the spotlight for monopolising the wallets of Chinese internet users.  Livestreaming services and virtual gifting have already caught the attention of Chinese regulators. Kuaishou may not be far behind.  Although the company isn't yet profitable, Rui Ma said Kuaishou's main strength has been its ability to monetise video content.  Many video apps have a big user base, but only a few have figured out how to make money from them.  ""Kuaishou is one of the best companies in capturing those monetisation opportunities. They've been very good at executing, despite all the competition. I think I'm cautiously optimistic,"" said Rui Ma.   It's customer base outside the major cities is also likely to be an advantage, she said, because they have used the app for many years and are likely to remain loyal.   "
risk appetite,"Mum's fear for girl, 4, in hepatitis outbreak",2024-09-15,2022-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-61592056,"A Scottish mum feared her four-year-old daughter could need a liver transplant after catching hepatitis.  Madison Duffy is one of almost 200 children in the UK currently being treated for the illness, amid a surge of cases around the world.   It has led to a number of children needing transplants but experts are not certain what has caused the outbreak.   ""They don't know why it's is happening and where it's coming from. It's frightening,"" mum Chloe Benham said. Hepatitis is a catch-all term to describe inflammation of the liver tissue.  Ms Benham told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that Madison fell ill last week, and they noticed her urine was particularly dark.  ""That is not normal so we took her to the doctor who did a urine test and then ordered blood tests,"" she said. ""Her liver enzymes were measuring over 1,000 when it should only be in the 50s, so we got sent to hospital for more blood tests."" At that point Madison, from Wishaw, Lanarkshire, was found to have hepatitis.  She developed classic symptoms - jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes - while in hospital.  ""It was scary because I didn't know what it was,"" said Chloe, ""When I Googled it there were a lot of horror stories like kids needing liver transplants. ""Medics have had to do screening and other tests to make sure there is nothing else causing it. They don't know why this outbreak is happening and where it is coming from. It is frightening."" Madison is now recovering well and is due to attend the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow for follow-up treatment.  Her mum believes she will be in hospital for several weeks and will also need to undergo blood tests and screening for the rest of her life. She has no idea how she contracted the illness. The most common symptoms of hepatitis are jaundice and vomiting.  Other signs of the virus are dark urine, pale grey coloured stools, itchy skin, muscle and joint pains, tiredness, feeling sick, a high temperature, loss of appetite and stomach pain. Last month, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced the launch of an investigation into a hepatitis outbreak in children under 10. On 20 May, Public Health Scotland (PHS) confirmed 26 cases of hepatitis had been reported, taking the total number of UK cases to 197. Cases have been detected in 20 countries worldwide, with nearly 300 children affected, and one death. There is no evidence of any link to the Covid-19 vaccine. The majority of cases are in children aged under five years old, and are too young to have received the jab. The latest UKHSA technical briefing suggested it could be linked to adenovirus. Adenoviruses are commonly passed from person to person and by touching contaminated surfaces, as well as through the respiratory system. Dr Jim McMenamin, the head of health protection (infection services) at PHS said the current risk to children of severe hepatitis remained low. ""Our investigations increasingly suggest that there is a link to adenovirus infection,"" he said. ""Common infections, like adenovirus, can be prevented with good hand and respiratory hygiene, therefore, I would encourage parents and care-givers to supervise young children while they are washing their hands to ensure they do so properly. ""Public Health Scotland continues to work with NHS and public health colleagues across the UK to investigate other potential causes and we will issue further updates as the situation develops."" Chloe wants other parents to watch out for the symptoms. She said: ""If they have any symptoms, take them to the doctor and even mention the hepatitis outbreak so they know to test for it. ""It's vomiting, dark urine and jaundice. Madison didn't start taking jaundice until she was in the hospital, so we basically caught it at the start. ""It was so worrying but I am fine now I know she is on the mend."""
risk appetite,What's coming up in Parliament next week?,2024-09-15,2022-01-07,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-59913080,"After a politically jittery but legislatively gentle start to 2022, all kinds of plots thicken in Parliament this week.  There's heavy-duty legislating in the Lords, as peers get to the chewier bits of the mammoth Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, where all kinds of important changes are up for consideration on Monday and Wednesday (there's already talk of providing an extra debating day to get through all the proposed changes).  And in the Commons MPs warm up for the arrival of the long-awaited Online Harms Bill with a debate on the report of the special committee set up to scrutinise the draft version. The committee recommended substantial toughening-up, and the aim of the debate looks to be to muster support for their proposed changes, in the hope that ministers build them into the updated version of the bill which they have promised to publish ""very soon."" On the Committee Corridor, look out for the verdict of former MI5 boss Lord Evans on such topics as the propriety of the Downing Street refurbishment, when he appears before the Public Administration Committee on Tuesday. Home Affairs launches its inquiry into spiking with evidence from witnesses who've had their drinks spiked in bars or clubs, or been directly injected.  And listen carefully to the mood music at question times, particularly at PMQs.  Boris Johnson and his ministers have been on the receiving end of some angry lectures from their own side, as well as from the Opposition - which suggests high levels of angst on the Tory benches right now.   The Commons opens (14:30) with defence questions, after which expect the usual post-weekend batch of government statements and urgent questions. The main legislative action is around the Nuclear Energy (Financing) Bill which aims to create a new financial model to cut the cost of new nuclear power stations.  The idea is to switch from developers paying the cost up front and recouping their investment on the bills to consumers in what's called a Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme, to a Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model under which consumers will pay a levy to contribute to the cost of new nuclear power projects during construction.   The idea is that this will cost less because it will mean less has to be borrowed and interest payments are therefore smaller.  Then there is a debate on Motions to approve the Charter for Budget Responsibility: Autumn 2021 update and the Welfare Cap as Specified in the Autumn Budget. In Westminster Hall (16:30) the Petitions Committee has scheduled a debate on e-petition 548682, calling for the police to have the power to suspend driving licences, so that drivers accused of drink, drug or dangerous driving receive a suspension notice which applies until they appear in court.  It would then be for the judge to decide whether a ban continues or they are able to continue to drive again.  Campaigners have dubbed this Tom's Law, after Tom McConnachie who was killed in February 2019, when the driver of the car was allowed to continue driving for 11 months after the collision. The petition attracted 104,868 signatures Committee action includes Public Accounts (16:00) returning to the subject of the government's bounce-back loans which were guaranteed by the taxpayer and granted with no credit or even fraud checks loans.  The Committee will question senior officials at the Financial Conduct Authority, the business department and the Treasury on the fluctuating guesstimates of how many billions the UK taxpayer may lose. In the Lords (14:30) ministers field questions on creating a professional register for care workers and expediting the payment of compensation to postmasters and mistresses as a result of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal. Peers warm up with a couple of brief Third Reading rubber stampings - on the Charities Bill, and then on to the Advanced Research and Invention Agency Bill.  And then it's on to day four of Report Stage consideration of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, where there will be some significant action.  In the wake of pressure in both the Commons and the earlier Lords stages of debate, the government is bringing forward some important amendments. First, to extend the offences which can trigger football banning orders to cover racial abuse of players - something promised in the wake of last year's European Cup. Second, a new clause which will disregard convictions and cautions against gay men for what were then sexual offences, but which would now be legal.  A further clause provides for posthumous pardons. Labour's Lord Cashman has campaigned strongly for both changes.  There could be a vote on a clause proposed by the Conservative, Lord Attlee, to outlaw ""potting"" - the practice of prison inmates pelting prison officers with excrement and bodily fluids.  And there is a Labour-led amendment to put Dame Elish Angiolini's inquiry to address the issues raised by the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, by a police officer, onto a full statutory footing, with powers to compel witnesses, on the argument that this will actually speed up the inquiry process.  The Commons day begins (11:30) with business, energy and industrial strategy questions. Labour and Co-operative Party MP Christina Rees presents a Ten Minute Rule Bill to help employees facing redundancy buy their company and turn it into a co-operative.  The main debate is on a Labour motion, to be announced - but something on the cost of living looks like a fair bet.  On the Committee Corridor, the  Business Committee (09:45) quiz the Post Office CEO Nick Read and Paul Scully, the Minister for Small Business, on the miscarriages of justice around their Horizon IT system, which led to many sub-postmasters receiving criminal convictions.  Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (10:00) examines the recent appointment of Charity Commission Chair Martin Thomas who resigned within days of taking the role.  Education (10:00) looks at the educational and longer-term outcomes for children in residential care, with evidence from the Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, and the National Director for Social Care at Ofsted, Yvette Stanley.  Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs will hear from Lord Evans, Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, on his report on upholding standards of governance, and on his views of the Greensill affair.  The discussion will range across prioritisation of compliance in government, his committee's recommendation against creating a single ethics regulator; enforcing the Ministerial Code and the propriety of finance for the Downing Street refurbishment.  Bring popcorn. And Environment Food and Rural Affairs (14:30) looks at muckspreading - and whether regulations designed to prevent water pollution are preventing farmers spreading organic fertiliser.  In Westminster Hall (16:30) former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVeigh leads a debate on careers guidance in schools. In the Lords (14:30) there are questions on the support from the Department for Work and Pensions for larger families, and the risks posed by respiratory viruses this winter.  Then, peers begin a seven-day committee stage trawl through the detail of the Health and Care Bill, with the focus on the role of NHS England, the NHS Mandate, and Integrated Care Boards. This is the exploratory phase of debate, where amendments are seldom pushed to a vote.   And there will also be a short debate on support for British farmers facing increasing costs from labour shortages and competition from Australia and New Zealand.  Commons business opens (11:30) with half an hour of Women and Equalities questions, followed, at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Conservative Dr Luke Evans returns to his campaigning theme of artificially enhanced body images, with a bill to require advertisers, broadcasters and publishers to display a logo where an image of the human body has been digitally altered. The main legislative action is the Report and Third Reading stages of the Commercial Rents (Coronavirus) Bill which will create a new binding arbitration process to help landlords and tenants find proportionate resolution of Covid-19 related rent debt. This may well leave space for something else to be dropped into the agenda.  Committee action includes Home Affairs (10:00) opening its new inquiry into spiking - drinks being drugged or people being directly injected with them, often to allow sexual assault or even rape - with evidence from victims about their experiences.  Public Accounts (14:00) looks at how the government manages risk and the lack of economic, health and education planning and preparedness for a pandemic, despite it being top of the national public risk register.  In the era of Covid, has the public appetite to spend money on averting risks changed?   Westminster Hall action includes Labour's Grahame Morris leading a debate (09:30) on access to radiotherapy treatments, and the Conservative Matt Vickers (14:30) on youth crime and anti-social behaviour. In the Lords (15:00), questions include the Bishop of Coventry asking about reconciling differences between nuclear possessor states and non-nuclear possessor states at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Then it's another Report Stage day on the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - and more important amendments.  This includes a government amendment to create new offences of recording images of breastfeeding for sexual gratification or to humiliate the victim.   A group of peers who've long campaigned on stalking have an amendment, fronted by the Crossbencher Lord Russell of Liverpool and former Labour Leader in the Lords Baroness Royall to require specialist training in stalking awareness and prosecution. There will be an amendment, from Labour front bencher Lord Ponsonby, criminalising ""sex for rent"" arrangements, a series of amendments from the Bishops' Bench toughening up the laws against hare coursing, and another (first proposed in the Commons by Yvette Cooper) to extend the reporting deadline for common assault in domestic violence cases.  The former Victims Commissioner, Baroness Newlove has tabled an amendment (with frontbench Labour support) to require police to keep a record of crimes where misogyny was a factor, and courts to consider it an aggravating factor in sentencing. The Commons day begins (09:30) with questions to the Chancellor of the Dutchy of Lancaster, Steve Barclay, followed by the weekly statement of the forthcoming agenda for the Commons.  Then come two debates chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - first on the report by a special committee on the Draft Online Safety Bill, which will give MPs a chance to discuss its recommendations to toughen up the bill, which include imposing new responsibilities on internet providers to comply with a Code of Conduct on risk areas like Child Exploitation and terrorism, and giving Ofcom new powers to punish them, where they fail.  That's followed by a debate on the government's plan for education and mental health catch-ups, led by the Conservative Chair of the Education Committee, Robert Halfon, to look at what he called the ""spectre of school closures"".  In Westminster Hall (13:30) the Liberal Democrat Wendy Chamberlain leads a debate on global vaccine access, and that is followed (15:00) by a chance for MPs to debate the Transport Committee's scathing report on the rollout and safety of smart motorways.  In the Lords (11:00) there's a question to ministers on the impact on health outcomes of the time spent by ambulances waiting in queues to transfer patients into hospital Accident and Emergency departments.  Then it's on to day two of committee consideration of the Health and Care Bill -continuing with the subjects of day one and then looking at mergers of NHS bodies. Normally Thursday afternoons are reserved for backbench business, so this piece of scheduling is a sign of how congested the Lords timetable is becoming.  It's private members bill day in the Commons, again (from 09:30), and the process has now reached the point where bills which have been considered in Committee return to the Commons for Report and Third Reading consideration. First up Mark Jenkinson's Education (Careers Guidance in Schools) Bill, a government-backed measure to extend entitlement to careers advice.  Second (and, after a blink and you'll miss it committee consideration) Sir Paul Beresford's Local Government (Disqualification) Bill, which explicitly disqualify individuals who are place on the sex offenders register from standing for or remaining in office as councillors, mayors etc. Then, if there's any time available, the former Attorney General, Jeremy Wright, has a second reading for his Taxis and Private Hire Vehicles (Disabled Persons) Bill, which aims to help improve access to private transport for disabled people.

risk appetite,Over 200 shopping centres 'in crisis',2024-09-15,2018-11-01,Jennifer Harby,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-45707529,"More than 200 UK shopping centres are in danger of falling into administration, experts are warning. The demise of ""major anchor stores"" like BHS and Toys R Us and the rise of online shopping has caused a ""downward spiral"", analyst Nelson Blackley said.  Many of the at-risk centres are owned by US private equity firms under deals that will need refinancing. ""If centres close, particularly in small towns, it will be catastrophic,"" Mr Blackley said. ""We have too many of them, doing exactly the same - the same range of stores and products - and basically that's not attractive,"" he added. In pictures: The rise and fall of shopping centres Mother and daughter Helena Waszczyszyn and Anja Ramsden, from Nottingham, said the city's Broadmarsh Centre was ""empty and soulless"". While it is not one of the 200 owned by private equity, the centre has seen shops close over the course of the past decade and is currently awaiting an £86m redevelopment. Ms Ramsden said: ""The shops have gone one by one - even when they were there they were a bit rubbish. ""It's desolate in there. There's a toilet, somewhere to sit and it's out of the rain, that's it."" Jasmin Stephenson, from Eastwood in Nottinghamshire, had a similar view of the centre, saying: ""I literally only go if I have to."" ""A few years ago a lot of businesses closed down and cleared out,"" she said.  ""They said they were going to renovate it but nothing has happened. It's not a place I go to now. ""It's a shame, as a lot of history was demolished to make way for it and it's just a concrete block. That's quite depressing."" Mr Blackley, from the National Retail Research Knowledge Exchange Centre, said the growth of online retail in the UK - on sites such as Amazon - had been faster than in almost any other retail market in the world. ""If the major anchor store moves out, that has a halo effect on other stores in that centre. It's a downward spiral and you can't fill shopping centres with nail bars and vape shops."" Steve Hall, from Essex, said: ""I like shopping centres but they do seem to be dying and I wish some money was spent on making them good again."" Mr Blackley, who is based at Nottingham Trent University's Nottingham Business School, pointed to research in the Financial Times that suggested about £2.5bn worth of shopping centres and retail parks are up for sale in towns and cities across the UK. Some of this marketing is unofficial and not in the public domain,"" he said. ""It's a trend that's moving very quickly. You don't necessarily want to be in the business of owning shopping centres at the moment. ""People are suggesting a number of leading national retailers are on the edge and may close and that would bring shopping centres down with them. ""The collapse of BHS, two years ago, left empty units in around 200 shopping centres and more than half of those large, empty units have not yet been filled."" The crisis is affecting shopping centres across the UK, regardless of their location Daniel Mead from asset management firm APAM said. All kinds of shopping centres, regardless of location or whether they are in small towns or major cities, could be affected,"" he said. ""What they have in common is the way in which they are funded - the capital structure behind them. Obviously, if the centre is in a more affluent location, the problem could be easier to fix."" One centre which recently went into receivership is the Nicholsons Shopping Centre in Maidenhead which, according to the Financial Times, was bought by Vixcroft, a private equity-backed property specialist and hedge fund Cheyne Capital in 2015. The paper described Nicholsons as ""one of the first significant collapses among dozens of UK retail property assets bought by opportunistic investors"". Residents have spoken to the BBC about their concerns regarding a number of shopping centres up and down the country, where they feel empty units and an apparent lack of investment have led to stagnation. The research to identify ""at-risk"" centres was carried out by APAM, which said it had found many of the affected centres had been the subject of short-term speculative deals. Executive director Simon Cooke said: ""We think these shopping centres have been hit with the perfect storm of defaulting retail markets, weaker consumer spending, the impact of the internet and rising rents and rates, making it very difficult for retailers to trade and make a profit. ""We perceive many of these borrowers beginning to breach land covenants."" Mr Cooke said most of the centres ""in crisis"" were the subject of deals that are due to be refinanced. ""They have to return money to their investors,"" said Mr Cooke. ""That's not looking very likely. Frankly, the centres are either going to have to be sold at a lower price or have capital injected in order to regenerate and we don't see banks having an appetite for that."" ""These are big tracts of land, occupying a central space in towns,"" he said.  ""You could see increasing vandalism, increasing crime, with a knock-on impact on infrastructure. I'm not suggesting every town is going to face these problems but we need to stop the rot."" ""Politicians need to come up with a plan to kick-start the regeneration of shopping centres,"" he added. A government spokesman said: ""It's true that high streets are changing, like they always have, and we're committed to helping communities adapt."" They said the government had put together an ""expert panel"" to ""diagnose the issues affecting the high street and develop recommendations that will help them thrive"". The trend of closing shopping centres is fairly well-known in the US, where ""dead mall"" or ""ghost mall"" is the term that describes the decaying edifices left when mainstream department stores have moved out. ""Many of the challenges facing shopping centres in the UK are mirrored in the USA,"" said Mr Blackley. Centres that have prospered, he said, have been canny about expanding their offer. ""UK shopping centres must change if they are to survive,"" according to Mr Blackley. ""They need to think like a hospitality brand. There has been a marked shift to the 'experience economy', and an increase in spend on food and beverage, which is now accounting for over 20% of total spend in some of the newest schemes. ""Some of the big centres in the UK are incorporating Sea Life Centres, ice rinks, indoor ski slopes. These are the shopping centres that, in my view, will survive. ""There's no doubt that if shopping centres don't deliver an experience consumers want, they will fall by the wayside."" Some of the other visions for the future are similarly radical. Mr Mead, head of shopping centre asset management at APAM, said community facilities such as libraries, medical centres and even schools could all sit within retail complexes. ""In Richmond, a new school is being built above a Lidl store, so it's not beyond the realm of possibility,"" he said. ""What people like about shopping centres is that they are centrally located with good transport links. The NHS has expressed interest in having a presence in some centres. With a chemist and other retailers already located there, it would be like a one-stop shop in the town centre. ""The problem is, these centres are run by investors who have a short-term approach and haven't the skill-sets or investments to embrace the kind of changes required. There needs to be a joint venture created with local communities to fix the problem."" In recent months, some local authorities have bought unloved shopping centres from investors keen to offload them. ""In February 2018, Canterbury City Council struck one of the largest shopping centre deals involving a council on record, taking full control of Whitefriars Shopping Centre in the city,"" said Mr Blackley. ""The local authority bought out global fund manager TH Real Estate's 50% stake for £75m."" In Shrewsbury, Shropshire Council bought three centres - including one that was neglected - to ""support economic growth and regeneration"" in the town centre. Whether such schemes will work depends on the passion and vision of the authorities concerned and whether they are able to secure private investment. In Coventry, the city council's plan to work with private investors to redevelop its post-war shopping precincts is seen as a good example of how to revive a shopping centre. ""But such investments by councils do risk public money,"" said Mr Blackley.  ""In too many cases, councils are trying to plug a gap and I don't think that is sustainable long term."""
risk appetite,Gove: People will make up their own mind on Cummings,2024-09-15,2020-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52803224,"People will make up their own minds after listening to Dominic Cummings' ""exhaustive"" account of his travels during the lockdown, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said.  The prime minister's chief aide has defended driving 260 miles in March from his home to County Durham.  He said he acted reasonably and legally in going to stay on his parents' farm.  His statement on Monday overshadowed the PM's new plans to reopen all non-essential shops in England on 15 June. Boris Johnson said shops will be able to open if they meet safety guidelines. They follow outdoor markets and car showrooms, which will be allowed to reopen from 1 June. Retailers have generally welcomed the announcement but some experts said more clarity was needed on how shops should keep staff and customers safe.  Mr Cummings has faced calls to resign after it emerged he had driven his child and ill wife from London to County Durham during lockdown. At his news conference in the garden of 10 Downing Street on Monday afternoon, he said he did not regret his actions. On the subject of why he then drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed symptoms - Mr Cummings said he was testing his eyesight to see if he could make the trip back down to London. He explained that he had experienced some eyesight problems during his illness. Following the conference, several government ministers rallied in support of Mr Cummings, with many writing on Twitter that it was ""time to move on"". Mr Gove said Mr Cummings' account of his actions was ""exhaustive, detailed and verifiable"". ""People will make their own mind up as they listened to Dominic's account,"" he told BBC Breakfast.  ""Most people will understand he was under pressure, and sought to put the health of his wife and son first, and took care to ensure they as a family unit were not in danger of infecting other people."" Opposition MPs are due to meet later to discuss how to hold Boris Johnson and his senior aide to account.  Labour has criticised Mr Cummings for failing to apologise for his actions, while other parties continue to call for him to be sacked. Dominic Cummings' rose garden confessional was a bold move designed to take the drama out of a crisis. But giving detailed answers to why he at the very least broke the spirit of the lockdown rules does not answer the fundamental question now - is his continued presence in Downing Street more of a hindrance than a help to Boris Johnson? Tempers may have cooled slightly on the Conservative backbenches, but there are still calls for him to go, both private and public. And some senior Conservative MPs are still aghast at how much political capital the prime minister has burned through to keep Mr Cummings at his side. Opposition leaders still intend to push for his departure. The man respected by Mr Johnson for judging the public mood has made himself famous for falling foul of that opinion. His explanations may ease for some of the anger. But in Westminster and beyond, it will not disappear overnight. And when the prime minister is interrogated by senior MPs on Wednesday his decisions over Dominic Cummings will surely be on the list. Read more from Laura. Boris Johnson said he regretted the ""confusion and anger"" caused by the row, but continued to back Mr Cummings.  Meanwhile, all shops in England will be allowed to reopen from 15 June provided they meet new social distancing and hygiene measures to protect customers and staff from the virus. Mr Johnson said the change would depend on premises being ""Covid-secure"" and on the country making progress towards meeting the five tests set out by the government as being crucial to lifting the lockdown restrictions. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of the retail consultancy Savvy, said some smaller retailers would want ""more clarity"" from safety guidelines, on things like how many people can be in a store at one time.  She also questioned whether there would be the appetite from the public to return to shops.  ""Shopping is a social, fun experience a lot of the time and social distancing takes that away. It's going to be a very different way of shopping from what we're used to,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  Schools in England have also been told to prepare for a phased reopening from the beginning of June, beginning with pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6.  On June 15, up to a quarter of Year 10 and Year 12 will be allowed ""some contact"" to help prepare for exams. However, the prime minister acknowledged some schools would not be ready to open then. Latest government figures show the number of people to die with coronavirus in the UK rose by 121 to 36,914 on Monday. In other developments:"
risk appetite,Is football's racism battle being lost?,2024-09-15,2021-02-01,Dan Roan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55892185,"Manchester United and Sheffield United players kneeling before their recent Premier League game at Old Trafford - Manchester United pair Axel Tuanzebe and Antony Martial received racist abuse following the match When it comes to online racist abuse, football appears to have had enough. Again.  Last week's series of incidents provoked a wave of condemnation from across the game and beyond.  And yet, this comes almost two years after top stars took part in a campaign called '#Enough', a 24-hour social media boycott in protest at a similar spate of abuse. Now the same demands for tech platforms to do more are being made. So is the battle being lost? Why is it proving so difficult to tackle this issue? And where is this crisis heading? Duke of Cambridge calls for racist abuse of footballers to stop Chelsea 'disgusted' after Reece James racially abused on social media Arrest over racist abuse of West Brom player Sawyers Racist abuse sent to Manchester United pair Tuanzebe and Martial The pressure on the social media platforms is intensifying. The appetite for more regulation is growing.  Last week the Premier League said the tech companies ""need to do more"", calling for ""swifter removal of offensive messages and improved identification and banning of offenders"". Manchester United, with three of their squad subject to vile messages, urged the creation of verifiable and identifiable accounts so offenders could be caught, saying they and the players were ""sick of it"", making the point that no one should face such hate-filled abuse in their place of work. The Duke of Cambridge, who is also the president of the Football Association, wants social media companies to take more responsibility The Duke of Cambridge, who is also the president of the Football Association, has praised those who have spoken out and called for an end to the ""despicable"" abuse. Writing on Twitter, Prince William also cited the need for social media companies to raise their game. ""We all have a responsibility to create an environment where such abuse is not tolerated, and those who choose to spread hate and division are held accountable for their actions. That responsibility extends to the platforms where so much of this activity now takes place,"" he said. The Professional Footballers' Association, which represents players, has asked the tech giants to prevent users from being able to send explicitly racist terms and emojis. ""While racist abuse is allowed to continue on each platform, we can only conclude that this is a choice by the companies running the social networks,"" it said. Putting such criticism to the platforms is no easy task. We asked for an interview with Twitter on this subject back in 2019. We are still waiting for one. Our request last week for an interview with Facebook - the owner of Instagram - was met with a short statement saying: ""There is no place for racism on Instagram and we are committed to removing it when we find it. We know there is more to do and we will continue to work closely with clubs, players and football authorities to investigate instances of discrimination and collectively tackle this issue."" Twitter too issued a statement: ""Racist behaviour has no place on our service and when we identify accounts that violate any of the Twitter Rules, we take enforcement action. ""We have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our valued partners in football to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour - both online and offline."" This video can not be played 'Social media companies not vigilant enough' - Wright and Jenas react after Rashford is subject of racist abuse The government meanwhile has vowed to press on with plans for ""groundbreaking"" new online harms legislation later this year to make tech companies legally responsible for the online safety of their users, and make them accountable to a regulator - Ofcom, external - over abusive content. Racist messages would need to be removed ""without delay"". The proposals include the threat of massive fines of up to 10% of global turnover if the companies fail to meet their obligations, and there could even be criminal sanctions for senior executives.  Behind the scenes, I am told that while football authorities were encouraged by the recent meeting that Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden hosted with players to discuss online abuse, there is concern at how long it is taking to introduce new laws considered long overdue, and fears they may be watered down if the hugely powerful, US-based tech companies have their way and threaten to invest elsewhere.   But according to Kick It Out, external chief executive Sanjay Bhandari, the legislation - along with the promise of more regulation in the US from President Joe Biden - are grounds for optimism.  ""The cavalry is on the way,"" the head of the anti-discrimination body told the BBC. ""That's the hope on the horizon, but that may not come quickly enough so there's things we need social media to do right now. The behavioural, cultural problems will take longer to solve. It's the technology problem we can do more quickly and all of the answers sit with Twitter and Facebook. Technology has been massively unregulated for 25 years and its time we closed that loophole."" Marcus Rashford played in Manchester United's 0-0 draw at Arsenal on Saturday Some at the Premier League - which launched a dedicated, 'rapid-response' reporting system for players last year - say the social media platforms have improved in recent years, but not enough. There has been success with the removal of posts but officials want more effort to assist the authorities to find perpetrators so they can be banned by clubs (if they are a fan) or even prosecuted. While there have been some successful prosecutions - an Irish teenager is due to be sentenced on Wednesday for sending racist abuse to former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright - these are few and far between when the sheer scale of the abuse is considered.  One insider said league officials felt hampered by what they called impregnable and unresponsive tech companies using privacy, freedom of speech and the sheer weight of traffic as reasons for not handing over information that would help identify offenders. The fear is that the police - without the resources to pursue every possible crime - only intervene in the most serious cases, and abusers know they face little risk of sanctions. Court orders need to be obtained to force the platform to co-operate, evidence has to be gathered, and often offenders are overseas in different jurisdictions.  Another challenge is persuading players to take legal action, which can often seem a daunting prospect. A man was arrested following alleged racial abuse of West Bromwich Albion midfielder Romaine Sawyers While admitting there is ""more to do"", Facebook does point to the fact that it is working with Kick It Out on a fans' education and reporting initiative, and has built tools designed to prevent unwanted contact on Instagram. It has also tripled the size of its safety team to 35,000 people, claiming it proactively took action on tens of million of pieces of hate speech last year. But considering the vast wealth of these companies, many believe more should be invested. The tech companies argue that tackling this problem is not as straightforward as many assume. They have other areas of concern that must also be monitored across their vast, unregulated platforms; from suspected terrorism and paedophilia to the spread of misinformation.  Simply blocking certain discriminatory words or emojis from being used in the first place is problematic, because these can also be used in a non-offensive context, and across global platforms can have different meanings in different communities or territories. The companies can block devices for repeat offenders, but that person can then just use a different device. Many are now calling for an end to the anonymity that provides a shield to many abusers with a mandatory verification process that means users must give passport details for instance before opening an account. Given the mistrust over social media platforms' use of personal data however, there are fears that this could pose a threat to activists, whistleblowers and persecuted minorities who need to protect their identity online. Many also point out that in recent years, racially offensive comments have been published on social media by fully verified accounts.  Axel Tuanzebe (left) and Anthony Martial (centre) received racist abuse after featuring in a Manchester United defeat There are also those who believe that the time has come for football's authorities and clubs to invest more, and take the burden of reporting away from the players.  ""The problem is that the systems that they've got in place require a player to receive and then report the abuse themselves, and by that point the damage has already been done,"" according to Jonathan Hirshler, the CEO of Signify, a data science company that uses artificial intelligence to uncover the identities of abusers. ""The technology is there, using AI and open source data, to unmask vile and prolific abusers.  ""It's also important that football moves from reactive to proactive, to pick up abuse before the players have to, and package evidence in a way that the social platforms and authorities have little choice but to act on. So we need a new approach, working constructively with the platforms, to ensure that abusers have nowhere to hide."" There is no time to waste. During just the final six weeks of last season, a joint PFA and Signify study identified more than 3,000 explicitly abusive messages aimed at Premier League players, 56% of which were racist. Of the players surveyed, 43% said they had experienced targeted racist abuse.  Football has become a lightning-rod for a wider, societal issue. The scale of the challenge facing the sport is significant, and seems to be getting worse. Finding a solution however, is proving far from simple."
risk appetite,"Have I got Covid, a bad cold or something else?",2024-09-15,2020-09-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54145299,"As the latest version of the Omicron variant continues to spread quickly, the official list of Covid symptoms has been expanded in England - but not yet in the rest of the UK.  The updated guidance now lists nine extra symptoms, including a sore throat, muscle pains and diarrhoea, but many of these are similar to cold and flu symptoms. So how can you tell if you've got Covid, a bad cold or something else? The new list of Covid symptoms has been expanded from the original three: It now includes nine other symptoms which are common signs of other respiratory infections too:  It's not possible to tell if you have Covid-19, flu or another respiratory infection based on symptoms alone, official advice says. But spotting these symptoms can help to reduce the spread to other more vulnerable people. If you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to go to work or school, you're advised to stay at home. This was one of the three key Covid symptoms identified during the first two years of the pandemic but it appears to be much less common with Omicron infections. The most common five symptoms experienced by people with positive Covid tests recently are runny nose (83%), fatigue (71%), sore throat (69%), headache (69%) and sneezing (68%), according to the ZOE Covid symptom app. A high temperature is 37.8C or above, and can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus.  If you don't have a thermometer, check if you - or the person you're worried about - feel hot to the touch on the chest or back.  A high temperature is unlikely with a cold.  If you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to carry out normal activities, you're advised to stay at home in England. You should avoid contact with other people, in particular those who are at high risk of becoming seriously unwell if they get Covid. People with symptoms are no longer advised to test for Covid in England, but if you do have a positive result, you should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days after the day you took your test.  Many people will no longer be infectious after five days but some may still be able to pass on the virus for up to 10 days. People with symptoms are still advised to take a PCR test in Scotland and Northern Ireland or a lateral flow test (LFT) in Wales. Anyone who tests positive in the three nations is asked to isolate.  When testing ends in Scotland, people who feel unwell will be advised to stay at home until they feel better. The advice is to try to keep your distance from people you live with, particularly those whose immune system is weaker than normal. You can also open windows in rooms for 10 minutes after someone with symptoms has left.  Cleaning frequently touched surfaces such as door handles and remote controls can protect people in your house from Covid and other viruses. If you can't stay at home while you feel unwell, you can reduce the chances of passing on the infection you have by:  For most people who've been vaccinated - and children, even if they haven't had a jab - Covid infections are usually mild, and typically last for up to a week.  But some groups are still at higher risk and need protecting from Covid and other respiratory infections, including:  Some very young children who were born prematurely or who have heart conditions are also at risk from RSV, another respiratory virus. Most people can be treated for Covid at home, as with any other mild respiratory illness. You should get plenty of rest and drink water to keep hydrated. You can take paracetamol to relieve headaches and muscle aches or pains, but antibiotics won't work against viral infections like Covid.  If you're having trouble breathing, contact your doctor, or use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online. If you're very worried about sudden shortness of breath, call 999. The NHS also advises: "
risk appetite,‘It’s either cannabis or die’,2024-09-15,2018-11-12,By Kevin Ponniah,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46029635,"A death sentence given to a young man selling cannabis oil to the ill has stirred debate in Muslim-majority Malaysia about its ultra-tough drug laws. The case has prompted calls for the country to become the first in Asia to legalise medical marijuana - but long-held stigma and a mostly conservative population means change could come slowly. Yuki describes smoking her first joint as a turning point in her life. She is willing to risk being thrown in jail rather than give up a drug that she says has worked for her unlike any other. She first turned to what Malaysians call ganja at 29, after a frustrated Google search in pursuit of something that might help ease chronic, crippling pain from hypokalaemia - or low blood potassium. Beleaguered by a litany of health problems, including diabetes, she decided to try the drug. It was the early 2000s and public discussion of medical cannabis use was non-existent in Malaysia, a country with some of the world's harshest drug laws. Cultivating a single cannabis plant at home can land you in prison for natural life, while possession of more than 200g is almost certain to result in a death sentence. But Yuki, now 41, was desperate to try it. She bought some marijuana and asked her husband to roll her a joint. ""All the pain was gone so finally I could sleep, I slept like a baby,"" she said. When she woke up the next morning, she felt her appetite coming back and devoured a meal of curry and rice. She then smoked another joint, and for the first time in a long time, felt up to doing house chores. ""I had two growing kids at that time, one was nine years old, the other was 11. The two of them needed my attention but I could not give it to them because I was so sick,"" she said. After years of using opiates to deal with pain caused by her various medical problems, she felt liberated.  More than a decade later, and after several arrests - including one episode in which her entire family, including the children, were held in a jail cell - Yuki has put herself at the forefront of a campaign to reform Malaysia's drug laws.  She says she's not scared - for her ""it's either cannabis or die"". Over the years Yuki has watched friend after friend be put behind bars and even lost her job at an airline as a result of her activism. But the events of recent months have made her and other marijuana advocates feel that they might finally have powerful voices on their side. It began with a devastating blow - on 30 August - when 29-year-old Muhammad Lukman, a friend of Yuki's, was sentenced to death. A few years ago, she had begun using cannabis in the form of oil as an alternative to smoking and Lukman, who sold small dropper bottles of oil for $10 (£8) via a Facebook page called HealTHCcare, supplied it to her. (THC is the main psychoactive compound in cannabis.) Lukman's lawyers presented him as a kind-hearted and pious Muslim, who would give away oil to patients who could not afford it - including Yuki. It's clear that many people felt his product helped them with various ailments, but his page also made some unfounded claims about cannabis's ability to cure diseases like leukaemia. Although about 900 others are on death row in Malaysia for drug offences, Lukman's case prompted an outcry over what was widely seen as a disproportionate punishment.  A petition gathered tens of thousands of signatures and high-profile politicians began to weigh in, including Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said the case should be reviewed. Nurul Izzah Anwar, an MP with the governing coalition, said it looked to be a ""miscarriage of justice"". Reports then emerged in late September that the cabinet had discussed the medical benefits of cannabis, with one minister saying he was fully behind it.  In October, Yuki and her friends received another surprise. Mr Mahathir's reform-minded government announced it was going to to abolish the death penalty completely. Suspects convicted for drug trafficking, like Lukman, could however still face jail for decades or life. Conclusive or substantial evidence: Moderate evidence: Epilepsy Sources: US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine; New England Journal of Medicine; NHS Lukman's case is not the only one the activists are watching. Mohammed Zaireen bin Zainal, the founder of the Malaysian Marijuana Education Movement, is also on death row and awaiting a final appeal. A 58-year-old ex-military captain known as ""Dr Ganja"", who treated himself and others with cannabis oil, is awaiting trial. Samantha Chong, Dr Ganja's lawyer, said that as a former prosecutor, she has seen first-hand that the draconian laws are not working. ""I kept on seeing the same accused person coming for drug offences. [We would] put them in jail or give them a fine but they would keep coming back."" Malaysians like her who advocate drug policy reform feel that international momentum is on their side. They recently watched Canada and South Africa legalise the drug completely.  In the US, medical cannabis is legal in 31 states.  And since 1 November, cannabis products have been available on the UK's National Health Service for certain patients.  In the region, India and Thailand have both signalled that they could liberalise laws around medical marijuana products. The World Health Organization is currently conducting a ""critical review"" of cannabis to decide if the drug's strict scheduling next to cocaine and heroin under decades-old international drug control conventions is appropriate. It could pave the way to revisions of UN conventions which underpin tough drug laws around the world, says Professor Iain McGregor of the University of Sydney's Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics. But for those changes to happen it will require ""a lot of the Muslim countries that are traditionally quite strongly anti-drug"" to change their positions. ""And I wonder if Malaysia"", he added, ""will now act as a key opinion leader amongst that cluster of countries to implement change."" Documents seen by the BBC confirm that both Prime Minister Mahathir and Health Minister Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad have been in contact with the organisers of a privately-funded project involving Malaysian and Indian researchers looking at the potential for medical cannabis to treat depression. And Nurul Izzah Anwar, the MP, says she has begun drafting a bill to present in parliament. However it's unclear how soon any major legal reforms could occur. Law Minister Liew Vui Keong insisted that the government had ""not come to any conclusion with regard to the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes"" but added that he would be willing to review the evidence available and based on that possibly make a recommendation that the laws be changed. For Yuki, legalisation - at least for medical use - can't come fast enough. A regulated market, she and other advocates say, would allow ill people who already use cannabis in the shadows to access safer products. ""If you are desperate, you are sick, you will do anything,"" she says. ""We go online, we search about it, we find out about it. The government doesn't want to give it to us but we will still find it."""
risk appetite,How long will it last? Your heatwave questions,2024-09-15,2018-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44934717,"After a brief burst of heavy rain last weekend, the summer heatwave is returning to some parts of the UK. Temperatures are forecast to rise again across southern England, with the hot weather set to continue into the first half of next week. Meanwhile, Europe is bracing itself for the hottest-ever temperatures with Spain and Portugal predicted to break the 48C (118.4F) record set in Athens in July 1977. As many struggle to stay cool this summer, here are some of the questions you've been asking Google. The hot weather is set to persist in the south of the UK throughout the weekend, says BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne. Temperatures are expected to reach highs of 33C in London on Friday before dropping back slightly to 29-30C on Saturday and Sunday. ""The weekend as a whole across the UK will be largely fine and warm with spells of sunshine,"" he says - although the exception will be the north-west of Scotland which will see showers. BBC Weather: UK forecast The heatwave in the south-east is forecast to continue into the start of next week with highs of up to 32C - although the Met Office said it is unlikely to be record-breaking. But from Wednesday, the weather will become fresher as an area of low pressure develops and for the rest of the week temperatures look set to return to more ""normal levels"" of mid to low 20s. For the middle weeks in August, Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell predicts a return to the ""typical British summer"" with some more unsettled weather and a risk of showers. Temperatures will be closer to 20-22C in southern areas and 16-18C in the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Hotter temperatures could return at the end of August as the weather becomes less changeable, Ms Mitchell said, although the outlook is still uncertain. The hottest day so far of 2018 was Thursday 26 July, when temperatures reached 35.3C in Faversham, Kent. But it still did not top the UK's highest ever recorded temperature of 38.5C (101F), also in Faversham in Kent in August 2003. Provisional figures from the Met Office had suggested that Scotland experienced its hottest ever temperature in June, when 33.2C degrees was measured in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. But the Met Office later rejected this figure because a stationary vehicle with the engine running was parked near to the thermometers that measured this temperature, potentially contaminating the result. So Scotland's high of 32.9C recorded in August 2003 at Greycrook in the Borders still stands. Forecasters say the all-time temperature record in Europe could be broken in the coming days. The current European record is 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in July 1977. Hot air sweeping in from Africa is causing temperatures to rise in Spain and Portugal and temperatures are forecast to rise to up to 47C in parts. The Association of British Travel Agents urged holidaymakers visiting the areas to ""copy the locals"". ""Avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day, drink lots of water and apply plenty of sun cream,"" a spokesman said. ""If you go to the beach, go early and when it feels like it's getting too hot leave, just as the locals do, and go and have a nice lunch in the shade."" You can't fail to notice how brown the UK landscape has become this summer. But, says the Royal Horticultural Society, brown lawns look a lot worse than they are and they should recover rapidly with renewed rainfall. When mowing dry lawns, the RHS advises gardeners to raise the height of cut on mowers to avoid weakening the grasses. Allow the clippings fall back onto the lawn - this will slow down the evaporation of water from the soil surface. The RHS also suggests watering the lawn (provided there are no hosepipe restrictions in force) in early morning, evening or even at night to reduce water wastage from evaporation. Find some more RHS advice here In pictures: The dried parks and parched lawns of Britain When there's warm weather, a false social media story about petrol tanks exploding in hot conditions tends to resurface. This is a complete myth, says the AA's head of road safety, Ian Crowder. ""Cars operate perfectly well in temperature extremes across the world - whether inside the Arctic Circle or in equatorial countries,"" he says. ""Cars fuel tanks are designed with a venting system that allows for the relatively small expansion and contraction of the fuel between temperature extremes. ""There is absolutely no risk that simply filling the tank will increase the risk of an explosion."" The NHS suggests keeping rooms cool by using shades or reflective material outside the windows - or light-coloured curtains which are closed. ""The most sensible option is to use a [electric] fan,"" says Mary Morrell, professor of sleep and respiratory physiology at Imperial College London. ""It will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating."" Thin cotton sheets rather than nylon bedding are also recommended. Prof Kevin Morgan, director of the Clinical Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University, says a lukewarm shower before bed is preferable to a cold shower. Read the BBC Magazine article on sleeping during hot weather  The NHS recommends keeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight and older infants out of the sun as much as possible, particularly in the summer and between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. Sun cream with a high sun-protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids.  The NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual but will not need water as well as breast milk.  If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. Rachel Frost, from Birmingham Dogs Home, has some advice for keeping canines cool this summer. And the RSPCA has released a series of tips for keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave. Read more: Keeping animals cool in the heatwave The NHS says heat exhaustion is not serious and usually gets better when you cool down. But if it turns into heatstroke it needs to be treated as an emergency. Signs of heat exhaustion include dizziness and confusion, loss of appetite, feeling sick and intense thirst. Children may become floppy and sleepy. Signs of heatstroke include temperature of 40C or above, shortness of breath and seizures. The NHS website has the full list of symptoms - and most importantly advice on how to prevent both conditions. Unfortunately for those seeking a day off there are no laws in the UK about when it is too hot to work (or too cold). Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. Londonderry-based employment law specialist Martina McAuley says: ""Employers do need to consider the impact of workplace temperature and have a general duty to ensure the safety, health and welfare of all employees."" But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures.  Read more: When is it too hot to work?

risk appetite,California burglar bear Hank the Tank captured,2024-09-15,2023-08-07,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66429736,"A massive and notoriously mischievous black bear has been captured after more than a year on the run following a string of break-ins in California.  The 500lbs (227kg) bear, known to fans as Hank the Tank, is believed to have broken into 21 homes in the Lake Tahoe area since 2022.  Hank - who is actually a female bear registered as 64F - will be moved to a sanctuary in Colorado.  Her three cubs may be transferred to a facility in California's Sonoma County.  In a statement released on Friday, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) said that biologists had ""safely immobilised"" the bear, who had been linked to 21 break-ins by DNA evidence.  Pending a successful health check, Hank will be taken to the Wild Animal Sanctuary near Springfield, Colorado.  While California authorities have noted that relocation is ""not typically an option"", Hank's fame has given her a reprieve.  ""Given the widespread interest in this bear, and the significant risk of a serious incident involving the bear, CDFW is employing an alternative solution to safeguard the bear family as well as the people in the South Lake Tahoe community,"" the statement said.  Hank's three cubs will be taken to a different facility in Petaluma, California ""in hopes they can discontinue the negative behaviours they learned from the sow and can be returned to the wild"".  On the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, Colorado Governor Jared Polis welcomed Hank - and joked that she should have been named ""Henrietta the Tank"".  Hank was originally believed to have been responsible for over 40 break-ins, but DNA samples proved that the break-ins were also the work of at least two other large bears with a voracious appetite for human food.  The discovery that Hank was not alone in the crime spree prompted California officials to reassure the public that ""no bears will be euthanised, harmed, relocated to some facility or placed in a zoo"".  Biologists believe that Hank, who is considerably larger than most black bears, had grown unafraid of humans and had learned to use her strength to force her way into people's homes.  ""When you have a bear forcibly crashing its way through a garage door or ripping open a front door with people inside, that's pretty brazen and unusual,"" CDFW spokesperson Peter Tira told the BBC in February 2022.  The whereabouts and potential fate of the other two bears involved in the spree of California break-ins is unclear.  The BBC has reached out to CDFW for comment. "
risk appetite,Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US,2024-09-15,2018-07-25,By Hervé  Lemahieu,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44702223,"Meeting in Singapore last month, US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un captured the world's attention and promised to work towards ""new relations"". Why have mixed messages followed? At the end of a summit billed as an ""epochal event"", ambitions were set high. North Korea reaffirmed its commitment to the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", while the US said it would stop ""provocative"" war games with South Korea. Things have since taken a rockier path. Although Pyongyang appears to have begun dismantling a rocket site, there have been reports that it is secretly continuing its weapons programme. Meanwhile, Pyongyang has accused the US of ""gangster-like"" tactics. So, why has there been a lack of clear progress? North Korea's notoriety and ability to capture global headlines may have led to its power being overestimated. It appears Pyongyang has sought to disguise a position of relative weakness as one of unqualified strength. It framed the summit as one between equal nuclear powers. In fact, the Lowy Institute ranks North Korea 17th out of 25 countries in its Asia Power Index - an in-depth assessment of the regional distribution of power, using measures including military, economic and cultural influence. North Korea is a misfit power. Despite its new-found confidence as a nuclear-armed country, it remains a weak state preoccupied by its very survival. That its influence is disproportionately dependent on its military strength may, ironically, make it less willing to make serious concessions than the US and others have hoped. North Korea may be one of the top military powers in Asia, but its emphasis is on quantity over quality.  The country's 1.4m military and paramilitary personnel account for about 8% of its working-age population. Only China, Russia and India have larger standing armies.  By comparison, South Korea - which has more than twice the North's population, and compulsory military service - has less than half the armed forces. Pyongyang has large numbers of battle tanks and even its navy maintains a fleet of about 70 ageing submarines. But it is its development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons that enables the regime to make threats far beyond its immediate region. However, to actually use this capability would be to provoke retaliation that would end the regime.   Pyongyang's permanent war footing has come at an enormous cost. The country spends upwards of 24% of its GDP on the military, the US Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance estimates. This extreme military burden has been justified by invoking a siege mentality among its population, with chronic impoverishment explained away as the result of the actions of foreign aggressors.  The consequence is that, on all non-military measures of resources and influence, North Korea is flatlining. In a dynamic and rapidly growing part of the world, North Korea is falling behind. North Korea's economy, when local prices are taken into account, is roughly the same size as that of Laos, one of the poorest countries in south-east Asia, which has just a quarter of the population. The productivity of North Korea's workers is the lowest in Asia and it suffers from an unusually low share of natural resources. The country relies substantially on imports of food, refined metals and fuel, while its main export to the outside world is coal briquettes. More like this Pyongyang's diplomatic and economic relationships are similarly stunted. Its trade with the region in 2015 amounted to about $6bn, less than 1% of South Korea's total, Lowy Institute research suggests. And yet it does have links with a surprising number of countries. Pyongyang maintains a network of 46 embassies worldwide, just behind New Zealand, and ahead of many other countries, including Singapore. These outposts have often been accused of operating as fronts for illicit activities.  North Korea also makes the best of the few friends it has.  Simply existing next to China benefits North Korea. A mutual defence treaty commits each country to providing military assistance to the other should it be attacked. Economically, Beijing is a lifeline, with trade between the two countries accounting for 87% of North Korea's total trade, according to research by the Lowy Institute. That gives Beijing tremendous power to impose costs on Pyongyang if it so wishes.  Yet North Korea knows that while China has supported UN sanctions, it is likely to steer clear of more punishing measures.  That would risk the collapse of the regime and cause instability on its border. North Korea is a wily survivor, but that is not the same as having broad-based international power.  Indeed, it suffers from what has been described as a ""legitimacy deficit"", particularly when compared with larger, more democratic and more prosperous South Korea. Like its southern counterpart, North Korea claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula.  But it has much less power than its neighbour. South Korea also has a formidable military and its treaty alliance with the US includes extended nuclear deterrence. It wields widespread influence in Asia, with well-developed trade and investment ties. And it has cultural power to match - partly through a voracious regional appetite for K-pop and South Korean soap operas.  South Korea attracts 15.7 million tourists annually from across Asia, compared with the estimated 1.4 million Chinese tourists that visit North Korea each year. By drawing the US president into talks - and partially normalising ties - Mr Kim appears to have played a weak hand well. He praised Singapore's economic success and promised to bring home lessons for North Korea's progress. But he did not agree to a timeframe for denuclearisation.  The US wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons upfront and reap largely economic rewards in return.  Yet it is far from clear that Pyongyang sees economic development as being incompatible with keeping some form of nuclear power.  And its willingness to give up its signature weapons capabilities is likely to depend on whether it thinks reforming into a benign state would risk the collapse of the regime. Even if it felt it could survive, North Korea might well have to submit to being South Korea's junior partner.  It would be decades before income reaches levels seen in South Korea and with only half the population, it would be likely to remain in its shadow. Is that too steep a price for the Kim dynasty to pay?  About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.

risk appetite,'This town got stuck in time but now I love it',2024-09-15,2021-07-24,By Zoe Applegate,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-56744949,"With its golden sands stretching for miles and two piers dating back to the 19th Century, the Norfolk resort of Great Yarmouth was once a mecca for fishermen and holidaymakers. Its fortunes have since waned, with areas of real deprivation. But could the seaside town be bouncing back?  In its fishing industry heyday, boats full of herring would be loaded onto the quayside.  The silver darling, as it was then known, was the town's lifeblood and it was said you could cross the River Yare by walking on the decks of the drifters. Today, work has started on bridging the port in a different way. It is hoped a £120m third river crossing, linking the south of the town and the A47, will relieve pressure on the existing bridges. But this scheme is just one of many big money investments in an area hoping to become the UK's City of Culture in 2025. The title could be very important for the town, where a quarter of neighbourhoods are among the most deprived in England. Earnings, life expectancy, GCSE results and major health measures are all worse than the national average.  One person trying change this is Ruben Cruz. He was 16 when he emigrated from Portugal to join family in Great Yarmouth.  He enrolled on a performing arts course in Norwich but later returned to the seaside town as he liked the community feel. The dancer and curator set up the Reprezent Project social enterprise, which runs arts events and workshops for young people. ""I think these are massive changes,"" the 26-year-old says. ""It is very important to invest in Yarmouth - they have been investing so much, but they have got to do so much. ""It got stuck in time - it used to have the fishing industry - but we need to look at new ways of attracting people. ""It's a place of promise."" He brought Canadian artist Brent Ray Fraser to the town in 2018 for its annual graffiti festival to inspire young people. ""We wanted to bring that guy because we were having issues [with groups of youngsters] outside McDonald's. ""We engaged with them... sometimes you have to take a big step."" Reprezent has painted nine murals across Great Yarmouth, to help give young people pride in their town.  ""We want people to find art. We want to do something amazing for the community that people can enjoy every day. ""Everything I'm doing is to make an example for my three-year-old son... I found myself here and I'm loving it."" At a glance: What is happening in Great Yarmouth? After years working in London and Italy, fashion designer Sophie Miller returned to her home town and later launched the heritage brand Yarmouth Oilskins for its 123-year-old parent company Yarmouth Stores. ""From a designer's point of view, it's like a treasure trove - because we've been in our building for over 100 years we've been so lucky… we have rails of clothes going back 100 years,"" she says. Waxed coats, denim smocks and bucket hats, based on patterns found at its quayside factory and hand-sewn by a 20-strong team, have proved a hit in Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Australia. ""In Asia they have an appetite for all things British and they are passionate about history. ""The workwear trend is really big there."" The label, which produces about 18,000 unisex garments a year, has also just had a New York boutique join its stockists.  She says some people ""talk Yarmouth down"" but she believes the investment is giving people more confidence. ""It's really important and provides a positive message, which gives the ripple effect for businesses. ""It will take a bit more momentum - that's not going to be overnight, but in five years we'll be in good stead,"" she says. Florist Caroline Gummer had been going to Great Yarmouth on holiday for years and decided to relocate there from Kent. After adopting three children she realised her dream and opened a town centre shop - just six months before the first lockdown. ""As a family we went from nought to three children overnight, but I couldn't work a normal job with all the extra bits that come with adoption,"" she says. By last autumn, she was becoming disenchanted by the number of neighbouring empty premises in the Victoria Arcade. ""I was tired of the negative comments - nothing's open, nobody comes down here, there's nothing in Yarmouth,"" she says.  So she asked the landlords if she could advertise shops on social media and have the keys to show potential clients.  It resulted in nine shops opening and the arcade is now almost full again. ""I'm ever so happy it's revitalised. ""This is a dream and one I would never have achieved in Kent due to the prices of shops - it's exactly where I want to be, doing what I want to do, living in a place I love,"" she says. Former town mayoress Sara Smith set up her café perched on the edge of the resort's golden sands and in the shadow of Great Yarmouth's famous Pleasure Beach in 1999.  She gets up at 06:00 through the summer to meet the demand for freshly-baked goods at Sara's Tea Rooms. ""I've never sold a cake in here that I haven't made,"" the 70-year-old says. She launched it with her late husband Tony, a long-serving borough councillor and mayor, and now runs it with her son Matt, 42. The pair have been buoyed this year by the string of investments, in contrast to their feelings last year. ""I spent three months on the verge of a breakdown, of 'are we going to get through this?',"" Matt says.   ""Last season we ran with six tables inside, we would normally have 23 inside - we lost two-fifths of our seats. ""Did we earn a living out of it? Yes. But at the start... it was a time of massive panic."" He says visitor numbers are currently looking good, partly due to the arrival of the big wheel. ""Not everybody wants to ride it, but everybody wants to look at it. ""And I think what they've done with the Marina Centre will be a massive, massive boost... the building felt tired and unloved."" More people are set to holiday at home this summer, but do they think the trend will continue? ""Next year there will be more people going abroad - and we will be competing with that - but we will have done the work, so people will say 'I've been there during Covid times and I'm going to go abroad, but I'm also going to go there,"" Matt says. ""So many people over the years have put Great Yarmouth down, but it is a place to be proud of,"" Sara says. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

risk appetite,We had the same cancer as Andy Goram,2024-09-15,2022-05-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61647707,"Former Rangers and Scotland goalkeeper Andy Goram has revealed he has oesophageal cancer and been given about six months to live.  Goram, 58, told the Daily Record he turned down chemotherapy as it would only extend his life by three months.  Two people who have been treated for the disease, sometimes known as a ""silent killer"", have spoken to BBC Scotland about their experience.  Paul Sinclair, from Kirkcaldy in Fife, started to experience what ""felt like wind at the bottom of my rib-cage"" in September 2020 and had a sensation that he had ""eaten too much in one mouthful"".  ""I ignored it like everyone else does,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. ""It just felt like I had wind. I was eating fine, I had no pain.  ""It was just an annoying niggle at the bottom of my rib-cage. It went on for about a week-and-a-half and then I thought 'I'm going to see someone about this'.  ""I went to the doctor and he sent me straight for an endoscopy. That confirmed I had a tumour at the top of my stomach."" His experience is similar to that of Goram, who said he ignored heartburn symptoms after being unable to book a face-to-face GP appointment.  Paul went through four sessions of chemotherapy over an eight-week period before a six-week break. Then he had an 11-hour operation, which also included the removal of his spleen, before another six-week break prior to more ""very aggressive chemotherapy"". ""I was very ill with both sessions of chemo,"" he said. ""The second one was worse because you are already weak after the operation.  ""As you recover you have to start learning to eat again, how to chew your food properly, have small portions and a lot of meals throughout the day."" Three years later, he is able to get back to the gym to do light training - but things will never be ""totally normal"".  ""You have just got to stay positive and be thankful for every day you wake up,"" he said.  ""The important thing is it wasn't particularly major symptoms I had, but it is really important not to ignore it and to get it checked."" The oesophagus is the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. The main symptoms of the cancer are: Others include: Source: www.nhs.uk Linda Moffat, from Auchterarder, Perth and Kinross, considered herself a fit 48-year-old who rode horses every day until December 2014. Then she ""started to feel my food go down - it was just kind of sticking,"" she recalled. ""The pain progressed and the food was getting stuck.   ""I was having to be sick to un-block it. I just thought it was an ulcer. We just thought 'Ach, it is going to be nothing'."" After a while she ""plucked up the courage to speak to the doctor"" and was put on antacids. But the symptoms continued and she was sent for an endoscopy.  That revealed a ""very advanced tumour"" at the junction of her oesophagus and the start of a ""very long, difficult journey"". ""It's a very aggressive cancer and really brutal surgery - eight hours in theatre,"" she said. ""You've got chemotherapy before and after. You have to learn to eat again.  ""You have lots of problems with sickness and diarrhoea and pain. I don't think you're ever fully recovered.  ""I am very lucky. My cancer was very advanced and I was only given a 20% chance of survival.  ""But I'm nearly seven years on now and I'm very happy to be alive and very grateful to everyone who helped me to be here.""  Ms Moffat said reading about Goram's diagnosis and others suffering with oesophageal cancer was ""absolutely heart-breaking"". ""It's often called the silent killer because the symptoms vary so much,"" she added. ""You just hope and pray people get to the doctor early enough.""  Caroline Geraghty, a specialist nurse at Cancer Research UK, said the risk of oesophageal cancer rises with ""the usual things"" such as smoking, alcohol and weight gain, as well as chewing tobacco.  ""But having an increased risk doesn't mean you will definitely go on and get cancer,"" she pointed out. ""For most people, we don't know why they get oesophageal cancer."" Ms Geraghty urged anyone who thinks they may have symptoms to go to their GP ""to be on the safe side"". ""As we know, the earlier you get to a cancer, the better the chances you have,"" she added.  Statistics from Public Health Scotland released on Tuesday showed 155,405 NHS patients were waiting to be seen for the eight key diagnostic tests on 31 March. Numbers have gone up 10% in the first three months of the year and are 75% higher than the average before the pandemic. David Ferguson, of Cancer Research UK in Scotland, said it was ""unacceptable"" that people were waiting too long for tests to determine whether they have cancer. Ms Geraghty added that for the majority of patients, their symptoms will not be cancer-related. ""You can understand why some GPs won't go straight to endoscopy to investigate - some people just need antacids,"" she said. ""But there will be some individuals who maybe need to be sent for investigation quicker."" "
risk appetite,Vale: The pride of Brazil becomes its most hated company,2024-09-15,2019-01-30,By Daniel Gallas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47056849,"As Brazil is coming to grips with what may be the worst industrial accident in the country's history, the national mood is rapidly shifting from grief to outrage. So far all focus has been on retrieving bodies, but too much time has already passed since last Friday's breaking of the Feijão dam, in the town of Brumadinho. Now investigators, politicians, business leaders and society are turning their attention to Vale - the company that runs the dam. They want answers to the following questions:  Vale isn't just any company in Brazil. It is one of its most prized success stories in business, and along with Petrobras and Embraer remains one of the few national players to have achieved a truly competitive status on a global scale. Today, it is the world's fourth largest mining company, with revenues of $34bn (£26bn; €30bn) in 2017 - the number one producer and exporter of iron ore. It is such an important player in commodities that global iron ore prices spiked 5.8% after the accident, as any glitch in Vale operations can cause disruptions of supply in the markets.  Vale is also the second most-traded share in Brazil's stock exchange, behind Petrobras. Formerly known as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (the River Doce Valley Company), it was created by the government in the 1940s during a period of intense industrialisation of Brazil, that was coupled with the state's desire to seize control of strategic natural resources in the country. In the late 1990s, Vale was privatised and since then it has undergone a period of rapid expansion, often winning awards for its management, and even for sustainable initiatives. It is now owned by a diverse group of shareholders that include a private bank, Brazilian pension funds and the government. But the Vale that is emerging from the crisis now is a starkly different company. On Monday, it saw almost $20bn wiped off its stock market value as the share price plunged almost 20%. As investors were dumping the stock, protestors threw mud in Vale's headquarters in Rio and painted ""murderers"" and ""it was not an accident"" on its façade. The company already had its image severely tarnished after the breaking of the Samarco dam - a joint venture with BHP Billiton - near the city of Mariana in 2015. A structural failure in the dam killed 19 people and polluted much of the River Doce. The disaster saw Samarco - the Vale and BHP Billiton joint venture - paying out billions in compensation and setting up Foundation Renova, a body supposed to help victims rebuild their lives and restore the river. But there was much controversy on both fronts. Families complain that the Foundation never found a proper compensation formula to establish how much each person should get. Some fishermen, affected by a fishing ban in the River Doce, complain that their pay packages are way below their old incomes. They say many people who never depended on the river are also claiming compensation and that the Foundation does a poor job in evaluating each case. The Foundation acknowledged the problems but said it had to rely on people's good faith. Although the Foundation is independently run from Samarco, with a separate board, the communities around the River Doce see it as a mere extension of the company. Three years on, the mood in the towns is of desolation, with unemployment and alcoholism plaguing families. The legal process also became bogged down. More than 20 people - including Samarco executives - were charged with various crimes, including homicide, but a trial date was never set. No one was convicted or jailed. In 2017, Samarco managed to get a court order suspending criminal proceedings, on the grounds that that investigators allegedly used illegal wire-tapping when gathering evidence. And Samarco is still contesting environmental fines imposed by government agencies. Despite all these problems, many communities in the Minas Gerais region of Brazil are supportive of mining. They rely on the industry for their livelihoods. Vale and BHP Billiton are still working on reopening the Samarco operation, which has remained closed since 2015. Vale managed to rebuild itself in the aftermath of the 2015 crisis, with robust profits and great prospects for the coming years. But after the recent Feijão accident, the company is under greater pressure than ever before.  This is shaping up to be the worst human tragedy in the history of Brazil's industry.  Five people have been arrested already. Billions have been frozen in assets in Brazil and a class action has already been filed in the US by investors. Companies that work with Vale are also being targeted.  Two workers from Tüv Süd - a German company that assessed safety conditions in Feijão - were amongst those arrested. Vale has announced that it will decommission all 10 remaining ""tailings"" dams of this type, which are often made from earth and used to store the often toxic mining by-products. It says it will investigate more expensive waste management options and significantly reduce its output. Jimena Blanco, an analyst for Verisk Maplecroft, says the Feijão accident could mark severe changes in Brazil, the mining industry and Vale. Investors worldwide will have less appetite for high-environmental risk opportunities, she believes.  And Brazil's new President Jair Bolsonaro - who wants to relax environmental restrictions on the mining industry - may have to review his stance. ""We expect community opposition to the industry stemming from concerns over water usage, pollution and soil contamination to increase, both against new and existing projects,"" says Ms Blanco, ""In addition, there will be greater scrutiny from civil society and international environmental activists."" In recent years a large scale corporate scandal involving another formerly beloved company, Petrobras, prompted a long debate and regulatory changes in the way Brazil deals with corporate corruption and political financing. This second Vale tragedy could force Brazilians to hold a long-overdue debate about the environmental effect exploitation of its natural resources is having."
risk appetite,"Pets can catch Covid from owners, study suggests",2024-09-15,2021-07-01,By Jim Reed,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57666245,"Covid is common in pet cats and dogs whose owners have the disease, research suggests. Swabs were taken from 310 pets in 196 households where a human infection had been detected. Six cats and seven dogs returned a positive PCR result, while 54 animals tested positive for virus antibodies. ""If you have Covid, you should avoid contact with your cat or dog, just as you would do with other people,"" Dr Els Broens, from Utrecht University, said. ""The main concern is not the animals' health but the potential risk that pets could act as a reservoir of the virus and reintroduce it into the human population."" The authors of the study said no evidence of pet-to-owner transmission had been recorded to date but it would be difficult to detect while the virus was still spreading easily between humans. Most infected pets tend to be asymptomatic or display mild Covid symptoms.  Researchers from Utrecht University sent a mobile veterinary clinic to households in the Netherlands that had tested positive for Covid at some point in the past 200 days. Swabs were taken from their pet cats and dogs to test for evidence of a current infection, while blood samples were also tested for antibodies suggesting a past exposure to Covid. The results were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases: Follow-up tests showed all the PCR-positive (polymerase chain reaction) animals cleared the infection and went on to develop antibodies. The researchers say the most likely route of virus transmission is from human to animal, rather than the other way round. ""We can't say there is a 0% risk of owners catching Covid from their pets,""  Veterinary Microbiological Diagnostic Centre Dr Broens said. ""At the moment, the pandemic is still being driven by human-to-human infections, so we just wouldn't detect it."" Vets in Russia have started vaccinating some animals against the disease. But Dr Broens said: ""I don't see the scientific evidence for that now.  ""It seems unlikely that pets play a role in the pandemic."" A separate study run by the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, found cats that slept on their owner's bed seemed to be at particular risk of infection.  A total of 48 cats and 54 dogs from 77 households were tested for Covid antibodies and their owners asked about their interaction with their pets.  About 67% of the owned cats and 43% of the owned dogs tested positive, compared with 9% of dogs and cats from an animal shelter and 3% of stray cats in the area. A quarter of the pets displayed a symptom of the disease, from loss of appetite to difficulty breathing.  And although most cases were mild, three were severe.   The study's authors said cats' biology may make them more susceptible to Covid.  Cats are also more likely to sleep near their owner's face than dogs, increasing their exposure to any infection. Cambridge University veterinary medicine department head Prof James Wood said the two studies added to other evidence suggesting a substantial proportion of cats and dogs may catch the virus from their owners. ""The Dutch study is robustly conducted and shows that around 20% of exposed pets may be infected and that they eventually clear the infection just as most humans do,"" he said.  ""Most reports are that this infection appears to be asymptomatic.  ""It also seems that the virus does not normally transmit from dogs and cats to either other animals or their owners."""
risk appetite,UK's special forces set for new Russia mission,2024-09-15,2019-06-13,By Mark Urban,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48624982,"The SAS and other UK Special Forces (UKSF) are poised to receive a new mission countering Russian and other forces around the world. The plan is called 'Special Operations Concept' and has been drawn up by the senior officer in charge of the special forces, the Director Special Forces (DSF). According to people familiar with what's in it, part of the concept involves changing both the structure of the military's secretive units and what they do. The plan is currently being considered by military chiefs, Whitehall insiders tell me, and will soon be sent to ministers and is likely to be approved. The Ministry of Defence has said it does not comment on the UK Special Forces. UK Special Forces are meant to provide more options for low-profile actions in places where overtly committing conventional troops would be difficult. For example, under the new plan, an operation might be mounted in a Baltic republic or African country in order to uncover and pinpoint Russian covert activities.  Then a decision would be made as to whether to make public what had been learned, or to cooperate secretly with local security forces in order to disrupt it.  The new missions would take UKSF units in a less ""kinetic"" or violent direction - after almost 20 years of man-hunting strike missions in the Middle East and Afghanistan - and into closer cooperation with allied intelligence agencies and MI6.  ""The counter-terrorist task is drawing down, while the need to confront dangerous international behaviour by peer adversaries is increasing,"" says one source.  Following the defeat of the last pocket of Islamic State group, missions in Syria and Iraq are declining.  And so in staking out new territory, the DSF seems to be trying to give new priorities to the units under their command at a time of financial stringency.  There are three main elements of the UK's Special Forces: the regular Special Air Service regiment (22 SAS), the Special Boat Service (SBS), and Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR).  The role of the SRR, which carries out covert surveillance, would grow under the Special Operations Concept.  Military chiefs believe Russia has been using its military intelligence arm, the GRU, effectively in Ukraine, Syria and Africa.  ""Right now, you do nothing or you escalate,"" one senior officer says.  ""We want to expand that competitive space."" The UK government has said the GRU was behind the 2018 Salisbury attack, in which Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a nerve agent. At a London conference earlier this month, Chief of General Staff General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith referred to ""authoritarian regimes"" rather than mentioning Russia by name, noting they had managed to ""exploit that hybrid space between those two increasingly redundant states of 'peace' and 'war'"".   This type of unstated conflict between states is often referred to as ""the grey zone"".  Recent attacks on tankers in the Gulf are an example of this, with states - believed to be Iran, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates - acting covertly, either directly or through proxies.   Experts across the West are seeking out the right responses to hostile acts that fall short of the threshold of all-out war. Such responses could include an increased emphasis on information and cyber operations.   The SRR is trained in a variety of techniques including physical and technical surveillance, such as planting cameras in insurgent-held territory, eavesdropping and close-proximity hacking.  It remains up for debate whether this new concept would see the stepping up of a shadow war against proxy forces - serving the interests of countries such as China, Iran and Russia - that could occasionally turn violent. British politicians' appetite for risk is limited and the capture of a party of Special Forces operators and MI6 officers in Libya eight years ago showed the potential for embarrassment that comes with such missions.

risk appetite,'I caught Covid twice and worry I'll get it again',2024-09-15,2021-02-15,By Emma Clifford Bell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-56049680,"A Scottish care worker has revealed how she caught Covid twice within seven months. Michelle Lamont, from Ardrossan in North Ayrshire, tested positive for the virus in April 2020. But the 50-year-old was ""stunned"" when routine testing picked up the infection again in November. After becoming ill for a second time, she is now concerned about the possibility of suffering the debilitating symptoms again. Walking her dog along the beach at Saltcoats, Ms Lamont shared her fears with BBC Scotland's The Nine programme. She said: ""I was devastated when I tested positive for the first time,"" she says. ""If I can get it twice, what's to say I can't get it a third time? That plays on my mind."" The first time around, Ms Lamont was exhausted and did not return to work for five weeks. ""It was just horrible. I've never felt so ill in my life,"" she said. ""I had a slight cough and a temperature but the headache was the worst. It was like a migraine, it just didn't go. The palpitations were really hard because it felt like a weight on my chest.  ""It was just a horrible feeling. I had no focus - I couldn't even watch television or listen to music and I had no appetite."" The mother-of-three said she worried more for her family than for herself. She said: ""My oldest daughter, Courtnay, wore PPE and she looked after me. ""I was scared. You're just lying thinking what if I've given this to my family? I've got vulnerable family members as well and I was thinking I'd never forgive myself."" After several months of negative PCR tests and feeling well again, it was ""an absolute shock"" to be told of another positive result.  ""I remember I got tested on a Friday. I felt ok and I had no symptoms at all,"" she said. ""On the Saturday at about 19:00, Public Health Scotland phoned me and said sorry, but you're positive. ""I burst out crying because I thought - I can't go through that again."" Michelle was in the middle of preparing dinner for the family and getting ready for work but had to immediately go back into self-isolation. After several days, Michelle gradually became unwell again.  She said: ""The headache was there and it wouldn't go this time. I had the temperature, the fatigue and the palpitations came back. This time it lasted around 10 days."" She now wants other people to know that it is possible to be re-infected. ""I didn't realise it could happen again and that's with taking all the right precautions. My doctor, she was stunned. People are in denial that it can happen again. They look at you as if you're daft. They don't believe you but yes, it can."" Ms Lamont says she feels lucky to be well again and is looking forward to getting some normality back. She said: ""I just want an end to this, like everyone else. If people follow the rules, I'm very hopeful."" Experts warn some people do catch Covid-19 again - and can infect others. A recent study led by Public Health England (PHE) found that most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months. Past infection was linked to around an 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. However, the new coronavirus has not been around long enough to know a lot about how long immunity lasts. PHE's ongoing study on immunity in healthcare workers found 44 potential re-infections in a group of 6,614 people who had previously had the virus. Researchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. Scientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different. Asked if it was aware of any cases of re-infection, Public Health Scotland said it was looking at possible Covid-19 reinfection and planned to publish a report in due course.  A spokesman added: ""It is too soon to draw any conclusions as to what the findings of this report will be."""
risk appetite,Talks on lifting football's booze ban,2024-09-15,2018-10-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45970058,"Talks have taken place that could lead to the lifting of the ban on the sale of alcohol at Scottish football grounds, BBC Scotland has learned.  The Scottish FA, Police Scotland and Scottish government officials have met to explore the idea of using the Euro 2020 matches at Hampden as a pilot. As it stands, Glasgow would be the only one of 12 host cities where fans could not buy alcohol in the stadium. It is understood some bodies involved are open to the idea of ending the ban. Police Scotland said it would be prepared to discuss changes. But Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said it needed widespread public consultation to prove there was an appetite for it. The ban was initially imposed following a riot at the 1980 Scottish Cup final between Rangers and Celtic. It means no alcohol can be served in football stadiums, although there is an exemption for corporate hospitality areas. Any change in Scotland would require government legislation. The Euro 2020 championships could be the catalyst for change. European football governing body Uefa has decided to relax its own rules on the sale of alcohol during its competitions. This means the 12 cities across Europe that will stage matches can now sell alcohol if local laws allow it. Hampden Stadium in Glasgow will stage three group stage games and one last-16 match. The issue of alcohol in Scottish football has polarised opinion since a ban was introduced in 1980.  The nature of the Hampden riot and the outrage that followed, meant there was little opposition when the rules were changed.  Scotland was shamed into banning booze.  But a new generation of fans feel they are being punished for the sins of the past.  They are not asking to bring crates of lager or large bottles of cider into matches across the country, they simply want to be treated like fans of others sports who can buy a beer whilst watching from the stands.  Now the shame that saw it outlawed from football could force its return.  There are influential figures within the game, the government and the police, who are keen that Hampden isn't the only host city of Euro 2020 where fans can't buy alcohol in the ground.  The thought of having to explain why, has forced a rethink.  Those against are once again mobilising though - the Scottish Police Federation says the risk is just too great.  It's been discussed many times since 1980 but this time feels different.  The thirst for change has never been greater. The Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said it would strongly oppose the idea. It said there was evidence that football authorities were already struggling to manage crowds appropriately. David Hamilton, the SPF's vice chairman, said: ""We don't have the same problems in rugby stadia that we do in football.  ""We don't see toilets being trashed, we don't see pyrotechnics.  ""They are particular problems for football and the idea of adding alcohol to that mix does not seem to make sense."" Dr Richard Purves from the Institute of Social Marketing at Stirling University is studying the link between alcohol and football. He told the BBC: ""When you mention something about alcohol availability in Scottish grounds, you will immediately assume Celtic and Rangers. ""I know there are talks ongoing to change the regulations but I don't see this being the case for big high-risk games.  ""There needs to be more research in this area which answers questions like, why do people drink when they attend football games? how much are they drinking? Does this cause any harm? Then, how should government respond to try to limit any potential harm?"" In England, where there were similar problems in the 1980s, alcohol can be sold within the stadium but cannot be drunk ""in view of the pitch"". This prevents fans from drinking while in their seats but allows booze to be sold before the match and at half-time. Dundee FC's managing director John Nelms said he was in favour of something similar in Scotland. He said: ""We're in the entertainment business and having a beer and watching the match with your mates would be fantastic.  ""Just a few weeks ago I was at the Man City v Liverpool match and they had beer at that game.  ""They are football fans and they behaved appropriately. ""I know there have been problems in the past but in the modern day, I think it's much less of an issue. I also think it would help boost attendances, especially for the smaller clubs."" Andrew Niven, the Scottish Football Association's man in charge of staging the Euro 2020 matches, said he was aware of Uefa giving permission to sell alcohol in stadiums. He said: ""While we are open to exploring this, further discussions would be required with the Scottish government, Police Scotland and other stakeholders to properly assess the feasibility of legislative change.""  A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We will continue to discuss these issues with Police Scotland, the Scottish FA and a wide range of other organisations to ensure our national game is safe and enjoyable for all.""

risk appetite,The man giving dignified burial to Covid-19 victims,2024-09-15,2020-04-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52380573,"For three decades, Abdul Malabari has been an undertaker for unclaimed bodies. But he never thought he would have to bury people whose families wanted to say goodbye but couldn't because of Covid-19. BBC Gujarati's Shaili Bhatt reports. ""My work has no fixed timings,"" says the 51-year-old undertaker. ""As soon as we get a call, we proceed with the kit."" Every time someone dies of coronavirus in Surat - in India's western state of Gujarat - officials call Mr Malabari. So far the city has recorded 19 deaths, and 244 active cases. There are 3,548 in Gujarat.  ""In such difficult times, Abdul bhai [brother] has been of great help,"" says Ashish Naik, Surat's deputy commissioner.  Mr Malabari says this is his job, and so he agreed to do it, despite the risk. His team now eat and sleep at the office of their charities, to protect their families from infection.  It is not the first time Mr Malabari has gone above and beyond for people he does not know. It was his compassion for a stranger three decades ago  - when a different disease was snaking its way through the population - which led to his work today. The stranger's name was Sakina, and she was suffering from HIV. Her husband and son had brought her to hospital, but then disappeared. Efforts to track them down after her death proved fruitless. And so, she had been lying in the morgue for a month. Local officials were desperate, and put an appeal out for a Muslim volunteer who would take on her burial. Mr Malabari, then just 21, was touched by the advert and decided to help. He contacted the only organisation in Surat that was burying unclaimed bodies, but they told him the man who did the job was travelling so they would have to wait for him to return.  ""I felt it was unfair,"" Mr Malabari says. So he went to the hospital and told officials that he would bury Sakina. Her body, he recalls today, ""was stinking"". But he was not put off, approaching some women he knew to bathe the body as per Islamic custom. But they refused, he says, because Sakina had HIV, which was still little understood in 1990. So Mr Malabari decided to do it himself, pouring buckets of water over her body, before taking her for burial.  He says that's when he realised Surat couldn't rely on just one man for this job. ""It took me a whole day, and I also realised I could not do this alone.""  So he started his charity. He says his family, which runs a textile business, was initially against it.  ""I remember telling them how Islam says its every citizen's duty to help and carry out a person's final journey out of humanity and respect. I was just doing that as a fellow human being."" Today, there is as much fear surrounding the bodies of those who die with Covid-19 - although with far more reason as, although health experts say the virus cannot transmit after death, it can survive on clothes for a few hours. So once the body is sealed in a bag, no-one, not even family, can see it.  Mr Malabari and his team take all the precautions - they wear masks, gloves and gowns. They have also been trained on how to prepare the bodies. First, they spray the body with chemicals and then they wrap it in plastic to avoid contamination, before transporting it in one of the two vans reserved for Covid-19 victims. The vehicles are sanitised after every trip, and the cemetery or crematorium is disinfected after each funeral.  Even so, fears over the virus have led to protests in some Indian cities by people who live close to the graveyards. Mr Malabari says he has also encountered some trouble, but he has been able to reason with people so far.   The hardest part, he says, is dealing with families who can't say goodbye - many of them are also under quarantine.  ""They cry a lot and talk about seeing the deceased. We explain to them that it's for their own safety and assure them that we will make the arrangements according to their religious customs.""  He says sometimes a family member has been allowed to observe from afar: ""We take them in a separate vehicle and ask them to stand at a distance and pray. Things have also changed a lot in Surat since he buried Sakina all those years ago,  Now, he says, his three children - a daughter and two sons - are ""happy"" and ""proud"" of him. His charity has since grown to 35 volunteers and has some 1,500 donors, as well as the help and support of officials.  What he's most proud of, he adds, is that his team includes people of all faiths and castes.  ""We have Hindu volunteers who bury the bodies of Muslims, and Muslim volunteers who cremate the bodies of Hindus.""    Most often, he says, they end up with the bodies of the homeless or runways who are never identified.   ""We find bodies in rivers and canals, on railway tracks. We sometimes deal with decomposed bodies."" He says the effect of what they do is hard to express but, over the years, it has affected his sleep, appetite and even his ability to enjoy time with his family.  But he has never considered stopping.  ""In my heart I feel a sense of satisfaction from doing this that nothing else will ever give me."" "
risk appetite,Sweet firms try to sugar coat price rises,2024-09-15,2023-05-10,By Elizabeth Hotson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65532112,"It's 10am and I'm already 15 minutes late for my first appointment. The mind-bogglingly expansive floor space at ISM Cologne, the giant, annual sweets and snacks fair in Germany, has beaten me again. It's heralded as the biggest confectionery trade event in the world, and when I was last here, in 2019, I was looking at how the industry was dealing with the introduction of sugar taxes. In 2023 a whole new issue is front and centre - rocketing sugar and cocoa prices. In amongst the brightly lit stands vying for attention, one brand name really stands out - ""Toxic Waste"". It is an extra sour sweet that is sold in containers made to look like mini industrial waste drums. In the words of Hayley Peyron, marketing manager at US-based Candy Dynamics which makes the sweets: ""The whole purpose around our candy is that it's supposed to be something so sour it almost needs to be contained."" And because the product is aimed at children, the company needs to be sensitive about passing on higher sugar costs, according to Ms Peyron. ""We've had conversations with our manufacturers about how we can get it to a price point that is still comparable to what we've had in the past,"" she says. ""Because the last thing we want is there to be a huge price increase so kids can no longer afford it with their allowance. We've increased prices, but by a small amount, it would be within about 10%."" Another option is to decrease pack sizes, according to Ms Peyron. ""We have started to do that, especially in the UK where there's been a big request for smaller pack sizes. And we try to provide a variety in the sizing, so that any consumer at any price point can enjoy the candy."" There are numerous ways of buying cocoa and sugar, but the prices quoted on the commodities markets are used as a benchmark indicator of the cost. At the end of April, raw sugar was trading at more than 27 cents (22p) per pound, the highest it has been since 2011. Meanwhile cocoa is hovering around $3,000 a tonne, the highest since 2016.  There's a multitude of factors behind rising prices, from bad weather, to the war in Ukraine, according to Diana Gomes, an analyst at market research group Bloomberg Intelligence. ""The sugar price has been surging recently, because we are expecting a shortfall in terms of production, and the weather risk is really what's driving this inflationary pressure,"" she says. This weather concern is focused on the growing expectation of meteorologists that 2023 will experience the latest El Niño climatic phenomenon. Caused by warm water in the western Pacific Ocean moving eastwards, it results in much higher levels of rainfall in South America. For Brazil, the world's biggest producer of sugar cane, this would mean reduced yields, as the water would both disrupt harvesting and lower the sucrose content of the plants. The El Niño is tipped to start around August, and would be the first since 2019. It comes after India, the world's second-largest sugar cane producer, has already seen lower yields this year due to excess rain. Some 80% of the world's sugar supply comes from sugar cane, with sugar beet providing the remainder. Ms Gomes says that beet production in Europe has also been affected by the weather. ""In Europe, the dry summers over the last few years, and drought, means production has been hurt,"" she says. The climate is also having an impact on cocoa crops, according to Ms Gomes. ""Cocoa has passed the psychological barrier of $3,000 a tonne, and that is being driven by weather concerns, as well as the fact that the Ivory Coast and Ghana, two of the major cocoa-producing countries, have been struggling with very expensive fertilisers.""  Russia is a major exporter of fertiliser, and the war in Ukraine has impacted supplies, adding costs to farmers around the world, and eventually therefore to consumers. Combine this with global wage inflation and price increases in other areas of the supply chain, and it means confectionery companies are having to make some difficult choices. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. At the premium end of the market, Swiss firm Goldkenn specialises in making chocolates for the duty free, airport shopping market. Its range includes bars and coins covered in golden foil, so as to look like solid gold bullion. It also has tie-ups with brands such as Jack Daniels and Captain Morgan for its line of liqueur chocolates and bars. Linda Gay, the company's export manager, is philosophical about the challenges facing the business, where the US is the biggest market. ""We need to increase our prices because of transport, cocoa, sugar and packaging, but consumers are ready to pay a bit more in order to get the product,"" she says. Even so, Ms Gay says that there's a limit to how much people will pay, and that savings have to be made in other areas, ""We pay attention to everything, we try to get better quotations for transport, then for packaging we try to group and do a bigger volume at the same time to get a smaller price."" In another cavernous hall at the vast Koelnmesse exhibition venue where ISM Cologne is being held, Bill Gow, finance director of Scottish stalwart Tunnock's, says that its sales are holding up in the face of soaring costs. The company's popular chocolate products include Teacakes, Caramel Wafer Biscuits and Snowballs. ""Since about March last year, our raw material costs have gone up 40%,"" says Mr Gow. ""We've passed a small element of that to the consumer, but as a company we've taken the long-term view and are financing the vast majority of it."" Like Goldkenn, Tunnock's has been trying to find savings. ""We can run the factory more efficiently,"" says Mr Gow. ""Over the past eight years we've spent approximately £60m on plant and machinery, and that gives us labour efficiencies, and efficiencies in terms of the scrap and yield we've achieved from our raw materials.""  Currently global demand for sweets and chocolates appears to be holding up, as producers try to limit how much they pass cost increases onto customers.  Manufacturers hope that that consumer appetite will remain, especially if prices have to rise sharply in the future."
risk appetite,Can processed food be good for you?,2024-09-15,2023-11-15,Jessica Brown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210521-which-processed-foods-are-better-than-natural,"Processed food conjures up images of unhealthy meals and snacks that have been mass-produced in factories. But can our intervention actually make some foods better for us?    The language used to describe the foods we eat can have a huge effect on how we perceive them: ""organic"", ""artisan"", ""homemade"" and ""handpicked"" foods sound slightly more tempting than the prosaic ""tinned"", ""rehydrated"" or ""freeze-dried"".   Another adjective that can whet our appetites is ""natural"", while we tend to associate ""processed"" food with long lists of ingredients we can't pronounce. But when it comes to our health – is natural always better than processed?   Actually, naturalness doesn't automatically mean a food is healthy, says Christina Sadler, manager at the European Food Information Council and researcher at the University of Surrey. In fact, natural foods can contain toxins, and minimal processing can in fact make them safer. Kidney beans, for instance, contain lectins, which can cause vomiting and diarrhoea. They're removed by soaking the beans in water overnight and then cooking them in boiling water. Processing also makes cow's milk safe to consume. Milk has been pasteurised since the late 1800s, in order to kill harmful bacteria. Before this time, it was distributed locally, because there wasn't good refrigeration in houses. You might also like: ""Cows in cities were milked every day, and people would bring milk in carts back to their neighbourhoods to sell it,"" says John Lucey, food science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""As cities got bigger, milk got further away and took longer to get to the consumer, which meant pathogens could multiply."" Mounting evidence suggesting that some organisms in milk could be harmful led to the development of heating devices for milk and the invention of pasteurisation, which was soon adopted across Europe, and later in the US. ""It's one of the major public health success stories of the last century,"" Lucey says. ""Just before World War Two, around a quarter of all food and waterborne diseases came from milk. Now it's less than 1%."" Processing can also help to retain nutrients in food we eat. For example, freezing, which is classified as minimal processing, allows fruit and vegetables to retain nutrients that can otherwise degrade while sitting in a fridge.   ""Often, vegetables are frozen soon after harvesting, instead of being picked, transported, and then sitting on shelves, losing nutrients,"" Sadler says. Do some ultra-processed foods have health benefits? Not all highly processed foods add to our risk of developing diseases like cancer, new research suggests. Ultra-processed cereals and breads can actually have health benefits because they contain fibre, research commissioned by the World Health Organization found. Even some forms of ultra-processed food previously thought to be harmful – like desserts and meat-free supermarket meals – now emerge as less of a risk to health. But a study in January from Imperial College London showed there was a higher risk of developing cancer in a diet high in ultra-processed foods.   In 2017, a group of researchers each bought fresh vegetables from different grocery stores and analysed their levels of nutrients, including vitamin C and folate, on the day they purchased them and five days later, after storing them in the fridge.  When they compared the frozen and chilled vegetables, they found that they had comparable levels of nutrients. In some cases, the paper found, the frozen vegetables had higher levels than their fridge-stored rivals. Read recipes and more in BBC Good Food’s Beyond Natural section ""There's a misconception that frozen produce isn't as good as its fresh counterparts, but that's truly inaccurate,"" says Ronald Pegg, food science and technology professor at the University of Georgia. Processing also allows vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, calcium and folate, to be added to certain processed foods, including bread and cereal. Such efforts have helped lower several nutrient deficiencies among the general public. This doesn't necessarily make the food nutritionally balanced, however. Processing can also help to preserve food and make it more accessible. Fermenting cheese, for example, keeps it stable for longer, and in some cases, reduces the amount of lactose, making it more accessible to people with mild lactose intolerance. In the past, the main reason food was processed was to increase its shelf life. For a long time, preserving food by adding ingredients such as sugar or salt was crucial in order for people to survive winter, says Gunter Kuhnle, food and nutritional food sciences professor at the University of Reading. ""Processing allowed us to be where we are today, because it prevented us from starving,"" he says. ""A lot of foods need to be processed to be eaten, like bread. We couldn't survive on grains alone."" Adding heat – also a minimal process – makes a lot of foods edible, such as potatoes and mushrooms. ""Tinned tomatoes are a textbook example of processed food being better than fresh,"" says Kuhnle. ""They can be harvested much later when the food is much riper, and processed in a much more gentle way."" And while some processing can make a food less nutritious, it can still make food more accessible. Bacon, for example, doesn't improve health, but it gives more people access to meat by preventing food from spoiling. Processed food also tends to be cheaper, as it can be produced with lower costs. Research has found that healthier foods are three times more expensive than foods that are high in salt, sugar and fat, which are mostly highly processed foods. But highly processed food – which is made from substances derived from foods and additives – is generally not good for us. Studies have shown that food additives can alter our gut bacteria, and cause inflammation in our bodies, which is linked to higher risk of heart disease. Also, research shows that people have a tendency to overeat ultra-processed food. Studies have shown that people who eat ultra-processed foods consume more calories overall and gain more weight, and have higher risk of developing heart disease. One small study from 2019 found that when people ate meals consisting of processed foods for two weeks, they ate 500 more calories per day than they did when they ate meals consisting of unprocessed foods for two weeks. They also gained an average of two pounds on the ultra-processed diet. However, the mechanisms behind why need to be better understood, researchers say. More generally, there seems to be consensus that more research is needed around the effects of processed food on our health. For example, it's still unknown how flavanols and polyphenols – micronutrients found in some plants that have been linked to many health benefits – in fruits are affected by processing, Kuhnle says. ""There's not much information on how processing affects more narrow health benefits. A lot of research focuses on one food, but people don't eat one apple, they eat an entire diet with apples in it, and smoothies and cakes."" While minimal processing has many benefits, the same can't be said for what classification systems call ""ultra-processed"" foods. But there is debate among scientists regarding the definitions and terminology around what constitutes minimal and ""ultra"" processing. Earlier this year, Sadler analysed numerous classification systems that seek to classify processed food. She found no consensus on what factors determine the level of processing, and states that classification criteria are ""ambiguous"" and ""inconsistent"".   Nova is one of the most widely known and used classification systems in food research. It categories food into unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods. According to Nova, ultra-processed foods are made up of fractionated ingredients, and contain little or no whole foods. But the definitions of ultra-processed food varies between publications, and there is ongoing debate about these definitions. ""There isn't a good definition of processing. The public has the idea, when they hear the word 'processing', that the whole food is taken apart and put back together again, but it could be as simple as heating or cooling,"" Lucey says. There is a debate about whether public health nutrition policies should focus more on the degree of food processing, rather than food's nutritional profiles. But is there anything inherently bad about processing? One group of scientists wrote in a 2017 paper: ""To our knowledge no arguments have been offered as to how, or if, food processing in any way constitutes a risk to consumer health through adverse nutrient intake or chemical or microbiological hazards."" However, it’s worth noting that the lead author serves on scientific committees for food producers Nestlé and Cereal Partners Worldwide. While ultra-processed foods typically contain fewer nutrients than minimally processed foods, fortified foods – where micronutrients are added during the food’s production to improve public health – play an important role in public health, they argue. While some studies show that ultra-processed foods fill us up less and leave us needing to eat more, the paper's authors argue that some processing is also used to lower the number of calories in some foods, such as semi-skimmed milk and low-fat spreads. Some ultra-processed foods can be linked to bad health outcomes, but all processed food shouldn't be tarred with the same brush. Frozen vegetables, pasteurised milk or boiled potatoes, for example, can be better for us than their unprocessed counterparts. But here's the key: all of those foods also all very closely resemble their natural form; and this is what we should bear in mind. As long as we can recognise a processed food as being close to its natural form, having them in our diet may even be good for us. * This story was originally published in May 2021 but has been updated in light of new research. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

risk appetite,The tree boosting Brazilan beef,2024-09-15,2021-06-30,Ellen Nemitz,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210629-the-australian-tree-cutting-brazilian-beefs-emissions,"With the help of the fast-growing eucalyptus tree, Brazil has created its first carbon-neutral beef. Cows are no strangers to methane. As a cow goes about its daily life, browsing through pasture or chewing the cud in the shade of a tree, it will typically emit 70-120kg (150-260lb) methane a year. This methane is a potent greenhouse gas, trapping heat in the atmosphere many times more efficiently than CO2 does. To reduce these climate-warming emissions, switching to a plant-based diet has been found to be an effective solution, and reducing consumption of beef in particular as it is a high-carbon meat. But the human appetite for beef has nonetheless been growing steadily for decades: today around 72 million tonnes of beef are produced a year. That's about 12.5 times the weight of the Pyramid of Giza. One country with a big incentive to make its beef more sustainable is Brazil, the world's largest exporter of beef, providing almost 20% of the world's exports. Researchers at the state-owned Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) have been searching for a way to counteract the emissions from the country's massive cattle herd – culminating in 2020 with a certified brand of Carbon Neutral Beef. Rather than simply paying for offsets to make up for emissions (an approach that can be fraught with difficulties), Embrapa has aimed to make the process of cattle-rearing carbon neutral within the farm, in an approach it hopes could make the country's carbon-intensive beef industry more sustainable. Brazil's incentive to clean up its beef industry is not just about carbon emissions. The country is also where a third of the world's tropical deforestation for commercial use happens. One of the main commercial uses of that deforested land is farming cattle. Worldwide, 2.11 million hectares of forest is lost each year to graze cows. Forest loss for cattle farming releases about 6% of the world's greenhouse gases, including the long-lived greenhouse gas CO2, as well as the methane from the cows and more methane emitted from soils. Meanwhile, the forest loss culls biodiversity and increases the risk of new diseases jumping to humans. Embrapa's Carbon Neutral Beef involves planting eucalyptus trees in the same area where cattle graze, turning a featureless grassland into one dotted with trees. Around 250-350 trees per hectare is thought to be the optimal number to keep Brazilian farms financially viable, producing 25 cubic metres of wood per hectare per year, according to studies by the Embrapa researchers. That sequesters up to five tonnes of carbon – the equivalent of emissions from about 12 adult cattle. In all, these trees occupy around 10% to 15% of the area, planted every 2m in rows between 14-22m (46-72ft) apart. This can also make a farm more productive, says Roberto Giolo de Almeida, who leads the Embrapa team. In traditional Brazilian cattle farming, there is typically around one animal grazing per hectare of land. When the land is planted with trees, the quality of the pasture actually improves. When the pasture is shadowed by the trees, the grass in its shade gets less sunlight. The grass reacts by investing more in photosynthesis, making more of the organelle where photosynthesis takes place: chloroplasts. These are the organelles that contain chlorophyll – the molecule that gives green plants their colour. A plant enriched in chloroplasts has higher nitrogen content, needed to make protein, and so it becomes more nutritious for the cows. Giolo de Almeida's team found that tree-dotted pastures can support up to twice as many cattle because of the improved pasture. And the cows fatten up faster too – as well as better nutrition, they have the added benefit that the trees offer some shade to escape the intense heat of the day. Typically, a cow raised among tree-dotted pasture will reach 250kg (550lb) of meat in two years. This is around 30% better productivity than expected in traditional systems, he says. This means the animals spend less time in the pasture before slaughter, giving them less time to emit methane. When the trees are mature, they are cut to be sold, and new saplings replace them. Richard Eckard, professor of sustainable agriculture at the University of Melbourne, who is familiar with Embrapa's project but not involved in it, sees many advantages in using eucalyptus, a commercial fast-growing tree native to Australia. ""If you harvest those trees and put them into construction timber, if you build houses or furniture, at least two-thirds of the carbon remains out of the atmosphere indefinitely or for the next hundreds of years,"" says Eckard. So far, Embrapa has not carried out studies on the use of native trees to sink carbon, which typically take longer to grow. However, one project called Native Carbon Stamp is beginning to investigate whether native trees could one day be used in a similar scheme. And in southern Brazil, one ongoing experiment aims to introduce Araucaria angustifolia (Brazilian pine), an endangered native symbol of the region, to livestock pasture integrated with croplands. These systems to combine livestock and tree-planting do not have just one ""recipe"", says the agronomist Claudete Reisdorfer Lang, professor at Federal University of Parana, in Brazil, who leads the Brazilian pine experiment. ""[It] depends on the different components – crops, trees, animals, among others,"" she says, as well as the ways the different parts of the system are integrated in the field. And combining cattle and tree-planting may not be an approach that works everywhere, notes Eckard – each area has its own climate and soil, and needs its own solution. Despite this, Giolo de Almeida estimates that around 10% of all pastures in Brazil already have a degree of integration between forest, crops and livestock, though only a small fraction of these are close to carbon neutral. Lang says she has seen rapidly growing interest in integrating livestock, trees and crops in the past 10 years. This could partly be because there are other incentives for farmers beyond the environmental benefits – Julie Ryschawy, assistant professor at the French National Institute for Agronomy, says that this approach to farming means there's less need to buy goods such as food for animals or chemical fertilisers. ""[Farmers] would both diversify the crop rotation and limit chemical inputs on the crop and grasslands,"" says Ryschawy, which could help biodiversity, limit livestock disease and store carbon. The meat industries in many regions have set targets for low or carbon-neutral livestock, including Australia, another of the world's main beef exporters. ""We are seeing an inevitable push towards low emissions livestock production,"" Eckard says. ""We have no options, we have to do this."" However, there are barriers to the expansion of tree and livestock-integrated systems like the kind used by Embrapa, including resistance from farmers. ""Many of them specialised in monocultures, which are profitable in a short-term, but unsustainable in the long-term,"" says Lang. There are also upfront costs to consider and the livestock sector can be reluctant to take financial risks, says Edegar de Oliveira Rosa, director of conservation and restoration of ecosystems at WWF-Brazil. ""It is necessary to face a huge challenge, the challenge of scale, since Brazil has one of the biggest herds of the world, around 200 million animals."" Rosa believes that regenerative agriculture could help improve a large swathe of Brazil's former forests. ""Currently livestock is the activity which most occupies recently deforested land,"" says Rosa. ""Deforestation and subsequent fires to clear the land are the main source of greenhouse gases emission in Brazil.""  While better use of deforested land could help lower beef's emissions, the challenge looming over cattle farming in Brazil is stopping deforestation in the first place. ""In the end it all comes back to government policy,"" says Eckard. He points to Australia's attempt to halt its historic problem with deforestation for cattle rearing through public policy. ""The only reason the Australian government achieved its Kyoto protocols targets was because they legislated against deforestation in Queensland. It requires leadership from government,"" Eckard says. While switching to a plant-based diet may remain a powerful solution to limit the environmental impact of cattle farming, in some parts of the world livestock provide essential nutrition, says Eckhard. ""Livestock are so integral to a lot of developing countries in allowing them to have food security,"" he says. In a region blighted by deforestation, it might seem like a small consolation to regrow just a hundred or so trees per hectare on the land now used for cattle pasture. But, for a global industry that is still steadily growing, Embrapa's project at least shows one way that the climate-warming emissions from those cattle can be curbed. -- The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

risk appetite,The most sustainable way to eat fish,2024-09-15,2022-08-11,Jocelyn Timperley,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220810-can-eating-fish-ever-be-sustainable,"Finding sustainable seafood can be complex. Jocelyn Timperley digs into out how to make the most environmentally friendly choices. For someone looking to make their diet more sustainable, the choices when it comes to eating seafood can be frankly baffling. It's a vast category of food that includes everything from farmed prawns to wild-caught mackerel, and can have a huge array of environmental impacts, from high carbon emissions to the nasty effects of overfishing, slaughtered bycatch or antibiotic pollution. Many people seeking to eat more environmentally choose to eschew it altogether and go for the vegetarian or vegan option. But some seafood can be low-carbon, low environmental impact and also be a healthy source of food. And if you're going to eat fish, making sure you choose a more sustainable option can make a huge difference. ""The category of seafood is really diverse,"" says Jessica Gephart, assistant professor in environmental science at the American University in Washington DC. ""It includes around 2,500 different species produced by farming and capture fisheries. We're really talking about very different production systems there."" Within this, there are some ""really great opportunities for finding really sustainable options within that"", she says. I've had a bit of an up and down relationship with eating seafood. Previously a long-time vegetarian, I started eating fish about 10 years ago after a coeliac diagnosis stopped me eating wheat, persuading me to open up some other food options. Living in Britain in 2022, a time when plant-based alternatives to meat are skyrocketing, I actually find I don't rely on fish very often, but I do eat it occasionally. To try to untangle my concerns about the sustainability of being a seafood eater, I decided to experiment by tracking my own seafood consumption for a month. I noted all the information I could get my hands on about what I was eating, including where and how each fish was caught, to see just what is information is typically available to seafood consumers, at least in the UK. You might also like: I then talked to several experts who spend their lives trying to improve the way we catch, farm and eat fish, to understand where I could be making better choices. So where to start with the information you can get hold of? And how to make judgement calls about the fish you can't get information on? A warning: there are few easy answers. But there are some general rules that can be helpful to keep in mind – first and foremost, that warning bells should go off if your supplier can't tell you where your fish comes from, though some types of fish do tend to be more environmentally friendly in general – and some handy sources of information on specific seafood. Consider this a starting guide to a thorny issue that is not going away. The seafood industry Fish and other seafood are a huge source of food globally. Some 178 million tonnes were caught or farmed in 2020, set to rise to 202 million tonnes in 2030, with the rise mainly coming from aquaculture. Per capita consumption of seafood around the world has doubled since the 1960s, to 20kg per person per year. The people most in need of fish Seafood is among the most traded commodities globally, but it is crucial to ensure it is not being exported away from local people who need it for nutrition, which research has shown is happening in countries such as Mauritania and Kiribati. Greater transparency around the distribution of fish, and incorporating nutrition into trade agreements, could help address this. The industry is also a huge source of employment. Around 59 million people work directly for the fisheries and aquaculture industry, but including subsistence fishing and secondary jobs, some 600 million livelihoods depend at least partially on the sector – that's around one in every 13 people on Earth. Seafood is a crucial source of protein and essential nutrients people around the world, with around three billion people relying on it as a primary source of protein. At the same time, farmed and wild caught seafood rightfully continue to be a source of huge concern over everything from labour rights and bycatch to environmental damage from trawlers and carbon and nitrogen pollution. Overfishing of stocks is another big worry: the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates that only 65% of fishery stocks in 2019 were operating at biologically sustainable levels. A guide through the haze I ate fish six times during the period I tracked. Three times this was haddock in a fish supper (I am Scottish, after all). One restaurant told me the haddock was line-caught in the North Atlantic Ocean. Another named the small fishing village in Scotland the haddock came from but couldn’t tell me the catching method. The third told me their haddock came from Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and was ""sustainably trawled"". I also ate salmon in a sushi takeaway in Edinburgh which told me it was farmed in Scotland; cod caught in the Barents Sea using an otter trawl; and mackerel fillets from a supermarket wild caught in the North East Atlantic Ocean (no catching method given). To my knowledge, none of these had any sustainability certificates. Armed with this information, the most useful thing I found to help me understand it was the UK-based Marine Conservation Society (MCS)'s Good Fish Guide. This searchable guide is an incredibly useful source of information on the sustainability of specific fish sources. The US equivalent, Seafood Watch from the Monterey Bay Aquarium, is equally useful. Where to get seafood ratings for my country? The Good Fish Guide and Seafood Watch are focused on fish sold in the UK and US respectively, although since seafood is a global industry many of their ratings are relevant for fish sold in many other countries. The wider Global Seafood Ratings Alliance lists similar organisations from around the world. Both operate on a traffic light system, based on local regulations, how capture fisheries and farms are managed, and the health of fish stocks. These are all aspects of understanding if the resource is ""sustainable"" – i.e. whether current management means it will continue to be available year after year. The apps both have helpful ""best choice"" lists. ""With meat, it's a bit easier: you go into the supermarket and you want to buy a chicken and you're faced with maybe three options,"" says Jack Clarke, sustainable seafood advocate at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), a UK-based non-profit. ""Seafood is a lot more complicated. There's a lot of variables in there. So you've got wild, farmed, a dozen different species caught in hundreds of different places with different ways of catching them and farming them."" The MCS started the Good Fish Guide to help guide people through this hugely diverse array of seafood, says Clarke. I found the Good Fish Guide app, which has 600 ratings for around 140 species, relatively easy to use while shopping – so long as I could get hold of the required information about the fish I’m about to buy. Is farmed or wild-caught fish better? It's complicated! Farmed fish can leak nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment, use up land and freshwater, risk spreading disease and antibiotic resistance, and can be fed on wild-caught fish, but usually have lower greenhouse gas emissions. Wild-caught fisheries avoid nutrient pollution and don't use up land or freshwater, but emit greenhouse gases from the fuel used in boats, and can have devastating impacts on ocean ecosystems through overfishing, bycatch, seafloor destruction and plastic pollution.  A good starting point is to check the Good Fish Guide and Seafood Watch ratings of the sustainability of different fish sources. It indicated that the haddock and cod I ate were likely a 2 (out of 5, the best being 1) rating, while the Scottish farmed salmon was a 3 (better than the 5 rating given to wild-caught Atlantic salmon). The mackerel could have been a 1, 2 or 3, depending on the exact catching method and exactly where it was caught, which I didn’t know. It’s not terrible, but I realise I could be doing far better on this by looking specifically for the 1-2 rated sources. Sarah Poon is the associate vice president of the Fishery Solution Center at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a non-profit. But despite her knowledge of fisheries, she says she still struggles with the day-to-day challenges of how to make good decisions about seafood. ""I think it's helpful to look at the guides to understand the nuance,"" she says. ""[They] have looked at not just the species, but where the species come from: what might be a good choice in one place could actually be not a great choice in another place."" Over time using these apps, people can develop a deeper understanding of which gear types tend to be better than others, and which countryies’ fisheries and farms are doing a better job, says Liz Nussbaumer, project director for seafood at the John Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. Erin Hudson, Seafood Watch programme director, says she tries to remember a few ""safe bets"" from the Seafood Watch app for when she doesn’t have her phone handy while shopping. ""For me personally, when I'm eating on the California Central Coast, that's going to be anything with farmed mussels [...] or farmed rainbow trout or local rockfish species,"" she says. The ratings also change over time, though, adds Hudson. ""Conditions in fisheries and farming operations do change, and we release new ratings every month. Things are always moving, and that’s great – we want to see improvements happen. And we want to stay on top of when things slide the other way."" Can you trust labels? Both these apps refer to certificates like the Marine Stewardship Council and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) in their ratings, which can also be found on fish packets in the supermarket. Despite the criticisms from films like Seaspiracy of these certificates, all the experts I talked to said they are worth taking into account when making choices. Sustainability on a Shoestring We currently live in an unsustainable world. While the biggest gains in the fight to curb climate change will come from the decisions made by governments and industries, we can all play our part. In Sustainability on a Shoestring, BBC Future explores how each of us can contribute as individuals to reducing carbon emissions by living more sustainably, without breaking the bank. ""[The Marine Stewardship Council blue tick] means at least they are being audited, and they have to prove things,"" says Clarke. ""It's a great way of just quickly and easily identifying whether something's a sustainable choice."" Certifications like these can also be a protection against fraud, a huge issue in the seafood industry. A 2016 meta-analysis of DNA identification studies of seafood found that globally there was a 30% rate of misdescription – meaning the fish was not the species stated on the label or menu. But a 2019 DNA study by the Marine Stewardship Council found that seafood bearing its sustainability mark was labelled correctly over 99% of the time. One issue with these labels, however, is that gaining them can be a significant process for a fishery involving data collection and a lot of paperwork – meaning not every fishery has the resources to receive the stamp, even if they are working sustainably. Some certifications are more accessible to smaller-scale fisheries, such as Fairtrade certification, says Poon. The highest carbon seafood It’s worth noting that none of these certificates, nor the apps, currently measure carbon emissions. These can vary significantly between different seafood species, and research has shown some species and farming methods do tend to be better than others on this. In a paper published last year, Gephart and her colleagues surveyed a range of seafood to examine several different dimensions of sustainability more typically considered for land-based agriculture, namely greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, land stressors and freshwater use. ""We wanted to be able to compare the aquatic foods [with agriculture and livestock] on a more even basis,"" says Gephart. Farmed mussels – the most sustainable seafood? Farmed bivalves such as mussels are an incredibly sustainable source of seafood less impactful on the planet than some vegetables, says Clarke. Unlike most farmed seafood, he says, you don't need to feed them or treat them with chemicals or antibiotics to avoid diseases. They’re also low carbon, and don’t use up fresh water or land, and they can form artificial reefs that encourage other kinds of wildlife to congregate. To top it all, they are a great source of micronutrients. The researchers found that farmed bivalves – a group which includes farmed mussels, oysters, scallops and clams – had the lowest environmental impact across all measures. When it comes to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, they actually have a positive effect on pollution – because they absorb these nutrients as they grow. ""They're actually removing nitrogen and phosphorus from the water. And so their emissions are negative for those,"" says Gephart. ""If you're going to eat one kind of seafood, that's probably the one to go for from across the board for environmental reasons."" However, wild-caught bivalves including mussels performed much worse on greenhouse gas emissions, the paper showed. That’s because wild-caught mussels are often caught by mechanical methods like dredging, which use high amounts of energy. It's also well-documented that the methods used to catch some wild bivalves can be devestating for local environments. According to the charity Open Seas, scallop dredging has the most severe impact on the wider ecosystem of any fishery in the UK. Other fish with low greenhouse gas emissions were farmed silver and bighead carp, salmon and trout, although carp use a lot of land to cultivate. On the wild-caught side, herrings, sardines and anchovies are fairly low carbon, with cod, hake and haddock not far behind. But wild-caught flounder, halibut, sole and lobster all fared badly on greenhouse gas emissions, as well as farmed tilapia and both wild and farmed shrimp. Overall, seafood typically either outperformed or performed similarly to chicken, often viewed as the most efficient form of meat. Predictably, though, it's a different story when considering fish compared to plant-based proteins. ""It is a 'compared to what' when it comes to any dietary question,"" says Gephart. ""What we found is that many of the different species groups are a good choice when it comes to carbon emissions if what you're going to eat instead is some kind of meat."" To look further into the carbon emissions of different seafoods, Monterey Bay Aquarium and Dalhousie University have a handy and searchable seafood carbon emissions tool. What fish should I avoid? When I first started eating fish, I found it vexing to learn that farmed fish such as salmon and prawns are often fed on smaller wild-caught fish, like mackerel, sardine and anchovy. It seemed silly to be feeding edible fish to other fish. Why not just eat the smaller fish and avoid the wasted energy?   Is seaweed a good choice? Farmed seaweed has low greenhouse gas emissions, absorbs nitrogen and phosphorus in a similar way to bivalves, uses no land, freshwater or food input, and has high micronutrients, although it lacks the protein of animal seafood. However, seaweed farming is a relatively new area, Nussbaumer notes, so more needs to be known about its side effects and the best location for it. Scotland’s farmed salmon industry, for example, is especially reliant on marine feeds, which researchers have criticised as a huge waste of micronutrients which could be feeding people. However, Gephart says there have been improvements in the raising and rearing of some farmed fish, such as salmon and trout, over the past decade. ""The technology for feeding has improved so much that they are really efficient at turning feed into fish, essentially,"" she says. She notes that fish meal from sustainably-managed pelagic fisheries can be a better choice to feed fish than, say, soy coming from areas where there's deforestation. There is also interest in the industry towards moving to other sources of food, such as algae additives, black soldier flies or other insect larvae, says Nussbaumer. However, generally speaking, lower trophic level species – meaning species that are lower on the food chain – are going to be more sustainable than predators, says Poon. ""I would still say you want to know how that fish was caught and where it came from [though],"" she adds. There are some species that are usually best completely avoided – shark and bluefin tuna, for example. Prawn and shrimp are another higher impact product to be careful about. Shrimp farms can replace coastal nursery habitats such as mangroves, in turn affecting fish stocks, says Gephart, and can impact coastal protection. Farmers in countries such as Bangladesh are still suffering the unintended impacts of flooding their paddies with salty water to raise tiger prawns, in part as an adaptation to rising sea levels. ""There’s lots of instances of red-rated prawn,"" says Hudson. ""Prawn, shrimp is a great example of a category where you see green, yellow, and red. So it's possible [for it to be sustainable], but you do need to look into where it's from, how it’s being raised."" Here again, it’s worth looking out for certifying bodies such as the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, says Clarke. ""They stepped in to make sure that these farms are meeting standards in environment, antibiotic use, labour, water use; all these things that we were so worried about, they started introducing them,"" he says. But perhaps the best thing to avoid is any place that can’t tell you where its seafood came from, says Poon. ""If a restaurant or a supplier or a grocer is not providing you specifics about what species that product is, where it came from, or how it was caught, that’s when a trigger goes off in my head that this could very well be from an unsustainable fishery."" Is it better to eat more diversely? Some 80% of the seafood eaten in the UK is made up of just five species, namely cod, haddock, salmon, tuna and prawns – statistics which chime with my own choices during my month tracking my seafood consumption. Where to shop for sustainable fish? People often assume that local seafood is more sustainable, but this isn’t always the case, says Clarke. Fishmongers can sell ""amazingly fresh, high quality, sustainable options"", he says, but they can also stock extremely unsustainable seafood. Some supermarkets, meanwhile, are doing a relatively good job on sourcing sustainable fish, says Nussbaumer. Wherever you buy your fish, it’s always worth checking their sourcing practices, and reading up on what you are buying. Similarly, in the US, 62% of seafood consumed is shrimp, salmon, canned tuna, tilapia or Alaskan pollock. This lack of diversity puts pressure on a handful of wild fisheries and a few species that are farmed all over the world, says Clarke. ""Our insatiable appetite for those things is driving unsustainable farming practices. It’s driving these huge fisheries and potentially overfishing of these species,"" he says. Swapping some of the usual suspects for less well-known seafood species can therefore have a positive impact, says Clarke. Farmed trout can substitute salmon, for example, while hake can replace cod. Farmed bivalves such as mussels, which don’t require any feed and can be grown by throwing a seeded line into the sea, are usually an especially good choice, and fare much better across sustainability measures than prawns. Diversifying can also open opportunities for people to consume local species that may well be being caught in sustainable ways, adds Gephart. ""We have lots of local smaller fisheries [in the US] that are often well managed, but the US consumer is often inclined to eating the same set of species."" Catching methods Depending where you live in the world, you may be more or less likely to be able to get information on the catching method from your grocer, but it is always worth asking because it can make a huge difference. When I realised the cod I was about to eat was caught by trawling, I felt a prod of guilt. Trawling is a controversial method of catching wild fish. It involves dragging cone-like nets along the seafloor bottom, which can damage seafloor habitats. It can also result in large amounts of bycatch, which is often discarded dead or dying back into the ocean, leading to eye-watering amounts of fish waste. Dredging – where a heavy steel frame is towed over the seabed – and to a lesser extent demersal seining, where a net on the seafloor is slowly closed, are other methods which can impact seafloor habitat. Lower-impact methods use less-intensive gear to catch fish, such as pole caught or troll fisheries, says Poon. Trawling also leads to more greenhouse gas emissions than other catching methods such as line caught fish. ""Bottom trawling is, unsurprisingly, going to use a lot more energy as a fishing method,"" says Gephart. The trawling nets can also drudge up huge amounts of carbon from the seabed floor. How to stop wasting fish An incredible one-third of the wild fish caught never gets eaten. Much of this waste happens before fish even reaches our fridges, especially due to trawling, but better planning in our kitchens can also help. Tips include planning in advance how you’ll use the fish you buy and choosing frozen, tinned or smoked seafood over fresh to avoid a fast expiry date. Scallops are a good example here. They can be caught in the wild by dredging, where they score between 3 and 5 on the Good Fish Guide, or hand diving, where divers pluck them one by one off the seabed, scoring them a 2. They can also be farmed, scoring them a 1. Pole and line-caught tuna, which are caught one-by-one, similarly tend to score much higher on the Good Fish Guide, says Clarke. ""If you’re worried about things like dolphins and shark bycatch, bycatch in pole and line fisheries is minimal."" However, he notes, ""you can still catch the last fish in the sea with a hook and a line"". There are ways that this intensive gear can be managed to be less impactful, adds Poon, who recommends asking for any fish caught by a larger net or trawl whether measures are being taken to avoid bycatch and impacts to the habitat. Clarke also notes that some parts of the sea are less susceptible to damage from trawling. ""They have big tidal races, they’re just muddy buttons, where there isn’t that much structure, there aren’t reefs or soft corals."" It’s worth keeping in mind in all this that there is only so much you can do as one person. Gephart suggests that the burden needs to be taken off consumers. So advocating for changes on policy, supply chain traceability and sustainable management of stocks at home may be the best place to start for those who want to make a wider impact. Doing this experiment has made me feel far more engaged with the seafood I’m eating. I’m going to stick to eating it only occasionally – it is still a high-impact food, after all – but I’m also going to make a bigger effort to avoid larger fish higher up the food chain, and instead opt for smaller fish and especially farmed mussels, the seafood superfood. I’ll also keep using the Good Fish Guide to inform my choices. But perhaps my biggest takeaway is that I want to be more vocal when I'm buying fish that I care that it's sustainably sourced. Simply asking your grocer or local restaurant whether they sell sustainable seafood can make a big difference, says Hudson. ""When customers ask for sustainable seafood, restaurants and retailers begin to seek and demand sustainable options from their suppliers. And, honestly, the answer is not the critical part here; it's the question."" Jocelyn Timperley is a senior journalist for BBC Future.

risk appetite,How can we make food last longer?,2024-09-15,2023-01-19,Marta Zaraska,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230118-how-to-make-fruit-and-vegetables-last-longer,"From hi-tech coatings to improving the state of the roads, there is a plethora of ways we can reduce the amount of fruit and veg that goes bad before it reaches our plates. It's a problem humans have been reckoning with since the first moment we had more food than we could eat in one go. When food is abundant, how do you store it to make it last? Where's the waste? Consumers are only partly responsible for food waste. About 17% of the produce available to consumers is thrown away, though that includes food supermarkets dispose of from their shelves and food which goes into restaurant bins, as well as household waste. The remaining losses happening on farms, during processing, distribution and storage. The question has almost as many answers as there are foods. The ancient Greeks washed figs in seawater and dried them in the hot sun, while in medieval China lemons and oranges were covered in waxes. In 15th Century Japan, vegetables were coated with soy milk to prevent moisture loss and extend their shelf-life. In 16th Century England, meanwhile, they were coated with lard. The problem of rotting apples and mouldering grain may have been a matter of season-to-season survival for our ancestors. Today preventing food waste is no less of a challenge, though the stakes have changed somewhat. The world's greenhouse gas emissions from wasted food are about 10 times greater than those from the UK. Wasted meat contributes the most to these numbers, as the energy required to produce it is typically many times greater than plant-based foods. Throw out 100g of steak and you might have just squandered as much as the equivalent of 10kg of CO2. By mass, however, it's fruits and vegetables that make up for the biggest pile of wasted food: roughly half a billion tonnes per year. In the UK, oranges and mandarins are number one among wasted produce, followed by apples and tomatoes. So how can we best preserve our fruit and veg to ensure more gets to our plates? Among the tools that producers currently have to reduce food waste, many involve the use of plastics and chemicals. A Swiss study published in 2022 showed that the climate benefits of wrapping cucumbers in plastic are almost five times higher than the negative climate impacts of the packaging itself. Chemicals such as chlorine, hydrogen peroxide and trisodium phosphate, meanwhile, have long been used to kill various microorganisms on fresh produce to prevent spoilage and extend shelf lives. Yet customers are turning away from both chemical treatments and plastics. Chlorination may lead to formation of compounds that are suspected carcinogens, and which may either end up in drinking water (as a result of industrial processing of fruits and vegetables) or remain on the produce. When it comes to plastics, many of us feel guilty about the amounts they use. According to David McClements, a food scientist at the University of Massachusetts, there is now a ""big push to replace plastics"" and find other ways to preserve fruits and vegetables that don't involve chemical treatments. While many of the new technologies are still limited to research labs, others are starting to appear on supermarket shelves, or soon will. Build a barrier One potentially promising technology is edible coating: covering fruits and vegetables in a film of protective material that can be consumed with the food. Modern commercial coatings have come on a fair way since the early soy and lard experiments in Japan, England and elsewhere. Coatings based on beeswax or paraffin took off in 1930s, when waxing fruits such as apples became popular. Apples have a natural wax coating when they are picked from the tree, though this is often lost in the washing process. Today, an artificial coating is often reapplied to apples, oranges, lemons and other fruits to help conserve moisture and extend shelf life. While these are pretty good at limiting dehydration of produce, there is still great room for improvement. To create perfect edible coatings scientists are now experimenting with many different substances, from silk fibroin (protein secreted by silk worm) and chitosan (a sugar from the outer skeleton of shellfish), to cashew gum, fish gelatine, fenugreek protein, soy protein, cellulose and algae derivatives – the list goes on. Such coatings, applied by dipping, brushing or spraying, form a thin membrane on the surface of, say, strawberries or tomatoes, reducing transfer of gas and water vapour, limiting browning and aroma loss, and ultimately prolonging shelf life. Ideally such coatings should keep the fruit or the vegetable well sealed, but not too sealed – otherwise you risk inducing anaerobic fermentation (that's when your apple turns into cider, for example). According to McClements, chitosan, which can be obtained as a by-product from shrimp fisheries, figures quite prominently in the current efforts to find the perfect edible coating. In one recent study covering strawberries with chitosan and whey protein isolate (a by-product of cheesemaking), extended their shelf life by 60% if stored in fridge-like temperatures. Tomatoes with a coating of chitosan and green algae, meanwhile, stayed close to perfect even 30 days after harvest (untreated tomatoes were in very unappealing shape after the same period). A number of companies around the world are now busy commercialising research on edible coatings. A California-based startup called Apeel Sciences, makes edible coatings from plant oils that can double shelf life. In the US, you can find their coatings on apples, avocados and limes; in the UK, they've partnered with Tesco to sell coated oranges and lemons – things that you still typically peel before eating, as UK and EU have strict regulations when it comes to edible coatings. (The treatments applied to citrus fruit peel is one reason many recipes call for unwaxed fruits.) Another company, Liquidseal, sells coatings based on polyvinyl alcohols for mangoes and avocados in the UK – again, fruits with hard peels only. However, Liquidseal has already developed an edible coating for cucumbers to replace those notorious plastic wraps, and hopes to sell it in Europe soon. Nano-treatment Another emerging way to boost edible coatings is to use nano-materials – materials with a particle size of less than 100 nanometres (nm) in at least one dimension (that’s 1,000 times smaller than a human hair). ""If you make the particles smaller, you can improve the functional performance of edible films and coatings, for example, by increasing their strength and barrier properties,"" McClements says. You can produce such minuscule particles by using lasers, vibrations, plant extracts or even certain microorganisms. In one study, after a week of storage at room temperature, most regular strawberries were covered in fungus. Among those coated with chitosan and nano-silver, however, only 10% were spoiled. Freshly cut carrots coated with silver nanoparticles stayed fine for 70 days. Uncoated carrots lasted a mere four. Nanoparticles are not only about edible coatings, however. Since some of them are powerful antimicrobials, they can be added to regular plastic packaging to extend shelf life of fruits, vegetables or leafy greens. What's more, they can be used in sensors that could inform retailers or customers that the food is no longer safe to eat, which could help avoid premature trips to the bin. Researchers from Canada’s McMaster University, for example, developed patches that could be applied on produce packaging to predict spoilage. However, such nanoscale interventions come with safety questions. In mice and rats, ingestion of zinc oxide nanoparticles causes liver and kidney damage. Studies on silver nanoparticles, meanwhile, found toxicity to both model organisms such as the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and to human cells.   ""There is risk with all novel technologies, and we do have to be careful,"" says Gustav Nyström, scientist at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. Nyström points out that silver and zinc nanoparticles can bioacumulate in tissues. However, if such nanoparticles are well encapsulated within plastic packaging, he says, the risk that they would migrate into food is low. Biological defence Bacteriophages – viruses that kill bacteria – may be another potential solution to prolonging shelf life of fruits and vegetables and making them safer to eat. An American company, Intralytix, already makes bacteriophage mixes to do just that (so far available only in US, Canada and Israel), while another company, Micreos, offers bacteriophage products for use on leafy greens as well as broccoli, carrots and other vegetables. Bacteriophages – or phages for short – kill bacteria by dissolving or attacking their cell wall, ""a bit like a needle puncturing a balloon"", says Gerrit Keizer, managing director at Micreos. As such, phages could potentially replace or diminish the use of disinfectants while still achieving improved shelf life. What’s more, phages are cheap, easy to apply and, above all, harmless to humans. ""You are completely covered in phages. They are everywhere. We are constantly consuming them,"" says Sam Nugen, food scientist at Cornell University. Nugen predicts that in a few years, produce protected by commercial phage mixes ""won't be uncommon"" in supermarkets. ""It’s coming up,"" he says. There are many other methods under investigation for keeping fruits and vegetables fresh and safe to eat for as long as possible: plasma-activated water, ozone treatments, high-power ultrasound and bacteriocins (antimicrobial peptides or proteins produced by certain bacteria) have all been suggested. Treating produce with pulsed light, or very strong flashes of light, can keep strawberries nice and firm for eight days in the fridge, while untreated ones will start getting mushy. What’s more, treatments with pulsed light can increase levels of healthy phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables. Paramount to any of these emerging technologies will be proof that they are safe for customers, as well as doing the job of keeping fruit and veg good for longer. Another challenge is scaling things from labs to real life. ""You have to apply these technologies to millions and millions of fresh fruits and vegetables, and make sure to do it uniformly, do it quickly and cheaply,"" McClements says. In the meantime, other solutions to food waste can be rather low-tech. A study of tomato shipments in South Africa showed that a lot of loss was caused by poor road conditions: the tomatoes were simply bumped around too much in the trucks. Elsewhere, food waste prevention can be achieved by proper storage and avoiding over-purchasing – or as simple as not forgetting that box of strawberries hidden at the back of your fridge. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,Why some people's pain is ignored,2024-09-15,2023-04-17,Naomi Elster,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230414-the-search-for-an-objective-measure-of-pain,"The science of pain is complex and its assessment subjective, leading to bias and health inequality. Now, researchers are searching for a reliable, objective measure of pain. How much does it hurt? You might think it's one of the simplest questions in health and medicine. But in fact, it can be a remarkably difficult question to answer objectively. Consider a doctor who has two patients who are grimacing and using similar words to describe their pain. Can the doctor be sure they are experiencing similar levels of pain? What if one habitually underestimates their suffering? What if one has been in pain for a long time and grown used to it? And what if the doctor has certain prejudices that mean they are more likely to believe one patient than the other? Pain is a difficult beast to grapple with, hard to measure and therefore to treat. Pain can be an important distress signal and failing to investigate it could mean a missed opportunity to save a life – or it may be something much more minor.  For such a universal experience, pain remains much of a mystery – especially the task of determining how much pain someone is in. ""We understand it so poorly,"" says Emma Pierson, a computer scientist at Stanford University researching pain. ""In particular, the fact that human doctors are frequently left flummoxed by why a patient is in pain suggests that our current medical understanding of pain is quite bad."" The gold standard for pain analysis currently relies on patients self-reporting how they feel, relying, in different places, on either a numerical scale (0 as no pain, 10 as worst pain), or a system of smiley faces. ""Step one in treating pain adequately is measuring it accurately and that's the challenge,"" says Carl Saab, who leads a pain research team at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. ""Nowadays the standard of care is based on 'smiley faces' that riddle ER rooms."" This system can be confusing for patients, he says, and especially problematic when treating children and non-communicative patients. Then there is the problem about whether the patient's rating is believed. One study found a widespread notion that people tend to exaggerate the level of pain they are in, despite little evidence to suggest such exaggeration is common. You might also like to read:  Without an objective way to measure pain, there is room for bias to creep into clinicians' decisions. ""Pain has a particularly large impact on underserved populations, and their pain is particularly likely to be ignored,"" says Pierson. Unfortunately, false beliefs about pain are widely held among physicians. In 2016, one study found that 50% of white medical students and residents in the US held very dangerous and false ideas about black people and their experience of pain. Another study found that almost half of medical students heard negative comments about black patients by their senior colleagues, and those students' level of racial bias grew significantly in their first four years of medical training. Such biases date back to historical attempts to justify slavery, including false claims that black people had thicker skin and different nerve endings. Now, black patients in the US are 40% less likely to have their pain treated than white patients. Hispanic patients, meanwhile, are 25% less likely than white patients to have their pain treated. Racial discrimination is not the only form of prejudice that influences pain treatment. Biases around ""hysterical women"" are still well known in medicine, particularly around pain. A review of 77 separate research studies revealed that terms like ""sensitive"" and ""complaining"" are more often applied to women's reports of pain. One study of 981 people found that women who came to emergency care due to pain were less likely to receive any pain relief at all, and they had to wait 33% longer than men to be treated. In addition, when men and women reported similar levels of pain, men were given stronger medication to treat it. Social expectations about what is ""normal behaviour"" for men and women are at the root of these patterns, says Anke Samulowitz, who researches gender bias at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. These biases add up to ""medically unjustified differences in the way men and women are treated in health care"". There are, she notes, sometimes genuine reasons why men and women might receive different treatment for a particular complaint. ""Differences associated with hormones and genes should sometimes lead to differences in, for example, pain medication,"" she says. ""But all observed differences in the treatment of men and women with pain cannot be explained by biological differences."" Could new technologies help provide a way to circumvent prejudice and bias about pain in medicine? Several innovations are being developed to try to plug this gap to provide an objective ""readout"" of the extent of someone's pain. These technologies rely on finding ""biomarkers"" for pain – measurable biological variables that correlate with the experience of pain. ""Without biomarkers we will not be able to properly diagnose – and adequately treat – pain,"" says Saab. ""We will not be able to predict the likelihood of someone with acute back injury to transition to chronic treatment-resistant pain, and we will not be able to objectively monitor response to novel therapies in clinical trials."" There are several candidates for biomarkers. Researchers in Indiana have developed a blood test to identify when a very specific set of genes involved in the body's response to pain is activated. Levels of these biomarkers could indicate not only that someone is in pain, but how severe it is. Brain activity could be another useful biomarker. Saab and his team, while he was still at Brown University, devised an approach which measures the ebb and flow of a type of brain activity known as theta waves, which the team found were elevated during pain. Saab also found that administering analgesics reduced theta activity to normal levels. The team's work has since been independently replicated by other labs. However, Saab sees theta-wave-based assessment of pain as an add-on rather than a replacement to current methods of measuring pain. ""We will never be able to know for sure how someone feels, be it pain or another mental state,"" says Saab. ""The verbal report of the patient should always remain as the 'ground truth' for pain. I envision this being used as an adjunct diagnostic, especially in cases where the verbal report is unreliable: children, adults with altered mental status, non-communicative patients."" Saab makes a distinction between acute pain, which functions as an alarm, ""in which case we should not be ignoring it,"" and chronic pain. Sometimes, a closer analysis of the injury or condition causing the pain could help to make treatments better and fairer. The Kellgren and Lawrence system, first proposed in 1957, looks at the severity of physical changes to the knee caused by osteoarthritis. One of the criticisms of it is that patients on low incomes, or from minority groups, often experience higher levels of pain from the condition. This deals a double blow to these individuals. ""Because these severity measures heavily influence who gets knee surgery, underserved groups may be under-referred for surgery,"" Pierson says. Pierson and her colleagues at Stanford developed a new algorithm which could address that. ""We use a deep learning approach to search for additional pain-relevant features in the knee X-ray the doctor might be missing, that might explain underserved patients' higher pain, by training a deep learning algorithm to predict pain from knee X-rays. ""So you could imagine, basically, using this algorithm to help better allocate surgery, by flagging to the doctor, 'You said this patient doesn't have physical knee damage, but here's some indication in the X-ray that they might – do you want to take another look?'"" The algorithm still has some way to go to reach the real world, Pierson says, with challenges to overcome that are common across the field of AI in medicine: deployment, and training humans and algorithms to work well together. But she is excited that their algorithm finds signals within the knee that predict pain and could help to narrow the pain gap, saying this work highlights the potential of AI to reduce bias in healthcare. ""I am often drawn to problems where medical knowledge is clearly inadequate and this particularly harms populations medicine has historically ignored, such as racial minorities and women,"" Pierson says. She notes, however, that algorithms such as hers won't solve the whole problem – for knee osteoarthritis. ""It's not like our algorithm does some fantastically magical job of predicting pain,"" she says. ""But we're comparing to a baseline understanding of pain which is quite bad, and to a severity score which was developed decades ago in heavily white British populations, and it's just not that hard to improve on those baselines."" The University of Gothenburg's Samulowitz points out that relying on technology to reduce bias can introduce its own challenges too. For instance, there is the question of bias in the application of technology. ""Around one-fifth of the general population is affected by moderate to severe pain. Most of them seek medical treatment in primary care. Will all of them get a brain scan pain measurement or will the selection be biased? Research has shown that more men than women get referrals to somatic examinations, more women receive referrals to psychologists. There is a risk of gender bias in who will get an objective pain measurement."" Despite these challenges ahead, Saab believes there is appetite for change in the field of pain. ""Clinicians are saying, 'Look, we can't base our clinical workflow on this, it's not how medicine should be practiced.' When you have a high temperature, you use a thermometer. When you have high blood pressure, you test your blood concentrations. In this case, people come with pain, and we show them smiley faces."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,How food on social media affects you,2024-09-15,2021-12-07,Jessica Brown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211206-does-seeing-food-on-social-media-make-us-eat-more,"It is hard to browse through social media without coming across a banquet's worth of mouth-watering posts, but do these actually alter your own food choices? Many of us are lucky enough to have some degree of choice over what we eat. When we open the fridge or browse the shelves of the local supermarket, there are a smorgasbord of options available to us. But are the decisions we make about our diet as free as we like to think? What if there was something other than our own hunger and the choices that happen to be at eye-level influencing what we eat? Scroll through social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter or Facebook and you will be confronted with picture after picture of perfectly presented and utterly delicious-looking meals. While the smell and taste of food can have an undeniably powerful effect on our cravings, are endless posts of steaming snacks and glistening morsels more than just a feast for our eyes? Certainly, it appears we're hugely influenced by other people – especially those closest to us – when it comes to what we eat. Research has found that the closer and stronger two people's connection, the more sway they have over each other's food choices.   ""A lot of our cues from face-to-face interactions are linked with who we're with,"" says Solveig Argeseanu, associate professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, US. ""It's more about the relationship and how I compare myself with that person than specific individuals. If I think the person I'm with is more attractive or popular, I'll tend to want to imitate them more."" This can mean these social cues generally encourage us to eat more, Argeseanu adds. Although, being around healthy eaters may encourage you to eat healthier, too, according to research. Our eating habits are also influenced by what we see. Scientists say we favour ""oozing"" protein, a dribbling egg yolk, or bubbling mozzarella, for example. ""There is some evidence that, if you see pictures of food, that visual stimulation can prompt you to feel a desire to eat,"" says Suzanne Higgs, professor in the psychobiology of appetite at the University of Birmingham, UK. Although, she says, whether people follow through on that desire is influenced by lot of other factors, such as what food is available at the time.   But social media is one place where visual and social cues meet. There is certainly evidence that if friends in your social network post regularly about particular types of food, it could lead you to copy them, for better or for worse. And research indicates that social media might be changing our relationship with food, making us think differently about what we eat. ""If all your friends on social media are posting pictures of themselves consuming fast food, it's going to set a norm that eating fast food is what people do,"" says Higgs. Research suggests we're more likely to engage with photos of fast food, says Ethan Pancer, professor of marketing at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. This is particularly true of saturated fat, because it makes us feel good by releasing dopamine and stimulating pleasure centres in the brain. Humans are biologically primed to seek out calorie-dense food – an ability that helped our ancestors survive when they foraged for food. ""Evolutionary psychology has found that people feel happy when they simply see these foods, and thus engage with it more,"" he says.   It doesn't help that healthier foods are often seen as boring in comparison, whereas processed food is seen as ""cool"", says Tina Tessitore, associate professor of marketing at the Institut d'Économie Scientifique Et de Gestion (IESEG) School of Management in Lille, France. ""In advertising, you see unhealthy food in social settings – people having a barbeque with friends, for example, while healthy food often focuses more on the nutritional value. If you saw friends eating salad together, it wouldn't seem so credible,"" she says. Scientists are becoming increasingly concerned that food-related content on social media is making us think differently about food. Social media algorithms promote content that users engage with more, so viewing more unhealthy food means seeing more of it on our social media feeds, Pancer says. ""With higher engagement and reach metrics for unhealthy foods, content producers may gradually shift their content to be unhealthier to stay competitive,"" he says. ""And with more exposure to unhealthy foods, consumer perceptions of what is considered normal eating habits may skew to be unhealthier."" One study estimated that children and adolescents see marketing for food between 30 and 189 times per week on social media apps, with fast food and sugary drinks being the most common. But it's not just advertising placements from the food industry that are responsible – we're all capable of influencing people online. ""When we think of advertising, we think of industry trying push a product, but influencers can work in the same way,"" says Patricia Cavazos, professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis, Missouri, US. ""Content on social media from peers is very influential, in terms of impacting what we feel is relevant and appealing, and social norms of how to behave."" It starts to get risky, Cavazo says, if the content people see perpetuates an unhealthy body image, for example. ""Some of us are less influenced by content, but for others who are already at risk and may have symptoms of eating disorders, having more content that normalises unhealthy eating patterns could trigger someone to move towards unhealthy behaviours."" But while studies have found that social media can make us think differently about food, and that we typically engage more with content featuring unhealthy food, it's uncertain yet whether this actually translates to our changes in our behaviour in daily life. ""If I'm scrolling through Instagram, looking at photos of tasty food, whether I seek out the food I'm prompted to seek out depends on how hungry I am, and whether it's appropriate in that moment,"" says Higgs. And when we do eat, we're influenced by more than what we've seen online, she adds. ""Research would suggest that, when making a decision about what and how much to eat, we're combining different pieces of information,"" says Higgs. ""Momentary influences come together in ways we don't understand very well."" Research has found that that these influences can include level of nutritional knowledge, body ideals, cooking skills and cost. And while researchers can relatively easily isolate possible influences on social media to see how it affects our diets, there's much more going on in real life that these studies can't look at, Higgs says. ""It's possible for some people in certain situations that social media could be the predominant factor that influences their behaviour, but it's only one factor,"" she adds. The amount of influence social media has on us also varies by individual, says Melissa Atkinson, a lecturer in psychology, at the University of Bath, UK.   ""There's a lot of individual difference in terms of how we respond to social media images, in terms of our own biological and psychological processes,"" she says. Some people have a higher reward response to food cues, for example, where the brain sends out pleasure signals after seeing certain foods, Atkinson says. These people are more likely to respond to food cues no matter where they see them. But even without definitive answers, researchers are looking at ways to make social media influence our diets in positive ways. Tessitore, for example, has found a way to make healthier food seem more exciting on social media. She created two Twitter pages that were identical apart from one detail – one had 23 followers, while the other had more than 400,000. Both accounts published the same tweet about eating healthy food. She showed participants to one of the two accounts, and when asked afterwards how likely they were to eat a salad, those who saw the account with more followers were more inclined to want to eat a salad. This is because the more we assume someone has influence, the more likely we are to be influenced by them ourselves, Tessitore says. While the findings don't reflect reality, where we're typically exposed to multiple streams of information, images and tweets, we'd still notice and process how many followers a Twitter account has, Tessitore says, so it's likely to have the same effect. But at the moment, we're a long way from being able to nudge people towards healthier diets with posts about salads and steering people away from the powerful pictures of oozing protein. ""We're fighting years of evolution here,"" says Pancer. ""There's a reason we've evolved to look for calorie-dense food in food-scarce environments. But eating what feels good is misfiring – we now need to find ways to recalibrate this."" Pancer has found in his research that, as soon as we demystify why seeing photos of burgers and chips feels good, the feel-good effect goes away. In other words – if we understand that we're biologically programmed to feel good when we see photos of burgers, perhaps we can become less prone to being influenced by it. In one study, he and his team asked participants to watch one of two videos, one with calorie-light and one with calorie-dense foods. Those who watched more calorie-dense foods felt more positive afterwards. In the second part of  the study, he told participants that their feelings weren't based on the food they were about to see, but on a low frequency, mood-boosting sound that was being played, one which wasn't detectable to humans, while a second group had no influence. Those who were told about the sound were no more likely to report that they'd engage with the video on social media after watching the video of calorie-dense food. But ultimately, when we click off social media and go back into real life, the many influences on what and how we eat are still much stronger, experts say. ""I expect that food cues are stronger in person,"" says Argeseanu. ""We're not engaging in the same way when scrolling through photos, and we're not engaging for long. Also, some research shows that if we're scrolling through lots of photos, we start to tune them out – we start to feel something that feels like satiety, as if we've eaten them all."" At least if you do choose to only enjoy these feasts over Instagram, it won't leave you needing to loosen your belt. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,Top 10 ways to see Hong Kong,2024-09-15,2010-08-31,Andrew Stone,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20100819-lonely-planets-top-10-ways-to-see-hong-kong,"It is an intoxicating place – spectacular, exotic and accessible. Here are the best ways to delve into the city’s absorbing culture. Hong Kong is a place that provokes questions, some without answers. Those five-star hotels and soaring skyscrapers are first world, but those crumbling tenements look third world, don’t they? How do seven million people fit on this tiny speck of land? And how do they decide where to eat in a city of 10,000 restaurants? How can a simmering tureen of tripe stock look so evil, yet smell so good? Pondering, you reach the water and stare across to Hong Kong Island. Nothing has quite prepared you for the spectacle up close: freighters and motor junks forever plying their harbour trade and, beyond them, a Futurama cityscape rising from near vertical jungle slopes.  It is an intoxicating place - spectacular, exotic and accessible. If you are visiting for business, you will find pleasure sneaks up on you. If you are visiting for pleasure, there are no shortage of locals who make it their business to please. Here are the top ten ways to delve into Hong Kong's absorbing culture.  Reach sensory overload in the wet market's colour, aroma and gore  Prepare to have your senses (and maybe sensibilities) assailed if you tour a wet market, places that feed Hong Kong's appetite for fresh food. Stalls of exotic fresh produce are piled high next to ones selling other local delicacies and staples, such as preserved eggs (the ready-to-eat greenish-black ones packed in a mixture of ash, lime and salt and buried for 100 days) or fresh white bean curd scooped still steaming from wooden pails.  Rock & roll along Hong Kong Island's northern coast on a tram  It doesn't matter how many times you visit Hong Kong Island, a ride on one of their infamous double-decker tram still offers a thrill. Yes it is slow, not air-conditioned and fully exposed to the noise and bustle, but that is part of the appeal. You will make stately progress through a sliver of Hong Kong Island, your journey along the tram tracks offering a mesmeric and slowly scrolling urban panorama.  Shuffle through Sheung Wan's old-Shanghai-style historic alleys  The streets of Sheung Wan form Hong Kong Island's old Chinese heart and it is a vibrant, colourful area that is best explored on foot. Towering above the bins of dried bivalves and small fry, the piles of dried shark fins are a stark sign of their popularity in Hong Kong as a high-status delicacy. Several shops in the area also seem to base their business entirely on the sale of ginseng roots or swallow's nests, gathered at great risk high up in Malay sea caves.  A night at the races in Happy Valley  They advise you not to get your hair cut on a Wednesday in Hong Kong, as the scissor-wielding barber will be more intent on the horse racing on TV than your scalp. It is easy to believe if you visit Happy Valley on race night. Beneath the twinkling lights of the surrounding high-rises, you will see Hong Kong's citizens momentarily abandon their exterior poise as they yell their horse home (or curse the donkey they backed). The racing season runs from September to early July.  Take a sip of luxury at Hong Kong's legendary Peninsula hotel  For service as smooth as it comes, a regal atmosphere and a string quartet discreetly sawing away upstairs, afternoon tea at the Peninsula offers an affordable taste of luxurious Hong Kong. Undeniably one of the world's great hotels, the Peninsula is both a landmark and a Hong Kong icon.   Pray for good fortune in temple of New Kowloon  Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple is an explosion of colour with red pillars, bright-yellow roofs and green-and-blue latticework. What is particularly striking is its popularity with locals. Behind the main temple and to the right are the Good Wish Gardens, replete with colourful pavilions, zigzag bridges and artificial ponds. Within the complex there is also a kooky arcade filled with dozens of booths operated by fortune-tellers.  Take a trip back through time at the Museum of History  Hong Kong's remnants of the past - be they listed buildings and monuments or old-fashioned observances - are precious indeed. ""The Hong Kong Story"" at the Museum of History takes visitors on a fascinating walk through the territory's past via eight galleries.  Escape to the city's rainforest aviary in Hong Kong Park  Hong Kong Park is one of the most unusual parks in the world, emphasising artificial creations, such as its fountain plaza, conservatory, artificial waterfall, indoor games hall, playground, tai chi garden, viewing tower, museums and an arts centre. For all its artifice, the park is beautiful in its own weird way and, with a wall of skyscrapers on one side and mountains on the other, makes for dramatic photographs. Its best feature by far is the Edward Youde Aviary, home to hundreds of birds representing some 150 different species. The aviary is a huge and convincing re-creation of tropical forest habitat.  Dinner and a show for a song at Temple Street Night Market  Temple St, named after the temple dedicated to Tin Hau at its centre, hosts the liveliest night market in Hong Kong. It used to be known as ""Men's St"" because it only sold men's clothing and to distinguish it from the ""Ladies' Market"" on Tung Choi St to the northeast. Though there are still a lot of items on sale for men, vendors don't discriminate - anyone's money will do. But do not just come here to shop; this is also a place for eating and entertainment. Aside from the plethora of street food on offer, you will also find a surfeit of fortune-tellers and herbalists and some free, open-air Cantonese opera performances here.  Hides and feathers in the marshes of Hong Kong Wetland Park  Hong Kong Wetland Park contains a huge visitor centre called Wetland Interactive World, with three major galleries and a surfeit of hands-on and educational exhibits, a theatre and a resource centre. Outside there are four brief boardwalk walking trails through marshland and mangrove swamps, complete with viewing platforms and bird hides, and a discovery centre. The park is also now the home of Pui Pui, the irascible pet crocodile that escaped and managed to find his way to the Shan Pui River in Yuen Long, eluding would-be captors from Hong Kong, China and Australia for seven not-so-snappy months in 2004.

risk appetite,Can Japan plug its start-up gap?,2024-09-15,2013-08-21,Michael Fitzpatrick,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130820-plugging-japans-start-up-gap,"Japan has long been hailed as one of the world’s most developed nations. But when it comes to innovation, things are less rosy. Why is it stifling its start-ups? Japanese start-up entrepreneur Masayoshi Hashimoto believes he knows where the country’s IT industry is getting its guidance from; the Czech surrealist author and satirist Franz Kafka. “Working for a Japanese web services firm, I couldn’t believe how badly things were done,” he says. “We had everyone managing projects using Excel. Excel, I ask you! It beggars belief. But managers here like the old ways.” When changes were suggested he was stonewalled. Venting his irritation on Twitter led him to a conversation about the business practices afflicting Japan’s tech sector with a fellow malcontent. One face-to-face meeting later, he quit his job to form a company with his new comrade rebel with and created the website Paradiseware, which helps businesses manage projects more efficiently. The result is typically Japanese; run on a shoestring without any of the benefits Silicon Valley start-ups might attract. Japan has a real problem with innovation. It’s just not very Japanese. Nor, you might be surprised to read, is originality. It’s the kind of thing swaggering foreigners or suspect loners are thought to meddle in. So if you visit Japan and find ersatz statues of Liberty in tourist spots, or a very uncool bureaucratic drive to promote Japanese creativity and culture ripped off from Cool Britannia - you’ll begin to understand why. Japan is ""good at technology but poor in business"" as one official puts it. “Its high levels of basic research and superior technology are hampered by too-strict regulations, and vertically integrated administration. The gap between researchers and manufacturers, in many cases, prevents brilliant R&D results from being put into practical use - the ‘Death Valley’ problem.” Japan leads in its high number of early adopters. Thanks to them, inventors can gain confidence and the initial momentum needed to push off a new idea. But it often doesn’t last long. “Unfortunately this is accompanied by a very envious, critical and vocal audience. They underline every possible reason that the product will fail and keep doing so indefatigably. They attack the innovator on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc; and they keep doing so until the innovator raises a white flag.” Add to this 20 year’s economic stagnation, zero appetite for risk and eroded confidence and Japan emerges as one the toughest environments on Earth to root new ideas.  Struggling start-ups There are backers in Japan, his partner Shuku Tanizaki explains, but most are interested only in no-risk ventures. Start-ups have to attract crowd-funding or, as is more usual, the personal savings of their creators. “There’s lots of venture capitalists here but they are only interested in games and new media,” says Hashimoto. Even renting conventional office space can be troublesome in Japan - landlords like to see two years’ profits before they open the door. Paradiseware operates out of cheap, shared office space in central Tokyo. “I think starting a new business means also confronting the problems afflicting your society,” says Mr Hashimoto. Despite being perceived as a big-hitting innovator, Japan has a tiny, struggling start-up landscape that has yet to make an impact abroad. “This is because this sector is the most under-supported in Japan,” says Terrie Lloyd, an Australian entrepreneur and commentator based in Tokyo. As the global digital economy grows in importance, this puts Japan, the world’s third-biggest economy and one-time electronics giant, at a massive disadvantage. America and even tiny South Korea continue to come up with the gadgets and smartphone-based services that consumers want. Japan’s sluggish megacorporations such as Sony are unable to match the swift-footed foreign competition and fall further and further behind. What strangles originality here, explains Tokyo-based technology consultant Nobuyuki Hayashi, is that Japanese innovation keeps to very rigid structures. “Most of them went to the same university, studied the same subjects and never met people from outside the group. This is because of the Japanese educational system and how Japanese recruiting is done,” he says. “Japanese companies tend to hire graduates from the same school.” This spectacular failure to respond to the internet age is slowly being challenged, however, both by the country’s new government and a few entrepreneurs. Copying ideas from Silicon Valley, top entrepreneurs and officials have tried for over a decade now to spark some life into Japan’s hi-tech sector by increasing incubation projects and the like. Japan now has over 400 business incubators up from 30 in 1999 some of which are focused on the hi-tech sector. Most offer funding, work space and mentoring. And after being held back by the entropy of their elders for so long, Japan’s enterprising young are going it alone. An experienced user interface designer in Japan and abroad, 26-year-old Alexander Takahashi simply rents shared office space, and networks for Angel investors when he can, to develop a location-based service named Rooftops. He understands the reservations. “Japanese businessmen tend not to trust the younger generation. No matter how well you present yourself - young equals bad,” says Takahashi.  “And honestly I can understand them. There are no really new start-ups with new ideas nowadays.” Japanese young entrepreneurs are enthusiastic but lack crucial business know-how, says Lloyd. “They are totally unprepared for the business world, and this is why cloistered accelerators and incubators are so popular here,” he adds. Hitoshi Masuda, who until recently headed up the government’s small-business think tank, disagrees. He says: “Japan is changing profoundly but dynamically in terms of who drives innovation and how innovation is being driven.” Economic reforms under a new government - Abenomics, named for the PM Shinzo Abe - are having some positive effects. His party has also promised to fight the corner of all innovators, risk takers and creative types. Their model is a bunch of maverick, by Japanese standards, entrepreneurs which include Japan’s third-richest man, Masayoshi Son, born to a Korean immigrant family, whose mobile phone empire Softbank is funding a brave attempt at commercialising home-grown green tech innovations. His outsider outlook was a huge benefit, he says. “If you look at successful Japanese start-ups, they are mostly run by CEOs who have applied the ‘foreign connection’ in some way - be it education, money, technology, business deals, or talent,” says Lloyd. “In some cases, like Mr Son, he has managed to combine all five factors.” Those factors seem to have inoculated such champions against fear of failure making them bold at the same time. They represent a new way of being Japanese – one the nation urgently needs to get to grips with.

risk appetite,How to plan your 2019,2024-09-15,2018-12-18,Amanda Ruggeri and Miriam Quick,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181217-the-best-time-of-year-to-x,"When it comes to life events like applying for a job, buying a house or even getting married, certain months are more advantageous than others. Want to ‘hack your year’? Here’s how.   Many of us rethink our lives in January, sit exams in May or June and get married in summer – and other events, like buying a house or applying for a job, we do throughout the year. But what if there was a better way? It turns out that when it comes to life events like these, some months are more optimal than others. Of course, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to reschedule your year around what the research has shown to be best. But if you could, what would your year look like? Here’s a taste of how you could organise your calendar in a smarter, better way. January: the best time of year to… apply for a job Perhaps in our efforts to turn over a new leaf, Google searches for ‘jobs’ peak in January, according to data from UK recruitment websites TotalJobs and Pagegroup. But few of these Google-searchers actually seem to apply for jobs compared to other months. That makes it a particularly good time of year to put in those applications. There were 14% fewer applications per available job from January to June than in July to December. This is likely because the majority of UK university students graduate in summer, leading to a glut of people job hunting in the autumn. It’s also a good month for other reasons: other than the first week, it’s a time when few people go on holiday, so there are more people in the workplace ready to make quick hiring decisions. Companies usually get their new hiring budgets for the year too. And since annual bonuses often pay out in December, a lot of people wait until January to change jobs – meaning there can be an abundance of new vacancies in January. February: the best time of year to… buy car insurance  In the UK, at least, average car insurance premiums spike in December, according to two pieces of research which analysed millions of quotes by British price comparison sites CompareTheMarket and MoneySuperMarket, respectively. But prices often drop sharply again in January. According to MoneySuperMarket, the average full comprehensive policy for Brits taken out in December 2016 cost £644 ($812), while in February 2017, two months later, it cost £544.43 ($685). Drivers who insure their cars in December paid on average 15% more than those who insured in February. The reasons for the rise in premium prices in December? The increased number of drivers on the road, combined with icy conditions – which increases the chance of accidents. The winter holidays also play a role, since call centres have fewer employees and fewer insurance quotes get generated, a drop in competition that allows for higher prices. But whatever the time of year, buying a policy three weeks before the renewal date is optimal, according to research by MoneySavingExpert, a British personal finance advice website. MSE analysed millions of quotes and found the sweet spot for buying a car insurance policy was 21 days before it was up for renewal. The company says: “It's all based around risk – buying it three weeks before you need it suggests you're more careful and organised, while leaving it to the last minute means you're seen as higher risk, with some insurers telling us they've seen a direct link between drivers who leave sorting their insurance to the last moment and a higher number of claims.” March: the best time of year to… get married The most popular time to get married in the US is autumn, while in the UK it’s summer. That means that those are also the most expensive times of year. And so, in northern hemisphere countries at least, you’re likely to reduce your expenses by getting married in an off-season month like January, February or March. (In Australia, where the most popular time for a wedding is the springtime month of November, June – the least common month – would be a better choice). That could have implications for more than your budget: A study of 3,000 US couples found that those who had a cheaper wedding ceremony were more likely to have longer marriages. (Find out more in our story on the best time of year to get engaged, married, pregnant or divorced). April: The best time of year to… try for a baby When it comes to fertility, one important factor is sperm health and quantity – and several studies have found that both tend to peak in spring. As we’ve written before, sperm samples from 29,000 US men over a 17-year period found the highest numbers of moving sperm in springtime and the lowest in the summer, while a Swiss study of more than 12,000 men also found that sperm concentration was also highest in the spring and lowest in summer. That alone doesn’t mean that you’ll have a markedly higher chance of getting pregnant than other times of year. But it certainly can’t hurt. May: The best time of year to… make a life decision  Although January tends to be a popular time to think through big choices, for those in the northern hemisphere, it’s not necessarily the best time to do so. That’s because many of us feel a bit lower in the winter months – most dramatically for the almost 10% of people estimated to have seasonal affective disorder. As we’ve written about in depth before, when we feel down, we’re also more risk-averse. That means it might be a better time to consider doing things with potentially serious consequences because we’ll be more likely to consider the risks. But risk aversion isn’t always helpful in decision-making. And a conservative approach isn’t always the wiser one: when given a card-playing task designed to assess risk-taking, for example, depressed participants had a harder time remembering which options were more likely to yield rewards, making them worse at the game than non-depressed participants. Plus, feeling depressed also makes us more conflicted and indecisive, making it harder to make any choice at all. So for many types of decisions, it’s probably better to wait until the days have lengthened and your mood has lifted – like, say, in May. (Find out more in our story on the best time of year to make a life decision). June: The best time of year to… go to hospital There’s never a good time to fall ill. But some months are worse than others. In northern latitudes, the winter is the most common – and worst – time of the year for a hospital visit. In the summer, on the other hand, there is some evidence that months that see an influx of new medical graduates – typically July and August – can be riskier. In England, the number of elective hospital admissions per day – that includes scheduled appointments and operations, but not visits to the emergency room – peaks in November and February to March. A&E admissions, too, peak in February and March. And internationally, hospital admissions for many diseases also peak in winter along with the incidence of those diseases. They include respiratory diseases like pneumonia and, among older age groups, asthma and heart attacks. That means that hospitals are typically at very high occupancy levels throughout the winter and there are fewer beds available – as well as a higher chance of longer wait times at A&E. If you can, though, you may want to avoid August or July in the US – or January in Australia. This is when there’s a mass influx of new medical graduates to hospital wards and when many junior doctors change hospitals or roles. Critics argue that the combination of newbie inexperience and mass turnover, where fewer doctors are fully familiar with their role, can lead to an increase in medical errors. From 1993 to 2001, the National Bureau of Economic Research found a 4% rise in mortality across 700 major teaching hospitals in July and August, while a Californian study found A&E patients were more likely to suffer from preventable complications when admitted in July and August compared to those admitted in May and June. After adjusting for other factors, there was a 90% increase in the risk of experiencing preventable or potentially preventable complications (though even then, it was still rare – just over 1%). Another US study found patients admitted to surgery in teaching hospitals in July and August were 41% more likely to die over next 30 days than those admitted in April to June. Still, the US study above found December was just as dangerous as July. So it might be disruption to the hospital schedule – caused, in this case, by doctors going on holiday – that causes the ‘July Effect’, not simply inexperience. Regardless, if you had to pick any single month that’s best for a hospital visit, you’d probably be best off aiming for June. July: The best time of year to… sit an exam Many of us don’t have a choice about when to sit an exam. But if we do, it may be best to schedule that test for mid-summer – at least if it requires close attention. One recent, though small, study suggests brain activity and cognitive skills may follow an annual cycle. When 28 young people were tested at different times of year, the researchers found that they were best at paying attention in the midsummer and worst in midwinter. But for the working memory task, performance was best in autumn and worst in spring. Animal research using mice suggests the brain region that responds to changing day length, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is the same one that controls the master circadian clock that regulates daily cycles in hormones, appetite, mood, and more. It's likely that day length has an effect on processes in the brain, but scientists don't yet understand how this works. Not all studies investigating seasonality and cognition have found an effect. One study of 182 Norwegian teenagers found time of year had no effect on memory, learning, reaction times or problem-solving abilities. Still, if you’re feeling superstitious, a summer exam date certainly couldn’t hurt. August: The best time of year to… buy a house In the US, spring is the most popular time to buy a home in the US, perhaps because the good weather inspires people to take action. April, May and June offer the largest number of new home listings, according to US real estate site Zillow, so will offer the largest number of options to the buyer. However, the number of other buyers looking at this time will make it a seller’s market, resulting in higher prices. April is the most competitive month, with the highest proportion of homes selling above their list price. When they analysed house price data in 50 US metropolitan areas between 2014 and 2016, US financial site NerdWallet found that the lowest prices were found in January and February, when homes cost 8.5% less on average than in June to August. But this may be partly because the type of house on the market in winter is smaller: larger family homes don't typically sell in winter months. Or because the housing stock left by winter is the poor quality stock no-one wants to buy. Based on their research, Zillow recommends looking for a house in August and September, months which tend to offer a sweet spot of having both good reductions and a reasonably wide selection. In 2016, “in almost every large market analysed, the highest share of listings with at least one price reduction were in August and September”, the site says. September: The best time of year to… be born Of course, we don’t have a choice about when we’re born. But if you’re trying to plan a pregnancy down to the last detail, despite sperm being in its optimal shape in the spring, you may give your child their best shot by trying to deliver in September. Researchers have found that around the world, September babies achieve better exam results, have better cognitive skills, are less likely to be bullied and more likely to attend a top university than even children born just slightly earlier – in August. This is likely because in many countries, the school year starts around September. But the school year alone can’t explain the ‘September effect’. A study of nearly 1,600 US centenarians found that people born between September and November also were more likely to live to 100 – and women born in warmer months like September are less likely to develop later health problems including heart disease or insulin resistance. (Find out more in our story on the best time of year to get engaged, married, pregnant or divorced). October: The best month to… buy stocks “Sell in May and go away” is an age-old investment adage, referring to the traditional belief that stocks show weaker performance in the summer, from May to October, and stronger performance in the winter, from November to April. According to the adage, you should sell stocks in spring, just before the summer lull, and buy them in autumn, just before their value rises again. As we’ve written about before, there is a good deal of truth to this old adage. A 1998 paper found it was true in 36 of 37 markets studied and noted evidence for it in the UK stretching back to 1694. The effect may be caused by seasonal fluctuations in optimism among investors. “Towards year end, investors start to look towards the new year, often with overly optimistic expectations. This results in attractive returns for stocks. Several months into the year, this initial optimism becomes hard to maintain and the stock market experiences a summer lull,” independent financial expert Ronald Doeswijk has said. But selling in May is not what people actually do. A study by US and Canadian researchers found investors are more bullish in spring and cautious in autumn, when they are more likely to sell their risky assets to buy safer ones. And when cautious investors sell their riskier assets, the price drops – meaning quality investments can be scooped up for a low price by those willing it to take the risk. Since these quality investment were bought at a bargain, the returns are disproportionately high when the market eventually bounces back at the end of winter, boosting overall returns. Still, the ‘sell in May’ effect is only one of many seasonal cycles affecting stock prices. Others include the January effect, the holiday effect and the turn-of-the-month effect, and the effects tend to be stronger in small-cap stocks. More importantly, of course, seasonality is only one of many, many factors affecting the stock market and returns in a given year may deviate substantially from seasonal patterns. None of the above should be read as investment advice, of course. November: The best time of year to… apply for a passport Waiting times for a new passport or a renewal generally increase when demand surges, so the best time to apply for a passport is when fewest other people are applying for one. Both US and UK data show that that’s in August to December, particularly November and December when fewer people are thinking about leaving the country. Applications jump in January, building to a summer rush as people scramble to get their passports renewed in time for their holidays abroad. December: The best time of year to… buy a car In the US, May and March used to be peak months for vehicle sales. But December has reigned since 2009, with sales 13% above the monthly average. This preference for end-of-year vehicle shopping has increased over time as buyers cotton on to the end-of-year discounts: US car dealers typically have annual sales targets and are more motivated to offer good reductions to shift stock as the year end approaches. Vehicles sold in December are the most discounted, according to US auto website Edmunds, with sales prices averaging 6.1% below the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. -- Correction: An earlier version of this piece said that the school year starts in September in countries around the world, including Australia.

risk appetite,Why do humans drink animal milk?,2024-09-15,2019-02-20,Michael Marshall,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-when-did-humans-start-drinking-cows-milk,"Humans didn’t start out being able to digest animal milk – but now many populations do. Why has evolution favoured tolerating dairy? Dairy milk has competition. Alternative “milks” made from plants like soya or almonds are increasingly popular. These alternatives are often vegan-friendly and can be suitable for people who are allergic to milk, or intolerant of it. The runner-up in the 2018 series of The Apprentice (UK) ran a flavoured nut milk business. But the rise of alternative milks is just the latest twist in the saga of humanity’s relationship with animal milk. This relationship dates back thousands of years, and it has had a lot of ups and downs. When you think about it, milk is a weird thing to drink. It’s a liquid made by a cow or other animal to feed its young; we have to squirt it out of the cow’s udders to obtain it. You might also like: • We don’t need nearly as much protein as we consume  • What would happen if the world went vegetarian? • Should you avoid dairy when you have a cold? In many cultures it is almost unheard of. Back in 2000, China launched a nationwide campaign to encourage people to consume more milk and dairy products for health reasons – a campaign that had to overcome the deep suspicions of many older Chinese people. Cheese, which is essentially milk that has been allowed to go off, can still make many Chinese people feel sick. Set against the 300,000-year history of our species, drinking milk is quite a new habit. Before about 10,000 years ago or so, hardly anybody drank milk, and then only on rare occasions. The first people to drink milk regularly were early farmers and pastoralists in western Europe – some of the first humans to live with domesticated animals, including cows. Today, drinking milk is common practice in northern Europe, North America, and a patchwork of other places. Baby food There is a biological reason why drinking animal milk is odd. Milk contains a type of sugar called lactose, which is distinct from the sugars found in fruit and other sweet foods. When we are babies, our bodies make a special enzyme called lactase that allows us to digest the lactose in our mother’s milk. But after we are weaned in early childhood, for many people this stops. Without lactase, we cannot properly digest the lactose in milk. As a result, if an adult drinks a lot of milk they may experience flatulence, painful cramps and even diarrhoea. (It’s worth noting that in other mammals, there aren’t any lactase-persistent adults – adult cows don’t have active lactase, and neither do cats or dogs, for example). So the first Europeans who drank milk probably farted a lot as a result. But then evolution kicked in: some people began to keep their lactase enzymes active into adulthood. This “lactase persistence” allowed them to drink milk without side effects. It is the result of mutations in a section of DNA that controls the activity of the lactase gene. “The first time that we see the lactase persistence allele in Europe arising is around 5,000 years BP [before present] in southern Europe, and then it starts to kick in in central Europe around 3,000 years ago,” says assistant professor Laure Ségurel at the Museum of Humankind in Paris, who co-authored a 2017 review of the science of lactase persistence. The lactase persistence trait was favoured by evolution and today it is extremely common in some populations. In northern Europe, more than 90% of people are lactase persistent. The same is true in a few populations in Africa and the Middle East. But there are also many populations where lactase persistence is much rarer: many Africans do not have the trait and it is uncommon in Asia and South America. It is hard to make sense of this pattern because we don’t know precisely why drinking milk, and therefore lactase persistence, was a good thing, says Ségurel: “Why was it so strongly advantageous in itself?” The obvious answer is that drinking milk gave people a new source of nutrients, reducing the risk of starvation. But on closer inspection this doesn’t hold up. “There’s a lot of different sources of food, so it’s surprising that one source of food is so important, so different from other sorts of food,” says Ségurel. People who are lactase-non-persistent can still eat a certain amount of lactose without ill effects, so drinking a small amount of milk is fine. There is also the option of processing milk into butter, yoghurt, cream or cheese – all of which reduce the amount of lactose. Hard cheeses like cheddar have less than 10% as much lactose as milk, and butter is similarly low. (Read more about parmigiano, a cheese with so little lactose it can be eaten by the lactose-intolerant). “Heavy cream and butter have the lowest lactose,” says Ségurel. Accordingly, people seem to have invented cheese rather quickly. In September 2018, archaeologists reporting finding fragments of pottery in what is now Croatia. They carried fatty acids, suggesting that the pottery had been used to separate curds from whey: a crucial step in making cheese. If that is correct (and the interpretation has been questioned), people were making cheese in southern Europe 7,200 years ago. Similar evidence from slightly more recent times, but still more than 6,000 years ago, has been found elsewhere in Europe. This is well before lactase persistence became common in Europeans. That said, there is clearly a pattern behind which populations evolved high levels of lactase persistence and which didn’t, says genetics professor Dallas Swallow of University College London. Those with the trait are pastoralists: people who raise livestock. Hunter-gatherers, who do not keep animals, did not acquire the mutations. Neither did “forest gardeners” who cultivated plants, but not livestock. It makes sense that people who did not have access to animal milk were not under great evolutionary pressure to adapt to drinking it. The question is, why did some pastoralist people acquire the trait and not others? Ségurel points to east Asian herding peoples, such as those in Mongolia, who have some of the lowest rates of lactase persistence even though they rely heavily on milk from their animals for food. The mutations were common in nearby populations in Europe and western Asia, so it would have been possible for them to spread into these east Asian groups, but they didn’t. “That’s the big puzzle,” says Ségurel. Dairy benefits She speculates that drinking milk might have other advantages besides its nutritional value. People who keep livestock are exposed to their diseases, which can include anthrax and cryptosporidiosis. It may be that drinking cow’s milk provides antibodies against some of these infections. Indeed, milk's protective effect is thought to be one of the benefits of breastfeeding children. But some of the mysterious absences of lactase-persistence could be down to sheer chance: whether anyone in a group of pastoralists happened to get the right mutation. Until fairly recently there were a lot fewer people on Earth and local populations were smaller, so some groups would miss out by plain bad luck. “I think the most coherent part of the picture is that there’s a correlation with the way of life, with pastoralism,” says Swallow. “But you have to have the mutation first.” Only then could natural selection go to work. In the case of Mongolian herders, Swallow points out that they typically drink fermented milk, which again has a lower lactose content. Arguably, the ease with which milk can be processed to be more edible makes the rise of lactase persistence even more puzzling. “Because we were so good at adapting culturally to processing and fermenting the milk, I’m struggling with why we ever adapted genetically,” says Swallow’s PhD student Catherine Walker. There may have been several factors promoting lactase persistence, not just one. Swallow suspects that the key may have been milk’s nutritional benefits, such as that it is rich in fat, protein, sugar and micronutrients like calcium and vitamin D. It is also a source of clean water. Depending on where your community lived, you may have evolved to tolerate it for one reason over another. It’s unclear whether lactase persistence is still being actively favoured by evolution, and thus whether it will become more widespread, says Swallow. In 2018 she co-authored a study of a group of pastoralists in the Coquimbo region of Chile, who acquired the lactase-persistence mutation when their ancestors interbred with newly-arrived Europeans 500 years ago. The trait is now spreading through the population: it is being favoured by evolution, as it was in northern Europeans 5,000 years ago. But this is a special case because the Coquimbo people are heavily reliant on milk. Globally, the picture is very different. “I would think it’s stabilised myself, except in countries where they have milk dependence and there is a shortage [of other food],” says Swallow. “In the West, where we have such good diets, the selective pressures are not really likely to be there.” Dairy decline? If anything, the news over the last few years offers the opposite impression: that people are abandoning milk. In November 2018, the Guardian published a story headlined “How we fell out of love with milk”, describing the meteoric rise of the companies selling oat and nut milks, and suggesting that traditional milk is facing a major battle. But the statistics tell a different story. According to the 2018 report of the IFCN Dairy Research Network, global milk production has increased every year since 1998 in response to growing demand. In 2017, 864 million tonnes of milk were produced worldwide. This shows no sign of slowing down: the IFCN expects milk demand to rise 35% by 2030 to 1,168 million tonnes. (Read more about how milk became a staple food in industrialised societies). Still, this masks some more localised trends. A 2010 study of food consumption found that in the US milk consumption has fallen over the last few decades – although it was replaced with fizzy drinks, not almond milk. This fall was balanced by growing demand in developing countries, especially in Asia – something the IFCN has also noted. Meanwhile, a 2015 study of people’s drinking habits in 187 countries found that milk drinking was more common in older people, which does suggest that it is less popular with the young – although this says nothing about young people’s consumption of milk products like yoghurt. Still, it seems unlikely that alternative milks will make much of a dent in the world’s growing appetite for milk, at least over the next decade. Walker adds that alternative milks are “not a like-for-like substitution” for animal milk. In particular, many don’t have the same micronutrients. She says they are most useful for vegans and for people allergic to milk – the latter being a reaction to milk protein, and nothing to do with lactose. It’s particularly striking that so much of the growth in milk demand is in Asia, where most people are non-lactase-persistent. Whatever advantages the people there see in milk, they outweigh the potential digestive issues or the need to process the milk. In fact, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has pushed for people in developing countries to keep more non-traditional dairy animals, such as llamas, so that they can obtain the benefits of milk even if cow’s milk is unavailable or too expensive. What’s more, a major study published in January described a “planetary health diet” that is designed to both maximise health and minimise our impact on the environment. While it entails drastically cutting down on red meat and other animal products, it nevertheless includes the equivalent of one glass of milk a day. Milk, it seems, is not down and out. If anything it’s still on the up – even if our bodies have mostly stopped evolving in response to it. Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,How meal timings affect your waistline,2024-09-15,2019-03-06,Linda Geddes,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190304-how-meal-timings-affect-your-waistline,"Your body clock, metabolism and digestion interact in complex ways - meaning it's not just what you eat, but when you eat, that matters. When young adults start university, they often gain weight. In the United States, they have a name for this phenomenon: the ""freshman 15"", referring to the 15lbs typically accrued during students’ first year of living away from home. In part, this weight gain can be explained by the substitution of home-cooked meals for ready meals and fast food, combined with reduction in physical activity. Increasingly, however, scientists are fingering an additional suspect: circadian disruption, brought about by a culture of late-night eating, drinking, and inconsistent sleep patterns. For decades, we’ve been told that weight gain, together with associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, are a simple matter of the quantity and type of food we consume, balanced with the number of calories we expend through exercise. But mounting evidence suggests that timing is also important: it’s not just what you eat, but when you eat that matters. The idea that our response to food varies at different times of day dates back a long way. Ancient Chinese medics believed that energy flowed around the body in parallel with the sun’s movements, and that our meals should be timed accordingly: 7-9am was the time of the stomach, when the biggest meal of the day should be consumed; 9-11am centred on the pancreas and spleen; 11am-1pm was the time of the heart, and so on. Dinner, they believed, should be a light affair, consumed between 5pm and 7pm, which was when kidney function predominated. You might also like: Although the explanation is different, modern science suggests that there is plenty of truth in that ancient wisdom. Consider studies of dieters. Most weight-loss schemes revolve around reducing the overall number of calories consumed – but what if the timing also determined the benefits? When overweight and obese women were put on a weight-loss diet for three months, those who consumed most of their calories at breakfast lost two and a half times more weight than those who had a light breakfast and ate most of their calories at dinner – even though they consumed the same number of calories overall. Many people think that the reason you gain more weight if you eat late at night is because you have less opportunity to burn off those calories, but this is simplistic. “People sometimes assume that our bodies shut down when asleep, but that’s not true,” says Jonathan Johnston at the University of Surrey, who studies how our body clocks interact with food. So, what else could be going on? Some preliminary evidence suggests that more energy is used to process a meal when it’s eaten in the morning, compared with later in the day, so you burn slightly more calories if you eat earlier. However, it’s still unclear how much of a difference this would make to overall body weight. Another possibility is that late-night eating extends the overall window during which food is consumed. This gives our digestive systems less time to recuperate and reduces the opportunity for our bodies to burn fat – because fat-burning only occurs when our organs realise that no more food is coming their way. Prior to the invention of electric light, humans woke at roughly around dawn and went to bed several hours after the sun set, with almost all food being consumed during daylight hours. “Unless we have access to light, we struggle to stay awake and eat at the wrong time,” says Satchin Panda, a circadian biologist at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, and author of The Circadian Code. His own research has revealed that the majority of North Americans eat over the course of 15 or more hours each day, with more than a third of the day’s calories consumed after 6pm, which is very different to how our ancestors must have lived. Now consider those college students, eating and drinking long into the night. “A typical college student rarely goes to sleep before midnight, and they also tend to eat until midnight,” Panda says. Yet, many students will still need to get up for classes the next day, which – assuming they eat breakfast – reduces the length of their night-time fast still further. It also means that they are cutting short their sleep, and this too could make them more likely to gain weight. Inadequate sleep impairs decision-making and self-control, potentially leading to poor food choices, and it disrupts levels of the “hunger hormones”, leptin and ghrelin, boosting appetite. It is now becoming clear that our circadian rhythms are intimately connected to our digestion and metabolism in many other ways, through the body’s intricate signalling pathways – a new understanding that could explain the long-term effects of jet lag and shift work. Inside every cell of your body, there ticks a molecular clock that regulates the timing of pretty much every physiological process and behaviour, from the release of hormones and neurotransmitters, to your blood pressure, the activity of your immune cells, and when you feel more sleepy, alert, or depressed. These clocks are kept in synchrony with each other, and with the time of day outside, through signals from a small patch of brain tissue called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). And its window on the outside world are a subset of light-responsive cells at the back of the eye called intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGs). The point of all these “circadian” clocks is to anticipate and prepare for regular events in our environment, such as the arrival of food. It means that different biochemical reactions are favoured at various times of day, allowing our internal organs to task-switch and recuperate. When we travel abroad, the timing of our light exposure changes, and our body clocks are pulled in the same direction – although the clocks in different organs and tissues adapt at different rates. The result is jet lag, which not only leaves us feeling sleepy or awake at the wrong times, but can also trigger digestive problems and general malaise. However, light isn’t the only thing that can change the timing of our clocks. When we eat our meals can also shift the hands of the clocks in the liver and digestive organs, even though the clocks in our brain cells are unaffected. Recent evidence also suggests that the timing of exercise can tweak the clocks in our muscle cells. When we fly across time zones, or eat, sleep and exercise at irregular times, the various clocks in our organs and tissues fall out of synchrony with one another. This is unlikely to be a problem if you just have the occasional late-night meal or lie-in, but if it’s a regular occurrence this may have longer-term consequences for our health. Complex processes, such as the metabolism of fats or carbohydrates from the diet, require the coordination of numerous processes occurring in the gut, liver, pancreas, muscle and fatty tissue. If the conversation between these tissues becomes scrambled, they become less efficient, which over the long term may increase our risk of various diseases.  In one recent study, researchers compared the physical effects of sleeping for five hours per night for eight days in a row, with getting the same amount of sleep but at irregular times. In both groups, people’s sensitivity to the hormone insulin dropped and systemic inflammation increased, escalating the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However, these effects were even greater in those who were sleeping at irregular times (and whose circadian rhythms were therefore knocked out of alignment): in men, the reduction in insulin sensitivity and increase in inflammation doubled. That could be a problem for frequent flyers, students who regularly sleep in, or any shift workers. According to European and North American surveys, some 15 to 30% of the working population is engaged in some form of shift work, which often equates to eating or being active when the body isn’t expecting it. Shift work has been linked to a host of conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and depression, and circadian disruption brought about by this irregularity is a prime suspect. However, we are all shift workers at least some of the time, says Panda. An estimated 87% of the general population maintains a different sleep schedule on weekdays, compared to weekends, resulting in social jet lag. People also tend to eat breakfast at least an hour later at the weekends, which can result in so-called “metabolic-jetlag”. It’s not only consistency in the timing of meals, but in the amount of food we eat at each meal that seems to be important. Gerda Pot is a nutrition researcher at King’s College London, investigating how day-to-day irregularity in people’s energy intake affects their long-term health. She was inspired by her grandmother, Hammy Timmerman, who was rigorous about routine. Each day she’d eat breakfast at 7am; lunch at 12.30pm, and dinner at 6pm. Even the timing of her snacks was intransigent: coffee at 11.30am; tea at 3pm. When Pot came to visit, she soon learned that sleeping in was a mistake: “If I woke up at 10am, she’d still insist I ate breakfast, and then we’d be having coffee and a cookie half an hour later,” she says. Increasingly, though, she is convinced that her grandmother’s rigid routine helped keep her in good health until she was almost 95. There are some good reasons why this might be. Our sensitivity to the hormone insulin, which enables the glucose from the food we eat to enter our cells and be used as fuel, is greater during the morning than at night. When we eat late (as Hammy Timmerman never did), that glucose remains in our blood for longer, which over the long term can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, where the pancreas no longer produces enough insulin. It can also damage tissues elsewhere, such as blood vessels or nerves in the eyes and feet. In the worst cases, this can result in blindness, or amputations. Using data from a UK national survey which has tracked the health of more than 5,000 people for over 70 years, Pot found that, even though they consumed fewer calories overall, people who had a more irregular meal routine had a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome – a cluster of conditions, including high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar levels, excess fat around the waist and abnormal fat and cholesterol levels in their blood, which together increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. So, what should we do about it? Striving for greater consistency in the timing of our sleep and meals is a good first step, and ideally, all our clocks should be operating on the same time zone. When we open the curtains and see bright light in the morning, this resets the master clock in the brain, so by eating breakfast soon afterward, this reinforces the message that its morning to the clocks in our liver and digestive system. Eating a good breakfast may therefore be essential to keeping our circadian clocks running in synchrony. Indeed, a recent study involving 18 healthy individuals, and 18 with type 2 diabetes, found that skipping breakfast led to disrupted circadian rhythms in both groups, as well as greater spikes in blood glucose levels when they finally did eat.  However, regularising our schedules shouldn’t come at the expense of missed sleep. Although it’s unlikely that the occasional lie-in will cause you any harm, we should generally be striving to go to bed at a time that will allow us to get adequate sleep – the recommended amount is seven to eight hours for most adults – on every day of the week. Here, light exposure could help. Dimming the lights in the evenings and getting more exposure to bright light during the day time has been shown to shift the timing of the master clock in the brain (the SCN) several hours earlier, making people more lark-like. (Read more: What I learnt by living without artificial light.) Some are advocating a more hardcore approach of forgoing all food for at least 12 hours, and possibly for as long as 14-16 hours overnight. In a landmark study published in 2012, Panda and his colleagues compared one set of mice that had access to fatty and sugary foods at any time of day or night, with another group that could only consumed these foods within an eight to 12-hour window during their “daytime”. Even though they consumed the same number of calories, the mice whose eating window was restricted appeared to be completely protected from the diseases that began to afflict the other group: obesity, diabetes, heart disease and liver damage. What’s more, when mice with these illnesses were placed on a time-restricted eating schedule, they became well again. “Almost every animal, including us, evolved on this planet with a very strong 24-hour rhythm in light and darkness, and the associated rhythms in eating and fasting,” explains Panda. “We think a major function [of these cycles] is to enable repair and rejuvenation each night. You cannot repair a highway when the traffic is still moving.” Human trials of time-restricted eating are just beginning, but some of the early results look promising – at least in certain groups. For instance, when eight men with prediabetes were randomised to eat all their meals between 8am and 3pm, their sensitivity to insulin improved and their blood pressure dropped by 10-11 points on average, compared to when they consumed the same meals within a 12-hour period. Quite what this means for the rest of us is unclear at this point, but the adage that you should breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper has never seemed truer. And it’s almost certainly worth fitting a padlock on the fridge overnight. -- Linda Geddes is a science journalist and the author of Chasing The Sun: The new science of sunlight and how it shapes our bodies and minds, published by Wellcome Collection.   Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,Shedding light on Indian business,2024-09-15,2015-11-11,Vikram Barhat,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20151109-driving-success-in-india,"There’s no blueprint for business success in India, but it’s not impossible for foreign firms to get a foothold, say those who have made it. India’s cultural diversity, social structures, operational issues and business environment make it a tough place to do business. But for those who find success, the prize may be worth it. With an economy growing at just under 8% annually, according to the World Bank, and a burgeoning middle class with disposable income and an insatiable appetite for consumption, there is a massive consumer base to tap within the country’s 1.2 billion population.  Foreign firms that have succeeded said they have had to adapt their existing companies to India. Some localised their business approach — for instance, introducing new food products to suit Indian palates. Others used the right entry strategy, promoting products in local languages, creating commercials tied into local themes or hiring popular Indian celebrities as brand ambassadors. By thinking creatively they were able to overcome some of the cultural and linguistic barriers they faced.  Here are four strategies for making it work. Find a local partner Choosing an Indian partner or agent can help businesses navigate through thorny issues, such as corruption. But this isn’t an easy marriage to make. It is crucial to hire local professionals and partner with the right Indian firms, according to Dhruv Ratra, the San Francisco-based chief executive officer of Anglian Omega Network, an umbrella group headquartered in Dubai, UAE. Ratra suggested working with tie-up agencies such as the Steinbeis Centre for Technology Transfer, the UK India Business Council or the US India Business Council that can link entrepreneurs, experts, businesses and governments. “This is how global private-equity companies first started their investments in Indian start-ups and established businesses,” he said.  Connecting with these types of organisation is a good starting point for outsiders to understand India and its unique ways of doing business, Ratra added. Major international companies, including Sun Life, Toyota, Tesco, Unilever and AIG, chose to enter into a joint venture with an Indian partner to drive their expansion.  Many firms “have succeeded by securing local tie-ups,” said Ratra, who added “it will take a little more time, but in the end foreign businesses will benefit from the experience of their Indian employees and partners.”  Combatting corruption Corruption remains a prevalent problem in India. It may shock India newbies (used to strict rules and regulations in their home markets in Europe, Australia or the US) but fending off bribery demands could become an ongoing process. One way to counter corruption is by making the right connections. Local tie-ups allow foreign businesses access to vast networks of professionals and decision makers, who can prove helpful in speeding things up and sidestep dubious middlemen and other disruptive forces.  “Companies may have to accept delays — rather than bribe — as a cost of [doing] business, hoping that introducing a policy of resistance will over time reduce the likelihood of demands for bribes,” according to a report from International Business Attitudes to Corruption: Focus on India, published by Control Risks, an independent, global risk consultancy.  Go digital. Yes, really.  Until recently, India was notorious for lengthy processing times and excessive paperwork for new firms setting up shop. But now, the digital revolution really is finally taking hold. Taking the online route can bypass numerous processing hurdles. The rapid shift online has spawned numerous online business consultancy firms, such as India Filings, KB Chandna & Co and Sikchi & Thakkar, among others, which try to help locals and outsiders set up and manage their companies in India. Government–backed agencies such as Invest India also hope to pull in global investors. “Going digital is the best way to make things transparent,” said Hardik Thakkar, a partner at Sikchi & Thakkar, an accountancy firm in the Indian state of Gujarat. “Digitisation of the income tax department, for instance, has reduced the time to process tax refunds from 18 months to about two to three months, which boosts investor confidence in governance.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support for digital movement has started to change things, including “reducing time to set up a limited liability company in India from four weeks to one,” insisted Thakkar, adding “transparency and ease of doing business are critical for businesses venturing into a foreign land.” Use local brain power  Never underestimate the management skills and talent of local professionals when it comes to overcoming regulatory barriers.  “Many Indian rules and regulations might look opaque to an outsider,” said Ratra. “However, they are fairly well-understood by local professionals, such as accountants, lawyers, and advisors, who have dealt with them throughout their careers.”  He likens the situation to India’s chaotic inner-city traffic which seems mind-boggling to an outsider, but which locals can weave through with relative ease. Cultural musts India has 22 official languages and many cultural nuances. Understand them. • In Kolkata, you are expected to sit and engage in lively and philosophical discussion before getting down to business. • In Mumbai, you have five minutes to make a sale or your Indian host is ready to move on to the next offer. • Indians will first look to build a relationship with you, and only then do issues such as price come to the fore. • Your Indian partner is highly unlikely to give you “bad news” such as a delay in the project, which upsets many Westerners. • Process-driven Westerners think more from the mind, while Indians can be driven more from the heart, in a more spontaneous manner. Source: Stephen Manallack, director at East West Academy Pty Ltd and Vikas Vij, a British entrepreneur who runs an event management business in Mumbai. Dutch national Paul Schuttenbelt, who runs Youth Football International, a football training academy, in New Delhi, said he employs a horses-for-courses policy which means he lets his local staff navigate areas that he just can’t understand. “It’s very difficult for a foreigner to know the rules and, therefore, I completely rely on good local staff members who know them.”  The same applies to dealing with India’s complex tax laws. Although the government is taking steps to overhaul the tax code, it may be advisable for foreign firms to rely on savvy local professionals to manage their tax affairs, advised Suneet Singh Tuli, president and chief executive officer of Data Wind, a Canadian tech firm specialising in low-cost digital devices such as tablets and smartphones. “It makes more sense to employ local talent for their knowledge of local laws, business practices and other nuances which an expat would not have, or would take a long time to gain,” he said. Ratra said it also helps to “start in India focusing on a single region” so as to avoid having to deal with its patchwork of state-specific tax laws. Be prepared for any legal disputes When it comes to laws and regulations, one key aspect of doing business in India is preparing for legal disputes before they occur — and knowing that they will. International law firm White & Case warns in one of its reports that resolving a business dispute in Indian courts can take as long as a decade. Foreign business companies should structure contracts in a way that disputes are resolved through offshore mediation, possibly through non-Indian courts, the report said. “Even when Indian law is the basis of the contract, it is important to agree to settle disputes through arbitration seated outside India [preferably in London or Singapore],” the study noted. “Most companies forget to consider bilateral investment treaties when structuring their investments. Bilateral investment treaties also offer important protections, shielding companies from unfair treatment by governments.” Hire smart  India has been supplying the world with doctors, engineers, technology professionals and chief executive officers for decades. So it’s not entirely unreasonable to assume India may be teeming with a highly-skilled population.  But business people say this is far from reality. There’s a large skills gap in the local market, Tuli said. For instance, while India produces hundreds of thousands of engineering graduates each year, only a handful have the practical skills that will get them hired. Teaching at the country’s trade and technology institutions is often mostly theory-based and a lack of interaction between academic institutions and industry means students aren’t exposed to practical application of their knowledge.  Another factor that has contributed to India’s shrinking job pool for long has been talent drain. The country’s elite routinely send their kids abroad for higher education, the majority of whom choose not to return. The tide, however, is turning as a growing number of foreign-educated Indians are opting to return to an India that is far more prosperous and progressive than the one they left behind. The trend is significant because it brings wealth and awareness of world markets, and enriches the country, said Professor Vivek Wadhwa, the Indian-born entrepreneur who holds academic positions in US universities: Singularity, Stanford and Duke. “Indeed, in the 1960s, [then Prime Minister] Indira Gandhi supposedly considered ways to stop Indian Institute of Technology graduates from leaving because the brain drain was so severe,” he said. “Now when you visit technology centres in any part of India, you find a significant proportion of the start-ups have returnees in senior positions,"" Wadhwa noted. ""They have taken their knowledge and values back with them from the west.” For its part, the government has made skill development a key part of its business-friendly initiatives. One such project is Skills India, a vocational and technical training program, which aims to make more than 400 million young Indians job-ready.  While these initiatives may take time to bear fruit, informal channels and word-of-mouth recommendations could be the most effective method for finding qualified workers, said British entrepreneur Vikas Vij, who runs his event management business, The Ideas Exchange, in Mumbai. “I have a team of 21 employees and everyone has come through a referral or contacted me directly,” he said. Returning western-educated, non-resident Indians could be another pool of talent to draw on. “Recently, many highly-skilled professionals who have been trained in North America, Western Europe, and Australia, have returned to India,” said Ratra. “Their familiarity with Indian culture and languages, and their western education, make them great assets to those who want to set up business in India.” And in case it gets forgotten, Australia-based Stephen Manallack, director at East West Academy Pty Ltd, a cross-border trade and investment advisory service, reminds business owners of another minor technicality: you had better have a great product offering if you want to differentiate yourself in a crowded marketplace. “The world is really knocking on India’s door,” he said. “You have to bring something innovative, special and compelling to the market.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,The rise of 'wellness travel',2024-09-15,2020-02-04,Peter Rubinstein,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200203-how-the-wellness-industry-is-taking-over-travel,"'Wellness tourism' is a growing industry, supported by travellers actively seeking ways to enhance their well-being on the go. Now, major lifestyle brands want a piece of the pie. Feel like waking up in a luxury hotel to a nutrient-rich meal of local cuisine, before scaling a mountain alongside a veteran fitness trainer? How about a few days of surfing on a private beach, with regular meditations within the tranquil Costa Rican jungle? Or perhaps you’d rather perfect your cycling technique – mindful, of course, that acupuncturists are on hand to ease that post-ride soreness. Welcome to the world of wellness tourism, the latest frontier in living our best lives. The world of wellness – a global economy of care and workout offerings, nutrients, alternative medicine and more that reached $4.5 trillion in 2018 – has witnessed a triumphant ascension over the past decade. Popular perceptions of the importance of diet, fitness and healthy practices have transformed, powering vibrant new business sectors. And as wellness evolves and expands, auxiliary markets from food and drink to hospitality are starting to provide products that reflect the values of today’s health-conscious consumers. Major companies broadly focused on the wellness lifestyle like fitness chain Equinox, indoor cycling chain SoulCycle and sports clothing retailer Lululemon are no different. As the lines blur between their products and the lifestyle they’re seeking to promote, these brands are taking steps to cater to all facets of their customers’ identity. Now all are moving into the tourism sector, offering multi-day excursions for members with health and fitness at their core. Wellness tourism is defined by the US-based non-profit Global Wellness Institute (GWI) as “travel associated with the pursuit of maintaining or enhancing one’s personal well-being”. While ‘activity’ holidays have existed for years, embarking on one of these new journeys – from hiking in Morocco with Equinox to sailing towards the Italian Riviera with Goop’s Gwyneth Paltrow – usually means a luxurious bounty of strictly curated meals, supervised workouts and an emphasis on mindfulness and enlightenment. While critics might highlight these trips, which often come with price tags of several thousand dollars, as another example of how wellness is most accessible to the most affluent, proponents say they offer opportunities for personal betterment and community engagement. So what does their emergence augur for the rapidly expanding wellness sector? New frontiers From 2015 to 2017 the wellness tourism market grew from $563bn to $639bn, or 6.5% annually – more than twice as fast as the growth of tourism overall, according to GWI. By 2022, GWI predicts the market will reach a whopping $919bn – representing 18% of all global tourism – with well over a billion individual wellness trips to take place around the globe. Anne Dimon, president of the Wellness Tourism Association, adds that while wellness travellers can be anyone, the bulk tend to be higher-educated women between ages 30 and 60. Yet despite its new visibility, the idea of travelling with the express purpose of improving well-being is by no means novel. Think back to the pilgrimages taken to the Dead Sea, ancient baths in Rome and natural hot springs across Asia – or the yoga retreats and Thai colon-cleansing holidays of more recent decades. But according to GWI, wellness tourism today is about much more than the destination or activities – it is an extension of the very values and lifestyle of the traveller. “All around the world, more people are incorporating elements of health, prevention, self-actualisation, experience and mindfulness into their daily lives,” its 2018 report says. “It is not a surprise that people now expect to continue their healthy lifestyles and wellness routines when they are away from home.” In the case of brands like Equinox, a US-headquartered fitness club known for its lavish amenities and hefty membership cost (over $3,000 per year for some), these values have translated into a new line of holistic, luxurious wellness trips aimed at the bodies, minds, souls and stomachs of the affluent. Members who sign up for a trip are what Beth McGroarty, director of research at GWI, describes as ‘primary’ wellness travellers – people who travel with an exclusive focus on wellness-centred experiences or destinations. And although this group only makes up 14% of wellness tourism spending – the other 86% comes from ‘secondary’ travellers who incorporate wellness activities into otherwise standard business or leisure trips – their average trip cost is much, much higher. “[Primary] travellers at the domestic level spend about 178% more than your average traveller,” McGroarty says. “And at the international level, they spend 53% more.” For Equinox, moving into tourism means recreating the extravagance of their brand in new locales. And so far, filling spots with willing ‘primary’ travellers has been an easy task. Leah Howe, senior director of Equinox Explore (the brand’s travel line) says that almost 100% of its clubs have expressed interest in attending a trip. Several of the six excursions planned for 2020, each limited to 12 to 20 people, have already sold out. The cheapest of the bunch (a four-day running tour of Florence) starts at $2,350, while the priciest (six days of hiking in Morocco) begins at $6,250. Attendees who can afford the latter will summit Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in the Arab world, alongside two professional trainers, dine on local cuisine and engage in breathing sessions, yoga and hammam treatment. The goal with Explore, Howe says, is for members to return home feeling better than when they left. The attendees are intent on maintaining their focus on health, fitness and luxury even while away. It’s because of their pre-established connection to the brand that they trust Equinox to be the authority in the travel space and beyond, she says. Proven practices? Some might argue that allegiance to particular brands can be far more costly than necessary. Contrary to what some providers might suggest, maintaining wellness can be simple and relatively inexpensive. “The basics of good health are straightforward,” says Margaret McCartney, a Glasgow-based general practitioner and author. “Not smoking, careful with alcohol, diet with fruit, veg and wholegrains, exercise, social connectivity.” The benefits provided by wellness brands can be numerous, but as the industry swells is there a risk we’re being persuaded to spend excessively? That depends, says David Colquhoun, a pharmacologist at University College London and author of science-debunking blog DC’s Improbable Science. “Nobody could possibly be against well-being. It would be like opposing motherhood and apple pie,” he wrote in 2011. “The only question that really matters is, how much of it works?” The high-end wellness tourism sector is a broad spectrum. Offerings from brands like SoulCycle or Equinox revolve around fitness and healthy eating, all wrapped in luxury that allows members to forget about logistics and focus on their betterment. Yet the industry at large also includes companies criticised for promoting scientifically unproven products and practices, like food manufacturers with dodgy interpretations of “natural” foods, “homeopathic” diet products made illegal or “barefoot” running shoes with greater injury risks. Goop, the vastly successful lifestyle brand founded by American actress Gwyneth Paltrow, has received the most scrutiny for its own wellness products, which many say rely on faulty pseudoscience. Most recently, its Netflix programme The Goop Lab – which explores the effectiveness of alternative therapies – was described as a “considerable health risk” by Simon Stevens, chief executive of public body National Health Service England. In January, the company announced it would be taking its own step towards the tourism industry with a debut cruise. Attendees who purchase Suite Class accommodations aboard Celebrity Cruises’ Celebrity Apex ship on 26 August for an 11-night voyage between Spain, France and the Italian Riviera (with a starting price of more than $2,000) will experience one day of Goop-hosted panels, classes and a workout, as well as see Paltrow in person. Kiki Koroshetz, Goop’s wellness director, says she hopes guests might take home “a new perspective on a mental loop that plays regularly in someone’s mind. It might be a tool for managing stress, for having a difficult conversation, for experiencing more joy, for finding connection.” Pseudoscience notwithstanding, if the sign-up sheet follows the lead of previous sold-out Goop events, the initiative will look healthy from the start – demonstrating that for this brand of wellness tourism too, there’s an appetite. “Goop understands this and has built its brand on the foundation of curiosity and non-judgement, and has been incredibly successful in building a community along the way,” says Gabrielle Lieberman, director of trends and social media research at market research company Mintel. “As consumers set out for a more holistic approach to managing their well-being, it makes sense then that they would want this to extend into their travel experiences as well.” Finding your community Whatever the exact content of these wellness trips, those within the industry agree that the sense of community attendees experience is a key takeaway. McGroarty says reserving a spot on a branded trip can feel like buying into a tribe. Dedicating the time, resources and energy to a multi-day trip is a serious commitment, even for those who can afford it, and ensures you will be surrounded by people who share your sensibilities. According to Howe of Equinox, this connection inspires a certain feeling that can’t be found exercising or meditating by yourself. The concept, first coined by French sociologist Émile Durkheim in 1912, is called “collective effervescence”, and refers to the way communal gatherings can intensify the experience of the group. The intoxication of shared activities, such as a yoga class or group hike, can enhance the emotional quality and create deep bonds between the actors, Durkheim surmised. Despite their differences, both Equinox and Goop understand this idea, and accordingly advertise it as a centrepiece for travellers. “The communal aspect is key,” agrees André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at City University London and co-author of The Wellness Syndrome. In addition to positive feelings in the moment, he says these trips can act as temporary replacements for the many communities that have been undermined over recent decades. “These include local communities, religions, families and so on.” Wellness trips provide a brief antidote to the competition people face in their everyday lives and a chance to enjoy likeminded company, he says. For some, luxury retreats may also inspire the same brag-worthy feeling of sitting at a VIP table, a welcome addition to their other benefits. McGroarty acknowledges that proper scrutiny of the various wellness offerings is healthy for the growth of the market. But both she and Dimon agree that if momentum keeps up, and consumers continue to be proactive about their health and stay across available options, wellness tourism will be valued at $1tn in no time. The big brands spearheading new initiatives within it will certainly seek to expand, perhaps tilting the scale more towards ‘primary’ travellers as time goes on. Dimon believes that a wellness trip may even become an annual event that individuals undertake for the betterment of body, mind and spirit. And that might make the experience more accessible, as lower-cost providers enter the market or tourism providers pivot towards the wellness space. Three quarters of American adults report that they are actively seeking ways to improve their health, Lieberman says. “While for most people this may mean incremental changes in how they manage their health, luxury experiences like these allow us to see what all is possible in pushing the limits. “You’ll see these wellness retreats become even less of a novelty and integrated more naturally into everyday experiences,” she says. “Accessibility is key here, in that managing your health shouldn’t feel out of reach.” Photo courtesy of Waldhotel."
risk appetite,The rise of 'overemployed' workers,2024-09-15,2021-09-29,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210927-the-overemployed-workers-juggling-remote-jobs,"Now out of the daily eye of managers, people are taking on additional, secret jobs. What could go wrong? Two corporate email addresses, two computers, two bosses? As many knowledge workers have been remote for nearly two years, out of their manager’s line of vision, an increasing number of people are quietly taking on second full-time positions. Home-based set-ups have enabled workers to secretly do two remote jobs at once – and some workers are banking hundreds of thousands of extra dollars per year. An extra job can become a safety net of extra income and experience – useful tools in an age of mass redundancies, economic uncertainty and continually deprioritised worker wellbeing. Yet taking on an extra full-time job is a bold choice that requires stealth and an appetite for risk. Some workers who are taking the leap into overemployment do so to take back a sense of control, or to game a system they believe has exploited them for too long. Working the system It’s not uncommon to hear of workers pursuing side hustles while they work in full-time jobs: selling jewellery on Etsy, driving an Uber during after hours, assembling furniture at weekends with TaskRabbit. But 'overemployment’ is different: an employee could hold simultaneous, separate full-time jobs, completed on different computers.   Overemployment is not an entirely new phenomenon. It’s been an “open secret” in the tech industry for years, says an overemployed worker in his late 30s in the US Bay Area who goes by ‘Isaac’ in the overemployment community. He’s been working two jobs for years, and says he makes more than $600,000 doing it. In April 2021, Isaac launched Overemployed, a website with articles about how to navigate holding down multiple remote jobs. (The number one rule? Don’t talk about holding down multiple remote jobs.) He says that for the past 20 years, some workers have exploited pockets in the tech industry that were remote-friendly long before the pandemic. But now, as more workers across fields all over the world have been given the opportunity to work from home, anecdotal evidence suggests more people are exploring the overemployment lifestyle. Isaac says users of his site live all over the world and “run the gamut” of ages, from those 60-plus to people in their 20s, just starting out (who may even “double intern” and hold two remote internships). But he says most users tend to be in the 35-to-40 age range, who “have a lot of experience already and are a little jaded by the corporate world”. Generally, both before the pandemic and during it, Isaac says it’s rare to hear of anybody getting caught; usually it’s a matter of the individual being sloppy in keeping the two jobs separate, although he’s heard of an instance in which spyware caught a programmer running a script he wasn’t supposed to be running on his primary job’s computer – that person got fired. Isaac maintains overemployment doesn’t necessarily mean working extra-long days – workers can put in 30 hours a week at their primary job, for example, and then use the time that would’ve otherwise been filled by non-mandatory meetings or cyberloafing for their second job. Of course, overemployment is legally tricky: whether it’s possible depends on what kind of contract a worker signed when they were hired at their primary job, and if they’re breaking any non-compete agreements. And unsurprisingly, it’s extremely controversial, or even seen as unethical; contractual obligations aside, workers are essentially lying (by omission or otherwise) to their ‘main’ employer. News outlets have called this kind of ‘business bigamy’ dishonest and wrong when readers have written in asking for advice as to whether they should ‘out’ overemployed colleagues at work. But for those who can make the arrangement work – both legally and logistically – Isaac argues overemployed workers stand to gain a lot.  ‘A moment of reckoning’ Unsurprisingly, Isaac says one reason workers take on a second, secret full-time job is to diversify sources of cash flow and make money in more efficient ways. But he believes money isn’t the entire driver.  Catherine Chandler-Crichlow, executive director for career management at Ivey Business School at Western University in Ontario, Canada, agrees, saying the framing of overemployed workers “surreptitiously trying to make more money” isn’t necessarily correct. “As we have been forced to work from home, people have probably started looking at, ‘where can my skill set be truly optimised?, ‘What are some of the things that I have a real passion for – and how might I use those skills differently?’,” she says. Chandler-Crichlow, who specialises in studying human capital – the skills, expertise and knowledge workers bring to their jobs – says that this concept is especially germane to the discussion of overemployment. For example, there may be someone who has a primary job of being a financial analyst, but they also enjoy something else, like coding or writing. The current widespread remote working situation allows that analyst to find a job coding or writing, and to put those skills to use.   “I now become the master of what I would like to do and where I would like to spend my time,” says Chandler-Crichlow. She says that for workers in lower socio-economic groups, holding down multiple jobs is a means of survival. But what’s different here is that “professionals who could be described as highly skilled are taking greater ownership of their careers”. Erin Hatton, associate professor of sociology who studies work and labour at the University at Buffalo in New York, US, agrees. “Maybe [workers are] trying new things. I think this is a moment of reckoning with the world of work, and thinking about what role work plays in our lives,” says Hatton. Overemployment can “free people to maybe try on other jobs for size; maybe take on extra work that may not pay well, but may be more meaningful to them.” So, it’s no coincidence that more people are trying this out in recent months. “I think the pandemic may have pushed people to do more of that deep thought and what it is they’re spending their lives doing, and deciding I could probably do more with my life,” says Chandler-Crichlow. By pursuing overemployment more workers seem to be saying to themselves, she says: “’Yes, I want to really utilise the skills and capabilities I have. And if someone wants to pay me – I’ll do it.’” Railing against employers The fact that people are turning to overemployment also signals important systemic workplace issues. For a long time, many workers have felt like their jobs are unfulfilling or meaningless – leading to problems like burnout and boreout – and that they’re constantly chasing success within a system that gives managers a disproportionate amount of power within the working relationship. That may be one of the reasons overemployment has become more popular, experts say. So if managers don’t realise workers are doing this, are they bad managers? “My sense is that they simply do not have systems in place to surveil workers in this way,” says Hatton. “For many lower wage workers, both remote and non-remote, there is plenty of surveillance that effectively disallows this kind of double dipping. Think call centre workers who work remotely but technology monitors the number of calls they take. But for workers who [are] typically in the worksite and are not already punitively surveilled in this way, they just don’t have a system in place to monitor and enforce this.” “How employers respond to this could also vary across of a spectrum of no support at one end,” says Chandler-Crichow, to companies somewhat giving their blessing, “as long as it does not impact your responsibilities at their organisations.” From Isaac’s perspective as an overemployed worker, and based on the activity on his website, one of the reasons people take on secret second jobs is because they feel disillusioned with the realities of corporate life. Some workers believe secret overemployment helps them break free of employers that haven’t given them that promotion or pay rise they’ve been chasing for years. “There’s a sense that our bosses own us a little bit, and I see this as an interesting pushback against that normative sense of ownership,” says Hatton. “It’s expected that we really owe them everything. That we’re theirs. But when push comes to shove, they can fire us tomorrow for no reason at all. This is taking back a little bit of that sense of power.” When Isaac's company was rolling out redundancies during the pandemic, he survived, but emerged with new resolve – he wouldn’t be one of many faceless employees. “You treat me like a number, I’m going to treat you like a number,” he says. So, armed with two separate laptops, he works two separate jobs, plus a part-time gig. He says he’s never been found out or had any close calls. What happens next? Overemployment may be ticking up, but those who go for the secret second job are still in the minority – and the move still carries a lot of risk. Plus, as the increase in overemployment is relatively new, there’s a lot both workers and employers alike don’t yet know. For instance, it’s unclear how companies will respond if they feel vulnerable, or if they realise an employee is breaching the terms of a non-compete contract. Perhaps managers will more closely monitor employees’ social media activity to find something incriminating, or might install software on company machines to detect anything fishy. For now, though, some workers will embrace overemployment – as long as one of their supervisors doesn’t catch them."
risk appetite,Quit — or fight corruption?,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Chana R Schoenberger,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20141031-quit-or-fight-corruption,"Your Question Here Work Ethic is a twice-monthly column on BBC Capital in which we consider the ethical and interpersonal dilemmas that workers face around the world. We welcome knotty questions from readers at workethic@bbc.com.  More Worth Ethic topics: Q: I work for a government-owned enterprise. As a citizen, I feel this company belongs in part to me, and I have a strong desire for it to succeed. However, I see unethical behaviour going on around me. The logical path is to quit, but I don't want to give up on the company. What can I do?  A: This is a patriot’s dilemma: how best to serve your country without becoming a part of actions you don’t condone. As you note, the easiest way to get away from problematic conduct at work is to quit and get another job where you don’t find yourself in troubling situations. But you don’t want to do that, because you feel there’s a higher ethical value in working to build a company on behalf of the country. Refusing to run from the problem is admirable, but solving it can be tough. If you’re staying, you have several options, notes Amy Wrzesniewski, an associate professor of organisational behaviour at the Yale University School of Management. “The most direct path to addressing the unethical behaviour you see is to figure out a way to bring attention to it so that change might happen,” she said by email. Yet doing this without getting fired is easier said than done. Check to see if your country has well-enforced whistleblower protection laws, Wrzesniewski suggests. Within the company, you will have better luck getting your message to the top if you have a sponsor at work, “a personal champion in the system who is willing to support you and back you up as you raise the issues you see,” she said. If you have this legal protection available, and you feel comfortable approaching your sponsor with your concerns, that’s the most direct approach. If not, you’ll have to take the covert route. Wrzesniewski suggests coming up with a new idea for an old problem that could subtly replace corrupt practices. Sometimes, a new approach can be “demonstrably more efficient, simpler, or data-driven, while also being far less open to gaming or unethical behavior,” she said. For instance, if you’re witnessing contracts awarded to the vendor who pays the highest kickbacks, you could suggest moving the bidding and award process to an online system that has greater transparency. Or if you’re seeing discriminatory hiring practices, consider asking if the company can create a database that tracks hiring by applicant characteristics. This would make it clear who’s being hired and why. “By proposing changes that undermine unethical behavior — directly or indirectly — you will learn quickly how interested the company is in changing,” Wrzesniewski said. There is also an opportunity to find like-minded people and institute small changes with them. Some colleagues may think that corruption and government go hand-in-hand. Such attitudes can be deeply ingrained, and you may not be able to change colleagues’ minds. But there are likely a few people who share the same beliefs about civic responsibility within a state-owned enterprise. If you’ve found a compatriot, you can brainstorm ideas for new procedures that cut out the possibility for corruption. The two of you can also look through your networks for potential sponsors to quarterback change; perhaps your partner in crime-fighting has stronger internal relationships than you do. If there’s little appetite for change on either a grassroots or an official level, you are once again faced with the same choice: stick with being an ethical person in an unethical environment, or quit.

risk appetite,The town at the centre of the world,2024-09-15,2019-01-02,Anne Burke,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20190101-a-strange-museum-at-the-centre-of-the-world,"Thirty years ago, Jacques-André Istel decided to move to the desert and think of something to do. Since then, he has constructed a museum intended to last until the year 6000. Around 30 years ago, Jacques-André Istel turned to his wife, Felicia Lee, and said, “We’re going to sit in the desert and think of something to do.” Hardly an enticing proposition, but by then, Lee was surely used to her husband’s hare-brained schemes. In 1971, at great risk to himself and his then bride-to-be, Istel piloted the couple on a round-the-world flight in a tiny, twin-engine plane that had hardly the oomph of a Chevrolet automobile. Before that, there was the whole business of convincing people to jump out of planes: in the 1950s, after returning home from the Korean War, where he served with the US Marines, Istel developed parachuting equipment and techniques that made it possible for the average Joe to leap out of an airplane at 2,500ft and land as if having tumbled from a 4ft bookcase. Soon, Americans by the thousands were enjoying the latest craze: skydiving. Lee was a reporter for Sports Illustrated– she met Istel, by then known as ‘the father of American sport parachuting’, during an interview for a piece in the magazine – and had her own taste for adventure. “If I told her tomorrow we were going to Mars, she would say, ‘What do I pack?’,” Istel said. You may also be interested in: • A museum measured in millimetres • A largely unsung piece of Americana • Why this US city is so absurd And so, in the 1980s, the couple moved to the far south-east corner of California, a few miles west of Yuma, Arizona, off Interstate 8, where Istel had acquired a 2,600-acre parcel of land several decades earlier. Apart from a good aquifer, this particular patch of the Sonoran Desert had little to recommend it. But “we realised that we loved it – the calm, the beauty,” Istel said. With nothing much around apart from an RV park and some impressively tall sand dunes, the couple’s desert refuge was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. So it made sense, at least in Istel’s fervid imagination, to put it in the middle of somewhere. In 1985, the French-born parachuting pioneer cajoled California’s Imperial County Board of Supervisors into designating a spot on his property as The Official Centre of the World. (Audacious, perhaps, but not necessarily inaccurate, given that anywhere on the Earth’s surface could be the centre.) A landmark of such importance needed a town of its own. The following year, Istel created Felicity, which now boasts about 15 residents and its own freeway sign. Facing no opposition, Istel got himself elected mayor that same year – apparently for life. But Istel wasn’t done with his Xanadu in the desert. He had an idea to build a granite monument with inscriptions honouring people and places important in his life – fellow parachutists, his alma mater (Princeton University in New Jersey), and his family, who had fled France during World War Two and settled in New York. His father, André, had been an advisor to Charles de Gaulle, and his mother, Yvonne, was a wartime volunteer. Istel didn’t want just any monument. It had to be magnificent and, more importantly, it had to be something that would last far, far into the future. He hired structural engineers who came up with a design for an elongated, granite triangle that just might – “short of the planet blowing up,” Istel said – survive to the year 6000. The triangular monument went up in 1991; it was 100ft long, about 4.5ft high, and faced with some 60 panels of polished, red granite. The durability came from what was inside: steel-reinforced concrete sunk into trenches 3ft deep. Istel then decided he would build another monument, this one to honour US marines who fought and died in the Korean War. Then came a third monument, and a fourth, and a fifth. Today, 20 granite monuments, arranged at artful angles across the desert floor, collectively make up The Museum of History in Granite, a sort of open-air bank of knowledge for the ages. As a visitor posted on TripAdvisor, the museum is where “Martians will come to learn about humanity”. Istel has engraved his stone triangles with tidy distillations of much of what we know about the world, from the Big Bang to former US president Barack Obama. Visitors – and they come by the thousands each year – learn about Hinduism, the eruption of Vesuvius, the Zapotecs of central Mexico, Buddhism, the birth of Jesus, Attila the Hun, Pythagoras' theorem, the behaviour of the walrus, Greek philosophy, the Gettysburg Address, the Moon landing and terrorism in contemporary times. Despite his Ivy League background, Istel believes strongly that self-acquired knowledge “is probably the best form of education”. The idea behind these thumbnail sketches of history is to offer just enough information to whet the reader’s appetite. Most topics – even big ones – get at most a couple hundred words. Lee handles most of the research, using reputable publishers like Oxford, Britannica and Larousse. Istel writes the text, then he and Lee go back and forth on the wording before settling on a final version. An entry titled ‘Interesting Times’ went through 59 drafts. Once the text is ready, professional engravers get to work, often toiling in the glow of lamplight under a night sky to escape the brutal desert heat. To accompany the text, artists etch illustrations into the hard stone panels. The museum can’t cover everything, so “you pick and choose things that are interesting,” Istel said. He often groups related items into a single theme. The Code of Hammurabi and the Ten Commandments appear under ‘Early Concepts of Law’. The American concept of ‘Manifest Destiny’ is mentioned on a panel called ‘Exploring and Expanding’, along with the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Some topics are of personal interest to Istel – parachuting gets ample space – while other topics come as suggestions from others. Lee came up with the idea for a panel on the ‘Great Seal of the United States’, the US’ official coat of arms. Some of the inscriptions are amusing, if little more. For example, in 1809, US president James Madison proposed a cabinet post of Secretary of Beer. Hamburgers “account for nearly 60% of all sandwiches eaten”. The grizzly in California’s original Bear Republic flag “looked more like a pig than a bear”. The typical Wild West cowboy was “frequently hundreds of miles from the nearest bar or woman”. The TV mute button, which Istel considers “one of the world’s great inventions”, gets a mention. Istel aims for objectivity and is a stickler for accuracy. But given that even reputable sources will disagree on certain points, it’s a difficult challenge. “The answer is, you do the best you can,” Istel said. The museum’s official season runs during the cooler months. From the day after Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November) through the end of March, visitors can join a 15-minute tour led by a volunteer docent, watch a short video about the museum or grab a bite at the small restaurant. During the rest of the year, the museum is open, but only for self-guided tours. Istel’s property is also dotted with pieces of art and architecture that seemingly have little to do with anything, but add a bit of absurdist fun. A 25ft section of the original spiral staircase from the Eiffel Tower rises incongruously into the desert sky. A bronze sculptural replica of Michelangelo’s ‘Arm of God’, from the painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, acts as the gnomon of a sundial. There is also a hollow, 21ft pink-granite pyramid, inside which is a metal plaque that marks the centre of the world. A $2 fee, on top of the museum’s regular admission of $3 per person, entitles visitors to a certificate attesting to having stood on the exact spot. The tallest and most striking element on the property is a little white chapel that sits poetically atop a 35ft earthen hill. Istel is not particularly religious, but he thought it fitting to install the chapel if for no other reason than to “keep us on our good behaviour”. Istel and Lee live alongside the museum in a lovely, light-filled house with big windows that look out on chocolate-coloured mountains. There’s a library stocked with leather-bound volumes and a piano that Lee plays. Istel serves guests fizzy water – wine if they prefer – in crystal glasses. Istel has made plans in his estate for the museum and all that surrounds it. Yet – as he approaches his 90th birthday – he has no plans of slowing down. The museum is far from complete. Dozens of blank granite panels await text and illustrations. There is also a new freeway sign to be installed, and the never-ending task of keeping up with online reviews. Istel responds to each – even the mean ones – with unfailing politeness. If residents of other worlds do indeed visit the museum one day, Istel would not be particularly surprised. He believes that humans will one day colonise other planets and eventually stars, so it’s not inconceivable that they could, at some point, return to Earth. One granite panel bears a big question mark, along with this inscription: “May distant descendants, perhaps far from planet Earth, view our collective history with understanding and affection.” Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

risk appetite,NI will not host WRC round in 2022,2024-09-15,2022-01-18,Andy Gray,https://www.bbc.com/sport/motorsport/59909617,"Irish driver Craig Breen will not have a home round of the World Rally Championship in 2022 Northern Ireland will not host a round of the World Rally Championship in 2022 but the door has been left open by organisers for 2023. Rally Northern Ireland had been tipped to fill the vacant slot on the 13-round WRC calendar from 18-21 August. Bobby Willis, event director for Rally NI, said the decision was ""disheartening"" but the organising team would work towards 2023. WRC officials remain keen to bring the series to Northern Ireland next year. Simon Larkin, WRC event director, said the promoter ""shares everyone's disappointment"" that the championship would not be coming to Northern Ireland's tarmac stages in August. He added: ""We will spend the next couple of months with Bobby, Tourism NI and the NI Executive over the next few months to try and make that a reality."" After months of talks, Tourism Northern Ireland revealed governing body Motorsport UK sent a letter stating it was ""unable to proceed"" with the rally in 2022 despite the Department for the Economy continuing to evaluate funding for the event. In response, Motorsport UK stated the lack of a decision from the Northern Ireland Executive and the ""increasing financial risk"" of underwriting the rally made ""continuing the project unviable"", and the decision taken was ""extremely disappointing"".  Motorsport UK added it is ""committed to working to bring the WRC back to the UK, with full support at the highest levels of the organisation, whilst acknowledging the appropriate funding needed to ensure that any associated financial risks are manageable and contained"". The British round of the World Rally Championship has been held in Wales since 2000, but in 2020 was cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to the traditional WRC event in Wales, a cross-border Rally Ireland took place in 2007 and 2009, with both editions won by nine-time WRC champion Sebastien Loeb. Nine-time WRC champion Sebastien Loeb won both editions of the cross-border Rally Ireland in 2007 and 2009 A bid to bring the WRC to Northern Ireland failed in 2020 and 2021, the latter due to Covid-19, but looked like it would get over the line at the third time of asking after WRC organisers left a slot available on the calendar, which BBC Sport understands was made available for Rally NI should the funding have been secured. However, Motorsport UK's withdrawal from the process leaves the United Kingdom without a round of rallying's premier championship for the third consecutive year. ""It is disheartening for competitors and fans in the UK and Ireland that they are missing out on a world-class event like the WRC for a third consecutive year,"" added Willis. ""This is a huge loss and the rally would have generated £10m for the economy with visitors expected to come from all over the world and it would have been the post-Covid boost that tourism and hospitality in the province so badly needs. ""I intend to work closely with the WRC Promoter to identify options for 2023. There is strong support for our event as the motorsport community in the UK and across Ireland as a whole has an incredible appetite to see the WRC back here."" 'WRC would showcase Irish rallying' Willis' desire to continue with a bid in 2023 has been backed by Larkin and the WRC, who said ""the door will remain open"". ""WRC Promoter and all of the stakeholders were extremely excited at the prospect of a rally in Northern Ireland,"" added Larkin. ""There is a strong history of heroes and drivers coming out of Ireland, and there is a passion for motorsport and you can see that with the motorbikes and road racing.  ""There is a lot of enthusiasm, and there is also a lot of knowledge. We are certain it would have provided a significant return on investment. It is a pity and I hope we can do it in 2023."" Rally Northern Ireland would have provided an opportunity for Welsh driver Elfyn Evans and Ireland's Craig Breen to showcase the hew hybrid World Rally cars on a home stage. This video can not be played WRC will not come to NI in 2022 - reaction from Willis and McErlean While the absence of a British round will hit rallying in the UK and Ireland, it is also a blow for up and coming drivers who are working their way up the World Rally ladder, including for 22-year-old NI driver Josh McErlean. ""Having Rally NI would be a huge boost to me and my career. It would bring more limelight into the world of rallying,"" said McErlean, who is aiming to return to the championship in 2022 in Rally2 machinery. ""You can see how much exposure the rallies get and how they get people on board and everyone can see what it is all about.  ""Rally NI would have been a huge opportunity to showcase myself and show what we are doing in the World Championship. ""You could see how many people were interested in golf after the Open came to Portrush so I think it would have been a great opportunity to showcase rallying in a similar light."""
risk appetite,'A painful brush with reality for Chelsea',2024-09-15,2020-09-20,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54229321,"This video can not be played MOTD2: Chelsea can't win the league with Kepa - Shearer Frank Lampard's £200m summer spending spree designed to move Chelsea closer to Premier League champions Liverpool was never going to bring instant results - but Sunday's 2-0 home defeat was still a bruising, painful brush with reality. Lampard's immediate concern will be the replacement of Chelsea's calamitous goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, who once more flouted his £71m price tag to such an extent that it might well have had owner Roman Abramovich demanding to know who was responsible for him signing that cheque. The Blues are now close to completing the £20m purchase of Rennes keeper Edouard Mendy, formalities possibly hastened by the manner in which Kepa's awful clearance gifted Sadio Mane his second goal in Liverpool's 2-0 win. In the wider context, Chelsea and Lampard's negative approach came as a surprise, arguably exaggerating the already very large gulf in class between themselves and their visitors. There must, however, be realism and context. Match report: Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool How you rated the players It always takes time for a clutch of new signings to settle in, for a team to adapt around them, and Chelsea's business this summer has been extensive. Timo Werner worked tirelessly in a hopeless cause, winning a late penalty missed by Jorginho, while Kai Havertz was taken off as Lampard reshaped his line-up after defender Andreas Christensen was correctly sent off for a panic-stricken rugby tackle on Mane just before half-time. Chelsea's defensive cavalry, Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell, are not yet ready while attacker Hakim Ziyech has been injured. The brilliant Christian Pulisic is also injured - so it is far too early to dig into Lampard's dealings this summer. Antonio Rudiger, strangely, was nowhere to be seen and while Fikayo Tomori did nothing wrong as a substitute, the German's experience and physical presence might have helped. It was an exclusion that seemed at odds with Chelsea's requirements. What also raised eyebrows was the home side's passive, conservative gameplan that handed impetus to Liverpool from the first whistle, something they were more than happy to accept. This video can not be played Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool: Frank Lampard says Christensen red card changed everything Chelsea got so stuck in a rigid defensive rut, hoping Werner's pace would threaten on the counter-attack, that they could not get out. It is madness to suggest Lampard's men should have come out and thrown the kitchen sink at Liverpool but their approach resembled a team that would have settled for a point and hoped a bit of pace and magic might snatch all three on the break. It was not happening. It was never happening. The Reds were too good, too ruthless and too packed with quality not to take advantage of what they were offered. Lampard's strategy was even more high-risk against Liverpool given the fact both his goalkeeper and the current Chelsea defence represent accidents waiting to happen, which they duly did. An already nervous defence is frayed even further by a nervous keeper. Silva will bring experience and calm, although he will have to become accustomed to the Premier League, while Chilwell should offer more solidity than Marcos Alonso. Chelsea will improve once these quality players bed in but this was a chance to make a powerful statement of where they want to be and they lost with a whimper, well on the way down and out even before the numerical disadvantage brought about by Christensen's dismissal. And for all the business of the summer, Chelsea's main problem has remained unaddressed (although it is about to be) in the shape of the shot confidence of keeper Kepa. This is a goalkeeper Lampard lost faith in last season, even preferring 38-year-old Willy Caballero at the end of the season, so it has to be questioned why Kepa somehow survived until the opening games this season, where he has been predictably unimpressive against Brighton and now Liverpool. The home side at Stamford Bridge deserved nothing, irrespective of the sending off, and in the end it could have been worse. Lampard can still reflect on the fact he will soon have the ability to add touches of class and experience but the lack of ambition in Chelsea's approach was disappointing, as was the result. Liverpool, on the other hand, demonstrated their hunger and desire has not been reduced by the club's first title in 30 years. If anyone wanted an answer to whether the glory of last season will lessen their appetite, it came here. A good few days for Jurgen Klopp's side, in which they have added elite quality in Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich and also strengthened the squad with the arrival of Diogo Jota from Wolves, has ended in highly satisfactory fashion with a victory that was even easier than the scoreline suggests. Manchester City and others harbouring dreams of mounting a challenge (reality suggests it will only be Pep Guardiola's side) would not have needed any reminder about how tough it will be to take the title away.  Liverpool gave them one anyway. This video can not be played Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool: Klopp happy with 'super mature' Liverpool performance"
risk appetite,Pupils to be vaccinated against Hep A,2024-09-15,2019-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-47032126,"Nearly 200 pupils and staff at a West Dunbartonshire primary school are to be vaccinated against Hepatitis A after a child contracted the illness. Parents of pupils at St Mary's primary in Alexandria have been notified but the source of the infection is unknown. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it was a precautionary measure and the likelihood of children becoming unwell due to the infection was low.  Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and nausea. Hepatitis A can also sometimes lead to yellowing of the skin and eyes - jaundice - due to inflammation of the liver.  Public health consultant Dr Gillian Penrice said: ""In children, the infection is often very mild and may cause no symptoms at all.  ""This means that children can be carrying Hepatitis A and pass it on to adults, who are more at risk of complications. ""Infection with Hepatitis A can be caused by consuming contaminated food or water.  ""The virus can also spread from someone with the infection to others in the same environment, for example if they share toilets, or by eating food touched by a person with the infection."" The vaccination programme follows a review by the NHSGGC public health team, together with Health Protection Scotland and West Dunbartonshire Council. Dr Penrice added: ""Our investigations have not identified a suspected source of the infection.  ""Therefore, as a precaution, we are recommending a Hepatitis A vaccination for all primary school children who attend.  ""The vaccine reduces the risk of being infected after being in contact with someone who has the infection."" A Q&A drop-in session has been organised at the school for Tuesday, from 15:00 to 16:00, and a vaccination session will take place in on Friday. Anyone who develops any symptoms is asked to contact their GP or, if it is out-of-hours, call NHS 24 on 111."
risk appetite,The millions of 'missing' babies after 2008 crash,2024-09-15,2018-09-13,By Kim Gittleson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45478670," In 2008, I was one of the 1.5 million students who graduated from university in the US. And, like everyone else, I was caught off guard. Whatever we expected then, the reality today is that as a generation, we have more debt, fewer children and quite a few scars.  A decade on, there has been quite a bit of handwringing about what's changed since the financial crisis. And I'm convinced that the biggest fallout isn't the increased regulation, or the jailed bankers (or lack thereof), but the impact it had on those of us who were just entering the workforce in 2008. To find out more, I've travelled around the country asking experts and fellow 2008 graduates - what happened to us? In the decade since the recession, American women had 4.8 million fewer babies than demographers were expecting. No, that isn't a typo.  ""Every year when I look at the fertility data I expect the number of births to go up and it hasn't,"" says University of New Hampshire Professor Kenneth Johnson. Prof Johnson says part of the fertility decline is attributable to women in their early and late 20s having fewer children than expected - in other words, my classmates and those who came after us. And it's not getting better. The gap is getting wider - which is why he brings up a historical parallel. ""There were a group of women who were in their early 20s at the beginning of the Great Depression who never made up for the births that they didn't have. ""More of them are childless than any group of American women before or since."" The question, says Prof Johnson, is if we too will simply forego births like the women of the Depression or if we're simply just waiting longer. Nora Carroll graduated from the University of Nevada Las Vegas in 2008 and says she delayed starting a family due to the crash. ""I spent the last decade really concentrating on getting a stable career, saving enough money so I can purchase a house,"" she says. ""All of that just takes time [especially because] being in a lower paying job [it] takes a little bit longer."" She is now expecting her first child. In the UK, research commissioned by the BBC found that people who are 30-39 years old now were worst affected by the financial crisis - losing on average 7.2% in real terms, or £2,057 ($2,684) a year between 2008 and 2017. That's pretty similar to what happened in the US.  Americans born in the mid-1980s have accumulated 34% less wealth than predicted based on previous generations, the St Louis Federal Reserve found. One reason? We started out with less. The average salary of a newly-minted college graduate in 2008 was $46,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was 8% less, adjusted for inflation, than college graduates aged 25 to 34 earned in 2002. Just two out of five millennials are invested in the stock market.  And even those of us who do invest have ventured only about $7,000, according to the Federal Reserve. That's not simply because we're money-strapped. ""Investors' willingness to bear financial risk depends on personal experiences of macroeconomic history"", economists at the University of California-Berkeley have found. In other words, if you are a young person who, say, watched the Dow Jones plummet over 500 points in one day - your appetite for risk is slim. So even though the S&P 500 officially entered the longest bull market in history this summer - rising over 325% since the depths of the financial crisis - well, we haven't really benefited from all those stock market gains. The homeownership rate of millennials between the ages of 25 and 34 was 37% in 2015 - 8% lower than that of prior generations, according to the Urban Institute. In the UK, the home-ownership rate for millennials has nearly halved. There are plenty of explanations - not least fewer children, less wealth and coming of age after the housing market imploded. When we do manage to buy property, it's worth a lot less than the average first-homes of prior generations.  The average median home value for someone aged 18-33 in 2013 was $133,000 compared to $197,000 for the same age group in 2007. Trust in institutions was on the decline well before the financial crisis, but as a generation, our faith is especially low. Just 19% of millennials agree with the statement that ""generally speaking, most people can be trusted"" - compared to 31% for the generation before us, and 40% for our parents' generation, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.  And, no surprise here, when it comes to institutions, we trust Wall Street least of all. ""Wall Street certainly took a hit,"" says Eric Fraser, who graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2008 and took what he thought was an innocuous job in the financial services industry. ""At that time it didn't seem villainous until these names and faces started hitting the news."" That caused him to re-think what it was like to work in the industry. ""I had a bit of hesitation to explain, 'yes I do work in financial services but no I'm not a subprime mortgage lender or anything like that.'"" Today, he says there is one silver lining to having had a front row seat to that dissolution in trust. ""I think entering the workforce around that time really gave me a sense of humility and I don't know if I would have had that same mindset if I had graduated earlier."""
risk appetite,"Lab-grown chicken safe to eat, say US regulators",2024-09-15,2022-11-17,By Shiona McCallum,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63660488,"A meat product grown in a lab has been cleared for human consumption for the first time. The US safety agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has given approval for cell-cultured chicken, after doing a ""careful evaluation"". It has been made in steel tanks by the firm Upside Foods, using cells harvested from live animals. It will be able to be sold to consumers after an inspection by the US Department of Agriculture.  The FDA said it used data and information provided by the company to reach its decision, and had ""no further questions at this time"". The firm's founder and chief executive Uma Valeti said: ""We started Upside amid a world full of sceptics, and today, we've made history again as the first company to receive a 'No Questions Letter' from the FDA for cultivated meat.""  Upside Foods will have a number of hurdles to clear before it can sell its products - for example, the facility where the product is made will need formal approval - but Mr Valeti called the news ""a watershed moment in the history of food"". Several start-up food companies have been trying to develop similar products, which could lead to big savings in carbon emissions and water, as well as freeing up land for nature. Scientists say pressures on the planet could fall by more than 80% with such foods, compared with the typical European diet. Cultured meat products are forecast to take a larger slice of the total meat market in the future. The start-up Eat Just, a competitor of Upside Foods, was the first to receive approval to make artificial ""clean meat"", in Singapore in 2020. Its nuggets are made from animal muscle cells in a lab. Two of the largest companies in the sector are Israel-based Future Meat Technologies and Impossible Foods, whose plant-based Impossible Burger was launched in 2016 and grew in popularity. As a result, the company launched a partnership with Burger King and now Impossible Whoppers are on the menus of most of its outlets in the US.  The Upside Foods FDA approval has been described as a ""major milestone"" in the industry by Ernst van Orsouw, chief executive of Roslin Technologies - a Scottish-based food tech company. ""It is very exciting to see a globally leading regulator now come to the same conclusion that cultivated meat is safe to eat,"" he said.  ""The FDA has been taking a risk-based, science-based and practical approach to regulating this novel food, which can be an excellent guide for other jurisdictions as well."" He said this step ""will spur further investment and innovation"" in the cultured food industry."
risk appetite,Furlough cut 'could push firms off cliff edge',2024-09-15,2021-07-30,By Rachel Flint,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-58030769,"Making businesses pay more to furloughed staff could push firms ""off a cliff edge"" as they are trying to recover from Covid, unions have warned. Almost 70,000 people in Wales were on furlough at the end of June, according to latest figures. Unions have warned changes from Sunday, doubling the amount firms pay, put jobs at risk and call for it to be delayed. The UK government said the furlough scheme was in place until September to provide ""certainty over the summer"". At the height of the pandemic last year, 378,400 people in Wales were furloughed. But as lockdown restrictions eased, numbers on the government's coronavirus job retention scheme have fallen - with an estimated 68,800 furloughed at the end of June, according to UK government figures. Staff returned to work in most sectors as the country reopened but some employed in the travel and hospitality industries remain on flexi-furlough - and work is based on demand. Furlough was introduced in spring 2020 to stop people being laid off by their employers during lockdown. The government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of £2,500. But the scheme is being wound down, and since 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers - with the government's contribution falling to 70%. That amount is now set to rise to 20%. The monthly limit of £2,500 will stay in place, so workers will not notice the difference. However, by making furlough more expensive for employers, the UK government hopes to encourage them to take workers back full-time if they can. The scheme is set to continue until 30 September. Ahead of the changes, unions warned the increased financial burden on firms could hit industries just as they were trying to recover from repeated lockdowns. With coronavirus measures still in place restricting numbers allowed in bars and restaurants, nightclubs unable to open and many not going abroad on holiday due to Covid rules, unions fear the travel and hospitality sectors could be badly affected. The Wales TUC said some firms were still having to furlough staff due to not being able to open fully, and ""half of all staff in travel agencies are still on furlough"". ""We do feel that doubling the employer contribution is too much too soon, and puts jobs at risk in some parts of the economy,"" a spokesperson said. The union representing travel and transport industries, the TSSA, said many people were still wary of booking holidays abroad and companies were struggling to survive. ""Any cuts to the furlough scheme will be like kicking people when they're already down,"" General Secretary Manuel Cortes said.  ""With no structured plan to provide the extra support, we are likely to see more travel agencies go under."" After months of being ground to a halt due to travel restrictions in the pandemic, drivers are back on the roads taking people on trips across the UK. ""We were faced with the really difficult decision of laying everyone off if it wasn't for furlough. It was a godsend,"" said Jason Edwards, director of Llantrisant-based Edwards Coaches. He said while it was good more than 500 staff who were on furlough were now back at work, the company was struggling with staff needing to take holidays, and being unable to recruit to deal with demand. ""You'd pinch yourself after the 14 to 15 months we've had, but we are short of staff,"" he said. ""There's a huge appetite for travel, but I feel there's a reluctance now to change jobs because people are nervous they might lose their furlough protection."" Mr Edwards said changes to furlough should be industry-specific as the scheme comes to an end. In Denbighshire, drivers have been excited to welcome back customers at Voel Coaches, but manager Chris Gentle said he was ""extremely concerned"" furlough was being wound down just before winter. While 50 staff who had been furloughed are now back in work, they are on flexi-furlough, allowing the company to send them home if they hit a quiet period. ""We are receiving a high number of bookings, and starting to operate back to full capacity on some trips, but there's still that knock-on effect of a whole 16 months of being closed, with overheads and maintenance still being paid,"" he said. ""We are trying to recover from that, and also now paying more of the staff wages when they go into furlough, and team that with the winter, it's really unsettling."" The Welsh government said it had repeatedly called on the UK government not to withdraw the furlough scheme until the economy ""is ready"". The UK government said the scheme had protected over 11.6 million jobs and eligible tourism businesses would also continue to benefit from reduced VAT until March 2022.  ""We deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty to people and businesses over the summer,"" a spokesperson said. ""Businesses can also continue to access other support including our Recovery Loan scheme - and we recently made cautious changes to the requirements for international travel which will support activity within the industry."""
risk appetite,The school that rules Britain,2024-09-15,2021-04-14,John Self,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210413-the-school-that-rules-britain,"A new memoir recalls life at Eton College – the school for the country's most powerful and privileged. John Self looks at how it has captured writers' imaginations for decades. A few miles down the road from Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, lies Britain's most famous school. Eton College, a boys' boarding school in the town of Windsor on the western edge of London, has captured the British imagination in films, books and TV for decades. Why should this be? More like this: -       The world's most misunderstood novel -       Why we are living in 'Gothic times' -       The man who wrote the most perfect sentences Is it because Eton is the crucible for generations of political leaders, with 20 of Britain's 55 prime ministers educated there, including the first, Robert Walpole, and the latest, Boris Johnson? This alone gives it a level of fame that is self-perpetuating. Or is it the school's long history (it was founded almost 600 years ago), the price of an education there (£42,500 or $58,000 a year), its traditions or even its uniform, for which top hats were worn as recently as the 1960s and tail-coats still are? These elements encourage mythologising and a sense of the school as a world apart, a fictional fantasy of high education passed down generations of families whose wealth, as old Etonian writer James Wood put it, ""stretched so far back, the origin of their prosperity was invisible."" Does the reality match the stories told – and the books written – about the school that rules Britain? Well, not everyone who attended Eton fits the mould. This month sees the publication of One of Them: An Eton College Memoir by writer, podcaster and musician Musa Okwonga. When he attended Eton from 1993 to 1998, Okwonga was one of only a handful of black boys at the school. The book is his contribution to an ""exploration of race and class"" in Britain, on the grounds that ""to understand where we are going as a society, we need to understand how we got here."" A striking fact in One of Them is that Okwonga was not sent to Eton by a family hungry to give him a leg up: instead, he urged his mother to send him after seeing it on a TV documentary and visiting on a school trip. ""I was aware,"" he tells BBC Culture, ""of what education gets you, wherever you go, even if you leave a country."" His family were middle-class refugees from Uganda and ""I thought, this is the kind of education that takes you anywhere."" Also: he shares his birthday (11 October) with the school's founding date. ""It was meant to be!"" he says. Okwonga brought an Etonian level of ambition with him: his memoir shows how he took his costly education seriously, calculating that it was costing his mother £20 ($27.50) a day for him to be there. ""I basically ran or joined every single society I could,"" he says. ""And my day was just full of bullet points, a checklist of things I had to do that day to earn it."" One startling feature of this work ethic was that he only went home twice in his five years at Eton, despite living ""closer to home than anyone else at school."" The determination Okwonga showed is a quality we see in the old boys who have climbed the greasy pole of politics: ""No one here ever tells us out loud that Etonians are natural leaders, "" he writes. ""That's what the architecture is for."" We associate Eton with wealth, so it's the rich and famous alumni who get our attention. But the stories that add flavour to the facts are often from fiction; though given the literary world's scepticism of material success (failure is more interesting), a novelist's portrayal of Eton boys can be unflattering – or worse. 'Villains and fools' Take that amiable idiot Bertie Wooster, whose status as an old Etonian is classic PG Wodehouse: affectionate rather than cutting. Bertie attended Eton with fellow fops Marmaduke ""Chuffy"" Chuffnell and G D'Arcy Cheesewright, though even in Wodehouse-world the school had its standards. Asked in Right Ho, Jeeves whether he was at school with Tuppy Glossop, ineffectual denizen of the Drones Club, Bertie replied, ""Good heavens, no. We wouldn't have a fellow like that at Eton."" A more directly villainous old boy is Peter Pan's arch-nemesis Captain Hook (who, incidentally, went from Eton to Balliol College, Oxford, a path followed by Boris Johnson). His education is revealed late in JM Barrie's play when Hook jumps toward death-by-crocodile, murmuring ""Floreat Etona"" (""May Eton flourish""), the school motto. Hook was, according to a Provost at the school in 1927, ""a great Etonian but not a good one"", and in a speech given at Eton that year, Barrie wryly noted that ""perhaps it was just that at Oxford he fell among bad companions – Harrovians."" Back in the real life of Eton, villains and fools in Okwonga's memoir are rare: One of Them is a nuanced portrait of his school years, and although ""there were no more than about four black boys out of 1,216 students, the entire time I was there"", Okwonga experienced ""not too much"" overt racism. On one level this looks like an advance on 30 years earlier, when Nigerian author Dillibe Onyeama suffered racist taunts as the first black student to complete studies at the school, which he reported in his 1972 memoir. (Writing about these attacks got Onyeama banned from returning to Eton until recently.) The racism Okwonga experienced was secondary, but no less insidious for that. One boy ""joked"" about his great-grandfather, a slave-driver, owning Africans; another told him, later, ""you have no idea what was being said behind your back about black people."" ""That was devastating,"" he says now, because ""I was just someone who was an exception to the rule for a lot of people there."" Worst were the friends who let him down: one ""swatted aside"" his concerns about feeling exposed and visible at Eton; this friend's father thought Okwonga was ""an asset, like a spy, put there by the Ugandan government. It was so bizarre to him that a middle-class black boy could go to Eton."" After Onyeama's book and before Okwonga's, the most prominent memoir of Eton was Stand Before Your God (1993), by the novelist Paul Watkins, the author of 18 books including the Inspector Pekkala series written under the name Sam Eastland. His memoir is a funny and dramatic account of the experiences of a young American trying to come to grips with a new life in a new country, after being dropped off by his parents at boarding school when ""I swear, I thought I was going to a party."" That the book is still in print almost 30 years after publication shows the continued appetite for stories about Eton. Watkins, whose skin colour fitted in but who still found that others ""slotted me into a file that said Foreigner"", had been signed up for the school at the age of six months. He writes that ""you had to have a coldness in yourself"" to avoid being hurt. Okwonga agrees: in One of Them he calls it ""the mask"". This, he tells BBC Culture, means ""the reality of being at a boarding school is you can't afford to argue with people you need to live with for five years. ""So you develop this thing where you learn not to have that feud. You learn pretty quickly not to express what you’re feeling, and that attribute stays with you."" A national totem Okwonga's ""mask"" – Watkins's ""coldness"" – is one thing that many old Etonians can agree on. Actor Damian Lewis said in 2016: ""You go through something which, at that age, defines you and your ability to cope. There's a sudden lack of intimacy with a parent, and your ability to get through that defines you emotionally for the rest of your life."" His belief that Eton enables pupils to ""compartmentalise their emotional life so successfully that they can go straight to the top"" may explain that extraordinary proportion of our political leaders who went there. But like other totems of national discussion, Eton fits whatever your preconceptions desire: a fantasy of grandeur, or the itch of resentment against unearned privilege. What does it actually tell us about Britain? ""The problem,"" Paul Watkins tells BBC Culture, ""is when you go to Eton, everything you do becomes a social commentary. It's hard to sum up a place like Eton without offending someone. That alone speaks to the power it holds over us."" Most of all, for him, it represents ""England's fascination with itself."" For Musa Okwonga, what Eton tells us about Britain is ""the lack of scrutiny you get if you're a certain type of person."" He refers to the busts of old Etonian prime ministers in one room of the school and the risk of ""revering power without context."" It also speaks to what he calls ""the funnel effect"", where people who are ""interpersonally really nice, really friendly… can nonetheless go down a particular funnel where there's a lack of empathy for people who haven't had your lived experience."" This sounds like another aspect of the emotional distance mentioned above. And if ruthless coldness is a yardstick, what better fictional representative could Eton have than the greatest spy of the 20th Century, James Bond? Our knowledge of Bond's time at the school is limited, but Ian Fleming's novel You Only Live Twice includes an obituary written by spymaster M when Bond is presumed dead: ""It must be admitted that his career at Eton was brief and undistinguished and, after only two halves [terms], as a result […] of some alleged trouble with one of the boys' maids, his aunt was requested to remove him."" Bond's creator's time at Eton was longer but no more distinguished. Ian Fleming took the traditional route to the school – he was the son of an old Etonian army major – but failed to perform academically and was removed from the school by his mother before he could fail to graduate. He did at least kick off his writing career at Eton, publishing his first story in the school magazine The Wyvern. Fleming also named the Bond villain Blofeld after an old classmate, but his feelings for Eton are best encapsulated in the James Bond All Purpose Grand Challenge Trophy Vase he presented to the Old Etonian Golfing Society – which was in fact a chamber pot. Fleming isn't the only writer to have a complicated relationship with the school. George Orwell, who attended on a scholarship and whose old school tie didn't quite fit such a man of the people, later disdained Eton, saying that although he was ""relatively happy"" at the school, he ""did no work there and learned very little"". In his 1941 essay The Lion and the Unicorn, he wrote that ""probably the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there. One of the dominant facts in English life during the past three-quarters of a century has been the decay of ability in the ruling class."" The school, undeterred, maintains the Orwell Award in his name, offering fully funded places ""to talented boys whose life opportunities have been limited."" 'A place of extremes' Even for writers who didn't attend Eton, it has provided inspiration. John le Carré taught there for a year and described it as ""a place of extremes"" where ""the English upper class can be seen at their best and worst. The good pupils are often brilliant […] and take you to the limits of your knowledge. The worst pupils,"" he added, ""provide a unique insight into the criminal mind."" These were ""riches"" for a novelist, and le Carré used Eton as inspiration for the fictional school Carne in his novel A Murder of Quality. Or take the case of Evelyn Waugh, the envious outside chronicler of the upper class, who probably wished he'd gone to Eton instead of the humbler Lancing College. And in a typical act of one-up-manship, he sent his character Sebastian Flyte there in his most nostalgic novel Brideshead Revisited. ""Thank God I went to Eton,"" sighs Sebastian during an obscure philosophical argument between family and friends. Sebastian, significantly, starts the book as the epitome of glamour but undergoes a decline as the story proceeds. (Waugh's mixed feelings about Eton may also have been coloured by the fact that his first wife, also called Evelyn, had an affair with an old Etonian.)   As this parade of writers suggests, Eton has been a hothouse for literary development. Like Fleming and Orwell, Paul Watkins began writing at Eton, and he writes in Stand Before Your God that he tied a pencil to his bed frame so he could scribble ideas on the wall when he woke at night. He wrote the first two drafts of his debut novel Night Over Day Over Night at Eton, when he was 16: ""The Eton library has the original draft, which I wrote by hand,"" he says. What did Eton teach him? ""The nobility in the pursuit of a goal,"" he tells BBC Culture, ""not just the goal itself. When I got out into the world, nobody cared that I was writing books until those books got published."" The most valuable lesson Eton taught him ""was to have the courage to pursue what I felt I was built to do, and not just what others wanted me to do.""  For Okwonga, it was a sense of meeting society's expectations – but also his own – from such a privileged education. ""I knew it was an opportunity that so few black people get. And I think I've carried that my entire career, this sense of, 'I have to achieve something, I have to make my time worth it.'"" ""And actually,"" he continues, ""someone wrote to me, a friend who lives in the US. She said, 'you haven't wasted your talent'. Which is a very powerful thing to be told, because you go to a place like that, which is such a privilege, and you feel that keenly, every week you're there. You go out into the world, going: 'I've got to do something with this'.""   Love books? Join BBC Culture Book Club on Facebook, a community for literature fanatics all over the world.

risk appetite,What would happen if we stopped mining?,2024-09-15,2022-04-14,Laura Cole,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220413-how-ending-mining-would-change-the-world,"Mining fuels the modern world, but it also causes vast environmental damage. What would happen if we tried to do without it? ""If you can't grow it, you have to mine it"" goes the miner's credo. The extraction of minerals, metals and fuels from the ground is one of humankind's oldest industries. And our appetite for it is growing. Society is more dependent on both greater variety and larger volumes of mined substances than ever before. If you live in a middle-income country, every year you use roughly 17 tonnes of raw materials – equivalent to the weight of three elephants and twice as much as 20 years ago. For a person in a high-income country, it is 26 tonnes – or four and a half elephants' worth. Extracting new materials continues to be cheaper than re-use for many substances, leading some experts to sound the warning about the increasing pressure of mines on the natural world. A growing chorus is concerned that environmental toll of mine-caused pollution and biodiversity loss, as well as the social impacts caused to local communities, could sometimes outweigh the benefits of mining. But what if we stopped extraction of fossil fuels and minerals entirely? What if, in order to better protect the environment, humanity decided the contents of the Earth's crust were off limits? It's an unlikely scenario, to be sure, and one that would cause hardship for many people – particularly if it happened suddenly. But imagining a world without access to the underground allows us to examine how dependent we have become on this ongoing extraction. It also invites us to consider the frivolousness with which we often then throw these materials away, and to examine the overlooked potential in this waste as a source of new materials. So could considering the end of mining help to change how we use materials today? Victor Maus, a researcher in geoinformatics and sustainability at the University of Economics and Business in Vienna, Austria, has spent the last three years poring over satellite images of the Earth's surface to estimate the total area humans currently give over to mining. The results surprised him. ""It's a country-sized area, and that's just with the mines that are reported,"" he says.  You might also like: The land size of mining had never been surveyed by satellite before, making it tricky to train a computer how to identify mines from thousands of photos. Maus and his team therefore had no choice but to make his estimates by eye, and spent hours tracing polygons around the shapes of open pits, shafts and waste tailings ponds. ""I was seeing polygons in my sleep,"" he says. Above ground, he found, mining sites covered around 100,000 sq km (38,600 sq miles), larger than Austria or five times the size of Wales. ""And that's just the mines that are active,"" says Maus. Mining is also one of the most basic forms of enterprise, and many locations are unreported. ""In reality, the world's total mining area is even larger."" On the first day of a world that stopped mining, the activity across this collective expanse would grind to a halt. Workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo's deep cobalt pits would drop their shovels, colossal bucketwheels in Germany's brown coal mines would cease to strip mine, and the small boats in the Mekong delta would stop sucking up sands. The first shockwave would be to jobs. Across the world, ending mining would terminate an estimated four million formal jobs in the industry. And the toll wouldn't stop there. ""There's a number of [further] people that rely indirectly on mining sites that would make it greater,"" says Eléonore Lèbre, who researches the social impacts of mining from the University of Queensland. More than 100 million livelihoods in work connected to artisanal mining – groups and individuals that mine on smaller scale, often informally – would be lost. Lèbre's research has involved studying the effect of mine closure on towns in remote Australia. ""In rural areas, where there might have been mining operations for decades, you have communities that have grown to depend on them."" In a world of no mining, ghost towns would be created almost overnight. These impacts wouldn't stay confined to those communities for long. By day seven, massive ripples would be felt in society. ""Energy would be the chief worry,"" says John Thompson, a mining consultant and professor of sustainability based in Vancouver. ""And coal would be the first to go."" Coal is heavy and bulky, so it moves around the world in short supply chains – often going straight from mine to power plant. ""Because it takes up so much space, power stations don't have much to rely on in terms of stockpiles,"" he says. The constant conveyor belt would empty very quickly if mining came to an end. With 35% of the world still relying on coal for electricity, few countries would escape a sudden energy crisis. However, coal use for electricity generation is not equal the world over – it is 15% in Europe, 63% in China and 84% in South Africa – so energy inequality between countries would soon be felt. To cope with this cut off from electricity, governments might begin looking to the past. The UK's mining strikes of the 1970s, where rolling blackouts and electricity rations were enforced, could be used as a form of damage control. ""The three-day-week policy could make a comeback,"" says Thompson, referring to how the UK government reduced working and manufacturing to three days instead of five to handle the electricity shortage from the strikes and the oil crisis of 1973. An indirect, but crippling effect of such electricity drops in the modern day would be the cut to communications. The internet, many of whose servers still rely on coal-powered electricity, would be slashed or reduced. Mobile phone networks might hang on for longer, but with less electricity in the grid, charging devices could become a luxury. Corded land lines, which are connected to centralised telephone exchanges, would last longest – at least as long as back-up generators and batteries could keep them going. Soon after, bulky materials would become scarce. Stocks of sand and gravel, which are essential ingredients for making concrete, are relatively shallow. Reserves of the two would be depleted within two to three weeks, says Thompson.   ""Sand and gravel are the most mined solid materials by mass,"" says Aurora Torres, who researches the environmental pressures of sand use at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. ""We mine vastly more sand than anything."" The UN estimates we get through 40-50 billion tonnes of sand per year. (Read more about the world's extraordinary demand for sand.) There is some capacity to recycle used concrete, but the rate at which we use fresh concrete far outstrips current recycling rates. There would also be quality concerns. ""Most recycled concrete is 'downcycled' to lower-grade uses such as road building,"" says Torres. So while there would be a rush to implement better recycling processes, in the short-term, the building of new homes would plummet. Meanwhile, the temperature in existing homes would become increasingly uncomfortable as gas stores began depleting after a handful of weeks, reducing power for heating and cooling. In economies that rely on gas-fired power stations for electricity such as the United Arab Emirates (95%), Russia (45%), the US (41%) and the UK (36%), blackouts would become more frequent. Any plastics production able to remain working would be restricted to recyclables as its gas feedstock disappeared. But there is more to modern society than energy and buildings. ""It's after about two months that things would get really interesting, as the mining halt would hit metals,"" says Thompson. Many mined metals are traded through exchanges in London and New York, where numbers and figures swapped over the trading floor denote the real-life movement of physical stockpiles between warehouses all over the world. For copper, an excellent conductor which is essential for almost all electronics, stockpiles would dwindle to nothing in around six to 10 weeks, Thompson estimates. This would lead the price of metals to skyrocket. ""It's not hard to imagine that theft would increase at this point,"" says Thompson. When the copper price rose to all-time highs in the 2010s, crime rose with it. Buildings, streetlamps, train lines – anything with copper in – were stripped of their cables for resale. Theft might increase for all the industrial metals – copper, iron, aluminium, zinc, lead and nickel – which by mass account for 98% of all mined metals. The shortage would reveal how much this handful of metals have become the lifeblood of society. Most countries mine something. China, Australia and the US are the global leaders for production value of raw materials, but extraction makes up a far larger share of the economy for some other nations. In at least 18 countries, metallic minerals and coal account for more than half of all exports; for some of these, it's more than 80%. In a no-mining-of-metals scenario, the entire economies of countries such as Suriname with its industrial gold mining, the Democratic Republic of Congo, where cobalt is king, and Mongolia, a leading exporter of copper, would be at risk. Simon Jowitt, an economic geologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, does not mince words on what he thinks the end of metals mining would look like. ""It would be the end of society as we recognise it today,"" he says, noting that we mine more now than we ever have before. A good example of our increasing reliance on a wide array of metals is the average mobile phone, says Jowitt. In the 1980s, a mobile needed 20 or so different elements. A new smartphone today needs more than twice that. ""Modern life is simply minerals- and metals-intensive. We wouldn't be having this conversation without them,"" he quips via video call from his home in Nevada. Around three months after the end of mining, stockpiles of rare earth metals and other metals useful to technology would be finished, leading to worrying trends for the pharmaceutical, car, electronics and construction industries. This would lead to massive unemployment that on ""a never-before-seen scale"", says Thompson. Just in time for the collapse of supply chains, oil reserves would finally run out. The US's strategic petroleum reserve, the largest fallback oil stockpile in the world, contains 730 million barrels of oil stored in salt caverns across the country – enough for three months at most. The production of petrol, diesel, plastics and road asphalt would come to end. And with them, the fossil fuel age. After a handful of months, global food supplies would be in crisis. An estimated 50% of food production depends on synthetic fertilisers, which are made up of varying formulas of phosphorus, potassium and natural gas. Lower crop yields could lead to food shortages. ""Particularly in countries where climate doesn't support food production,"" says Thompson.  Nuclear fuel is stocked months in advance, so it could be up to a year before society ran out of nuclear power. Renewables, however, would be the ultimate kingmakers. Nations with the highest renewable power generation per person would be at a huge advantage. Iceland and Norway, which both source nearly all their power from hydroelectric and geothermal sources, would be among the best equipped nations to ride out the socio-economic storm. In a cruel twist of fate, though, despite huge demand for new renewable power, deployment rates of wind and solar power would slump. The paradox of renewables is that, in their current form, they need unprecedented volumes of non-renewable mined materials. ""Increasing renewables, while it means fewer fossil fuels out of the ground, means large upticks in battery metals such as cobalt and nickel,"" says Thompson. Solar panels demand large amounts of silicon for the semiconductors in their cells. Wind turbines need rare earth metals such as neodymium for powerful magnets that generate electricity with the turn of the blades. Pressure would soon increase to redirect all metals recycling into renewables. ""We do recycle a fair amount already,"" says Jowitt. ""Most of the base metals and a handful of other elements are already recycled at their end-of-life by a rate of more than 50%."" Other metals that are critical to renewables, however, such as rare earths, are ""lost by design"", he says. ""The way we currently use them is inherently non-recyclable."" This is because technologies use tiny amounts of more and more elements, all in different ways, making it difficult to separate them to get the individual metals out. But even if technology developed to extract these tiny quantities of rare earth metals, it's unlikely that it would meet the amount needed to vastly expand renewable energy. ""The metals demand is already set to exceed current production many times over,"" says Jowitt. According to the World Bank, in a world on track to keep global warming below 2C, the annual production of graphite, cobalt and lithium will be five times higher by 2050 than today's production. There is also a huge inequality in the current distribution of already-extracted metals across the world. Most mined and processed metals are in use in the Global North, where they have been imported, meaning populations in the Global South would have less access to recyclable material. The richest 20% of the global population have access to 60-75% of the world's in-use metal stock per capita, according to one study, a spread even more unequal than carbon emissions inequality. A new world with no mining would have to think carefully about equal access to materials. An unprecedented rush for research could lead to breakthroughs in recycling technology and circular design, however. ""Products would be designed so that they last longer or so that they can be taken apart more easily, and the components returned into the system,"" says Thompson. This would be an about-face for the tech industry, which today creates produces batteries that are notoriously difficult to recycle. Research might be funnelled into methods of gleaning metals without mining, such as the electrolysis of seawater and brines. ""There may also be the development of new biomaterial that could mimic or replace the role of metals,"" says Thompson. ""Luckily these would probably be more recyclable. Meanwhile, energy production might need to adapt to smaller, more decentralised systems, probably using already-invented tech. Last year, the environmental campaign group Seas At Risk imagined  a society in 2050 that had banned mining in 2020. Bereft of a constant supply of metals, the blueprint completely overhauls the electricity grid, with a transition from large, metals-heavy solar and wind farms to decentralised and low-tech distribution. ""Direct hydro- and wind-power were other age-old technologies that made their comeback, not only for industrial applications but even for water-powered household devices,"" it says. Instead of large lithium-ion batteries, compressed-air systems, thermal energy storage and gravity batteries become the champions of energy storage. Seas At Risk argues for the importance of rethinking energy consumption in a no-mining scenario, as well as for careful environmental policy. Without a clear vision, controversial biofuel production might make up the energy shortfall, with vast areas of land given over to forestry practices to provide wood as a source of building materials, energy and biofuels. But the work wouldn't stop there. For Lèbre, who researches mine closure, the closed mines themselves would be a huge source of concern. If all mining stopped there would still be an area at least the size of Austria with degrading and in some cases dangerous levels of heavy metals. ""Mining is a process of entropy. We are bringing material from locked-up concentrations underground and letting them out into the world."" Ensuring the clean-up and and rehabilitation of these areas would be vital. Mines usually operate at depths below the water table, which need to be constantly dewatered using pumps. When a mine is abandoned, the ground water gradually refloods underground passages and mineral seams over many months, creating acidic reservoirs of water. Above ground, meanwhile, tailings ponds and piles of low-grade ore with traces of heavy metals lie in wait. ""All of this material is exposed to water and oxygen,"" says Lèbre. Exposing such elements to, well, the elements, wreaks havoc on ecosystems, soils and water supplies through acid leaching. ""A mine that is abandoned can have chronic pollution for hundreds if not thousands of years,"" says Lèbre. Cleaning up a mine consists of reducing water acidity, detoxifying the soil and treating waste before reintroducing flora and fauna to the site. It's a lengthy, expensive process and can cost billions for a single, large mine. Avoiding an environmental catastrophe, and cleaning all the world's mines at once, would cost hundreds of billions or even trillions. Global inequalities would be seen in this mining clean up too. Maus, in his tracing of polygons across the map, has discovered that the majority of reported mines are located in the tropics, one chapter of a larger shift of mining from the Global North to the Global South over the last century. In a world that ended mining, these regions would have the bigger burden of the clean-up projects. With healthy soils and water re-established, though, eventually nature would return to mining sites. Wastes and tailings ponds, meanwhile, could present an opportunity to access metals. ""Most of a mine's desired elements are [the very same] pollutants present in the waste,"" says Lèbre. Mining is not going anywhere anytime soon: in fact, experts predict a new surge in metals and aggregate mining over the coming decades. With the exception of a handful of elements, such as lead and tin, the extraction of all metals is even increasing on a per capita basis, notes Jowitt. Warranting more concern, perhaps, is the fact that more mining will likely create more land impacts. Mining and biodiversity researcher Laura Sonterand her colleagues recently warned that mining the materials needed for renewable energy will increase the threats to biodiversity. Without careful planning, these new threats could surpass those avoided by climate change mitigation. Perhaps in time, the concept of material footprints, as an addition to carbon footprints, will catch on with governments, as they increasingly realise how much care we need to take of all our non-renewable resources.

risk appetite,The tree boosting Brazilan beef,2024-09-15,2021-06-30,Ellen Nemitz,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210629-the-australian-tree-cutting-brazilian-beefs-emissions,"With the help of the fast-growing eucalyptus tree, Brazil has created its first carbon-neutral beef. Cows are no strangers to methane. As a cow goes about its daily life, browsing through pasture or chewing the cud in the shade of a tree, it will typically emit 70-120kg (150-260lb) methane a year. This methane is a potent greenhouse gas, trapping heat in the atmosphere many times more efficiently than CO2 does. To reduce these climate-warming emissions, switching to a plant-based diet has been found to be an effective solution, and reducing consumption of beef in particular as it is a high-carbon meat. But the human appetite for beef has nonetheless been growing steadily for decades: today around 72 million tonnes of beef are produced a year. That's about 12.5 times the weight of the Pyramid of Giza. One country with a big incentive to make its beef more sustainable is Brazil, the world's largest exporter of beef, providing almost 20% of the world's exports. Researchers at the state-owned Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) have been searching for a way to counteract the emissions from the country's massive cattle herd – culminating in 2020 with a certified brand of Carbon Neutral Beef. Rather than simply paying for offsets to make up for emissions (an approach that can be fraught with difficulties), Embrapa has aimed to make the process of cattle-rearing carbon neutral within the farm, in an approach it hopes could make the country's carbon-intensive beef industry more sustainable. Brazil's incentive to clean up its beef industry is not just about carbon emissions. The country is also where a third of the world's tropical deforestation for commercial use happens. One of the main commercial uses of that deforested land is farming cattle. Worldwide, 2.11 million hectares of forest is lost each year to graze cows. Forest loss for cattle farming releases about 6% of the world's greenhouse gases, including the long-lived greenhouse gas CO2, as well as the methane from the cows and more methane emitted from soils. Meanwhile, the forest loss culls biodiversity and increases the risk of new diseases jumping to humans. Embrapa's Carbon Neutral Beef involves planting eucalyptus trees in the same area where cattle graze, turning a featureless grassland into one dotted with trees. Around 250-350 trees per hectare is thought to be the optimal number to keep Brazilian farms financially viable, producing 25 cubic metres of wood per hectare per year, according to studies by the Embrapa researchers. That sequesters up to five tonnes of carbon – the equivalent of emissions from about 12 adult cattle. In all, these trees occupy around 10% to 15% of the area, planted every 2m in rows between 14-22m (46-72ft) apart. This can also make a farm more productive, says Roberto Giolo de Almeida, who leads the Embrapa team. In traditional Brazilian cattle farming, there is typically around one animal grazing per hectare of land. When the land is planted with trees, the quality of the pasture actually improves. When the pasture is shadowed by the trees, the grass in its shade gets less sunlight. The grass reacts by investing more in photosynthesis, making more of the organelle where photosynthesis takes place: chloroplasts. These are the organelles that contain chlorophyll – the molecule that gives green plants their colour. A plant enriched in chloroplasts has higher nitrogen content, needed to make protein, and so it becomes more nutritious for the cows. Giolo de Almeida's team found that tree-dotted pastures can support up to twice as many cattle because of the improved pasture. And the cows fatten up faster too – as well as better nutrition, they have the added benefit that the trees offer some shade to escape the intense heat of the day. Typically, a cow raised among tree-dotted pasture will reach 250kg (550lb) of meat in two years. This is around 30% better productivity than expected in traditional systems, he says. This means the animals spend less time in the pasture before slaughter, giving them less time to emit methane. When the trees are mature, they are cut to be sold, and new saplings replace them. Richard Eckard, professor of sustainable agriculture at the University of Melbourne, who is familiar with Embrapa's project but not involved in it, sees many advantages in using eucalyptus, a commercial fast-growing tree native to Australia. ""If you harvest those trees and put them into construction timber, if you build houses or furniture, at least two-thirds of the carbon remains out of the atmosphere indefinitely or for the next hundreds of years,"" says Eckard. So far, Embrapa has not carried out studies on the use of native trees to sink carbon, which typically take longer to grow. However, one project called Native Carbon Stamp is beginning to investigate whether native trees could one day be used in a similar scheme. And in southern Brazil, one ongoing experiment aims to introduce Araucaria angustifolia (Brazilian pine), an endangered native symbol of the region, to livestock pasture integrated with croplands. These systems to combine livestock and tree-planting do not have just one ""recipe"", says the agronomist Claudete Reisdorfer Lang, professor at Federal University of Parana, in Brazil, who leads the Brazilian pine experiment. ""[It] depends on the different components – crops, trees, animals, among others,"" she says, as well as the ways the different parts of the system are integrated in the field. And combining cattle and tree-planting may not be an approach that works everywhere, notes Eckard – each area has its own climate and soil, and needs its own solution. Despite this, Giolo de Almeida estimates that around 10% of all pastures in Brazil already have a degree of integration between forest, crops and livestock, though only a small fraction of these are close to carbon neutral. Lang says she has seen rapidly growing interest in integrating livestock, trees and crops in the past 10 years. This could partly be because there are other incentives for farmers beyond the environmental benefits – Julie Ryschawy, assistant professor at the French National Institute for Agronomy, says that this approach to farming means there's less need to buy goods such as food for animals or chemical fertilisers. ""[Farmers] would both diversify the crop rotation and limit chemical inputs on the crop and grasslands,"" says Ryschawy, which could help biodiversity, limit livestock disease and store carbon. The meat industries in many regions have set targets for low or carbon-neutral livestock, including Australia, another of the world's main beef exporters. ""We are seeing an inevitable push towards low emissions livestock production,"" Eckard says. ""We have no options, we have to do this."" However, there are barriers to the expansion of tree and livestock-integrated systems like the kind used by Embrapa, including resistance from farmers. ""Many of them specialised in monocultures, which are profitable in a short-term, but unsustainable in the long-term,"" says Lang. There are also upfront costs to consider and the livestock sector can be reluctant to take financial risks, says Edegar de Oliveira Rosa, director of conservation and restoration of ecosystems at WWF-Brazil. ""It is necessary to face a huge challenge, the challenge of scale, since Brazil has one of the biggest herds of the world, around 200 million animals."" Rosa believes that regenerative agriculture could help improve a large swathe of Brazil's former forests. ""Currently livestock is the activity which most occupies recently deforested land,"" says Rosa. ""Deforestation and subsequent fires to clear the land are the main source of greenhouse gases emission in Brazil.""  While better use of deforested land could help lower beef's emissions, the challenge looming over cattle farming in Brazil is stopping deforestation in the first place. ""In the end it all comes back to government policy,"" says Eckard. He points to Australia's attempt to halt its historic problem with deforestation for cattle rearing through public policy. ""The only reason the Australian government achieved its Kyoto protocols targets was because they legislated against deforestation in Queensland. It requires leadership from government,"" Eckard says. While switching to a plant-based diet may remain a powerful solution to limit the environmental impact of cattle farming, in some parts of the world livestock provide essential nutrition, says Eckhard. ""Livestock are so integral to a lot of developing countries in allowing them to have food security,"" he says. In a region blighted by deforestation, it might seem like a small consolation to regrow just a hundred or so trees per hectare on the land now used for cattle pasture. But, for a global industry that is still steadily growing, Embrapa's project at least shows one way that the climate-warming emissions from those cattle can be curbed. -- The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

risk appetite,The drugs that transform your worldview,2024-09-15,2021-09-07,Ed Prideaux,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210906-what-if-everyone-took-psychedelics,"The growing legitimacy of psychedelics as therapies promises to transform how we view the extraordinary, writes Ed Prideaux. It was 1971 when Rick Doblin first took LSD. A Saturday afternoon in Florida, a few weeks into his freshman year. Four years had passed since the Summer of Love – when millions of young people descended on San Francisco, London and beyond in a haze of music and drugs – but the psychedelics still flowed through campus.    LSD, or Lysergic Acid Diethylamide-25, is a chemical trickster. Mimicking the morphology of serotonin, it locks in the synapses of the brain’s 5-HT2A receptors to trigger a manifest wave in cognition: extraordinary ruptures in vision, patterns of thought, belief, and emotion.   Within an hour, the trickster’s games make themselves known. A sense of strangeness hard to put in words descends. Shapes and kaleidoscopes may appear and dance in synchrony. Synaesthetic connections – when you can hear or taste colours – could emerge. Depending on one’s dose, by the drug’s peak you may be thrown into an entirely altered dimension: a weird place filled with entities, snakes, designs behind-the-eyes, DNA strands, and a radically enhanced appreciation for art and aesthetics. Or something far darker.   Doblin’s world hummed, throbbed, droned. After floating through the campus dining hall, he made his way back to a private dorm for an inward-facing trip. Glancing at his friend – also surging on LSD – Doblin was struck by a fresh vision. Not merely deducing his co-pilot’s thoughts and emotions, Doblin could see them plain as day. His friend’s comfort, benefaction, warmth, were visible like arms and legs. Doblin wished he could feel so free. He was decomposing. In his own LSD rotoscope, Doblin had become a boy again – no longer the man – and the imbalance of emotion and intellect that drove his life in the everyday were sensible. Yet he was this way for a reason, Doblin realised. And this meant it wasn’t set in stone. He could change things. He could be free.   For the philosopher LA Paul, what Doblin experienced can be described as a ""transformative experience"". These aren’t like most experiences, even our most dramatic ones. What makes them distinct is how they change a person: their preferences, ideas and identities are turned upside-down. When Doblin entered his first trip, he perhaps hadn’t realised that the next day he would not be the same.    Afterwards, Doblin knew he was on to something. He’d take more trips – many of which were destabilising – but the essential promise was clear. Evangelising the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs became his life’s mission. Doblin is today the founder and executive of a non-profit organisation called the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), which aims to bring psychedelic drugs closer to mainstream use in medicine and beyond. It advises scientists how to conduct trials and win funding, as well as working closely with regulators.   Now the efforts of Doblin and others are finally paying off. In the last 10 years, psychedelic drugs like LSD, magic mushrooms, DMT, a host of ""plant medicines"" – including ayahuasca, iboga, salvia, peyote – and related compounds like MDMA and ketamine have begun to lose much of their 1960s-driven stigma. Promising clinical trials suggest that psychedelics may prove game-changing treatments for depression, PTSD and addiction. The response from the psychiatric community, far from dismissive or even sceptical, has been largely open-armed. The drugs may well mark the field’s first paradigm shift since SSRIs in the 1980s. In 2017, for example, the US Food and Drug Administration designated MDMA a ""breakthrough therapy"", which meant it would be fast-tracked through to the second stage of Phase-3 trials. Doblin, whose organisation was instrumental in achieving the designation, hopes it will achieve FDA approval by 2023.   Psychedelics remain Schedule-1 drugs federally in the US and Class-A in the UK, but rules are relaxing. Along with Austria and Spain in the EU, psilocybin mushrooms have been decriminalised in Washington DC and a host of other US cities, and legalised for therapy in Oregon, where LSD has also been decriminalised. A California bill to decriminalise LSD and psilocybin passed several crucial committee stages and will be decided next year. A vote to federally sponsor psychedelic research recently made its way to Congress. In anticipation of this shift, psychedelic drug developers and clinical providers are attracting significant investment. Business reports describe ""psychedelic euphoria” and a ""Shroom Boom"". This phenomenon is known as the ""psychedelic renaissance"" – and it promises to change far more about our societies than simply the medical treatments that doctors prescribe. Unlike other drugs, psychedelics can radically alter the way people see the world. They also bring mystical and hallucinatory experiences that are at the edge of current scientific understanding. So, what might follow if psychedelics become mainstream?   You may also like: This wave of psychedelic enthusiasm in psychiatry isn’t the first. They were originally heralded as wonder drugs in the 1950s. Across some 6,000 studies on over 40,000 patients, psychedelics were tried as experimental treatments for an extraordinary range of conditions: alcoholism, depression, schizophrenia, criminal recidivism, childhood autism. Participants included artists, writers, creatives, engineers and scientists. And the results were promising. From as little as a single LSD session, studies suggested that the drug relieved problem drinking for 59% of alcoholic participants. Experimenting with lower, so-called ""psycholytic"" doses, many therapists were amazed by LSD’s power as an adjunct to talking therapy. It wouldn’t last. By October 1966, LSD was banned in California, with federal restrictions to follow in 1970 under the Controlled Substances Act. Several alarming myths made their ways into government campaigns: claims of LSD-induced chromosome damage, mutant babies, that tallying five, six (or seven) trips made you ""legally insane"", were propagated to school kids just like Doblin (although he’d only shirk the warnings in time).   This affected science, too. Apart from a handful of remnant groups in Canada and the US, the entire field of psychedelic science would dry up for decades. Regulators restricted access. Funders lost appetite. At the height of the crackdown from the 1970s to the 1980s, Doblin’s attempts to launch psychedelic research led to closed doors and real difficulty securing jobs.   Conventional narrative traces the crackdown to the career of Timothy Leary, a Harvard scientist who became the counterculture's biggest proponent of LSD in the mid-to-late 1960s. A scandal at his Harvard Psilocybin Project in 1963 – in which his co-director was accused of dishing out psilocybin to undergraduates – would mark the first shots of a more sensationalist reaction in the media. Soon after, regulators would grow distressed by LSD’s black market currency ""outside the lab"", which Leary’s post-Harvard advocacy – including claims that LSD could give women ""thousands of orgasms"" and excite revolution against the establishment – did much to furnish.   That's not the whole story, though. Some medical historians pin the blame for the backlash on the rise of the Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) methodology. This is now the standard way to run clinical trials, and its introduction raised questions about just how scientific ""psychedelic science"" really was among regulators. RCTs involve comparing two groups of people: one which has taken a drug, and another which has not. The participants aren't meant to know which group they are in, but that's difficult with psychedelic substances.   The Good Friday Experiment of 1962 – a session held in a church with seminary students to test psilocybin’s capacity for inducing mystical experiences – provides an illustrative example. One half of the subjects were given the active drug, the other a placebo (and all double-blinded), yet within 30 minutes it was plainly obvious who’d got which. Those dosed wandered around the grounds in a daze envisioning God, one of the participants told me – while the placebo group (including him) just ""twiddled their thumbs and read the hymnal"". Between the 1980s and mid-2000s, flares of change amid the crackdown were seen. But the recent psychedelic renaissance has blown the doors off. It began with a landmark study in 2006 at Johns Hopkins University, headed by Roland Griffiths: a scientist who’d made his name studying caffeine. Griffiths and his co-authors attempted a replication of the Good Friday Experiment of more 40 years before. The results were striking.   ""It is remarkable"", Griffiths wrote, ""that 67% of the volunteers rated the experience with psilocybin to be either the single most meaningful experience of his or her life or among the top five most meaningful experiences of his or her life."" In other words, rivalling the profundity of marriage, childbirth, career highs, and other deep rites of passage.   While the challenges of conducting robust clinical trials have not gone away, regulators are now more open to psychedelic trial results than they once were. Meanwhile, private clinics are beginning to open around the world. Awakn, a clinic in Bristol, offers infusions of ketamine as a treatment for depression, PTSD, eating disorders and addiction: while not classically psychedelic like LSD, high doses of ketamine can trigger powerful visionary experiences with therapeutic potential.    As the anthropologists Tehseen Noorani and Joanna Steinhardt write, “there are still limits to the enthusiasm for psychedelic healing. Still, the shifts in the cultural value and meaning of psychedelics in the last decade have been remarkable”. If current trends continue, it may be a matter of time until psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is green-lighted by regulators. In a decade's time, might clinics and hospitals feature Psychedelic Session Rooms kitted out with cushions, incense, candles and paintings? Will doctors prescribe pills of psilocybin or LSD, manufactured by big pharma, with side effects including ""ecstasy"", ""changes in metaphysical beliefs"", and ""acute panic""? Could we see the high-street version of psychedelic clinics – perhaps with names like ""Pala"", ""Indigo"" or ""Oasis""?   It's difficult to know how it will play out, but if therapeutic psychedelics become more common, it may be only the start of a significant transformation in cultural and scientific attitudes. Psychedelic culture The psychedelic renaissance in medicine has been running parallel to a broader mainstreaming across culture, which the drugs haven't experienced since the early 1960s. In Europe and North America, recreational use is rising – with use of LSD rising by 50% from 2015 to 2018 in the US – psychedelic-themed media are getting popular, influencers and celebrities are emerging as users, and the drugs are de-stigmatising in a way that their pioneers could likely never have foreseen. This mainstreaming has changed who is having psychedelic experiences, says Erik Davis, a writer and long-standing psychedelic commentator. Psychedelics in the 20th Century were confined to underground groups: hippies, hackers, Silicon Valley, spiritual communities, rave culture, environmentalists. Nowadays, though, appetite is coming from unexpected groups: wellness communities, hip hop culture, the political right, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, Wall Street traders, financiers, and everyday people looking to remedy their mental health.    It’s possible that we’ll soon see the effects appear in broader culture, just as we did in the music, writing, art and politics of the 1960s and 1970s. Yet it's unlikely that any psychedelicised culture will look the same – nor feel the same to psychedelic users – because the world we live in now is so different.   To understand why, it helps to draw on a concept proposed by the social scientist Ido Hartogsohn, called the ""collective set and setting"". One part of a drug experience depends on immediate individual factors – personal mindset, local environment, or the presence of others. But broader social forces make an impact too: the zeitgeist, media headlines, bigger cultural conversations. The 1960s had an entirely different ""collective set and setting"" compared with today. People didn’t just live differently, they tripped differently, too. Consider all the different influences of the present day. Technology and artificial intelligence. Political conflict. A broader sense that society is heading in ""the wrong direction"". The surveillance state. Off-the-record, one scientist I interviewed has already observed an emerging trend of ""apocalyptic"" trips, and not least during the broader pressures of Covid-19. ""Messianic"" trips are emerging in parallel: experiences in which one glimpses their own personal salvific role in effecting systems change.   How might climate change feed into people's experiences? It depends on the individual, but when consumed in the right context, the drugs can significantly enhance one’s connection to nature. One of the most famous examples in this vein is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, Gail Bradbrook, who was inspired to start the movement by an experience on iboga.   For this reason, one social scientist has proposed calling them ""ecodelics"". Another researcher interviewed for Vice magazine raised the idea of bringing pro-environmental cues to psychedelic sessions – the idea being to leverage the mind’s pivotality to increase nature-relatedness, and even dampen climate change scepticism.    Mystical experience   Under the surface, a still-more radical effect is appearing. In clinical trials and recreational use alike, psychedelics often produce states of ""mystical experience"" or ""ego dissolution"": a peak consciousness characterised by bliss and goodwill, interconnection, a sense of the ""sacred"", a possible ""loss of self"", or even encounters with spiritual entities and God(s). What happens if more people start having them? And how might we understand their nature better than we currently do?   For researchers, the mystical experience is core to how the drugs produce such impressive results. It’s seen all the time in papers and reports. The greater the mystical experience, studies suggest, the greater the derived therapeutic benefit. Questionnaires to measure, track, and better-understand the mystical experience are proliferating. But science and psychiatry have cast suspicions on the mystical experience for centuries. ""Even at the optics level, it’s a horrible name,"" says Matt Johnson, a psychedelic scientist at John Hopkins University, “because 'mystical' sounds like you have a crystal ball and you're casting a spell. For some people, it draws up a connotation of the medieval.""   This means that despite the role of spiritual experience in the cultural fabric – underpinning epiphanies of science, art, and religion for millennia – they have been chronically under-studied. People are reluctant to share their stories for risk of stigma, pathology, or diagnosis. Losing one’s sense of self, for example, may be diagnosed as ""depersonalisation"", and a transformative shift to spiritual beliefs may be interpreted as the florid outpourings of a mental breakdown.    Outside psychedelic usage, more people have had mystical experiences than you might think. From 1962 to 2009 – the last year of available data – the number of Americans who reported a lifetime mystical experience more than doubled to half the population.   With this in mind, researchers may need to get better at understanding how they work and what they entail. For example, the notion that there is a single defined mystical experience at all has come under question. It’s not obvious how its core traits – the boundless, sacred, timeless, blissful – piece together. ""There's a good chance those are going to occur together, but just because something occurs together doesn't mean it's part of the same thing,"" says Johnson.    As the author Jules Evans points out in The Art of Losing Control, the unitive character of the clinical mystical experience – that sense of losingone's ego and becoming ""one with everything"" – also leaves out half the picture. A third of DMT smokers, 17% of LSD takers, and 12% of psilocybin users report encountering external entities. In neoshamanic rituals with ayahuasca, daime and iboga, these entities are anchors of the peak experience. One subject in a study on ayahuasca, for example, describes a prototypical meeting: ""He received a clutch of octopus eggs that were laid inside his head. He interpreted this as an auspicious occasion, and wrote that he believed the eggs symbolised a source of wisdom. He recognised the octopus as a benign ally right away.""   Psychedelics are often defined by the hallucinations they evoke (or, more accurately, pseudohallucinations), too. These hallucinations drove clinicians in the first wave of the 1950s to deem LSD a ""psychotomimetic"", or psychosis-mimicking drug: a move that makes sense, as with its tendencies for casting extraordinary visions and hearing voices. If hallucinatory experiences were to be mainstreamed, not just de-stigmatised, this could mark a radical shift, says Davis, since they are more often associated with pathological conditions such as schizophrenia. He suggests it would be the culmination of the modern ""neurodiversity"" movement, which recognises conditions like autism or hearing voices as differences on a spectrum, and not discrete problems to be solved.    For Davis, understanding the extraordinary experiences of psychedelics shouldn't – and can’t – be the sole domain of science. Some have suggested that literature and poetry may be a useful adjunct to scientific questionnaires. Others have called for theologians to join the table, too. After all, without a broader approach, he warns that some may undergo strange experiences that resist any ""model"" – and which could worsen their mental health more than enhancing it.   Coming down   Psychedelics offer something that few other things can: an experience well beyond what our everyday reality could conceive or expect. How the mainstream will handle its trip isn’t clear. Therapeutic mainstreaming may put big issues on the table, but one wonders whether the medical establishment can handle them alone. ""The interest in industry, especially for clinicians in medicalisation, is to downplay all of that. What they want is a soothing, healing, restorative situation,"" says Davis.   But the mystical, hallucinogenic and transformative experiences coupled with these drugs are likely to change far more than that for many. ""Psychedelics are like philosophical probes,"" Davis explains. ""Even if you're not a philosophical person, you have to suddenly deal with [things] the next day. 'Well, what the hell was that? What do I make of that? Was I given a glimpse of true reality when I got the message to stop drinking alcohol? Am I going to take that seriously? Does that make me crazy?'""  For Rick Doblin – still in the echoes of that first transformative trip – the possibilities of psychedelics are far-reaching, and go beyond the clinical setting. With his organisation Maps, he wants to ""legitimise psychedelics not just for patients but for all of us who are struggling with a world on fire… to try to make it so we don’t destroy the place. The tactic, you could say, is [to] medicalise it. But that’s not the end goal.""   --  Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,What would happen if we stopped mining?,2024-09-15,2022-04-14,Laura Cole,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220413-how-ending-mining-would-change-the-world,"Mining fuels the modern world, but it also causes vast environmental damage. What would happen if we tried to do without it? ""If you can't grow it, you have to mine it"" goes the miner's credo. The extraction of minerals, metals and fuels from the ground is one of humankind's oldest industries. And our appetite for it is growing. Society is more dependent on both greater variety and larger volumes of mined substances than ever before. If you live in a middle-income country, every year you use roughly 17 tonnes of raw materials – equivalent to the weight of three elephants and twice as much as 20 years ago. For a person in a high-income country, it is 26 tonnes – or four and a half elephants' worth. Extracting new materials continues to be cheaper than re-use for many substances, leading some experts to sound the warning about the increasing pressure of mines on the natural world. A growing chorus is concerned that environmental toll of mine-caused pollution and biodiversity loss, as well as the social impacts caused to local communities, could sometimes outweigh the benefits of mining. But what if we stopped extraction of fossil fuels and minerals entirely? What if, in order to better protect the environment, humanity decided the contents of the Earth's crust were off limits? It's an unlikely scenario, to be sure, and one that would cause hardship for many people – particularly if it happened suddenly. But imagining a world without access to the underground allows us to examine how dependent we have become on this ongoing extraction. It also invites us to consider the frivolousness with which we often then throw these materials away, and to examine the overlooked potential in this waste as a source of new materials. So could considering the end of mining help to change how we use materials today? Victor Maus, a researcher in geoinformatics and sustainability at the University of Economics and Business in Vienna, Austria, has spent the last three years poring over satellite images of the Earth's surface to estimate the total area humans currently give over to mining. The results surprised him. ""It's a country-sized area, and that's just with the mines that are reported,"" he says.  You might also like: The land size of mining had never been surveyed by satellite before, making it tricky to train a computer how to identify mines from thousands of photos. Maus and his team therefore had no choice but to make his estimates by eye, and spent hours tracing polygons around the shapes of open pits, shafts and waste tailings ponds. ""I was seeing polygons in my sleep,"" he says. Above ground, he found, mining sites covered around 100,000 sq km (38,600 sq miles), larger than Austria or five times the size of Wales. ""And that's just the mines that are active,"" says Maus. Mining is also one of the most basic forms of enterprise, and many locations are unreported. ""In reality, the world's total mining area is even larger."" On the first day of a world that stopped mining, the activity across this collective expanse would grind to a halt. Workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo's deep cobalt pits would drop their shovels, colossal bucketwheels in Germany's brown coal mines would cease to strip mine, and the small boats in the Mekong delta would stop sucking up sands. The first shockwave would be to jobs. Across the world, ending mining would terminate an estimated four million formal jobs in the industry. And the toll wouldn't stop there. ""There's a number of [further] people that rely indirectly on mining sites that would make it greater,"" says Eléonore Lèbre, who researches the social impacts of mining from the University of Queensland. More than 100 million livelihoods in work connected to artisanal mining – groups and individuals that mine on smaller scale, often informally – would be lost. Lèbre's research has involved studying the effect of mine closure on towns in remote Australia. ""In rural areas, where there might have been mining operations for decades, you have communities that have grown to depend on them."" In a world of no mining, ghost towns would be created almost overnight. These impacts wouldn't stay confined to those communities for long. By day seven, massive ripples would be felt in society. ""Energy would be the chief worry,"" says John Thompson, a mining consultant and professor of sustainability based in Vancouver. ""And coal would be the first to go."" Coal is heavy and bulky, so it moves around the world in short supply chains – often going straight from mine to power plant. ""Because it takes up so much space, power stations don't have much to rely on in terms of stockpiles,"" he says. The constant conveyor belt would empty very quickly if mining came to an end. With 35% of the world still relying on coal for electricity, few countries would escape a sudden energy crisis. However, coal use for electricity generation is not equal the world over – it is 15% in Europe, 63% in China and 84% in South Africa – so energy inequality between countries would soon be felt. To cope with this cut off from electricity, governments might begin looking to the past. The UK's mining strikes of the 1970s, where rolling blackouts and electricity rations were enforced, could be used as a form of damage control. ""The three-day-week policy could make a comeback,"" says Thompson, referring to how the UK government reduced working and manufacturing to three days instead of five to handle the electricity shortage from the strikes and the oil crisis of 1973. An indirect, but crippling effect of such electricity drops in the modern day would be the cut to communications. The internet, many of whose servers still rely on coal-powered electricity, would be slashed or reduced. Mobile phone networks might hang on for longer, but with less electricity in the grid, charging devices could become a luxury. Corded land lines, which are connected to centralised telephone exchanges, would last longest – at least as long as back-up generators and batteries could keep them going. Soon after, bulky materials would become scarce. Stocks of sand and gravel, which are essential ingredients for making concrete, are relatively shallow. Reserves of the two would be depleted within two to three weeks, says Thompson.   ""Sand and gravel are the most mined solid materials by mass,"" says Aurora Torres, who researches the environmental pressures of sand use at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. ""We mine vastly more sand than anything."" The UN estimates we get through 40-50 billion tonnes of sand per year. (Read more about the world's extraordinary demand for sand.) There is some capacity to recycle used concrete, but the rate at which we use fresh concrete far outstrips current recycling rates. There would also be quality concerns. ""Most recycled concrete is 'downcycled' to lower-grade uses such as road building,"" says Torres. So while there would be a rush to implement better recycling processes, in the short-term, the building of new homes would plummet. Meanwhile, the temperature in existing homes would become increasingly uncomfortable as gas stores began depleting after a handful of weeks, reducing power for heating and cooling. In economies that rely on gas-fired power stations for electricity such as the United Arab Emirates (95%), Russia (45%), the US (41%) and the UK (36%), blackouts would become more frequent. Any plastics production able to remain working would be restricted to recyclables as its gas feedstock disappeared. But there is more to modern society than energy and buildings. ""It's after about two months that things would get really interesting, as the mining halt would hit metals,"" says Thompson. Many mined metals are traded through exchanges in London and New York, where numbers and figures swapped over the trading floor denote the real-life movement of physical stockpiles between warehouses all over the world. For copper, an excellent conductor which is essential for almost all electronics, stockpiles would dwindle to nothing in around six to 10 weeks, Thompson estimates. This would lead the price of metals to skyrocket. ""It's not hard to imagine that theft would increase at this point,"" says Thompson. When the copper price rose to all-time highs in the 2010s, crime rose with it. Buildings, streetlamps, train lines – anything with copper in – were stripped of their cables for resale. Theft might increase for all the industrial metals – copper, iron, aluminium, zinc, lead and nickel – which by mass account for 98% of all mined metals. The shortage would reveal how much this handful of metals have become the lifeblood of society. Most countries mine something. China, Australia and the US are the global leaders for production value of raw materials, but extraction makes up a far larger share of the economy for some other nations. In at least 18 countries, metallic minerals and coal account for more than half of all exports; for some of these, it's more than 80%. In a no-mining-of-metals scenario, the entire economies of countries such as Suriname with its industrial gold mining, the Democratic Republic of Congo, where cobalt is king, and Mongolia, a leading exporter of copper, would be at risk. Simon Jowitt, an economic geologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, does not mince words on what he thinks the end of metals mining would look like. ""It would be the end of society as we recognise it today,"" he says, noting that we mine more now than we ever have before. A good example of our increasing reliance on a wide array of metals is the average mobile phone, says Jowitt. In the 1980s, a mobile needed 20 or so different elements. A new smartphone today needs more than twice that. ""Modern life is simply minerals- and metals-intensive. We wouldn't be having this conversation without them,"" he quips via video call from his home in Nevada. Around three months after the end of mining, stockpiles of rare earth metals and other metals useful to technology would be finished, leading to worrying trends for the pharmaceutical, car, electronics and construction industries. This would lead to massive unemployment that on ""a never-before-seen scale"", says Thompson. Just in time for the collapse of supply chains, oil reserves would finally run out. The US's strategic petroleum reserve, the largest fallback oil stockpile in the world, contains 730 million barrels of oil stored in salt caverns across the country – enough for three months at most. The production of petrol, diesel, plastics and road asphalt would come to end. And with them, the fossil fuel age. After a handful of months, global food supplies would be in crisis. An estimated 50% of food production depends on synthetic fertilisers, which are made up of varying formulas of phosphorus, potassium and natural gas. Lower crop yields could lead to food shortages. ""Particularly in countries where climate doesn't support food production,"" says Thompson.  Nuclear fuel is stocked months in advance, so it could be up to a year before society ran out of nuclear power. Renewables, however, would be the ultimate kingmakers. Nations with the highest renewable power generation per person would be at a huge advantage. Iceland and Norway, which both source nearly all their power from hydroelectric and geothermal sources, would be among the best equipped nations to ride out the socio-economic storm. In a cruel twist of fate, though, despite huge demand for new renewable power, deployment rates of wind and solar power would slump. The paradox of renewables is that, in their current form, they need unprecedented volumes of non-renewable mined materials. ""Increasing renewables, while it means fewer fossil fuels out of the ground, means large upticks in battery metals such as cobalt and nickel,"" says Thompson. Solar panels demand large amounts of silicon for the semiconductors in their cells. Wind turbines need rare earth metals such as neodymium for powerful magnets that generate electricity with the turn of the blades. Pressure would soon increase to redirect all metals recycling into renewables. ""We do recycle a fair amount already,"" says Jowitt. ""Most of the base metals and a handful of other elements are already recycled at their end-of-life by a rate of more than 50%."" Other metals that are critical to renewables, however, such as rare earths, are ""lost by design"", he says. ""The way we currently use them is inherently non-recyclable."" This is because technologies use tiny amounts of more and more elements, all in different ways, making it difficult to separate them to get the individual metals out. But even if technology developed to extract these tiny quantities of rare earth metals, it's unlikely that it would meet the amount needed to vastly expand renewable energy. ""The metals demand is already set to exceed current production many times over,"" says Jowitt. According to the World Bank, in a world on track to keep global warming below 2C, the annual production of graphite, cobalt and lithium will be five times higher by 2050 than today's production. There is also a huge inequality in the current distribution of already-extracted metals across the world. Most mined and processed metals are in use in the Global North, where they have been imported, meaning populations in the Global South would have less access to recyclable material. The richest 20% of the global population have access to 60-75% of the world's in-use metal stock per capita, according to one study, a spread even more unequal than carbon emissions inequality. A new world with no mining would have to think carefully about equal access to materials. An unprecedented rush for research could lead to breakthroughs in recycling technology and circular design, however. ""Products would be designed so that they last longer or so that they can be taken apart more easily, and the components returned into the system,"" says Thompson. This would be an about-face for the tech industry, which today creates produces batteries that are notoriously difficult to recycle. Research might be funnelled into methods of gleaning metals without mining, such as the electrolysis of seawater and brines. ""There may also be the development of new biomaterial that could mimic or replace the role of metals,"" says Thompson. ""Luckily these would probably be more recyclable. Meanwhile, energy production might need to adapt to smaller, more decentralised systems, probably using already-invented tech. Last year, the environmental campaign group Seas At Risk imagined  a society in 2050 that had banned mining in 2020. Bereft of a constant supply of metals, the blueprint completely overhauls the electricity grid, with a transition from large, metals-heavy solar and wind farms to decentralised and low-tech distribution. ""Direct hydro- and wind-power were other age-old technologies that made their comeback, not only for industrial applications but even for water-powered household devices,"" it says. Instead of large lithium-ion batteries, compressed-air systems, thermal energy storage and gravity batteries become the champions of energy storage. Seas At Risk argues for the importance of rethinking energy consumption in a no-mining scenario, as well as for careful environmental policy. Without a clear vision, controversial biofuel production might make up the energy shortfall, with vast areas of land given over to forestry practices to provide wood as a source of building materials, energy and biofuels. But the work wouldn't stop there. For Lèbre, who researches mine closure, the closed mines themselves would be a huge source of concern. If all mining stopped there would still be an area at least the size of Austria with degrading and in some cases dangerous levels of heavy metals. ""Mining is a process of entropy. We are bringing material from locked-up concentrations underground and letting them out into the world."" Ensuring the clean-up and and rehabilitation of these areas would be vital. Mines usually operate at depths below the water table, which need to be constantly dewatered using pumps. When a mine is abandoned, the ground water gradually refloods underground passages and mineral seams over many months, creating acidic reservoirs of water. Above ground, meanwhile, tailings ponds and piles of low-grade ore with traces of heavy metals lie in wait. ""All of this material is exposed to water and oxygen,"" says Lèbre. Exposing such elements to, well, the elements, wreaks havoc on ecosystems, soils and water supplies through acid leaching. ""A mine that is abandoned can have chronic pollution for hundreds if not thousands of years,"" says Lèbre. Cleaning up a mine consists of reducing water acidity, detoxifying the soil and treating waste before reintroducing flora and fauna to the site. It's a lengthy, expensive process and can cost billions for a single, large mine. Avoiding an environmental catastrophe, and cleaning all the world's mines at once, would cost hundreds of billions or even trillions. Global inequalities would be seen in this mining clean up too. Maus, in his tracing of polygons across the map, has discovered that the majority of reported mines are located in the tropics, one chapter of a larger shift of mining from the Global North to the Global South over the last century. In a world that ended mining, these regions would have the bigger burden of the clean-up projects. With healthy soils and water re-established, though, eventually nature would return to mining sites. Wastes and tailings ponds, meanwhile, could present an opportunity to access metals. ""Most of a mine's desired elements are [the very same] pollutants present in the waste,"" says Lèbre. Mining is not going anywhere anytime soon: in fact, experts predict a new surge in metals and aggregate mining over the coming decades. With the exception of a handful of elements, such as lead and tin, the extraction of all metals is even increasing on a per capita basis, notes Jowitt. Warranting more concern, perhaps, is the fact that more mining will likely create more land impacts. Mining and biodiversity researcher Laura Sonterand her colleagues recently warned that mining the materials needed for renewable energy will increase the threats to biodiversity. Without careful planning, these new threats could surpass those avoided by climate change mitigation. Perhaps in time, the concept of material footprints, as an addition to carbon footprints, will catch on with governments, as they increasingly realise how much care we need to take of all our non-renewable resources.

risk appetite,Honeymoons for foodies,2024-09-15,2012-02-17,Josey Miller,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20120213-honeymoons-for-foodies,"From Reims to Tokyo to Sonoma, discover epicurean delights with your true love. Discovering new dishes with the one you love can be one of the most intimate parts of a honeymoon, especially for gourmands. Whether you want to travel on a budget or can splurge a little, these post-wedding destinations require you to pack a serious appetite. Europe
high budget: Reims, France Your honeymoon calls for a toast… or several!
And no destination is more appropriate for such an occasion than Reims
(pronounced somewhere between “Rance” and “Rence”), in the Champagne region of
France. For a true luxury chateaux experience, check into Les Crayeres, an elegant hotel that was
built in 1904 and is set on 17 acres of park-like grounds. The tangerine colour
of the Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin label has become the
bubbly equivalent of Tiffany blue, a signifier of something costly and
covetable. Their cellar tours and tastings are by appointment only — and its
doors close between December and March, the coldest months of the year. Fancy a
smaller operation? The Cris-Event company offers
vineyard bike tours that are private or semi-private. Spend at least four days
in Reims, perhaps as a side trip from Paris, which is two hours away. Europe
low budget: Valls, Spain Just more than an hour’s drive southwest of
Barcelona, Valls is a Catalan countryside town steeped in Spanish culinary
tradition. In fact it is the birthplace of the calcotada (pronounced
kahl-so-TAH-dah), a traditional Spanish feast, often served alfresco, that celebrates
the spring harvest of oversized leek-like onions called calcots. Do not to
knock it ‘til you taste it — especially when charred and dipped in salvitxada sauce alongside a spread of
meats, beans and fresh bread, and washed down with Catalan wine from a porron, a glass pitcher with a
spout. Be warned, you drink the wine from a distance, so wear dark clothing.
The whole experience is debauched, messy and unforgettable. Stay at the Felix Hotel for its restaurant’s calcotada,
plus the tennis court and swimming pool. If you prefer a city honeymoon, make Valls
a daytrip during a weeklong stay in nearby Barcelona. Americas
high budget: Sonoma, California For a divine honeymoon in northern California’s
wine country, skip high-traffic Napa Valley for its lower-key neighbour, Sonoma.
 Reserve a room at the cosy El Pueblo Inn and sample the bistro fare
(best when paired with a wine-tasting flight) at The Girl and the Fig, a charming restaurant on
the town’s plaza. For the days spent touring the nearby wineries, be sure to
hire a designated driver: join a group wine shuttle  or splurge on a private tour . Devote at least a long
weekend to Sonoma during spring, summer or, best of all, autumn, when many of
the local vineyards are in the middle of harvest. Americas
low budget: Palisade, Colorado For oenophiles who have already been to many of
the well-known wine regions, it is time to cover some uncommon ground. The area
around Palisade in western Colorado is home to more than a quarter of the
state’s wineries. Wine lovers converge on Palisade every autumn for
the Colorado Mountain Winefest. Pick up a few bottles
during your long weekend here, and open one on the wrap-around porch at DiVine Thyme B&B, where breakfast is served by candlelight.  Caribbean
high budget: West End, Anguilla For the foodiest of all the Caribbean islands,
Anguilla takes the cake. Pimms, a restaurant on the bay
at the elite Cap Juluca resort, the local cuisine
is called “Eurobbean” – European-Caribbean fusion — and high-rolling
honeymooners pay the price to try their five-course tasting menu with wine
pairings. The Hibernia restaurant in Island
Harbour, with its art gallery and a chef trained at the Ecole Hoteliere of
Strasbourg, France, is another favourite — and has been since it opened in 1987
(note: they go on holiday from mid-July until November). You will only need a
long weekend in tropical Anguilla, and hurricane risk exists between June and
November. Caribbean
low budget: Grand Case, St Martin In comparison to many of its Caribbean neighbours,
the quality of cuisine is superb on St Martin, an island where the connection
to France can literally be tasted. Traditional bistros abound, and while the
pricing at many of them is surprisingly uncompetitive, you can
compromise by spending less on your lodging.  The Grand Case Beach Club has a full kitchen in every room, where, if you
fancy yourself a chef, you can save even more money by trying a few of the
local recipes. For those travelling from North America, St Martin is one of the
most northernmost Caribbean islands, and the flight from the US mainland is
short – a consolation if you can only stay for a long weekend. Asia-Pacific
high budget: Tokyo, Japan This sprawling metropolis is consistently ranked
among the most expensive cities worldwide, but since the March 2011 earthquake
and tsunami, Tokyo needs your tourism dollars now more than ever. Despite the
high price tag, the city’s culinary scene is top notch -- Tokyo offers more
Michelin-star-rated restaurants than Paris! For starters, sushi snobs will be
hard pressed to find fresher fish than at Kyubey. And for a taste of Japan’s signature Kobe beef, try Seryna -- you may even find a menu in English. Stay for at
least 10 days at the over-the-top Peninsula Hotel, and aim for May when the
rainfall and heat are not at their peak — but average sunshine is. Asia
Pacific low budget: Agra, India Many Indians do not eat out, so do not be
surprised to find mostly fellow tourists at Agra restaurants such as the Mughal
Room in the Hotel Clarks Shiraz, where you can dine on
Mughlai and Chinese dishes while listening to live music. Fittingly, the
restaurant has views of the Taj Mahal, which was built by Shah Jahan in adoring
memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Stay at the Oberoi Amarvilas, and fight the urge to
sleep in if you want to beat the bevy of fellow lovey-dovey tourists. You will
only need a few days before moving on to other areas of India, and steer clear of
Agra in May through September when it is likely to be sweltering, pouring rain
or both.   "
risk appetite,A beer revolution in Sheffield,2024-09-15,2012-07-23,David Whitley,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20120710-a-beer-revolution-in-sheffield-england,"This northern English city is quietly forging a reputation as the UK’s beer capital. If there is a British version of Portland, Oregon - albeit without the cool factor – this is it. It is rather hard to leave the station in Sheffield,
England after the train pulls in. The long bar at the Sheffield Tap – a beer cornucopia on Platform
1 that lures weary travellers into its hoppy embrace -- is studded with 10
hand-pulled cask ales, eight keg beers, four lagers and a cider. Behind it are
fridges filled with high-quality bottled beers sourced from all over the world. When it opened in November 2009, the Sheffield
Tap was considered a huge risk -- a £450,000 investment was required to
refurbish the old railway buildings that had been closed since 1967. But owner
Jamie Hawksworth admits he underestimated this northern city’s appetite for
craft beer. “We thought we would sell 10 barrels a week – but we were selling
five-and-a-half times that in the first two weeks of opening,” he said. Hawksworth’s pub is a drool-inducing
introduction to a city that is quietly forging a reputation as the UK’s beer
capital. If there is a British version of Portland, Oregon -- albeit without
the marketing nous and cool factor – this is it.  In September, the Sheffield Tap is due to open
its own brewery inside the station’s former first class dining rooms. In doing
so, it will join a ballooning microbrewing scene that has emerged in and around
the city over the last 15 years.  Much of this activity is focused around the
formerly industrial Kelham Island area, to the north of the city centre. Many
of the steel mills that made Sheffield’s world famous cutlery were based here,
but they began to close down in the 1980s and Kelham Island became a run-down
red light district. “Sheffield has a strong industrial heritage and
a manual labour tradition that fosters a residual drinking culture, which didn’t
die out, even when the industry did,” said Pete Brown, author of the book Man
Walks into a Pub. So it is in this inauspicious setting – in a now
gentrified Kelham Island -- that the thriving brew scene was
born. Today, the Sheffield Brewing
Company sells its broad range of traditional British ales through the Gardener’s Rest
pub, which became a spruced-up version of a traditional British boozer after a
flood-enforced renovation in 2007. Meanwhile, three breweries -- Little Ale Cart,
Steel City and White Rose -- share
equipment at the back of the spit-and-sawdusty Wellington pub, supplying many
of the cask-conditioned real ales that have cropped up around Kelham Island. Brown attributes the city’s beer revolution to
“the singular influence of Dave Wickett”, who opened the Kelham Island Brewery in the garden
of the Fat Cat pub in 1990. The small
brick shed where the operation began still stands, even though the brewery has
since moved to bigger premises over the road. “Wickett kept the flame alive,” Brown said. “For
a time, Kelham Island was the only brewery in Sheffield. But he didn’t suffer
fools gladly, and a lot of people who worked with him left to set up their own
breweries.” Sheffield’s beer revolution can also be seen in Thornbridge, a brewery that
Brown described as “the most interesting in the country”. Since its first brews
in 2005, Thornbridge has rapidly expanded and gathered scores of awards
worldwide -- particularly for its powerful but expertly rounded Jaipur IPA.
  Thornbridge’s chief operating officer Simon
Webster said cherry-picking brewers from as far afield as Italy and Australia
has been part of the success. “We want consistent quality and we spend a lot of
money on the science side,” he said. The brewing operation is based just outside
Sheffield, in the Derbyshire town of Bakewell, but Thornbridge has taken over a
number of pubs in the city, including The
Greystones, a shabby, unloved suburban pub that Webster described as “the
haunted house on the hill”.  Thornbridge refurbished The Greystones in November 2010 and now serves a large
range of their own beers alongside a carefully chosen selection from other
British breweries. They also opened up the back room for live music gigs and
comedy nights, then invited the local community to stage meetings and events. “The reason people historically went to pubs was
that they’re warmer and nicer than your own house,” said Webster. “[But] pubs
stopped competing [and now] there has to be a reason to go there. [Offering]
beers that you can’t get down the road or in the supermarket is just part of
that.” Even the popular city centre bars are joining in
Sheffield’s craft beer embrace. Ten to 15 years ago, bars such as the Old House, Bungalows and Bears and the Forum would have focused largely
on wine, cocktails and generic mass-market beers. Now they all serve at least
one locally-made ale. It seems opening a bar in Sheffield without selling the
likes of hoppy-but-mildly-citrusy Abbeydale Moonshine, award-winning pale ale Kelham

risk appetite,Where does the red carpet come from?,2024-09-15,2016-02-22,Lindsay Baker,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160222-where-does-the-red-carpet-come-from,"The crimson path that Oscar nominees tread dates back at least 2,500 years. How did it become the ultimate signifier of celebrity? Lindsay Baker investigates. It denotes stratospheric status, style and opulence. It conjures up glitz and glamour. It is the focus of the contemporary Oscars experience and the mainstay of today’s awards ceremonies, gala events and premieres around the world. The iconic red carpet sets the movie stars who step on it apart from us mere mortals. It was ever thus. In its earliest known incarnation the red carpet was not intended for ordinary folk. A path of dark red tapestries was rolled out in ancient Greece, in the Aeschylus play Agamemnon, when the King’s vengeful wife Clytemnestra prepares for the triumphant welcome home of her husband from the Trojan War. Even the King hesitates to walk on the “crimson path” laid before him, because he is “a mortal, a man” and not a god. “I cannot trample upon these tinted splendours without fear thrown in my path,” he says – and indeed he comes to a sorry end soon after setting foot on it. “It’s interesting that the red carpet has become synonymous with movie stars who in a sense have become the royalty of today,” Sonnet Stanfill, senior curator at the Victoria & Albert Museum, tells BBC Culture. “The evolution of the picture house in the second half of the 20th Century made them the palaces of the people. There’s a certain synergy about the red carpet – that was traditionally to welcome royalty – now welcoming film royalty.” In Renaissance art, red carpets and rugs appeared frequently, usually Oriental and intricately patterned in style, and were seen in paintings of deities, saints and royalty. Why was that? “Red as a colour has long been associated with prestige, royalty and aristocracy,” says Stanfill. “Scarlet was among the most prized dyes as it was the most difficult to make and the most expensive.” Cochineal or carmine dye was – and still is – made from the cochineal scale insect and was used in the 15th Century by the Aztec and Maya people in north and central America for colouring fabrics. By the 17th Century cochineal dye was a hugely valued export. A scarlet-hued carpet continued to denote high status, and in Georgetown, South Carolina, in 1821, the arrival of US president James Monroe was marked by the laying out of a red carpet to welcome him ashore from a riverboat.  The red carpet has since become a standard addition to high-profile events involving political dignitaries. The origin of the phrase ‘red carpet treatment’, meanwhile, is thought to derive from the start of the 20th Century, when the red carpet was co-opted by the railroads. An exclusive, express passenger train run by the New York Central Railroad from 1902 welcomed its passengers aboard with a red carpet, which also helped guide them onto the train. Smile for the camera It wasn’t until the1920s that the red carpet and Hollywood became truly synonymous. In 1922 a long, crimson-hued carpet was unfurled in front of the Egyptian Theatre for the Hollywood premiere of Robin Hood, starring Douglas Fairbanks. And in the decades that ensued, the red carpet was one of the few places where the public could catch a glimpse of charismatic stars like Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. Then, in 1961 the red carpet was introduced at the Academy Awards at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. A few years later, the broadcasters of the ceremony opted to film outside the venue, showing the arrival of guests as they stepped out of their limousines. From this point in 1964 the red carpet became a globally acknowledged focal point for actors and actresses to make a grand entrance and showcase themselves at the Oscars. Showmanship, after all, is the essence of the Hollywood red carpet, and the red carpet appearances that have gone down in history tend to be the unique moments of bold, peacockish display and swagger – confident, flamboyant, provocative and individualistic. Barbra Streisand’s sequined, see-through Scaasi trouser suit worn in 1969 generated as many headlines as her Best Actress Oscar for Funny Girl. The turbulent dynamic between movie-star couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was played out on the red carpet at the 1970 Academy Awards, when Taylor’s deeply glamorous and revealing violet dress and diamond necklace upstaged her husband’s Academy Award nomination. In 1978 Diane Keaton accepted her Best Actress Oscar for Annie Hall in a ‘statement’ menswear-inspired suit. And then of course there is Cher, whose unique red-carpet outfits have included a feathered headdress and – for her 1988 Moonstruck Oscar victory – a barely-there, black lace Bob Mackie number. The red carpet can be career defining, too – in Britain, actress Elizabeth Hurley sprang into the public consciousness overnight by donning a dramatic Versace dress to a premiere that she attended with Hugh Grant. The dress, which appeared to be held together by giant safety pins, came to be known as ‘That dress’. It was a deliberately sexy, edgy choice of dress, and was subsequently featured in the V&A’s Versace exhibition. “It was very Versace and very provocative,” says curator Stanfill. “She was making a display, and there was a sense of showmanship about it. In that sense she was a descendent of Streisand and Cher.” By the 1990s fashion and the movies were becoming inextricable, and the red carpet was the place they came together. Certain designers dominated, and Valentino and Giorgio Armani became particularly known for their red-carpet flair. In 1997 Nicole Kidman upped the game, wearing a green Dior gown that was the first bona fide couture dress to be seen on the red carpet. In the early ‘00s Renee Zellwegger and Julia Roberts were among a handful of stars to rebel and wear vintage dresses on the red carpet, while the Icelandic singer and actress Björk went one step further in her memorable Marjan Pejoski swan ensemble. Who are you wearing? Today, the Oscar red carpet is a massive 16,500 sq ft, takes two days to install, and is the focus of an ever more fearsome media frenzy each year. There is a new intensity of scrutiny and criticism – thanks in part to the unforgiving GlamCam360 and ManiCam. Most of the big designers are now creating special red-carpet lines. ‘Pay-to-wear’ deals with designers are commonplace, as are powerful red-carpet stylists. Perhaps for these reasons, actresses are increasingly playing safe with feminine, sure-fire flattering options. And there is a certain symmetry in the recent proliferation of the pastel, princessy gown on the crimson carpet – as if the red carpet is going back to its royal roots, laying a path for contemporary fairytale princesses. This is after all Tinseltown, a place of fantasy and escape. Still, the likes of Tilda Swinton and other fashion-savvy stars know how to break the rules in inimitable style. And last year’s Twitter ‘ask her more’ campaign showed there is appetite for unpredictability. It would be nice to think that there is still space on the red carpet for real boundary breaking, and that some brave soul might take a risk, take it that one step further – wear a swan around their neck, say, and lay some giant ostrich eggs on the hallowed red carpet. After all, at the time it happened Björk may have topped the dreaded worst-dressed lists, but 15 years on, the wild-and-wonderful swan dress was exhibited at MoMA, and Björk’s bonkers, egg-laying moment has gone down in Oscars red-carpet history.

risk appetite,Why Clueless is a feminist classic,2024-09-15,2020-07-17,Hanna Flint,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200716-how-clueless-transformed-the-movie-makeover,"Now 25 years old, Amy Heckerling’s teen movie is a classic on many levels – including for how it subverts one of cinema’s most enduringly problematic tropes, writes Hanna Flint. If there is one thing that Cher Horowitz, the heroine of 1990s teen-movie classic Clueless, loves, it’s a makeover. It’s her “main thrill in life,” her best friend Dionne points out, “It gives her a sense of control in a world full of chaos”. But as Cher plans the transformation of new friend Tai from grungy misfit to Beverly Hills princess, she is blissfully unaware that the person getting the real makeover in this movie is herself. More like this: - Why Showgirls is a horror masterpiece - Groundhog Day meets Bridesmaids - Why there’s no sex in Pretty Woman  Makeovers have long been a trope used by Hollywood to give films a clear narrative arc, especially in romantic comedies. The plot device of a character’s aesthetic overhaul helps to push the story forward and make a character seem more desirable, with their romantic lives often improved as a result. But 25 years ago, Clueless writer/director Amy Heckerling flipped this clichéd journey on its head to deliver a witty critique of the consumerist, privileged lifestyle of Los Angeles teens. The 1995 high-school rom-com is, in itself, a ‘makeover-ed’ property. Heckerling had been asked to write a script by 20th Century Fox about youth culture; she agreed (though Paramount would eventually produce it) but wanted to focus on 'the in-crowd.’ In an interview for the original Clueless DVD release, she recalled how, as she drafted a story about what could “go wrong for a girl who always looks through rose-coloured glasses,” she realised she was writing a modern-day version of Jane Austen’s Emma. “Unconsciously I had been writing an Emma character,” Heckerling said, “especially as she makeovers people all the time. She was very manipulative in a nice way; she lived in a fantasy of what could be for everybody else. I tried to take all the things that were in this pretty 1800s world and [imagined] what would that be like if it was Beverly Hills.” Just as Emma Woodhouse takes the unrefined Harriet Smith under her wing, Alicia Silverstone’s queen bee begins moulding Brittany Murphy’s new kid Tai into her image. In a quick montage scene, Tai’s box dyed hair is washed out, make-up applied and her outfit overhauled (to the tune of Jill Sobule’s aptly satirical bop Supermodel) so that she can become polished enough to sit with Cher and Dionne at the top of the social hierarchy. It’s the sort of scene that appeals to audiences, says film studies lecturer Dr Julia Wagner, because it panders to our aspirational appetites. ”The make-up, clothes and hairstyles are easy to come by, and pretty much effortless. The girl sits while other people fuss around her. Movie makeovers play out a wish fulfilment – that we can all, with just a little expertise, transform into a beautiful, confident creature.”   Tai’s confidence certainly improves as she conforms to this idealised image – but the more Cher teaches her how to dress, how to speak, and how to date, the uglier her personality becomes. Our statuesque lead has created a shallow monster and lost control of her. Thus, this vapid version of her friend holds a mirror up to our protagonist and highlights the flaws in her own superficial outlook, which is based on the assumption that everyone should fit into her world and look the part too. Soon enough, the rose-coloured glasses come off, and Cher’s perspective shifts. “I needed a complete makeover,” she says, “except this time I’d makeover my soul.” Cher begins the film already looking like an ‘after’ photo, so her transformation comes from popping the bubble of her privileged lifestyle. She participates in her teacher’s charity drive, gives away lots of her material possessions, and becomes friends with peers, like stoner Travis, who she had previously excluded. On top of that, realising that her love interest Josh is attracted to brains as much as beauty, she starts watching the news, and helping with her dad’s legal work. Clueless is a movie that cunningly subverts the movie makeover to show how attractiveness is not only predicated on how conventionally good looking you are on the outside, but how good a person you are on the inside too. Though, it should also be noted, the film doesn’t say that wanting to look glamorous is a bad thing; come the end, Cher is still wearing designer outfits. Similarly, Legally Blonde (2001) allows its bombshell lead Elle Woods to retain her hyper-feminine style, even as she goes through an intellectual transformation while studying at Harvard Law School. A sexist transformation  The flipside to this kind of evolution, however, is the more hackneyed one that suggests a woman is only valuable in as much as she conforms to societal beauty standards. Think of Ally Sheedy’s ‘Basketcase’ Allison being made over to look more like Molly Ringwald’s ‘Princess’ in The Breakfast Club (1985), or Sandy getting sexed up at the end of Grease (1978). That’s when the trope becomes problematic. “I think the main problem is perhaps in the result of the makeovers, which almost always shows a standard and narrow idea of beauty,” Wagner suggests. “No one ends up with frizzier hair after a movie makeover.” In their book The Makeover in Movies: Before and After in Hollywood Films, 1941-2002, Elizabeth A Ford and Deborah C Mitchell assert that 1942’s Now, Voyager, “established the ground rules for the makeover genre,” through the metamorphosis of Bette Davis’s depressed and dowdy spinster into a beautiful and confident heiress. “Change of appearance parallels change of fortune for heroine Charlotte Vale,” the authors write, noting that the physical traits of Charlotte’s ‘before’ appearance – no make-up, frumpy clothes, bushy eyebrows, heavy dark hair and glasses – have often been replicated in makeover movies, to varying degrees, ever since.   Half a century later, for example, two teen films featured heroines who could have been reincarnations of Catherine in the similarities of their pre-makeover appearance. Like Catherine, too, both Mia from The Princess Diaries (2001) and Laney Boggs from She’s All That (1999)  become more socially acceptable once they are beautified  – She’s All That even mimics Now, Voyager’s camera shot of a pan from the shoe up show the makeover results – while also retaining some sense of autonomy by the film’s end. An imbalance of power However, there is an awkward power dynamic at play in both films, which is pretty typical of the makeover movie. The Princess Diaries sees a queen force her civilian-raised granddaughter to change her looks and behaviours in order to fit in with the elite circles of her birthright. She’s All That takes its cues from My Fair Lady by seeing a rich popular jock transform a less wealthy art nerd into a prom queen for a bet. “At the heart of many movie makeovers, the powerless are physically manipulated by the powerful characters,” Wagner explains. “The ostensible aim is the made-over person’s sexual and social empowerment, but it is of benefit to the (initially) more powerful characters.” It’s even more problematic when a man is in charge of a woman’s makeover. In Miss Congeniality (2000), domineering pageant coach Victor Melling and FBI agent Eric Matthews are in charge of Gracie Hart’s transformation from ungroomed cop to beauty queen, while in Up  Close and Personal (1996), news director Warren Justice (Robert Redford) controls and refines the career of younger reporter Tally (Michelle Pfeiffer) for network TV, and becomes more attracted to her as she changes. Pretty Woman (1990) sees Richard Gere’s millionaire Edward buy Julia Roberts’s sex worker Vivian for a week to play the role of his girlfriend. He orchestrates her style and etiquette transformation so that she can be elevated to his social milieu and fit in with his life, sacrificing her own in the process. As in Pretty Woman, class mobility has also long been a key aspect of the makeover trope, ever since Cinderella had to dress the part of a princess in order to land Prince Charming. However not every female protagonist’s transformation means turning their back on their former life. In The Hunger Games (2012), Katniss Everdeen retains her working-class, District 12 identity despite the makeover she is forced to have upon arrival in the elite Capitol. Maid in Manhattan (2002) and Working Girl (1988) see two women from working-class backgrounds find their happily ever after with wealthier men after a makeover, but they are both still working by the movie’s end. Crucially, they are also in charge of their own beauty transformations – something that Wagner believes makes them far more feminist. “I’d like to see more films where a woman chooses to have a makeover, rather than have it done to her,” she says. “Not for her wedding or a date with a man who’s deemed out of the plain girl’s league.”   Is a makeover ever truly empowering? Last year’s comedy-drama Brittany Runs a Marathon fits this bill as it sees the titular Millennial choosing to transform her lifestyle not for a love interest, but after learning that her health is at risk. Brittany goes from a slobby, overweight slacker who can barely run around her block to a slimmed-down (though not size zero) seasoned runner, whose commitment to her fitness has led to improvements in nearly every aspect of her life. “I love putting out the message of body positivity and I think it’s time we celebrate the way we look,” star Jillian Bell said to me, championing the film’s importance, when I spoke to her for its release. “How many years have we been told that this one size and this one look is the right size and look? I’m just tired of it.” But even a seemingly self-empowered makeover like this can be questionable: some criticised Brittany Runs a Marathon’s ‘fitspo’ narrative for still perpetuating fat-shaming, while erasing the experience of plus-size runners. “The story we’re too often told about fatness and running is that body size is an obstacle to overcome in our quest for glory,” writes Kate Brown in an article about the film for Runner’s World. “You may start out fat, slow, sweaty, and out of breath, but stick with it long enough and you’ll become a svelte, glowing running machine.” It’s the teen-movie genre that continues to provide the smartest makeover takes, with recent films like Booksmart and Dumplin’ following Clueless in subverting the trope, and rejecting its most clichéd aspects. In the former, the lead duo’s dress-up montage ends with them looking the same but in matching blue jumpsuits, while the latter sees a diverse range of girls and non-binary contestants enter a beauty pageant without needing to conform to antiquated beauty standards in order to compete. In fact, the only transformation that plus-sized protagonist Willowdean goes through is similar to Cher Horowitz: a makeover of the soul that sees her gain confidence and reconnect with her mother. But while the cinematic makeover has gone through plenty of iterations over the years, in line with the broadening range of women’s stories on screen, what about men? The superhero genre is certainly full of makeovers: Steve Rogers' transformation in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is an iconic moment. And in the past, male-led rom-coms like Can’t Buy Me Love (1987), Crazy, Stupid Love (2011) and Hitch (2005), have used the plot device – though the latter two films see makeovers orchestrated by men who also teach their male students to use misogynistic ways to manipulate women into either sleeping or falling in love with them. However, in general, male makeovers have not featured anywhere near as prominently in popular culture as female ones. Wagner hopes that will change. “I’d like to see more men undergo makeovers in films – and not just Clark Kent taking off his glasses.” She points to the success of Queer Eye, Netflix’s hit reboot of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, as an example of how the male makeover can make for rewarding material. “[The show’s] success proves that men can gain a lot from a makeover, so the man’s makeover should also make its way into the movies.” Love film and TV?

risk appetite,The school that rules Britain,2024-09-15,2021-04-14,John Self,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210413-the-school-that-rules-britain,"A new memoir recalls life at Eton College – the school for the country's most powerful and privileged. John Self looks at how it has captured writers' imaginations for decades. A few miles down the road from Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, lies Britain's most famous school. Eton College, a boys' boarding school in the town of Windsor on the western edge of London, has captured the British imagination in films, books and TV for decades. Why should this be? More like this: -       The world's most misunderstood novel -       Why we are living in 'Gothic times' -       The man who wrote the most perfect sentences Is it because Eton is the crucible for generations of political leaders, with 20 of Britain's 55 prime ministers educated there, including the first, Robert Walpole, and the latest, Boris Johnson? This alone gives it a level of fame that is self-perpetuating. Or is it the school's long history (it was founded almost 600 years ago), the price of an education there (£42,500 or $58,000 a year), its traditions or even its uniform, for which top hats were worn as recently as the 1960s and tail-coats still are? These elements encourage mythologising and a sense of the school as a world apart, a fictional fantasy of high education passed down generations of families whose wealth, as old Etonian writer James Wood put it, ""stretched so far back, the origin of their prosperity was invisible."" Does the reality match the stories told – and the books written – about the school that rules Britain? Well, not everyone who attended Eton fits the mould. This month sees the publication of One of Them: An Eton College Memoir by writer, podcaster and musician Musa Okwonga. When he attended Eton from 1993 to 1998, Okwonga was one of only a handful of black boys at the school. The book is his contribution to an ""exploration of race and class"" in Britain, on the grounds that ""to understand where we are going as a society, we need to understand how we got here."" A striking fact in One of Them is that Okwonga was not sent to Eton by a family hungry to give him a leg up: instead, he urged his mother to send him after seeing it on a TV documentary and visiting on a school trip. ""I was aware,"" he tells BBC Culture, ""of what education gets you, wherever you go, even if you leave a country."" His family were middle-class refugees from Uganda and ""I thought, this is the kind of education that takes you anywhere."" Also: he shares his birthday (11 October) with the school's founding date. ""It was meant to be!"" he says. Okwonga brought an Etonian level of ambition with him: his memoir shows how he took his costly education seriously, calculating that it was costing his mother £20 ($27.50) a day for him to be there. ""I basically ran or joined every single society I could,"" he says. ""And my day was just full of bullet points, a checklist of things I had to do that day to earn it."" One startling feature of this work ethic was that he only went home twice in his five years at Eton, despite living ""closer to home than anyone else at school."" The determination Okwonga showed is a quality we see in the old boys who have climbed the greasy pole of politics: ""No one here ever tells us out loud that Etonians are natural leaders, "" he writes. ""That's what the architecture is for."" We associate Eton with wealth, so it's the rich and famous alumni who get our attention. But the stories that add flavour to the facts are often from fiction; though given the literary world's scepticism of material success (failure is more interesting), a novelist's portrayal of Eton boys can be unflattering – or worse. 'Villains and fools' Take that amiable idiot Bertie Wooster, whose status as an old Etonian is classic PG Wodehouse: affectionate rather than cutting. Bertie attended Eton with fellow fops Marmaduke ""Chuffy"" Chuffnell and G D'Arcy Cheesewright, though even in Wodehouse-world the school had its standards. Asked in Right Ho, Jeeves whether he was at school with Tuppy Glossop, ineffectual denizen of the Drones Club, Bertie replied, ""Good heavens, no. We wouldn't have a fellow like that at Eton."" A more directly villainous old boy is Peter Pan's arch-nemesis Captain Hook (who, incidentally, went from Eton to Balliol College, Oxford, a path followed by Boris Johnson). His education is revealed late in JM Barrie's play when Hook jumps toward death-by-crocodile, murmuring ""Floreat Etona"" (""May Eton flourish""), the school motto. Hook was, according to a Provost at the school in 1927, ""a great Etonian but not a good one"", and in a speech given at Eton that year, Barrie wryly noted that ""perhaps it was just that at Oxford he fell among bad companions – Harrovians."" Back in the real life of Eton, villains and fools in Okwonga's memoir are rare: One of Them is a nuanced portrait of his school years, and although ""there were no more than about four black boys out of 1,216 students, the entire time I was there"", Okwonga experienced ""not too much"" overt racism. On one level this looks like an advance on 30 years earlier, when Nigerian author Dillibe Onyeama suffered racist taunts as the first black student to complete studies at the school, which he reported in his 1972 memoir. (Writing about these attacks got Onyeama banned from returning to Eton until recently.) The racism Okwonga experienced was secondary, but no less insidious for that. One boy ""joked"" about his great-grandfather, a slave-driver, owning Africans; another told him, later, ""you have no idea what was being said behind your back about black people."" ""That was devastating,"" he says now, because ""I was just someone who was an exception to the rule for a lot of people there."" Worst were the friends who let him down: one ""swatted aside"" his concerns about feeling exposed and visible at Eton; this friend's father thought Okwonga was ""an asset, like a spy, put there by the Ugandan government. It was so bizarre to him that a middle-class black boy could go to Eton."" After Onyeama's book and before Okwonga's, the most prominent memoir of Eton was Stand Before Your God (1993), by the novelist Paul Watkins, the author of 18 books including the Inspector Pekkala series written under the name Sam Eastland. His memoir is a funny and dramatic account of the experiences of a young American trying to come to grips with a new life in a new country, after being dropped off by his parents at boarding school when ""I swear, I thought I was going to a party."" That the book is still in print almost 30 years after publication shows the continued appetite for stories about Eton. Watkins, whose skin colour fitted in but who still found that others ""slotted me into a file that said Foreigner"", had been signed up for the school at the age of six months. He writes that ""you had to have a coldness in yourself"" to avoid being hurt. Okwonga agrees: in One of Them he calls it ""the mask"". This, he tells BBC Culture, means ""the reality of being at a boarding school is you can't afford to argue with people you need to live with for five years. ""So you develop this thing where you learn not to have that feud. You learn pretty quickly not to express what you’re feeling, and that attribute stays with you."" A national totem Okwonga's ""mask"" – Watkins's ""coldness"" – is one thing that many old Etonians can agree on. Actor Damian Lewis said in 2016: ""You go through something which, at that age, defines you and your ability to cope. There's a sudden lack of intimacy with a parent, and your ability to get through that defines you emotionally for the rest of your life."" His belief that Eton enables pupils to ""compartmentalise their emotional life so successfully that they can go straight to the top"" may explain that extraordinary proportion of our political leaders who went there. But like other totems of national discussion, Eton fits whatever your preconceptions desire: a fantasy of grandeur, or the itch of resentment against unearned privilege. What does it actually tell us about Britain? ""The problem,"" Paul Watkins tells BBC Culture, ""is when you go to Eton, everything you do becomes a social commentary. It's hard to sum up a place like Eton without offending someone. That alone speaks to the power it holds over us."" Most of all, for him, it represents ""England's fascination with itself."" For Musa Okwonga, what Eton tells us about Britain is ""the lack of scrutiny you get if you're a certain type of person."" He refers to the busts of old Etonian prime ministers in one room of the school and the risk of ""revering power without context."" It also speaks to what he calls ""the funnel effect"", where people who are ""interpersonally really nice, really friendly… can nonetheless go down a particular funnel where there's a lack of empathy for people who haven't had your lived experience."" This sounds like another aspect of the emotional distance mentioned above. And if ruthless coldness is a yardstick, what better fictional representative could Eton have than the greatest spy of the 20th Century, James Bond? Our knowledge of Bond's time at the school is limited, but Ian Fleming's novel You Only Live Twice includes an obituary written by spymaster M when Bond is presumed dead: ""It must be admitted that his career at Eton was brief and undistinguished and, after only two halves [terms], as a result […] of some alleged trouble with one of the boys' maids, his aunt was requested to remove him."" Bond's creator's time at Eton was longer but no more distinguished. Ian Fleming took the traditional route to the school – he was the son of an old Etonian army major – but failed to perform academically and was removed from the school by his mother before he could fail to graduate. He did at least kick off his writing career at Eton, publishing his first story in the school magazine The Wyvern. Fleming also named the Bond villain Blofeld after an old classmate, but his feelings for Eton are best encapsulated in the James Bond All Purpose Grand Challenge Trophy Vase he presented to the Old Etonian Golfing Society – which was in fact a chamber pot. Fleming isn't the only writer to have a complicated relationship with the school. George Orwell, who attended on a scholarship and whose old school tie didn't quite fit such a man of the people, later disdained Eton, saying that although he was ""relatively happy"" at the school, he ""did no work there and learned very little"". In his 1941 essay The Lion and the Unicorn, he wrote that ""probably the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there. One of the dominant facts in English life during the past three-quarters of a century has been the decay of ability in the ruling class."" The school, undeterred, maintains the Orwell Award in his name, offering fully funded places ""to talented boys whose life opportunities have been limited."" 'A place of extremes' Even for writers who didn't attend Eton, it has provided inspiration. John le Carré taught there for a year and described it as ""a place of extremes"" where ""the English upper class can be seen at their best and worst. The good pupils are often brilliant […] and take you to the limits of your knowledge. The worst pupils,"" he added, ""provide a unique insight into the criminal mind."" These were ""riches"" for a novelist, and le Carré used Eton as inspiration for the fictional school Carne in his novel A Murder of Quality. Or take the case of Evelyn Waugh, the envious outside chronicler of the upper class, who probably wished he'd gone to Eton instead of the humbler Lancing College. And in a typical act of one-up-manship, he sent his character Sebastian Flyte there in his most nostalgic novel Brideshead Revisited. ""Thank God I went to Eton,"" sighs Sebastian during an obscure philosophical argument between family and friends. Sebastian, significantly, starts the book as the epitome of glamour but undergoes a decline as the story proceeds. (Waugh's mixed feelings about Eton may also have been coloured by the fact that his first wife, also called Evelyn, had an affair with an old Etonian.)   As this parade of writers suggests, Eton has been a hothouse for literary development. Like Fleming and Orwell, Paul Watkins began writing at Eton, and he writes in Stand Before Your God that he tied a pencil to his bed frame so he could scribble ideas on the wall when he woke at night. He wrote the first two drafts of his debut novel Night Over Day Over Night at Eton, when he was 16: ""The Eton library has the original draft, which I wrote by hand,"" he says. What did Eton teach him? ""The nobility in the pursuit of a goal,"" he tells BBC Culture, ""not just the goal itself. When I got out into the world, nobody cared that I was writing books until those books got published."" The most valuable lesson Eton taught him ""was to have the courage to pursue what I felt I was built to do, and not just what others wanted me to do.""  For Okwonga, it was a sense of meeting society's expectations – but also his own – from such a privileged education. ""I knew it was an opportunity that so few black people get. And I think I've carried that my entire career, this sense of, 'I have to achieve something, I have to make my time worth it.'"" ""And actually,"" he continues, ""someone wrote to me, a friend who lives in the US. She said, 'you haven't wasted your talent'.

risk appetite,UK wind farms sold to German company for £1bn,2024-09-15,2023-12-22,By August Graham and Katy Prickett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-67796231,"The rights to develop three of Britain's largest wind farms have been sold by Swedish company Vattenfall to German rival RWE for nearly £1bn. The projects are known collectively as the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone. Earlier this year, Vattenfall paused work on one of the sites, Norfolk Boreas, saying it was no longer financially viable.  Chief executive Anna Borg said: ""Today's agreement with RWE is great news for the UK's energy security."" All three sites have government consent to go ahead.  When built they will supply 4.2 gigawatts of power to the UK's grid - about the amount that four million households consume. In July, Vattenfall stopped work on the Norfolk Boreas site, about 50 miles (80km) off Cromer, saying the cost of building a wind farm had soared by about 40%. The two other sites, known as Vanguard East and Vanguard West, were also to be reviewed.  Last year, the company won the right to supply power to the grid from Boreas for £37.35 per MWh - a record low for offshore wind. Since then, the price paid to generate electricity by offshore wind farms has been raised by more than 50%, as the government tries to entice energy firms to invest. Vattenfall will stay in the UK as it still runs on and offshore wind farms and is developing a nearly 800 MW floating wind farm in the North Sea. Ms Borg said: ""Both the UK and the offshore market remain attractive over the long term, and we will focus our offshore investments in projects which are appropriate to our current risk appetite while continuing to operate and grow our existing fleet of assets."" The UK is a world leader in offshore wind and is home to the world's five largest farms, supporting tens of thousands of jobs. They provided 13.8% of the UK's electricity generation last year, according to government statistics. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

risk appetite,IS links to student killings cause outrage,2024-09-15,2020-11-05,By Secunder Kermani,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54718437,"Mohammad Rahid's warm and cheerful expression radiates through a motivational video clip that has been widely shared online following his death.  ""Life is full of challenges, pain, sadness, pressures and problems,"" he says, ""but still, there is a smile on these lips."" On Monday the 22-year old student was among more than 20 people killed in an attack by gunmen on Kabul University, one of Afghanistan's oldest and most popular institutions. The assault on young men and women trying to build a future for themselves and their country has shaken the city's residents and caused outrage. It's hard to comprehend who could commit such cold-hearted murders.  The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility, releasing a photograph of two masked attackers, who, it said, targeted a ceremony for ""the graduation of judges and investigators"".   IS is the latest player to emerge in the murky world of militants in the country, further complicating the already bloody war between the Afghan government and Taliban insurgents. It's far less powerful than the Taliban and recently lost most of the territory it once controlled in the east of the country, but it retains the ability to carry out deadly attacks.  Both the Taliban and the government have fought against IS and both regard it with suspicion, accusing each other of secretly supporting the jihadists and using them to undermine slow-moving peace talks.  That war of narratives over IS has come to the fore in the aftermath of this awful attack.  Amrullah Saleh, the first vice-president of Afghanistan, and a vocal critic of the Taliban, described the IS statement as ""fake"", stating that the weapons found at the scene do not match those in the photo released by IS. Mr Saleh also pointed to a ""Taliban flag"" apparently found at the scene of the attack as evidence that the Taliban - rather than IS - carried it out. Journalists visiting the site took photographs of the specifically pro-Taliban slogan ""Long live the Emirate"" scrawled on the bullet-ridden wall of a classroom.  There was a further mysterious development, when a video was uploaded to the internet, purportedly of masked IS militants denying they were involved in the attack, and blaming the Taliban.  Most experts, however, agree the video is a fake. And it remains unclear why, if the Taliban wanted to avoid association with the attack, they would bring a flag with them to the scene.  Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid issued an angry rebuttal, asking: ""How is it possible for assailants to find the time to draw graffiti on walls while being engaged in combat? And what purpose would taking a flag to attack site serve?"" A Taliban statement condemned the attack, and accused the government of supporting IS, suggesting it had encouraged the group to stage the assault for ""propaganda"" purposes. The Taliban's criticism of the violence rings rather hollow, however, as they are widely believed to have carried out an assault on another university in the city in 2016, in which 13 people were killed.  Borhan Osman, a senior analyst who has conducted extensive research into the Afghan conflict, told the BBC that both sides have ""strongly held"" narratives about IS but there has been no real evidence substantiating the claims advanced by either the Taliban or the government.  The counter-accusations mirror similar claims by both sides about IS in the past too.   Supporters of the government have often accused the Taliban of carrying out attacks on ""soft targets"" but deliberately not claiming them, and allowing IS to take responsibility instead, in order to benefit from the chaos of the violence whilst avoiding the public backlash.  There is something of a precedent for this: suicide attacks with large numbers of civilian casualties, widely thought to have been carried out by the Taliban, and its affiliated Haqqani network, have at times gone unclaimed. However, the Taliban have fought fiercely against IS in eastern Afghanistan, determined not to allow them to usurp their position in the insurgency. The Taliban have claimed the Afghan government helped rescue IS fighters during clashes between the two militant groups in the north. Afghan officials deny that. There's no doubt that the conflict with the Taliban saps some of the energy that the government could be expending on tackling IS, and for a war-weary public, divisions between the militants seem irrelevant in the face of widespread violence.  Security officials in Kabul also have said they believe, despite the Taliban's rivalry with IS, that the two groups tap into the same logistical support networks when carrying out attacks in the city. But there are also apparently significant ideological differences between the groups.  The Taliban profess to only wanting to implement an ""Islamic government"" or ""Islamic Emirate within Afghanistan"", and insist they do not pose a threat to other countries, whereas the Afghan branch of IS flaunts its links with affiliates in the Middle East and the idea of a global ""caliphate"". IS has also been much more openly sectarian, repeatedly targeting Kabul's Shia minority in bloody suicide bombings on weddings, shrines and sports clubs in a way the Taliban have not. Last month IS killed more than 20 students outside a tuition centre in a Kabul neighbourhood largely populated by ethnic Hazaras, followers of Shia Islam whom IS regard as heretics.  In an interview two years ago, one IS prisoner held in a Kabul prison told the BBC the group considered itself the only ""real Muslims"", following, in their view, a true, undiluted interpretation of the religion, which they contrasted to the Taliban's more nationalist-infused views. He dismissed the Taliban as ""agents"" of the Pakistani intelligence services.  Research by Borhan Osman for the United States Peace Institute also indicates that around Kabul at least, IS has managed to recruit from sectors of the population not typically drawn to the Taliban, such as ""men and women from middle-class families, many of whom are non-Pashtun university students"".  One of the attackers at Kabul University was referred to by IS using the nom de guerre ""Anas al Banishiri"", suggesting a link to Panjshir province, traditionally a stronghold of anti-Taliban sentiment. By contrast, Mr Osman wrote, the Taliban generally receive support from more rural and ethnically Pashtun communities.   The horrific violence carried out by IS has the potential to disrupt the already stalling peace talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban, with the bloodshed further raising tensions and increasing disillusionment amongst the public.  And whilst predictions that IS could attract defections from hard line elements in the Taliban opposed to the peace process have so far failed to materialise, the attacks also highlight the continued danger the group could pose, even if an agreement between the two main warring parties is eventually reached. Mr Osman told the BBC the competing narratives over IS mean ""there is a risk of overlooking the actual threat, however small, that comes from urban youth who are well-educated and have become radicalised"". At the moment, he said, ""there is very little appetite in acknowledging or doing anything about this threat"".    You may also be interested in:"
risk appetite,Fur industry faces uncertain future due to Covid,2024-09-15,2020-11-23,By Adrienne Murray,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55017666,"Europe's fur industry is back in the spotlight after Denmark's mass culling of millions of mink following an outbreak of coronavirus at farms in the country.   Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced that all mink would be slaughtered. Denmark is the world's biggest mink producer, farming up to 17 million of the animals, and Covid has swept through a quarter of its 1,000 mink farms. Officials say this ""reservoir"" of disease poses a significant health risk for humans, and worry that mutations detected in mink-related strains of the virus might compromise a future vaccine. But images of mink mass graves and farmers in tears were followed by outcry after the government admitted its order had no legal basis. The agriculture minister has since resigned. On Saturday hundreds of tractors drove into central Copenhagen to protest about the handling of the crisis. There have also been protests in the cities of Aalborg and Aarhus. The proposed ban on mink farming until 2022 now has parliamentary backing but negotiations over compensation are dragging out. Authorities say all 288 infected herds have been killed and they have put down approximately 10 million animals. It is believed the majority of remaining mink on farms where no infection was detected have also been killed. In a short while, Denmark's fur industry has almost been wiped out. Around 6,000 jobs are at risk.  ""It is a de facto permanent closure and liquidation of the fur industry,"" said Danish Mink Breeders Association chairman Tage Pedersen in a statement. ""This affects not only the mink breeders, but entire communities.""  Mink farmer Per Thyrrestrup doubts business will ever come back: ""To have the same quality of the skins, to have the same colour - it's going to be 15 to 20 years before that's possible."" The world's largest fur auction house, Kopenhagen Fur, has also announced a ""controlled shutdown"" over two to three years until this season's pelts and older stockpiles are sold.   Thousands of buyers, mostly from China, once flocked to auctions held in the Danish capital. It has been a giant in the business, trading 25 million Danish and foreign furs last year. But even before the pandemic struck, there were signs it was struggling.   A decade ago trade boomed, fuelled by an appetite for luxury goods as Chinese incomes grew. In 2013, Kopenhagen Fur sold about $2bn (£1.5bn) of furs, with global mink production worth $4.3bn. Mink pelts then cost over $90 (£69) each, but the bubble burst and last year skins fetched only a third of that. Local farmers have struggled to make money - and it is a pattern seen elsewhere. China is by far the biggest fur importer, but it is a major producer too. Else Skjold, head of fashion at the Royal Danish Academy, says this competition has driven prices down: ""A lot of new farmers went into the market and so there was simply an overflow of fur."" There's also significant fur farming across Europe. In 2018 there were 4,350 fur farms in 24 European countries, says industry group Fur Europe. Poland, the Netherlands, Finland, Lithuania and Greece are the biggest producers after Denmark - though the US, Canada and Russia also operate farms.  Since the cull began prices have shot up. ""People were concerned that there might be a shortage,"" says Mark Oaten, chief executive of the International Fur Federation (IFF). Denmark accounts for at least a quarter of the global mink trade. Ms Skjold thinks foreign competitors will fill the gap: ""They will invest hugely in expanding mink farming in China, I suspect."" Although fur farming is controversial, she believes standards on Danish farms are high and one consequence of Denmark's exit is a risk that animal welfare could get worse. ""We will see farming in less regulated and less controlled countries,"" she says.   Mink appear particularly susceptible to Covid and it can spread quickly in the farms. Infections have been detected in France, Spain, Sweden, Italy, the US, Greece and the Netherlands, which will now ban fur farming by March 2021.  Animal welfare groups say this is further reason to outlaw the practice, in addition to ethical grounds.  ""Fur farms are not only the cause of immense and unnecessary animal suffering, they are also ticking time bombs for deadly diseases,"" says Dr Joanna Swabe from the Humane Society International. Over the years, animal welfare campaigns have shifted public opinion. Numerous fashion brands have stopped using fur and switched to synthetic alternatives. The UK banned fur farming in 2003. Austria, Germany and Japan have also stopped production and other countries are phasing it out. Yet as European consumers turned away, Chinese customers took their place. ""Towards the 2000s you could see the Chinese market grow. Fur represents that you've entered the middle class,"" says Else Skjold.  The IFF's Mark Oaten says Asia now accounts for 35-40% of fur sales, with South Korea another key market. Trends have also shifted away from the high-cost ""grandma's fur coat"" to affordable, everyday garments with small amounts of fur trim.  But the Chinese market has also faltered. Economic slowdown had dampened consumer spending even before Covid struck. Luxury goods spending ""has really taken a dip in the last three years,"" says Mr Oaten. ""The whole industry has been struggling,"" says Veronica Wang of OCC strategy consultants, which specialises in luxury apparel and beauty. ""Even in China, this year a lot of fur companies have closed."" She says the problem is two-fold: ""There is a decline in terms of demand and there is the oversupply,"" added to which Covid has made things worse as there is now nervousness within China about trading or importing animal products.   Ms Wang adds that the appetite for fur is changing among younger Chinese. Fake fur used to be seen as low quality, but consumers' perceptions are changing as more luxury brands make the switch. ""We know that versus the previous generations, these younger consumers, especially Gen Z, have a higher sense of social responsibility - I do see that trend has started,"" she says."
risk appetite,The businesses staying in Russia,2024-09-15,2023-09-19,Brennan Doherty,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230918-business-in-russia-why-some-firms-havent-left,"Hundreds of companies have exited Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, but others cite revenue concerns – and even humanitarianism – as reasons to stay put. When the first airstrikes fell on Ukraine in February 2022, corporate executives with operations or holdings in Russia were forced to pick a side. This decision had significant implications. Russia remains a major business market, with a population of 145 million; its 2022 GDP was a staggering $2.24tn (£1.81tn), right behind France. Fleeing companies would leave a lot of revenue on the table. Yet amid a gruelling war, with tens of thousands of civilian casualties and widespread international condemnation of Russia, companies risked severe reputational damage by staying put. Plus, a mix of international pressure, sanctions and risks of Russian government interference offered strong reasons for companies to leave when the conflict began. ""Some decided to stay, some decided to go very quickly, and some dragged their feet,"" says Roman Sidortsov, an associate professor of energy policy at Michigan Technological University, US, who practised corporate law and taught in Russia. One of the biggest companies to pull out almost immediately was British Petroleum, which exited just three days after the conflict began. By 1 March, BMW also announced it would halt Russian production and imports. And after first announcing a plan to leave Russia in March 2022, Heineken sold off its Russian business to Russian packaging firm Arnest for a single euro this August, taking a €300m ($319m; £257m) loss on the division. Experts disagree on exactly how many companies have left Russia – and what constitutes a 'full departure'. The Kyiv School of Economics Institute, which tracks the status of foreign companies selling or operating in Russia through its Leave Russia project, estimates around 300 have left. According to a similar list compiled by the Yale School of Management's Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI), roughly a thousand companies have exited.   However, hundreds of foreign companies continue to operate in, or sell to, Russia. The KSE Institute claims 1,400 companies are still conducting business in some form within the country; by the CELI’s count, around 500 companies are doing so. A recognisable name on the KSE list is PepsiCo. In early September, Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention accused the multinational soft-drink giant of continuing to produce food products in Russia despite it discontinuing Pepsi-Cola, 7Up and Miranda production.  Tech and finance giants, including Chinese firm Alibaba, also continue to conduct business there, as does British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. Airlines including Emirates, China Eastern and Air Serbia still openly advertise flights to Russia on their websites. Other businesses, like Indian refiner Chennai Petroleum, are gearing up instead of exiting: the company is expanding its services to Russia because of the invasion.  Critics of companies that have remained in Russia, including Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute founder Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, denounce these businesses as greedy, or even complicit in Russia's invasion. But ceasing operations in a country with such major business implications isn't simple. Some businesses remain because of a lack of pressure on them to leave, or due to an existential threat. Others believe staying is the most humane option for their consumers. Why stay? Companies choose to continue operations in Russia for all sorts of reasons, despite immense public pressure from both consumers and governments. The simplest is financial solvency. Growing revenue and maintaining market share is critical for any firm, especially one dependent on Russian consumers. Andreas Rasche, a professor of business in society at the Copenhagen Business School's Centre for Sustainability, offers the example of family-owned German chocolate brand Ritter Sport, which pledged to stop investing and advertising in Russia, but still sells its products in the country. ""They get 7% of their overall revenue out of Russia,"" he says. ""They don't simply leave the market because, for them, it would potentially hurt a lot.""  Sidortsov says other companies may simply not fear the optics of operating in Russia, especially if these firms are small or not publicly well known, or if business interests are simply too great. He points to US oilfield-services giant SLB, which, along with fellow firms Halliburton and Baker Hughes, continued to supply Russia with imports after the war began. Although Halliburton and Baker Hughes wound down their operations less than six months into the conflict, SLB only stopped in July 2023. Russia is a major oil producer, and Sidortsov says there was a compelling business reason to stay. SLB even grew its fortunes slightly before departing. ""The reputational risk was not that high, and the dependence on these companies was really, really high, so it was just worth it,"" he says. In many cases, management might be able or willing to leave Russia, but aren't keen on selling factories, warehouses, storefronts or other assets in the country. This is especially true considering Russian legislation that complicates foreign corporate withdrawals. Rasche cites a law, passed by the Kremlin in late 2022, which essentially requires all foreign companies wishing to sell assets be assessed by a Russian government agency, then sold at half the agency's valuation. Some companies, like Heineken, have been willing to sell their Russian assets at a steep discount. But Rasche says other businesses are not as eager to take a massive financial hit. Plus, he adds, many of these asset sales are done with Russian oligarchs. ""Quite a lot of companies struggle with that,"" he says. Even companies that stay risk the possibility of seizure by the Kremlin. In July, this happened to Carlsberg, a Danish competitor to Heineken; Russian President Vladimir Putin seized its assets in retaliation for Western governments taking control of Russian assets abroad. While Carlsberg still owns Baltika, it no longer has any jurisdiction over it. Sidortsov, who grew up in the former Soviet Union, says this could be a case of the Russian government deliberately seizing assets to enrich itself or its supporters. This practice, known in Russia as ""otzhim"", derived from the Russian word for ""to squeeze"", is not unusual in Russia's business environment. In other cases, firms providing essential food or medicine, like AstraZeneca, have argued staying in Russia is worth it on moral grounds. In a statement last August, the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant said it had signed the Ukraine Business Compact in support of Ukraine's recovery, and had paused investments, but would continue to sell medication in Russia. ""Patients rely on our essential and live-saving medicines, and it is vital that medical supply chains continue to operate, enabling health systems and workers to deliver essential care,"" the statement reads. It added it would not start global clinical trials in the country. Future risks? Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the founder of Yale's Chief Executive Leadership Institute, believes companies choosing to stay in Russia amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine will not be viewed kindly by the public. He compares it to the PR disaster faced by companies that ran German operations during the Third Reich. ""When the war ends, they're going to be seen as Nazi collaborators were seen,"" he says. He argues the decisions to continue German operations by companies including Woolworth, Royal Dutch Shell and Texaco did not benefit their bottom lines in the end. All three were forced into stopping their activities in Nazi Germany due to pressure, adds Sonnenfeld. Texaco’s chairman, Torkild Rieber, was forced to resign in 1940 due to public outcry over his pro-fascist sympathies and dealings with Gerhard Westrick, a Nazi official who represented US companies operating in Germany. However, not every business in this position sustained harm: IBM, which currently has a market cap of $134bn, supplied technology to the Nazi regime itself; while Volkswagen, the original producer of Hitler's so-called 'people's car', is currently the largest automotive group in the world. As for the current conflict, Rasche believes the long-term consequences for companies choosing to stay in Russia depend on investors' appetite for risk. After all, he says, companies in Russia could have their assets seized, as was the case with Carlsberg, or kicked out of the country. If the war escalates further into Russia itself, workers, factories and other assets might be caught in the crossfire. Businesses may also face blowback from consumers around the globe. Myriad boycotts aim to galvanise foreign companies into leaving Russia, including the KSE Institute's Leave Russia project, which tracks the company exits. These campaigns often produce negative attention for lingering firms, yet some businesses may be fine weathering the storm – Rasche says the financial implications for companies caught in scandals are usually short-lived. ""Nike had all these sweatshop scandals in the 1990s,"" he points out. ""Nowadays, people still buy their products. So, I think there is a tendency for people to forget and maybe just keep on going and revert to business as usual."" The ongoing deterioration of Russia's economy, in the face of international sanctions and condemnation, may still give remaining companies increasing reason to bail. While the Russian economy is large, it still underperforms the US, China and the European Union. Ultimately, Sidortsov expects the country's business environment will eventually look like North Korea's: very isolated, with only a handful of business links to the outside world through staunch allies like China. ""I think there will be a point in time,"" he says, ""when there will be very, very few foreign companies left."""
risk appetite,Arab and Muslim leaders blame West for Gaza misery,2024-09-15,2023-11-14,By Frank Gardner,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67417570,"Hypocrisy, double standards and a failure to understand the region. These are the charges being levelled at the West, primarily the US, by leaders of 57 Arab and Muslim countries who convened at the weekend in the Saudi capital Riyadh. How is it, foreign ministers said to me, that the West slams Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine, yet, in their words, it ""gives a green light to Israel to do the same in Gaza""?  In the luxurious surroundings of Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, amid giant floral bouquets and glittering chandeliers, and a world away from the shattered landscape of Gaza, princes, presidents and prime ministers met for the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit. Blame for the war and the destruction of lives and property was heaped unilaterally on Israel and its supporters. No-one criticised Hamas for its 7 October raid into southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw some 240 taken hostage, triggering the massive military retaliation. Israel, said the secretary general of the Arab League, had committed criminal acts. ""We warn of the disastrous repercussions of the retaliatory aggression by Israel against the Gaza Strip, which amounts to a war crime,"" said the final communique. ""We warn of the real danger of the expansion of the war as a result of Israel's refusal to stop its aggression and of the inability of the [UN] Security Council to enforce international law to end this aggression.""  Few people I spoke to at the summit expected Israel to take much notice. Instead, it was clear that this summit and its intended message of unity was aimed at Israel's biggest backer - the United States. Leaders want the Biden administration and the West in general to exert sufficient pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether. But what they could not agree on was how to achieve that. The summit pulled together some strange bedfellows - an indication of just how worried the region is at events in Gaza spiralling beyond their control.  Iran - Israel's main adversary - attended, with President Ebrahim Raisi striding across the carpeted halls in his black, cleric's robes, flanked by his scowling security men in dark suits and collarless shirts. This in itself was a surprising sight.  Until they patched over their differences in March this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran were arch rivals exchanging venomous mutual accusations. They still have competing agendas, with Iran backing what many call its ""proxy militias"" - Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.  The Saudis, together with their conservative Arab allies like Egypt and Jordan, see these movements as dangerous destabilisers. As he departed Tehran airport for Riyadh, President Raisi said that now was the time for action over Gaza, not words.  But anyone expecting concrete, punitive actions against the US or the UK was left disappointed. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which only recently opened full diplomatic, trade and security ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, resisted calls to break them off. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad was also at the summit. Until very recently he was a pariah in the Arab world for the repressive actions of his regime in Syria's civil war. He told the summit it would achieve little without concrete measures, but suggestions of an oil embargo or the expulsion of US bases from Arab countries were quietly batted away. Yet there is no denying that the 7 October Hamas raid and the ensuing war has changed the whole paradigm in the Middle East. Up until that murderous morning in southern Israel the tectonic plates of regional politics were shifting away from the interests of Iran and its militant allies. Six Arab nations had already established full ties with Israel; Saudi Arabia was well on the way to being next. The Israeli tourism minister visited Riyadh just days before the Hamas raid. Dubai has been luring Israeli tourists in large numbers and there has been a huge Arab appetite for Israel's expertise in technology, surveillance, bio-tech and other sectors. With the exception of Qatar, which hosts the exiled political leaders of Hamas, Gulf Arab rulers had grown tired of what they saw as the corruption, inefficiency and infighting of Palestinian leadership. While sympathetic to the plight of ordinary Palestinians, still without a state after 75 years, they largely took the view that Israel was too important a nation to ignore, and that it was time to move on and normalise ties with it. The question of a future Palestinian state, while still featuring in speeches, was getting little practical attention. Today, those Arab-Israeli ties, while not yet broken, are certainly fraying at the edges.  ""We are really worried about the radicalisation of our youth,"" one Arab foreign minister told me on background. ""They watch what is happening in Gaza on TV and they are increasingly angry.""  Time and again I heard delegates complain that the actions of the Netanyahu government have gone far beyond self-defence and are now dragging the region down a dangerous path. There are concerns that extremist narratives are gaining popularity online. Arab and Muslim leaders are frustrated that the UN Security Council has failed in their eyes to exercise any restraint on Israel's military in Gaza. America's opposition to a ceasefire has deeply embarrassed those countries it calls allies in the region.  Washington's strategic alliance with the oil-rich Gulf Arab states dates back to 1945 and a wartime meeting on a US warship in the Red Sea between President Roosevelt and the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz. Today, the US still provides the bulk of Saudi and Gulf Arab defence and security needs. But below the surface things are changing. Ever since the Obama administration's ""pivot to Asia"" there has been a fear here in the Gulf that the US is losing interest in the region, that it cannot be relied upon as a loyal partner. At the same time, the influences of Moscow and Beijing are in the ascendant. China recently brokered the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. President Putin has impressed Arab leaders with his unstinting support for Syria's President Assad. They compare this with how quickly Washington abandoned Egypt's President Mubarak in 2011 when the crowds came out on Cairo's Tahrir Square. None of this means the West has lost the friends it had in the Middle East. Those Arab allies are clearly reluctant to go beyond angry words with Washington. But they do want to be heard and for the violence in Gaza to stop now, before events in the region and in their own countries risk deteriorating far beyond their control."
risk appetite,Snoop Dogg: I've decided to give up smoke,2024-09-15,2023-11-17,Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g21x5yp81o,"Snoop Dogg, who has built a public persona around his copious marijuana intake, says he is giving up smoking. The hip-hop star, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, made the surprise announcement on social media. ""After much consideration & conversation with my family, I’ve decided to give up smoke. Please respect my privacy at this time,” he posted on Instagram and X. He did not specify what form of smoking he was stopping, or even whether he was serious. Some fans speculated that the post was part of a marketing stunt for his cannabis company Leafs By Snoop.  Others reacted with disbelief. “Today isn’t April Fools day Snoop,” said one.  “Snoop without smoke is like earth without water,"" added another. Ro Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley, commented:  ""No more BBQ at uncle's... the grill is off for the season."" Snoop's cannabis intake has been well-documented in his music and interviews. The rapper, 52, made his debut on Dr Dre's 1992 album The Chronic, whose title is a slang name for high quality marijuana.  Over the years, his lyrics have contained multiple references to the habit.  ""We gon' smoke an ounce to this,"" he rapped on his solo single Gin And Juice. The Dr Dre collaboration The Next Episode - which opened the Super Bowl half-time show in 2022 - carried the observation: ""Smoke weed every day.""  In 2013, speaking to GQ magazine, the artist said he was smoking 80 cannabis joints a day. His founded Leafs By Snoop two years later. The company specialises in making its own cannabis strains, concentrates, flowers, and edibles. What is your reaction to Snoop's decision?

You can also get in touch via: WhatsApp: +44 7756 165803 and X: @BBC_HaveYourSay Some fans suggested the star's apparent decision to quit could have been made on health grounds. ""I had a pulmonary embolism last year and had to give up smoking as well,"" wrote one on Instagram.  ""I know how hard this transition is especially for someone like you. Take all the time you need."" A second comment added: ""I quit few months ago and literally [had] so much clarity since I stopped. Congratulations unc."" On X, another fan speculated that Snoop was not giving up the drug altogether.  ""He’s moving to edibles, letting his lungs rest a little. Eat up, champ."" Frank, the UK's anti-drug advisory service, notes that overusing marijuana can increase the risk of lung cancer.

risk appetite,Talks on lifting football's booze ban,2024-09-15,2018-10-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45970058,"Talks have taken place that could lead to the lifting of the ban on the sale of alcohol at Scottish football grounds, BBC Scotland has learned.  The Scottish FA, Police Scotland and Scottish government officials have met to explore the idea of using the Euro 2020 matches at Hampden as a pilot. As it stands, Glasgow would be the only one of 12 host cities where fans could not buy alcohol in the stadium. It is understood some bodies involved are open to the idea of ending the ban. Police Scotland said it would be prepared to discuss changes. But Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said it needed widespread public consultation to prove there was an appetite for it. The ban was initially imposed following a riot at the 1980 Scottish Cup final between Rangers and Celtic. It means no alcohol can be served in football stadiums, although there is an exemption for corporate hospitality areas. Any change in Scotland would require government legislation. The Euro 2020 championships could be the catalyst for change. European football governing body Uefa has decided to relax its own rules on the sale of alcohol during its competitions. This means the 12 cities across Europe that will stage matches can now sell alcohol if local laws allow it. Hampden Stadium in Glasgow will stage three group stage games and one last-16 match. The issue of alcohol in Scottish football has polarised opinion since a ban was introduced in 1980.  The nature of the Hampden riot and the outrage that followed, meant there was little opposition when the rules were changed.  Scotland was shamed into banning booze.  But a new generation of fans feel they are being punished for the sins of the past.  They are not asking to bring crates of lager or large bottles of cider into matches across the country, they simply want to be treated like fans of others sports who can buy a beer whilst watching from the stands.  Now the shame that saw it outlawed from football could force its return.  There are influential figures within the game, the government and the police, who are keen that Hampden isn't the only host city of Euro 2020 where fans can't buy alcohol in the ground.  The thought of having to explain why, has forced a rethink.  Those against are once again mobilising though - the Scottish Police Federation says the risk is just too great.  It's been discussed many times since 1980 but this time feels different.  The thirst for change has never been greater. The Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said it would strongly oppose the idea. It said there was evidence that football authorities were already struggling to manage crowds appropriately. David Hamilton, the SPF's vice chairman, said: ""We don't have the same problems in rugby stadia that we do in football.  ""We don't see toilets being trashed, we don't see pyrotechnics.  ""They are particular problems for football and the idea of adding alcohol to that mix does not seem to make sense."" Dr Richard Purves from the Institute of Social Marketing at Stirling University is studying the link between alcohol and football. He told the BBC: ""When you mention something about alcohol availability in Scottish grounds, you will immediately assume Celtic and Rangers. ""I know there are talks ongoing to change the regulations but I don't see this being the case for big high-risk games.  ""There needs to be more research in this area which answers questions like, why do people drink when they attend football games? how much are they drinking? Does this cause any harm? Then, how should government respond to try to limit any potential harm?"" In England, where there were similar problems in the 1980s, alcohol can be sold within the stadium but cannot be drunk ""in view of the pitch"". This prevents fans from drinking while in their seats but allows booze to be sold before the match and at half-time. Dundee FC's managing director John Nelms said he was in favour of something similar in Scotland. He said: ""We're in the entertainment business and having a beer and watching the match with your mates would be fantastic.  ""Just a few weeks ago I was at the Man City v Liverpool match and they had beer at that game.  ""They are football fans and they behaved appropriately. ""I know there have been problems in the past but in the modern day, I think it's much less of an issue. I also think it would help boost attendances, especially for the smaller clubs."" Andrew Niven, the Scottish Football Association's man in charge of staging the Euro 2020 matches, said he was aware of Uefa giving permission to sell alcohol in stadiums. He said: ""While we are open to exploring this, further discussions would be required with the Scottish government, Police Scotland and other stakeholders to properly assess the feasibility of legislative change.""  A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We will continue to discuss these issues with Police Scotland, the Scottish FA and a wide range of other organisations to ensure our national game is safe and enjoyable for all.""

risk appetite,Police cuts 'a risk to mass riot response',2024-09-15,2017-06-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40377260,"Police in England and Wales would struggle to deal with riots on the scale of 2011 due to budget cuts, an officer who oversees funding has said. Chief Constable Dave Thompson, of West Midlands Police, said the ""strain is showing"" after multiple terror attacks. ""We'd have real challenges in dealing with something like the 2011 riots again,"" he wrote on the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) blog on Friday. The home secretary has admitted that police resources are ""very tight"". Amber Rudd told MPs on Thursday that the police response to attacks in Manchester and London required ""additional work"" in law enforcement. She said: ""I recognise the fact that we cannot carry on at that emergency level indefinitely."" Mr Thompson, finance lead at the NPCC, which represents police leaders, called on the government to ""stabilise"" police funding so it can tackle not only terrorism but other threats, such as cyber-crime. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""policing is not raising a white flag, saying we can't cope"". ""But the last few weeks, and our general resilience, is starting to show some red lights.  ""Of course, policing will pull out all the stops to protect the public. ""But that strain on the system now is reaching a stage where we need a serious debate, as we go forward into the Budget in November, as to what the resources are for policing."" He wrote that the police face handling ""a modern terror threat with 6,600 officers - a number that has already fallen by close to 2,000 and is set to fall further"". And he also said more investment was needed ""with a growing cyber threat"", adding: ""Counter-terrorism policing is stretched and is in no place to deliver efficiency savings."" He said mainstream police resources were being diverted to fight terrorism, echoing warnings by Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley that ordinary law enforcement faced ""significant"" funding risks after four terror attacks in as many months. The violence that spread around England began at a peaceful protest demanding justice for a man shot by police in London. Mark Duggan was killed in Tottenham on Thursday 4 August after police stopped the car he was a passenger in.  A protest march two days later sparked unrest and resulted in cars and shops in Tottenham being set alight, and looting taking place.   By the afternoon of Monday 8 August this began to spread to other areas in London,  then to other major cities such as Birmingham, Nottingham, Bristol, Leicester, and several areas in Manchester and Liverpool. More than 1,000 people were eventually jailed for the disturbances. Maps and timeline of England riots Mr Thompson said: ""The firearms commanders, casualty bureau, custody staff, body recovery teams and uniformed officers patrolling crowded spaces that are so central to preventing and responding to a terror attack are paid for by core police funding."" He said that two-thirds of the policing effort after the Westminster Bridge attack was met by core police funding and not counter-terrorism. He said: ""If we are to sustain the protection citizens want and need, police leaders need to continue to reform, look hard at what needs to be done differently, and be bold and innovative in rising to the challenge. ""We need to have a conversation and a partnership with government that enables us to look forward to deal with the threats we face, and there are choices in there for government that we will give them."" This was not simply ""asking for a blank cheque"", he said. Mr Thompson's comments were backed by West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Dee Collins.   ""Our resources will only stretch so far and my concern is just how sustainable this in the long term, without an uplift in funding and resources,"" she said. The Home Office has said it is in ""detailed engagement"" with police over planned funding changes. A spokesman said: ""The government is undertaking a period of detailed engagement with policing partners and independent experts on the police funding formula. ""New proposals will not be implemented without a public consultation."" Meanwhile, chief constables in England and Wales are to consider measures to allow more officers to carry guns.  A discussion paper is being prepared for a meeting next month in response to the terror attacks over the past three months.  The options include equipping more officers with Tasers, increasing the availability of armed response vehicles and specialist firearms officers - and giving some front-line police small firearms for personal protection.  However, there appears to be no appetite among senior officers for a fundamental change to policing practices by routinely arming all police.  "
risk appetite,Rise in sales of home-cooked food worries watchdog,2024-09-15,2021-02-15,By Dougal Shaw,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56032185,"There has been a ""concerning"" rise in food businesses operating out of people's homes during lockdown, according to the food safety watchdog. Many of them are selling food through social media, putting further pressure on a hygiene inspection system that is under strain because of the crisis. And other experts are also worried.  ""Little food businesses are popping up like mushrooms in lockdown,"" said Julie Barratt from the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH). ""There are rank outsiders operating off the radar, who think, 'Oh, my mum can cook', and confuse cooking with catering,"" she added. They sell to locals on apps such as Whatsapp, Instagram and Nextdoor. Many are failing to register as food businesses, meaning their hygiene arrangements are not checked by local authorities. But even those that do register are often not getting an inspection - despite new businesses usually being a priority - because the system is struggling to keep up during the pandemic. Hygiene inspections ceased completely during the first lockdown and since then a scaled-back operation has focused on high-risk cases.  Local authorities are using video calls in a bid to clear the backlog. They allow basic issues to be resolved and reduce the time environmental health officers need to spend on-site. They could be used, for example, to ensure there is a separate sink for washing hands. But these video calls can never be as effective as in-person, surprise inspections, says Ms Barratt. They are unable to reveal things such as ingredients past their use-by date, or rat droppings under the cooker. Indeed, a challenge posed by the new legion of at-home businesses is that even if a physical inspection is required, a 24-hour warning has to be given because it is a private address, so the surprise element is lost. About 44% of new food businesses started since the first lockdown are home-based, according to a new centralised online registration system used by nearly 200 local authorities, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has revealed.  The full picture will be clearer when all local authorities report their registration figures in the new financial year in April. ""The growth of at-home food businesses is a concern,"" the FSA said. ""Local authority resources are already stretched and many are finding it difficult to keep on top of the workload [these at-home food businesses] are generating,"" says Michael Jackson, the FSA's head of regulatory compliance.  Some people are starting food businesses from their home because they have lost work and need to generate income - including professional chefs who have been hit by the closure of restaurants.  Others are on furlough and have time to set up ""side hustles"". Takeaway eating and the idea of cooking for neighbours in need has also become more common in lockdown.  As well as social media platforms, websites such as Olio and Cook My Grub also now allow this new army of at-home food entrepreneurs to find customers, selling everything from cakes to Sunday roasts.  Every new food business must register before it starts selling food. Once registered with the local authority, an environmental health officer can visit in person and this eventually leads to an official food hygiene rating of 0-5 (or pass-fail in Scotland). The business can still trade prior to gaining its rating.  However, the rating is a vital tool for customers to gauge the safety of an establishment and can be a selling point. Indeed, many new at-home food businesses that are well-run and take hygiene seriously are frustrated that they haven't been able to secure a rating yet, due to the backlog. The FSA described the situation with inspections as ""at the edge of our risk appetite"" back in early December, before the current lockdown was announced. There have been no reported outbreaks of food poisoning connected to new at-home businesses so far. However, the FSA wants the public to be aware of the risks. ""Our advice to people when ordering food online is to check that the business has a food hygiene rating and choose only those with a rating of 3 or above, this can be checked on our website,"" says Mr Jackson of the FSA.  ""If a consumer has any doubts about a food seller or a food product, they should report them to the local authority,"" he adds. ""Where sellers do not follow the rules, they may be fined, imprisoned for up to two years, or both."" However, others think the system itself needs an overhaul to protect the public. The law should be changed so that food businesses of any type cannot trade until they have been inspected and rated, says the CIEH's Ms Barratt. You can follow Dougal on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc"
risk appetite,My business is flooded - is support available?,2024-09-15,2023-11-03,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67314336,"Businesses in parts of Northern Ireland hardest hit by flooding have been left counting the cost of the damage. Many have told BBC News NI that their insurance does not cover flooding. Insurers will look at a lot of information including flood maps and previous incidents which might mean some areas, like BT35 in Newry, cannot get flood cover. However, it can depend on a street-by-street basis.  The advice from industry experts is to contact your insurer or broker regardless as they will need to know the property is empty as that might affect other parts of your policy. If you do not have cover for commercial damage of things like stock, that also means you will not be eligible for business interruption cover either.  Alastair Ross, from the Association of British Insurers, said: ""There are some properties whereby insurance cover will exclude flood cover.  ""That's because insurance is a business that's built on risk and data and in those cases the cost of insuring for flood insurance, bearing in mind the likelihood of a claim coming in and the severity and the extent of that claim probably goes beyond the commercial appetite of insurers. ""It may be that insurance is simply unavailable, or where they are quoting, the business has decided that they can't afford that.  ""It's a really difficult situation for them to be in, insurers do want to try and do business and help these customers, but they need to be able to do that within the confines of their own business models and risk appetite."" Businesses are calling for support from all levels of government - council, regional and Westminster. At a regional level, there is no executive or ministers in place but the Department for Infrastructure is working on the immediate aftermath and clear up. There have been calls from business organisations for the Department of Finance, which is responsible for rates, to give businesses an immediate rates holiday. But BBC News NI understands that the department would not have the financial firepower to fund this, nor the ability to pass legislation in order to do this.  The department does have a hardship rates relief fund that businesses can apply for retrospectively to get rates paid back. Applications, it said, can be made up until 31 March 2024. ""In addition Land & Property Services would encourage those experiencing difficulties paying their rates bill as a result of the floods to contact them as soon as possible and discuss payment options that may help alleviate immediate financial concerns,"" a spokesperson continued. At a Westminster level, business groups have also called for a financial support package. A Northern Ireland Office (NIO) spokesperson said the UK government has been ""in close contact"" with the civil service and would continue to work with it closely ""in the days ahead"". The Department for Communities has activated the Scheme for Emergency Financial Assistance (SEFA) for the period from 17 October 2023 to 16 November 2023. ""Individual householders who have suffered severe inconvenience following the recent incidents of flooding can claim £1,000 payment from their local council as an offer of practical assistance,"" a spokesperson for The Executive Office said. ""Departments are also exploring what financial support they could collectively provide as part of the overall response.  ""An approach will be made to HM Government, through NIO, for financial assistance for impacted businesses."" Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said it has been ""engaging with businesses throughout the process and is keeping residents affected by flooding informed of financial assistance available through the SEFA scheme""."
risk appetite,Suella Braverman's letter to Rishi Sunak in full,2024-09-15,2023-11-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67416146,"Suella Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary by Rishi Sunak after she defied No 10 over an article accusing the Metropolitan Police of bias in the policing of protests, has sent a scathing open letter to her old boss. Here it is in full: Dear Prime Minister Thank you for your phone call yesterday morning in which you asked me to leave government. While disappointing, this is for the best. It has been my privilege to serve as home secretary and deliver on what the British people have sent us to Westminster to do.  I want to thank all of those civil servants, police, Border Force officers and security professionals with whom I have worked and whose dedication to public safety is exemplary.  I am proud of what we achieved together: delivering on our manifesto pledge to recruit 20,000 new police officers and enacting new laws such as the Public Order Act 2023 and the National Security Act 2023.  I also led a programme of reform: on anti-social behaviour, police dismissals and standards, reasonable lines of enquiry, grooming gangs, knife crime, non-crime hate incidents and rape and serious sexual offences.  And I am proud of the strategic changes that I was delivering to Prevent, Contest, serious organised crime and fraud. I am sure that this work will continue with the new ministerial team. As you know, I accepted your offer to serve as home secretary in October 2022 on certain conditions. Despite you having been rejected by a majority of party members during the summer leadership contest and thus having no personal mandate to be prime minister, I agreed to support you because of the firm assurances you gave me on key policy priorities. These were, among other things: This was a document with clear terms to which you agreed in October 2022 during your second leadership campaign. I trusted you. It is generally agreed that my support was a pivotal factor in winning the leadership contest and thus enabling you to become prime minister. For a year, as home secretary I have sent numerous letters to you on the key subjects contained in our agreement, made requests to discuss them with you and your team, and put forward proposals on how we might deliver these goals.  I worked up the legal advice, policy detail and action to take on these issues. This was often met with equivocation, disregard and a lack of interest. You have manifestly and repeatedly failed to deliver on every single one of these key policies. Either your distinctive style of government means you are incapable of doing so. Or, as I must surely conclude now, you never had any intention of keeping your promises. These are not just pet interests of mine. They are what we promised the British people in our 2019 manifesto which led to a landslide victory. They are what people voted for in the 2016 Brexit Referendum. Our deal was no mere promise over dinner, to be discarded when convenient and denied when challenged. I was clear from day one that if you did not wish to leave the ECHR, the way to securely and swiftly deliver our Rwanda partnership would be to block off the ECHR, the HRA and any other obligations which inhibit our ability to remove those with no right to be in the UK. Our deal expressly referenced ""notwithstanding clauses"" to that effect. Your rejection of this path was not merely a betrayal of our agreement, but a betrayal of your promise to the nation that you would do ""whatever it takes"" to stop the boats. At every stage of litigation I cautioned you and your team against assuming we would win. I repeatedly urged you to take legislative measures that would better secure us against the possibility of defeat. You ignored these arguments. You opted instead for wishful thinking as a comfort blanket to avoid having to make hard choices. This irresponsibility has wasted time and left the country in an impossible position. If we lose in the Supreme Court, an outcome that I have consistently argued we must be prepared for, you will have wasted a year and an Act of Parliament, only to arrive back at square one.  Worse than this, your magical thinking - believing that you can will your way through this without upsetting polite opinion - has meant you have failed to prepare any sort of credible Plan B.  I wrote to you on multiple occasions setting out what a credible Plan B would entail, and making clear that unless you pursue these proposals, in the event of defeat, there is no hope of flights this side of an election. I received no reply from you. I can only surmise that this is because you have no appetite for doing what is necessary, and therefore no real intention of fulfilling your pledge to the British people. If, on the other hand, we win in the Supreme Court, because of the compromises that you insisted on in the Illegal Migration Act, the government will struggle to deliver our Rwanda partnership in the way that the public expects.  The Act is far from secure against legal challenge. People will not be removed as swiftly as I originally proposed. The average claimant will be entitled to months of process, challenge, and appeal. Your insistence that Rule 39 indications are binding in international law - against the views of leading lawyers, as set out in the House of Lords - will leave us vulnerable to being thwarted yet again by the Strasbourg Court. Another cause for disappointment - and the context for my recent article in The Times - has been your failure to rise to the challenge posed by the increasingly vicious antisemitism and extremism displayed on our streets since Hamas's terrorist atrocities of 7 October. I have become hoarse urging you to consider legislation to ban the hate marches and help stem the rising tide of racism, intimidation and terrorist glorification threatening community cohesion.  Britain is at a turning point in our history and faces a threat of radicalisation and extremism in a way not seen for 20 years.  I regret to say that your response has been uncertain, weak, and lacking in the qualities of leadership that this country needs. Rather than fully acknowledge the severity of this threat, your team disagreed with me for weeks that the law needed changing. As on so many other issues, you sought to put off tough decisions in order to minimise political risk to yourself. In doing so, you have increased the very real risk these marches present to everyone else. In October of last year you were given an opportunity to lead our country. It is a privilege to serve and one we should not take for granted. Service requires bravery and thinking of the common good. It is not about occupying the office as an end in itself. Someone needs to be honest: your plan is not working, we have endured record election defeats, your resets have failed and we are running out of time. You need to change course urgently. I may not have always found the right words, but I have always striven to give voice to the quiet majority that supported us in 2019. I have endeavoured to be honest and true to the people who put us in these privileged positions. I will, of course, continue to support the government in pursuit of policies which align with an authentic conservative agenda. Sincerely Suella Braverman"
risk appetite,The rise of 'wellness travel',2024-09-15,2020-02-04,Peter Rubinstein,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200203-how-the-wellness-industry-is-taking-over-travel,"'Wellness tourism' is a growing industry, supported by travellers actively seeking ways to enhance their well-being on the go. Now, major lifestyle brands want a piece of the pie. Feel like waking up in a luxury hotel to a nutrient-rich meal of local cuisine, before scaling a mountain alongside a veteran fitness trainer? How about a few days of surfing on a private beach, with regular meditations within the tranquil Costa Rican jungle? Or perhaps you’d rather perfect your cycling technique – mindful, of course, that acupuncturists are on hand to ease that post-ride soreness. Welcome to the world of wellness tourism, the latest frontier in living our best lives. The world of wellness – a global economy of care and workout offerings, nutrients, alternative medicine and more that reached $4.5 trillion in 2018 – has witnessed a triumphant ascension over the past decade. Popular perceptions of the importance of diet, fitness and healthy practices have transformed, powering vibrant new business sectors. And as wellness evolves and expands, auxiliary markets from food and drink to hospitality are starting to provide products that reflect the values of today’s health-conscious consumers. Major companies broadly focused on the wellness lifestyle like fitness chain Equinox, indoor cycling chain SoulCycle and sports clothing retailer Lululemon are no different. As the lines blur between their products and the lifestyle they’re seeking to promote, these brands are taking steps to cater to all facets of their customers’ identity. Now all are moving into the tourism sector, offering multi-day excursions for members with health and fitness at their core. Wellness tourism is defined by the US-based non-profit Global Wellness Institute (GWI) as “travel associated with the pursuit of maintaining or enhancing one’s personal well-being”. While ‘activity’ holidays have existed for years, embarking on one of these new journeys – from hiking in Morocco with Equinox to sailing towards the Italian Riviera with Goop’s Gwyneth Paltrow – usually means a luxurious bounty of strictly curated meals, supervised workouts and an emphasis on mindfulness and enlightenment. While critics might highlight these trips, which often come with price tags of several thousand dollars, as another example of how wellness is most accessible to the most affluent, proponents say they offer opportunities for personal betterment and community engagement. So what does their emergence augur for the rapidly expanding wellness sector? New frontiers From 2015 to 2017 the wellness tourism market grew from $563bn to $639bn, or 6.5% annually – more than twice as fast as the growth of tourism overall, according to GWI. By 2022, GWI predicts the market will reach a whopping $919bn – representing 18% of all global tourism – with well over a billion individual wellness trips to take place around the globe. Anne Dimon, president of the Wellness Tourism Association, adds that while wellness travellers can be anyone, the bulk tend to be higher-educated women between ages 30 and 60. Yet despite its new visibility, the idea of travelling with the express purpose of improving well-being is by no means novel. Think back to the pilgrimages taken to the Dead Sea, ancient baths in Rome and natural hot springs across Asia – or the yoga retreats and Thai colon-cleansing holidays of more recent decades. But according to GWI, wellness tourism today is about much more than the destination or activities – it is an extension of the very values and lifestyle of the traveller. “All around the world, more people are incorporating elements of health, prevention, self-actualisation, experience and mindfulness into their daily lives,” its 2018 report says. “It is not a surprise that people now expect to continue their healthy lifestyles and wellness routines when they are away from home.” In the case of brands like Equinox, a US-headquartered fitness club known for its lavish amenities and hefty membership cost (over $3,000 per year for some), these values have translated into a new line of holistic, luxurious wellness trips aimed at the bodies, minds, souls and stomachs of the affluent. Members who sign up for a trip are what Beth McGroarty, director of research at GWI, describes as ‘primary’ wellness travellers – people who travel with an exclusive focus on wellness-centred experiences or destinations. And although this group only makes up 14% of wellness tourism spending – the other 86% comes from ‘secondary’ travellers who incorporate wellness activities into otherwise standard business or leisure trips – their average trip cost is much, much higher. “[Primary] travellers at the domestic level spend about 178% more than your average traveller,” McGroarty says. “And at the international level, they spend 53% more.” For Equinox, moving into tourism means recreating the extravagance of their brand in new locales. And so far, filling spots with willing ‘primary’ travellers has been an easy task. Leah Howe, senior director of Equinox Explore (the brand’s travel line) says that almost 100% of its clubs have expressed interest in attending a trip. Several of the six excursions planned for 2020, each limited to 12 to 20 people, have already sold out. The cheapest of the bunch (a four-day running tour of Florence) starts at $2,350, while the priciest (six days of hiking in Morocco) begins at $6,250. Attendees who can afford the latter will summit Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in the Arab world, alongside two professional trainers, dine on local cuisine and engage in breathing sessions, yoga and hammam treatment. The goal with Explore, Howe says, is for members to return home feeling better than when they left. The attendees are intent on maintaining their focus on health, fitness and luxury even while away. It’s because of their pre-established connection to the brand that they trust Equinox to be the authority in the travel space and beyond, she says. Proven practices? Some might argue that allegiance to particular brands can be far more costly than necessary. Contrary to what some providers might suggest, maintaining wellness can be simple and relatively inexpensive. “The basics of good health are straightforward,” says Margaret McCartney, a Glasgow-based general practitioner and author. “Not smoking, careful with alcohol, diet with fruit, veg and wholegrains, exercise, social connectivity.” The benefits provided by wellness brands can be numerous, but as the industry swells is there a risk we’re being persuaded to spend excessively? That depends, says David Colquhoun, a pharmacologist at University College London and author of science-debunking blog DC’s Improbable Science. “Nobody could possibly be against well-being. It would be like opposing motherhood and apple pie,” he wrote in 2011. “The only question that really matters is, how much of it works?” The high-end wellness tourism sector is a broad spectrum. Offerings from brands like SoulCycle or Equinox revolve around fitness and healthy eating, all wrapped in luxury that allows members to forget about logistics and focus on their betterment. Yet the industry at large also includes companies criticised for promoting scientifically unproven products and practices, like food manufacturers with dodgy interpretations of “natural” foods, “homeopathic” diet products made illegal or “barefoot” running shoes with greater injury risks. Goop, the vastly successful lifestyle brand founded by American actress Gwyneth Paltrow, has received the most scrutiny for its own wellness products, which many say rely on faulty pseudoscience. Most recently, its Netflix programme The Goop Lab – which explores the effectiveness of alternative therapies – was described as a “considerable health risk” by Simon Stevens, chief executive of public body National Health Service England. In January, the company announced it would be taking its own step towards the tourism industry with a debut cruise. Attendees who purchase Suite Class accommodations aboard Celebrity Cruises’ Celebrity Apex ship on 26 August for an 11-night voyage between Spain, France and the Italian Riviera (with a starting price of more than $2,000) will experience one day of Goop-hosted panels, classes and a workout, as well as see Paltrow in person. Kiki Koroshetz, Goop’s wellness director, says she hopes guests might take home “a new perspective on a mental loop that plays regularly in someone’s mind. It might be a tool for managing stress, for having a difficult conversation, for experiencing more joy, for finding connection.” Pseudoscience notwithstanding, if the sign-up sheet follows the lead of previous sold-out Goop events, the initiative will look healthy from the start – demonstrating that for this brand of wellness tourism too, there’s an appetite. “Goop understands this and has built its brand on the foundation of curiosity and non-judgement, and has been incredibly successful in building a community along the way,” says Gabrielle Lieberman, director of trends and social media research at market research company Mintel. “As consumers set out for a more holistic approach to managing their well-being, it makes sense then that they would want this to extend into their travel experiences as well.” Finding your community Whatever the exact content of these wellness trips, those within the industry agree that the sense of community attendees experience is a key takeaway. McGroarty says reserving a spot on a branded trip can feel like buying into a tribe. Dedicating the time, resources and energy to a multi-day trip is a serious commitment, even for those who can afford it, and ensures you will be surrounded by people who share your sensibilities. According to Howe of Equinox, this connection inspires a certain feeling that can’t be found exercising or meditating by yourself. The concept, first coined by French sociologist Émile Durkheim in 1912, is called “collective effervescence”, and refers to the way communal gatherings can intensify the experience of the group. The intoxication of shared activities, such as a yoga class or group hike, can enhance the emotional quality and create deep bonds between the actors, Durkheim surmised. Despite their differences, both Equinox and Goop understand this idea, and accordingly advertise it as a centrepiece for travellers. “The communal aspect is key,” agrees André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at City University London and co-author of The Wellness Syndrome. In addition to positive feelings in the moment, he says these trips can act as temporary replacements for the many communities that have been undermined over recent decades. “These include local communities, religions, families and so on.” Wellness trips provide a brief antidote to the competition people face in their everyday lives and a chance to enjoy likeminded company, he says. For some, luxury retreats may also inspire the same brag-worthy feeling of sitting at a VIP table, a welcome addition to their other benefits. McGroarty acknowledges that proper scrutiny of the various wellness offerings is healthy for the growth of the market. But both she and Dimon agree that if momentum keeps up, and consumers continue to be proactive about their health and stay across available options, wellness tourism will be valued at $1tn in no time. The big brands spearheading new initiatives within it will certainly seek to expand, perhaps tilting the scale more towards ‘primary’ travellers as time goes on. Dimon believes that a wellness trip may even become an annual event that individuals undertake for the betterment of body, mind and spirit. And that might make the experience more accessible, as lower-cost providers enter the market or tourism providers pivot towards the wellness space. Three quarters of American adults report that they are actively seeking ways to improve their health, Lieberman says. “While for most people this may mean incremental changes in how they manage their health, luxury experiences like these allow us to see what all is possible in pushing the limits. “You’ll see these wellness retreats become even less of a novelty and integrated more naturally into everyday experiences,” she says. “Accessibility is key here, in that managing your health shouldn’t feel out of reach.” Photo courtesy of Waldhotel."
risk appetite,The rise of 'overemployed' workers,2024-09-15,2021-09-29,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210927-the-overemployed-workers-juggling-remote-jobs,"Now out of the daily eye of managers, people are taking on additional, secret jobs. What could go wrong? Two corporate email addresses, two computers, two bosses? As many knowledge workers have been remote for nearly two years, out of their manager’s line of vision, an increasing number of people are quietly taking on second full-time positions. Home-based set-ups have enabled workers to secretly do two remote jobs at once – and some workers are banking hundreds of thousands of extra dollars per year. An extra job can become a safety net of extra income and experience – useful tools in an age of mass redundancies, economic uncertainty and continually deprioritised worker wellbeing. Yet taking on an extra full-time job is a bold choice that requires stealth and an appetite for risk. Some workers who are taking the leap into overemployment do so to take back a sense of control, or to game a system they believe has exploited them for too long. Working the system It’s not uncommon to hear of workers pursuing side hustles while they work in full-time jobs: selling jewellery on Etsy, driving an Uber during after hours, assembling furniture at weekends with TaskRabbit. But 'overemployment’ is different: an employee could hold simultaneous, separate full-time jobs, completed on different computers.   Overemployment is not an entirely new phenomenon. It’s been an “open secret” in the tech industry for years, says an overemployed worker in his late 30s in the US Bay Area who goes by ‘Isaac’ in the overemployment community. He’s been working two jobs for years, and says he makes more than $600,000 doing it. In April 2021, Isaac launched Overemployed, a website with articles about how to navigate holding down multiple remote jobs. (The number one rule? Don’t talk about holding down multiple remote jobs.) He says that for the past 20 years, some workers have exploited pockets in the tech industry that were remote-friendly long before the pandemic. But now, as more workers across fields all over the world have been given the opportunity to work from home, anecdotal evidence suggests more people are exploring the overemployment lifestyle. Isaac says users of his site live all over the world and “run the gamut” of ages, from those 60-plus to people in their 20s, just starting out (who may even “double intern” and hold two remote internships). But he says most users tend to be in the 35-to-40 age range, who “have a lot of experience already and are a little jaded by the corporate world”. Generally, both before the pandemic and during it, Isaac says it’s rare to hear of anybody getting caught; usually it’s a matter of the individual being sloppy in keeping the two jobs separate, although he’s heard of an instance in which spyware caught a programmer running a script he wasn’t supposed to be running on his primary job’s computer – that person got fired. Isaac maintains overemployment doesn’t necessarily mean working extra-long days – workers can put in 30 hours a week at their primary job, for example, and then use the time that would’ve otherwise been filled by non-mandatory meetings or cyberloafing for their second job. Of course, overemployment is legally tricky: whether it’s possible depends on what kind of contract a worker signed when they were hired at their primary job, and if they’re breaking any non-compete agreements. And unsurprisingly, it’s extremely controversial, or even seen as unethical; contractual obligations aside, workers are essentially lying (by omission or otherwise) to their ‘main’ employer. News outlets have called this kind of ‘business bigamy’ dishonest and wrong when readers have written in asking for advice as to whether they should ‘out’ overemployed colleagues at work. But for those who can make the arrangement work – both legally and logistically – Isaac argues overemployed workers stand to gain a lot.  ‘A moment of reckoning’ Unsurprisingly, Isaac says one reason workers take on a second, secret full-time job is to diversify sources of cash flow and make money in more efficient ways. But he believes money isn’t the entire driver.  Catherine Chandler-Crichlow, executive director for career management at Ivey Business School at Western University in Ontario, Canada, agrees, saying the framing of overemployed workers “surreptitiously trying to make more money” isn’t necessarily correct. “As we have been forced to work from home, people have probably started looking at, ‘where can my skill set be truly optimised?, ‘What are some of the things that I have a real passion for – and how might I use those skills differently?’,” she says. Chandler-Crichlow, who specialises in studying human capital – the skills, expertise and knowledge workers bring to their jobs – says that this concept is especially germane to the discussion of overemployment. For example, there may be someone who has a primary job of being a financial analyst, but they also enjoy something else, like coding or writing. The current widespread remote working situation allows that analyst to find a job coding or writing, and to put those skills to use.   “I now become the master of what I would like to do and where I would like to spend my time,” says Chandler-Crichlow. She says that for workers in lower socio-economic groups, holding down multiple jobs is a means of survival. But what’s different here is that “professionals who could be described as highly skilled are taking greater ownership of their careers”. Erin Hatton, associate professor of sociology who studies work and labour at the University at Buffalo in New York, US, agrees. “Maybe [workers are] trying new things. I think this is a moment of reckoning with the world of work, and thinking about what role work plays in our lives,” says Hatton. Overemployment can “free people to maybe try on other jobs for size; maybe take on extra work that may not pay well, but may be more meaningful to them.” So, it’s no coincidence that more people are trying this out in recent months. “I think the pandemic may have pushed people to do more of that deep thought and what it is they’re spending their lives doing, and deciding I could probably do more with my life,” says Chandler-Crichlow. By pursuing overemployment more workers seem to be saying to themselves, she says: “’Yes, I want to really utilise the skills and capabilities I have. And if someone wants to pay me – I’ll do it.’” Railing against employers The fact that people are turning to overemployment also signals important systemic workplace issues. For a long time, many workers have felt like their jobs are unfulfilling or meaningless – leading to problems like burnout and boreout – and that they’re constantly chasing success within a system that gives managers a disproportionate amount of power within the working relationship. That may be one of the reasons overemployment has become more popular, experts say. So if managers don’t realise workers are doing this, are they bad managers? “My sense is that they simply do not have systems in place to surveil workers in this way,” says Hatton. “For many lower wage workers, both remote and non-remote, there is plenty of surveillance that effectively disallows this kind of double dipping. Think call centre workers who work remotely but technology monitors the number of calls they take. But for workers who [are] typically in the worksite and are not already punitively surveilled in this way, they just don’t have a system in place to monitor and enforce this.” “How employers respond to this could also vary across of a spectrum of no support at one end,” says Chandler-Crichow, to companies somewhat giving their blessing, “as long as it does not impact your responsibilities at their organisations.” From Isaac’s perspective as an overemployed worker, and based on the activity on his website, one of the reasons people take on secret second jobs is because they feel disillusioned with the realities of corporate life. Some workers believe secret overemployment helps them break free of employers that haven’t given them that promotion or pay rise they’ve been chasing for years. “There’s a sense that our bosses own us a little bit, and I see this as an interesting pushback against that normative sense of ownership,” says Hatton. “It’s expected that we really owe them everything. That we’re theirs. But when push comes to shove, they can fire us tomorrow for no reason at all. This is taking back a little bit of that sense of power.” When Isaac's company was rolling out redundancies during the pandemic, he survived, but emerged with new resolve – he wouldn’t be one of many faceless employees. “You treat me like a number, I’m going to treat you like a number,” he says. So, armed with two separate laptops, he works two separate jobs, plus a part-time gig. He says he’s never been found out or had any close calls. What happens next? Overemployment may be ticking up, but those who go for the secret second job are still in the minority – and the move still carries a lot of risk. Plus, as the increase in overemployment is relatively new, there’s a lot both workers and employers alike don’t yet know. For instance, it’s unclear how companies will respond if they feel vulnerable, or if they realise an employee is breaching the terms of a non-compete contract. Perhaps managers will more closely monitor employees’ social media activity to find something incriminating, or might install software on company machines to detect anything fishy. For now, though, some workers will embrace overemployment – as long as one of their supervisors doesn’t catch them."
risk appetite,Quit — or fight corruption?,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Chana R Schoenberger,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20141031-quit-or-fight-corruption,"Your Question Here Work Ethic is a twice-monthly column on BBC Capital in which we consider the ethical and interpersonal dilemmas that workers face around the world. We welcome knotty questions from readers at workethic@bbc.com.  More Worth Ethic topics: Q: I work for a government-owned enterprise. As a citizen, I feel this company belongs in part to me, and I have a strong desire for it to succeed. However, I see unethical behaviour going on around me. The logical path is to quit, but I don't want to give up on the company. What can I do?  A: This is a patriot’s dilemma: how best to serve your country without becoming a part of actions you don’t condone. As you note, the easiest way to get away from problematic conduct at work is to quit and get another job where you don’t find yourself in troubling situations. But you don’t want to do that, because you feel there’s a higher ethical value in working to build a company on behalf of the country. Refusing to run from the problem is admirable, but solving it can be tough. If you’re staying, you have several options, notes Amy Wrzesniewski, an associate professor of organisational behaviour at the Yale University School of Management. “The most direct path to addressing the unethical behaviour you see is to figure out a way to bring attention to it so that change might happen,” she said by email. Yet doing this without getting fired is easier said than done. Check to see if your country has well-enforced whistleblower protection laws, Wrzesniewski suggests. Within the company, you will have better luck getting your message to the top if you have a sponsor at work, “a personal champion in the system who is willing to support you and back you up as you raise the issues you see,” she said. If you have this legal protection available, and you feel comfortable approaching your sponsor with your concerns, that’s the most direct approach. If not, you’ll have to take the covert route. Wrzesniewski suggests coming up with a new idea for an old problem that could subtly replace corrupt practices. Sometimes, a new approach can be “demonstrably more efficient, simpler, or data-driven, while also being far less open to gaming or unethical behavior,” she said. For instance, if you’re witnessing contracts awarded to the vendor who pays the highest kickbacks, you could suggest moving the bidding and award process to an online system that has greater transparency. Or if you’re seeing discriminatory hiring practices, consider asking if the company can create a database that tracks hiring by applicant characteristics. This would make it clear who’s being hired and why. “By proposing changes that undermine unethical behavior — directly or indirectly — you will learn quickly how interested the company is in changing,” Wrzesniewski said. There is also an opportunity to find like-minded people and institute small changes with them. Some colleagues may think that corruption and government go hand-in-hand. Such attitudes can be deeply ingrained, and you may not be able to change colleagues’ minds. But there are likely a few people who share the same beliefs about civic responsibility within a state-owned enterprise. If you’ve found a compatriot, you can brainstorm ideas for new procedures that cut out the possibility for corruption. The two of you can also look through your networks for potential sponsors to quarterback change; perhaps your partner in crime-fighting has stronger internal relationships than you do. If there’s little appetite for change on either a grassroots or an official level, you are once again faced with the same choice: stick with being an ethical person in an unethical environment, or quit.

risk appetite,Why Clueless is a feminist classic,2024-09-15,2020-07-17,Hanna Flint,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200716-how-clueless-transformed-the-movie-makeover,"Now 25 years old, Amy Heckerling’s teen movie is a classic on many levels – including for how it subverts one of cinema’s most enduringly problematic tropes, writes Hanna Flint. If there is one thing that Cher Horowitz, the heroine of 1990s teen-movie classic Clueless, loves, it’s a makeover. It’s her “main thrill in life,” her best friend Dionne points out, “It gives her a sense of control in a world full of chaos”. But as Cher plans the transformation of new friend Tai from grungy misfit to Beverly Hills princess, she is blissfully unaware that the person getting the real makeover in this movie is herself. More like this: - Why Showgirls is a horror masterpiece - Groundhog Day meets Bridesmaids - Why there’s no sex in Pretty Woman  Makeovers have long been a trope used by Hollywood to give films a clear narrative arc, especially in romantic comedies. The plot device of a character’s aesthetic overhaul helps to push the story forward and make a character seem more desirable, with their romantic lives often improved as a result. But 25 years ago, Clueless writer/director Amy Heckerling flipped this clichéd journey on its head to deliver a witty critique of the consumerist, privileged lifestyle of Los Angeles teens. The 1995 high-school rom-com is, in itself, a ‘makeover-ed’ property. Heckerling had been asked to write a script by 20th Century Fox about youth culture; she agreed (though Paramount would eventually produce it) but wanted to focus on 'the in-crowd.’ In an interview for the original Clueless DVD release, she recalled how, as she drafted a story about what could “go wrong for a girl who always looks through rose-coloured glasses,” she realised she was writing a modern-day version of Jane Austen’s Emma. “Unconsciously I had been writing an Emma character,” Heckerling said, “especially as she makeovers people all the time. She was very manipulative in a nice way; she lived in a fantasy of what could be for everybody else. I tried to take all the things that were in this pretty 1800s world and [imagined] what would that be like if it was Beverly Hills.” Just as Emma Woodhouse takes the unrefined Harriet Smith under her wing, Alicia Silverstone’s queen bee begins moulding Brittany Murphy’s new kid Tai into her image. In a quick montage scene, Tai’s box dyed hair is washed out, make-up applied and her outfit overhauled (to the tune of Jill Sobule’s aptly satirical bop Supermodel) so that she can become polished enough to sit with Cher and Dionne at the top of the social hierarchy. It’s the sort of scene that appeals to audiences, says film studies lecturer Dr Julia Wagner, because it panders to our aspirational appetites. ”The make-up, clothes and hairstyles are easy to come by, and pretty much effortless. The girl sits while other people fuss around her. Movie makeovers play out a wish fulfilment – that we can all, with just a little expertise, transform into a beautiful, confident creature.”   Tai’s confidence certainly improves as she conforms to this idealised image – but the more Cher teaches her how to dress, how to speak, and how to date, the uglier her personality becomes. Our statuesque lead has created a shallow monster and lost control of her. Thus, this vapid version of her friend holds a mirror up to our protagonist and highlights the flaws in her own superficial outlook, which is based on the assumption that everyone should fit into her world and look the part too. Soon enough, the rose-coloured glasses come off, and Cher’s perspective shifts. “I needed a complete makeover,” she says, “except this time I’d makeover my soul.” Cher begins the film already looking like an ‘after’ photo, so her transformation comes from popping the bubble of her privileged lifestyle. She participates in her teacher’s charity drive, gives away lots of her material possessions, and becomes friends with peers, like stoner Travis, who she had previously excluded. On top of that, realising that her love interest Josh is attracted to brains as much as beauty, she starts watching the news, and helping with her dad’s legal work. Clueless is a movie that cunningly subverts the movie makeover to show how attractiveness is not only predicated on how conventionally good looking you are on the outside, but how good a person you are on the inside too. Though, it should also be noted, the film doesn’t say that wanting to look glamorous is a bad thing; come the end, Cher is still wearing designer outfits. Similarly, Legally Blonde (2001) allows its bombshell lead Elle Woods to retain her hyper-feminine style, even as she goes through an intellectual transformation while studying at Harvard Law School. A sexist transformation  The flipside to this kind of evolution, however, is the more hackneyed one that suggests a woman is only valuable in as much as she conforms to societal beauty standards. Think of Ally Sheedy’s ‘Basketcase’ Allison being made over to look more like Molly Ringwald’s ‘Princess’ in The Breakfast Club (1985), or Sandy getting sexed up at the end of Grease (1978). That’s when the trope becomes problematic. “I think the main problem is perhaps in the result of the makeovers, which almost always shows a standard and narrow idea of beauty,” Wagner suggests. “No one ends up with frizzier hair after a movie makeover.” In their book The Makeover in Movies: Before and After in Hollywood Films, 1941-2002, Elizabeth A Ford and Deborah C Mitchell assert that 1942’s Now, Voyager, “established the ground rules for the makeover genre,” through the metamorphosis of Bette Davis’s depressed and dowdy spinster into a beautiful and confident heiress. “Change of appearance parallels change of fortune for heroine Charlotte Vale,” the authors write, noting that the physical traits of Charlotte’s ‘before’ appearance – no make-up, frumpy clothes, bushy eyebrows, heavy dark hair and glasses – have often been replicated in makeover movies, to varying degrees, ever since.   Half a century later, for example, two teen films featured heroines who could have been reincarnations of Catherine in the similarities of their pre-makeover appearance. Like Catherine, too, both Mia from The Princess Diaries (2001) and Laney Boggs from She’s All That (1999)  become more socially acceptable once they are beautified  – She’s All That even mimics Now, Voyager’s camera shot of a pan from the shoe up show the makeover results – while also retaining some sense of autonomy by the film’s end. An imbalance of power However, there is an awkward power dynamic at play in both films, which is pretty typical of the makeover movie. The Princess Diaries sees a queen force her civilian-raised granddaughter to change her looks and behaviours in order to fit in with the elite circles of her birthright. She’s All That takes its cues from My Fair Lady by seeing a rich popular jock transform a less wealthy art nerd into a prom queen for a bet. “At the heart of many movie makeovers, the powerless are physically manipulated by the powerful characters,” Wagner explains. “The ostensible aim is the made-over person’s sexual and social empowerment, but it is of benefit to the (initially) more powerful characters.” It’s even more problematic when a man is in charge of a woman’s makeover. In Miss Congeniality (2000), domineering pageant coach Victor Melling and FBI agent Eric Matthews are in charge of Gracie Hart’s transformation from ungroomed cop to beauty queen, while in Up  Close and Personal (1996), news director Warren Justice (Robert Redford) controls and refines the career of younger reporter Tally (Michelle Pfeiffer) for network TV, and becomes more attracted to her as she changes. Pretty Woman (1990) sees Richard Gere’s millionaire Edward buy Julia Roberts’s sex worker Vivian for a week to play the role of his girlfriend. He orchestrates her style and etiquette transformation so that she can be elevated to his social milieu and fit in with his life, sacrificing her own in the process. As in Pretty Woman, class mobility has also long been a key aspect of the makeover trope, ever since Cinderella had to dress the part of a princess in order to land Prince Charming. However not every female protagonist’s transformation means turning their back on their former life. In The Hunger Games (2012), Katniss Everdeen retains her working-class, District 12 identity despite the makeover she is forced to have upon arrival in the elite Capitol. Maid in Manhattan (2002) and Working Girl (1988) see two women from working-class backgrounds find their happily ever after with wealthier men after a makeover, but they are both still working by the movie’s end. Crucially, they are also in charge of their own beauty transformations – something that Wagner believes makes them far more feminist. “I’d like to see more films where a woman chooses to have a makeover, rather than have it done to her,” she says. “Not for her wedding or a date with a man who’s deemed out of the plain girl’s league.”   Is a makeover ever truly empowering? Last year’s comedy-drama Brittany Runs a Marathon fits this bill as it sees the titular Millennial choosing to transform her lifestyle not for a love interest, but after learning that her health is at risk. Brittany goes from a slobby, overweight slacker who can barely run around her block to a slimmed-down (though not size zero) seasoned runner, whose commitment to her fitness has led to improvements in nearly every aspect of her life. “I love putting out the message of body positivity and I think it’s time we celebrate the way we look,” star Jillian Bell said to me, championing the film’s importance, when I spoke to her for its release. “How many years have we been told that this one size and this one look is the right size and look? I’m just tired of it.” But even a seemingly self-empowered makeover like this can be questionable: some criticised Brittany Runs a Marathon’s ‘fitspo’ narrative for still perpetuating fat-shaming, while erasing the experience of plus-size runners. “The story we’re too often told about fatness and running is that body size is an obstacle to overcome in our quest for glory,” writes Kate Brown in an article about the film for Runner’s World. “You may start out fat, slow, sweaty, and out of breath, but stick with it long enough and you’ll become a svelte, glowing running machine.” It’s the teen-movie genre that continues to provide the smartest makeover takes, with recent films like Booksmart and Dumplin’ following Clueless in subverting the trope, and rejecting its most clichéd aspects. In the former, the lead duo’s dress-up montage ends with them looking the same but in matching blue jumpsuits, while the latter sees a diverse range of girls and non-binary contestants enter a beauty pageant without needing to conform to antiquated beauty standards in order to compete. In fact, the only transformation that plus-sized protagonist Willowdean goes through is similar to Cher Horowitz: a makeover of the soul that sees her gain confidence and reconnect with her mother. But while the cinematic makeover has gone through plenty of iterations over the years, in line with the broadening range of women’s stories on screen, what about men? The superhero genre is certainly full of makeovers: Steve Rogers' transformation in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is an iconic moment. And in the past, male-led rom-coms like Can’t Buy Me Love (1987), Crazy, Stupid Love (2011) and Hitch (2005), have used the plot device – though the latter two films see makeovers orchestrated by men who also teach their male students to use misogynistic ways to manipulate women into either sleeping or falling in love with them. However, in general, male makeovers have not featured anywhere near as prominently in popular culture as female ones. Wagner hopes that will change. “I’d like to see more men undergo makeovers in films – and not just Clark Kent taking off his glasses.” She points to the success of Queer Eye, Netflix’s hit reboot of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, as an example of how the male makeover can make for rewarding material. “[The show’s] success proves that men can gain a lot from a makeover, so the man’s makeover should also make its way into the movies.” Love film and TV?

risk appetite,Where does the red carpet come from?,2024-09-15,2016-02-22,Lindsay Baker,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160222-where-does-the-red-carpet-come-from,"The crimson path that Oscar nominees tread dates back at least 2,500 years. How did it become the ultimate signifier of celebrity? Lindsay Baker investigates. It denotes stratospheric status, style and opulence. It conjures up glitz and glamour. It is the focus of the contemporary Oscars experience and the mainstay of today’s awards ceremonies, gala events and premieres around the world. The iconic red carpet sets the movie stars who step on it apart from us mere mortals. It was ever thus. In its earliest known incarnation the red carpet was not intended for ordinary folk. A path of dark red tapestries was rolled out in ancient Greece, in the Aeschylus play Agamemnon, when the King’s vengeful wife Clytemnestra prepares for the triumphant welcome home of her husband from the Trojan War. Even the King hesitates to walk on the “crimson path” laid before him, because he is “a mortal, a man” and not a god. “I cannot trample upon these tinted splendours without fear thrown in my path,” he says – and indeed he comes to a sorry end soon after setting foot on it. “It’s interesting that the red carpet has become synonymous with movie stars who in a sense have become the royalty of today,” Sonnet Stanfill, senior curator at the Victoria & Albert Museum, tells BBC Culture. “The evolution of the picture house in the second half of the 20th Century made them the palaces of the people. There’s a certain synergy about the red carpet – that was traditionally to welcome royalty – now welcoming film royalty.” In Renaissance art, red carpets and rugs appeared frequently, usually Oriental and intricately patterned in style, and were seen in paintings of deities, saints and royalty. Why was that? “Red as a colour has long been associated with prestige, royalty and aristocracy,” says Stanfill. “Scarlet was among the most prized dyes as it was the most difficult to make and the most expensive.” Cochineal or carmine dye was – and still is – made from the cochineal scale insect and was used in the 15th Century by the Aztec and Maya people in north and central America for colouring fabrics. By the 17th Century cochineal dye was a hugely valued export. A scarlet-hued carpet continued to denote high status, and in Georgetown, South Carolina, in 1821, the arrival of US president James Monroe was marked by the laying out of a red carpet to welcome him ashore from a riverboat.  The red carpet has since become a standard addition to high-profile events involving political dignitaries. The origin of the phrase ‘red carpet treatment’, meanwhile, is thought to derive from the start of the 20th Century, when the red carpet was co-opted by the railroads. An exclusive, express passenger train run by the New York Central Railroad from 1902 welcomed its passengers aboard with a red carpet, which also helped guide them onto the train. Smile for the camera It wasn’t until the1920s that the red carpet and Hollywood became truly synonymous. In 1922 a long, crimson-hued carpet was unfurled in front of the Egyptian Theatre for the Hollywood premiere of Robin Hood, starring Douglas Fairbanks. And in the decades that ensued, the red carpet was one of the few places where the public could catch a glimpse of charismatic stars like Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. Then, in 1961 the red carpet was introduced at the Academy Awards at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. A few years later, the broadcasters of the ceremony opted to film outside the venue, showing the arrival of guests as they stepped out of their limousines. From this point in 1964 the red carpet became a globally acknowledged focal point for actors and actresses to make a grand entrance and showcase themselves at the Oscars. Showmanship, after all, is the essence of the Hollywood red carpet, and the red carpet appearances that have gone down in history tend to be the unique moments of bold, peacockish display and swagger – confident, flamboyant, provocative and individualistic. Barbra Streisand’s sequined, see-through Scaasi trouser suit worn in 1969 generated as many headlines as her Best Actress Oscar for Funny Girl. The turbulent dynamic between movie-star couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was played out on the red carpet at the 1970 Academy Awards, when Taylor’s deeply glamorous and revealing violet dress and diamond necklace upstaged her husband’s Academy Award nomination. In 1978 Diane Keaton accepted her Best Actress Oscar for Annie Hall in a ‘statement’ menswear-inspired suit. And then of course there is Cher, whose unique red-carpet outfits have included a feathered headdress and – for her 1988 Moonstruck Oscar victory – a barely-there, black lace Bob Mackie number. The red carpet can be career defining, too – in Britain, actress Elizabeth Hurley sprang into the public consciousness overnight by donning a dramatic Versace dress to a premiere that she attended with Hugh Grant. The dress, which appeared to be held together by giant safety pins, came to be known as ‘That dress’. It was a deliberately sexy, edgy choice of dress, and was subsequently featured in the V&A’s Versace exhibition. “It was very Versace and very provocative,” says curator Stanfill. “She was making a display, and there was a sense of showmanship about it. In that sense she was a descendent of Streisand and Cher.” By the 1990s fashion and the movies were becoming inextricable, and the red carpet was the place they came together. Certain designers dominated, and Valentino and Giorgio Armani became particularly known for their red-carpet flair. In 1997 Nicole Kidman upped the game, wearing a green Dior gown that was the first bona fide couture dress to be seen on the red carpet. In the early ‘00s Renee Zellwegger and Julia Roberts were among a handful of stars to rebel and wear vintage dresses on the red carpet, while the Icelandic singer and actress Björk went one step further in her memorable Marjan Pejoski swan ensemble. Who are you wearing? Today, the Oscar red carpet is a massive 16,500 sq ft, takes two days to install, and is the focus of an ever more fearsome media frenzy each year. There is a new intensity of scrutiny and criticism – thanks in part to the unforgiving GlamCam360 and ManiCam. Most of the big designers are now creating special red-carpet lines. ‘Pay-to-wear’ deals with designers are commonplace, as are powerful red-carpet stylists. Perhaps for these reasons, actresses are increasingly playing safe with feminine, sure-fire flattering options. And there is a certain symmetry in the recent proliferation of the pastel, princessy gown on the crimson carpet – as if the red carpet is going back to its royal roots, laying a path for contemporary fairytale princesses. This is after all Tinseltown, a place of fantasy and escape. Still, the likes of Tilda Swinton and other fashion-savvy stars know how to break the rules in inimitable style. And last year’s Twitter ‘ask her more’ campaign showed there is appetite for unpredictability. It would be nice to think that there is still space on the red carpet for real boundary breaking, and that some brave soul might take a risk, take it that one step further – wear a swan around their neck, say, and lay some giant ostrich eggs on the hallowed red carpet. After all, at the time it happened Björk may have topped the dreaded worst-dressed lists, but 15 years on, the wild-and-wonderful swan dress was exhibited at MoMA, and Björk’s bonkers, egg-laying moment has gone down in Oscars red-carpet history.

risk appetite,The town at the centre of the world,2024-09-15,2019-01-02,Anne Burke,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20190101-a-strange-museum-at-the-centre-of-the-world,"Thirty years ago, Jacques-André Istel decided to move to the desert and think of something to do. Since then, he has constructed a museum intended to last until the year 6000. Around 30 years ago, Jacques-André Istel turned to his wife, Felicia Lee, and said, “We’re going to sit in the desert and think of something to do.” Hardly an enticing proposition, but by then, Lee was surely used to her husband’s hare-brained schemes. In 1971, at great risk to himself and his then bride-to-be, Istel piloted the couple on a round-the-world flight in a tiny, twin-engine plane that had hardly the oomph of a Chevrolet automobile. Before that, there was the whole business of convincing people to jump out of planes: in the 1950s, after returning home from the Korean War, where he served with the US Marines, Istel developed parachuting equipment and techniques that made it possible for the average Joe to leap out of an airplane at 2,500ft and land as if having tumbled from a 4ft bookcase. Soon, Americans by the thousands were enjoying the latest craze: skydiving. Lee was a reporter for Sports Illustrated– she met Istel, by then known as ‘the father of American sport parachuting’, during an interview for a piece in the magazine – and had her own taste for adventure. “If I told her tomorrow we were going to Mars, she would say, ‘What do I pack?’,” Istel said. You may also be interested in: • A museum measured in millimetres • A largely unsung piece of Americana • Why this US city is so absurd And so, in the 1980s, the couple moved to the far south-east corner of California, a few miles west of Yuma, Arizona, off Interstate 8, where Istel had acquired a 2,600-acre parcel of land several decades earlier. Apart from a good aquifer, this particular patch of the Sonoran Desert had little to recommend it. But “we realised that we loved it – the calm, the beauty,” Istel said. With nothing much around apart from an RV park and some impressively tall sand dunes, the couple’s desert refuge was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. So it made sense, at least in Istel’s fervid imagination, to put it in the middle of somewhere. In 1985, the French-born parachuting pioneer cajoled California’s Imperial County Board of Supervisors into designating a spot on his property as The Official Centre of the World. (Audacious, perhaps, but not necessarily inaccurate, given that anywhere on the Earth’s surface could be the centre.) A landmark of such importance needed a town of its own. The following year, Istel created Felicity, which now boasts about 15 residents and its own freeway sign. Facing no opposition, Istel got himself elected mayor that same year – apparently for life. But Istel wasn’t done with his Xanadu in the desert. He had an idea to build a granite monument with inscriptions honouring people and places important in his life – fellow parachutists, his alma mater (Princeton University in New Jersey), and his family, who had fled France during World War Two and settled in New York. His father, André, had been an advisor to Charles de Gaulle, and his mother, Yvonne, was a wartime volunteer. Istel didn’t want just any monument. It had to be magnificent and, more importantly, it had to be something that would last far, far into the future. He hired structural engineers who came up with a design for an elongated, granite triangle that just might – “short of the planet blowing up,” Istel said – survive to the year 6000. The triangular monument went up in 1991; it was 100ft long, about 4.5ft high, and faced with some 60 panels of polished, red granite. The durability came from what was inside: steel-reinforced concrete sunk into trenches 3ft deep. Istel then decided he would build another monument, this one to honour US marines who fought and died in the Korean War. Then came a third monument, and a fourth, and a fifth. Today, 20 granite monuments, arranged at artful angles across the desert floor, collectively make up The Museum of History in Granite, a sort of open-air bank of knowledge for the ages. As a visitor posted on TripAdvisor, the museum is where “Martians will come to learn about humanity”. Istel has engraved his stone triangles with tidy distillations of much of what we know about the world, from the Big Bang to former US president Barack Obama. Visitors – and they come by the thousands each year – learn about Hinduism, the eruption of Vesuvius, the Zapotecs of central Mexico, Buddhism, the birth of Jesus, Attila the Hun, Pythagoras' theorem, the behaviour of the walrus, Greek philosophy, the Gettysburg Address, the Moon landing and terrorism in contemporary times. Despite his Ivy League background, Istel believes strongly that self-acquired knowledge “is probably the best form of education”. The idea behind these thumbnail sketches of history is to offer just enough information to whet the reader’s appetite. Most topics – even big ones – get at most a couple hundred words. Lee handles most of the research, using reputable publishers like Oxford, Britannica and Larousse. Istel writes the text, then he and Lee go back and forth on the wording before settling on a final version. An entry titled ‘Interesting Times’ went through 59 drafts. Once the text is ready, professional engravers get to work, often toiling in the glow of lamplight under a night sky to escape the brutal desert heat. To accompany the text, artists etch illustrations into the hard stone panels. The museum can’t cover everything, so “you pick and choose things that are interesting,” Istel said. He often groups related items into a single theme. The Code of Hammurabi and the Ten Commandments appear under ‘Early Concepts of Law’. The American concept of ‘Manifest Destiny’ is mentioned on a panel called ‘Exploring and Expanding’, along with the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Some topics are of personal interest to Istel – parachuting gets ample space – while other topics come as suggestions from others. Lee came up with the idea for a panel on the ‘Great Seal of the United States’, the US’ official coat of arms. Some of the inscriptions are amusing, if little more. For example, in 1809, US president James Madison proposed a cabinet post of Secretary of Beer. Hamburgers “account for nearly 60% of all sandwiches eaten”. The grizzly in California’s original Bear Republic flag “looked more like a pig than a bear”. The typical Wild West cowboy was “frequently hundreds of miles from the nearest bar or woman”. The TV mute button, which Istel considers “one of the world’s great inventions”, gets a mention. Istel aims for objectivity and is a stickler for accuracy. But given that even reputable sources will disagree on certain points, it’s a difficult challenge. “The answer is, you do the best you can,” Istel said. The museum’s official season runs during the cooler months. From the day after Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November) through the end of March, visitors can join a 15-minute tour led by a volunteer docent, watch a short video about the museum or grab a bite at the small restaurant. During the rest of the year, the museum is open, but only for self-guided tours. Istel’s property is also dotted with pieces of art and architecture that seemingly have little to do with anything, but add a bit of absurdist fun. A 25ft section of the original spiral staircase from the Eiffel Tower rises incongruously into the desert sky. A bronze sculptural replica of Michelangelo’s ‘Arm of God’, from the painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, acts as the gnomon of a sundial. There is also a hollow, 21ft pink-granite pyramid, inside which is a metal plaque that marks the centre of the world. A $2 fee, on top of the museum’s regular admission of $3 per person, entitles visitors to a certificate attesting to having stood on the exact spot. The tallest and most striking element on the property is a little white chapel that sits poetically atop a 35ft earthen hill. Istel is not particularly religious, but he thought it fitting to install the chapel if for no other reason than to “keep us on our good behaviour”. Istel and Lee live alongside the museum in a lovely, light-filled house with big windows that look out on chocolate-coloured mountains. There’s a library stocked with leather-bound volumes and a piano that Lee plays. Istel serves guests fizzy water – wine if they prefer – in crystal glasses. Istel has made plans in his estate for the museum and all that surrounds it. Yet – as he approaches his 90th birthday – he has no plans of slowing down. The museum is far from complete. Dozens of blank granite panels await text and illustrations. There is also a new freeway sign to be installed, and the never-ending task of keeping up with online reviews. Istel responds to each – even the mean ones – with unfailing politeness. If residents of other worlds do indeed visit the museum one day, Istel would not be particularly surprised. He believes that humans will one day colonise other planets and eventually stars, so it’s not inconceivable that they could, at some point, return to Earth. One granite panel bears a big question mark, along with this inscription: “May distant descendants, perhaps far from planet Earth, view our collective history with understanding and affection.” Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

risk appetite,The world’s most exclusive travel club?,2024-09-15,2020-08-18,Jack Palfrey,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200817-is-this-the-worlds-most-exclusive-travel-club,"Counting only six members and boasting an initiation that takes at least a year to complete, the World Runners Club is probably the most exclusive travel club in existence. Jesper Olsen was just two days into his inaugural attempt to run around the world when he found himself on the verge of quitting. The Dane was camping in a sodden field on the outskirts of the English port of Dover, having started his audacious overland odyssey with Russian companion Alexander Korotkov in London on 1 January 2004. During an unexpectedly eventful opening 48 hours, Olsen and Korotkov had endured a restless night in a leaking tent, a dressing down from police for jogging on the side of the M2 motorway, and several punctures to the wheels of the repurposed baby stroller the pair was using to carry their camping and food supplies. But it was the feeling of fatigue that was really getting Olsen down. “We were cold, wet and we just couldn’t understand how it was taking us eight or nine hours [rather than the planned five to six hours] to run just 40km each day,” Olsen said. “We were tired like you wouldn’t imagine.” But, thankfully, that evening Olsen made a discovery that all but saved the fledgling venture. “We’d forgotten UK road signs use miles [unlike the rest of Europe]. We’d been running 40 miles [roughly 60km] each day, not 40km,” he said. “Things started to get a lot easier from then on.” After a further 26,000km or so, which included Korotkov calling it a day somewhere in Siberia due to injury and a particularly harrowing encounter with a “dinner-plate-sized” spider in the Australian outback, Olsen arrived back in London 22 months later, having successfully run around the world. Not content at that landmark achievement, he repeated the feat three years later, this time traversing the planet north to south. It was after this journey, upon returning to his native Denmark, that Olsen co-founded the World Runners Club; a curious coterie that remains arguably the most exclusive travel club in existence, and certainly the hardest to join. The club grew as an arm of the World Runners Association (WRA), a small-scale operation that functions as a de facto governing body of the extremely niche sport of world running (that is, running around the planet). Its website, overseen by president Phil Essam, documents an official ruleset for the sport, along with other useful resources for enthusiasts. To be eligible to gain membership to the World Runners Club, you have to have completed a fully documented run around the Earth – but it’s not quite as straightforward as that. “You have to cross four continents from one major ocean to another; cover [at least] 26,232km in total; pass through antipodal (opposite) points of the Earth; and start and finish at the same point. They’re the main rules,” explained Tom Denniss, who co-founded the club with Olsen after completing his own world circumnavigation between 2011 and 2013. You may also be interested in:  • From Africa to tea with the Queen  • A town that sold mountains to the world  • A crazy sport created by isolation There is no time limit for would-be members to complete the mammoth feat (so long as it is undertaken in one continuous journey), but athletes have to actively run (as opposed to walk) more than half of the total distance covered to qualify. Currently the World Runners Club only has six members: Olsen, Denniss, Kevin Carr, Serge Girard, Tony Mangan and Rosie Swale Pope, who holds honorary membership due to her run taking place before the official ruleset was agreed upon. Olsen admits the group, which spans several time zones and has only managed to get together in person once (in Florida for a marathon, naturally), is quite an unconventional bunch. “My friends would say it is probably one of the most eccentric selections of people that you can find,” he said. There is certainly a touch of the whimsical about the World Runners Club, but in reality, the quirky travel style that the group champions couldn’t be more intrinsically human. Circumnavigating the globe has long captivated our collective imagination, with the first reputed attempt to traverse the world on foot, according to Guinness World Records, dating as far back as 1897. For thousands of years before that, pilgrims – perhaps the original world travellers – wandered across vast deserts and along meandering country-spanning pathways in search of enlightenment. And it seems the philosophical aspect of traversing our home planet on two feet still forms a large part of the enjoyment for world runners today. “When you’re running, you get to experience the world as it is, in a scale of one to one,” said Olsen. “If you go by train, then Siberia feels fairly long, it takes maybe a week [to cross], but that’s not how long Siberia is. Siberia takes seven and a half months to run across.” Both Olsen and Denniss also cite the luxury of time afforded and freedom from modern routines (namely, “meetings, television and Facebook”) as other positives of this travel style, along with the genuine interactions with local people that come about when you jog into their town or village. “You tend to visit places normal tourists would just be passing through on a freeway,” said Denniss, “But when you’re out running you see, hear and smell everything about a place.” Intriguingly, it might be a very modern problem that could rekindle an appetite for this primordial style of travel. With coronavirus wreaking havoc on established tourist infrastructure – and a lingering anxiety around large crowds – more people may be tempted to shun the busy beachside holiday resort for a sturdy pair of hiking boots or running shoes, with camping gear in tow. Such a trend would be welcomed by Dr Kathleen Martin Ginis, a professor in the School of Health and Exercise Sciences at the University of British Columbia and co-author of The Psychology of Exercise. While running or walking holidays may be embraced by travellers as a novel way to see lesser-visited parts of the world, Dr Martin Ginis notes the importance of exercise on our mental wellbeing and the beneficial role active holidays can play in forming healthy habits. “Routine exercise can reduce the risk for, and the symptoms of, depression and anxiety. It can also improve self-perceptions (body image, self-esteem), cognitive functioning and mood, and reduce stress,” she said. “For people who can’t manage to fit exercise into their usual schedules, an active holiday is a way to kick-start better exercise habits when they get home,” Dr Martin Ginis added. Whether or not the enduring impacts of coronavirus has us all boldly heading out into the wilderness for holidays in future, the members of the World Runners Club are certain their small band of adventurous athletes will not remain so exclusive for long. “It’s going to get bigger,” Denniss said. “Increasingly people are contacting [the WRA] for advice and guidance.” According to Denniss, at least two athletes (an English man and French woman) are in the process of conducting a world run in accordance with the rules set out by the WRA, with a handful more actively planning attempts. So, what’s the current advice for anyone thinking of joining this exclusive club? “Prepare well. And do it. You won’t regret it,” said Olsen. “But remember, the UK uses miles not kilometres.

risk appetite,Dark underbelly of a Chinese obsession,2024-09-15,2016-05-19,Tim McDonald,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160511-why-this-green-stone-can-be-worth-more-than-gold,"China’s appetite for jade has grown as the country has become wealthier. But while the top end seems glamorous, there’s a dirty underbelly to the industry. During the Han dynasty, the wealthiest Chinese noblemen were sometimes buried in jade suits made from hundreds of small jade tiles linked together, sometimes with gold thread. It was a lavish display of status. But it also suggested that jade offered protection from physical decay. And for centuries since, there has been a deep connection between Chinese culture and the smooth green stone.   “Jade usually represents good health and long life for Chinese people,” according to Kent Wong, managing director of Hong Kong luxury jeweller Chow Tai Fook. Jade suits are no longer in fashion, but China’s appetite for the stone has grown as the country has become wealthier. Credit Suisse says there are now 109 million middle class people in China collectively holding $7.3tn in financial assets and real estate. More than two million Chinese are millionaires. With figures like that it’s no wonder more Chinese are buying luxury products like jade, which has in recent years experienced double-digit growth, Wong said. Demand for jade is driven almost entirely by the Chinese market. At the top end, it can be worth more than gold.  In fact, it’s so valuable, that criminals half a world away are taking notice. A gang in the UK was recently sentenced to prison for plundering jade artefacts from museums and an auction house. The artefacts were estimated to be worth up to $79m on the Chinese auction market, although criminal blundering ensured they never got there. Why is it so valuable? Jade is in fact a catch-all title for two chemically different substances that are physically similar. Jadeite, which comes exclusively from Burma, is by most accounts the more prized of the two. But nephrite, which traditionally comes from western China, was in use long before jadeite became popular. Older Chinese nephrite pieces sometimes command huge figures at auction. Bonhams auction house in Hong Kong recently sold a collection of historical jade items for $23m, dating from as early as the Neolithic period. It’s a big number, but it’s not investors who are buying. “In my experience, nobody treats Chinese archaic jade as an investment vehicle. It’s a highly specialised, highly scholarly, very narrow sector of the collectors’ market,” said Colin Sheaf, the head of Asian art at Bonhams.  Investors typically seek out something with broader appeal. Often that means jadeite jewellery. Art deco pieces are particularly prized. Last October, Sotheby’s Hong Kong sold an art deco jadeite brooch by Cartier for $930,000. The deputy chairman of Sotheby’s Asia, Quek Chin Yeow, thinks there’s money to be made at the top end of the market, but only if you know what you’re buying. “Like all investment possibilities, you have to select the right pieces,” he said. What to look for Picking a winner can be tricky, though, because every piece of jade is different, and figuring out what each one is worth is an art rather than a science. There are labs that can determine the chemical makeup of the stone, and whether it’s chemically treated or if it’s an outright fake. But there’s no “jade index” that gives a price per ounce like there is for gold. Colour is often the first thing buyers look for. Jade is almost synonymous with green, and bright emerald shades of the colour are still the most prized. But jade comes in many hues, ranging from blue to lavender to “icy” white, which has increased significantly in price in recent years. Buyers also look for size, shape, transparency, texture and craftsmanship. A jade bangle, for instance, is often a good investment because it can only be made with high-quality material, according to Wong. And as with anything, the higher the quality, the higher the value. With jade, auction sale records often provide the best indicator of price. The single most expensive jade item ever sold is the Hutton-Mdivani Necklace. It was owned by Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. Made of 27 graduated bright emerald green jadeite beads with a clasp set with diamonds and rubies, the necklace sold for $27.4m at auction in 2014, more than six times the price it sold for at auction 20 years earlier. The risks But if the top end of the market seems glamorous, there’s a dirty underbelly to the industry, which by some estimates is worth $8bn. Jadeite comes from Myanmar, and there are serious concerns over labour and human rights in the mining industry there. So much so that the US left in place sanctions on the jade industry even as it removed them from most other sectors of the country’s economy. There’s no certification process to prove to consumers that their purchase has been sourced ethically. On the other hand, Quek points out that some of the most prized jade items are decades or even centuries old, and tracing the source would be virtually impossible.  And as with any investment, there’s always the possibility that market conditions will change. Although there are enthusiastic jade lovers the world over, it’s a market that depends very heavily on growth in China. But China’s economy isn’t growing as fast as it once did. It’s currently seeing its slowest growth in 25 years. Even so, if it hits the government target of 6.5-7% growth, that still equates to an enormous amount of wealth being added to the country’s economy every year. There are other concerns too. Many luxury goods have taken a beating recently, in part because of the Chinese government’s crackdown on corruption, which has been blamed for all manner of things, from declining gambling revenues in Macau, to slowing fortunes for high end wine-makers, slow sales of Tibetan mastiffs and, indeed, jade. Wong thinks there’s no government policy that could derail a love affair with jade that dates back to the Neolithic period. He believes that as China becomes wealthier, and its appetite for jade grows, the price is only likely to climb. This story was produced under the BBC's guidelines for financial journalism.

risk appetite,How sense of smell predicts your health,2024-09-15,2021-03-04,Abdullah Iqbal,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210302-how-your-sense-of-smell-predicts-your-overall-health,"The effect that disease can have on our sense of smell has been thrown under the spotlight by Covid-19, but what else can we learn about our health from our noses? Barrie Smith was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in his 50s, but 18 years before he was given his diagnosis, he developed a very strange and permanent symptom. One day he detected ""a strong smoky smell, like burning wires"", he says. Since then, he has never smelt anything again. At the time, flummoxed, Smith's doctor attributed the loss of his sense of smell to his scuba diving, as deep diving is known to sometimes cause smell impairments.   If only the doctor was right.   Smell loss can have sinister origins beyond scuba diving, and in Smith's case, that proved to be true. In today's world, most would automatically attribute the loss of smell to Covid-19, but it is also a common symptom of neurodegenerative diseases, including Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Research has found that up to 38% of those suffering from Multiple Sclerosis while almost half of older adults diagnosed with dementia showed signs of smell loss five years earlier. In Parkinson's disease 45-96% of patients show smell impairment.   For years, smell loss – or anosmia as it is also known – has been largely ignored as a marker for diseases such as Parkinson's, but now some scientists believe using it as a tool of diagnosis could come with big advantages.   The pathology of diseases such as Parkinson’s is present in the olfactory area of the brain long before other areas, and this is thought to be the reason why Smith lost his sense of smell 18 years before his first tremor. An accurate smell test might have identified his disease almost two decades before his official diagnosis, and that could potentially have given him much more time to slow the disease’s progression.   You might also like:   Several initiatives are now developing tests which could use smell to help diagnose neurodegenerative diseases. Predict-PD is one such initiative. According to Alastair Noyce, a clinical senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, who leads the project, it has developed a smell test called Scratch and Sniff. This is a quick test that presents six smells to the patient that we commonly encounter throughout the day, based off a larger roster of 40 odours.   The hope is the data they collect could be used to predict who is going to develop Parkinson's, which might lead to new early treatments that could prevent the disease from progressing or slow it down. And with up to 0.45-3.4% of individuals (depending on the test) apparently unaware of their own smell loss, tools such as Predict-PD could help people to identify it.   The catch is that such tests are currently expensive. ""The standard smell test costs on average £25 [$34.88]  to undertake but only a few pence to produce,"" says Noyce. Whilst cost may not be a barrier for the many private clinics that are using smell tests as a tool for diagnosis, it would limit its usefulness for public healthcare systems with limited resources.   Of course, smell impairment does not only develop as a result of neurodegenerative diseases. Around 19% of the population have some sort of olfactory dysfunction, with 0.3% losing their sense of smell entirely (anosmia) and 19.1% suffering from reduced ability to detect odours (hyposomia). Recent studies have found that smell loss may be linked to mental health conditions such as depression, schizophrenia and dystonia, a movement disorder in which a person's muscles contract uncontrollably.   A study from 2016 found that men (but not women) with symptoms of depression also tended to have a poor sense of smell, while those who felt lonely were generally less good at identifying different smells. Other research has linked a defective sense of smell to increased mortality, suggesting it could be a ""bellweather"" for aging or illness. One study of more than 2,200 people aged 71-82 years old finding that those with a poor sense of smell had a 46% higher risk of dying within a ten year period than those with an ordinary sense of smell.    But how is it that smell can have such a powerful link to our health?   Carl Philpott, professor of rhinology and olfactology at the University of East Anglia, believes there could be a link to what we eat. According to his research, ""one-third of patients with smell loss overconsume and another one-third of patients under-consume"", he says. Since a healthy diet is one of the pillars of good health, it is easy to see why this would lead to increased mortality. Philpott says ""that our sense of smell makes up more than 70%"" of the flavours we experience (although the exact proportion is contested), which could explain why losing this sense can affect a person's appetite. This fits with the personal experiences of Clara O'Brien, an independent clinical neuropsychiatrist who helps individuals who have been diagnosed with neurological illnesses and brain injuries. ""Smell plays an important part in a patient lives many lose the enjoyment from activities that are a core part of their daily routine,"" she says, explaining that she often finds that those close to her patients with smell loss say they have changed their behaviour, becoming more inward-looking, angry or withdrawn.   Honglei Chen, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Michigan State University, has identified another reason why smell may lead to increased mortality, that smell impairments are linked to an increased exposure to adverse environments.   If you have a sense of smell, just think about those times you have found yourself walking alongside a road when you smell particularly repugnant car fumes, hurrying up as a result. In this situation, the person lacking the ability to smell would continue to inhale the toxic fumes. Smith describes how he had once been sitting in his room for hours which had been full of smoke from his neighbours' wood fire, but had not noticed until his wife came in.   On a neurological level, impairments in a person's sense of smell can lead to long-lasting changes in the make-up of the brain. Areas of the brain that are involved in smell such as the olfactory bulb and piriform cortices shrink, but so do less obvious ones such as the anterior cingulate cortex which is important for motor control and rational thought, and the limbic system which is important for emotional processing.   The good news is that the areas of the brain which shrink due to smell loss can regrow, should the person regain their sense of smell. When this happens, the olfactory bulb, piriform cortices, anterior cingulate cortex and limbic system would all expand, and the person's diet would also improve. This means that smell restoration therapies can be a very effective technique. There are currently researchers who are designing techniques that would enable them to do this.   Thomas Hummel, who leads the Smell and Taste Clinic at the University of Dresden, invented one such technique called ""smell training"". The technique involves patients sniffing an approximation of smells that combine scents from four odour categories, usually rose, clove, eucalyptus and lemon. The patient is required to smell the approximations for 10 minutes, twice a day for a three-month period. While the technique does not work on everyone, it has been shown to be effective in improving the smell abilities of 40% of patients.    Therapies such as Hummel's are for people who have a lose or weakening in their smell because of a range of conditions, whether Covid-19 or neurodegenerative diseases. There are also drugs available for restoring a person's smell, but these are not commonly as drugs may have side effects and smell training doesn’t. However, new therapies are needed for the 60% of patients who are unresponsive to smell training. There are other therapies being developed for those who have lost their sense of smell. One of these is electrical stimulation: stimulating a particular area of the brain via electrodes either placed on the surface or implanted during surgery. These electrodes lead to changes in brain activity, which in turn can improve a patient's sense of smell.   For example, electrical stimulation in the nose has been shown to increase proliferation of olfactory receptor cells, these being the cells responsible for smell. While stimulating the regions of the brain involved in smell could lead to improved smell as this is one of the ways smell training is thought to be effective, by increasing the activity within the smell regions of the brain.   Yusuf Cakmak, an associate professor of anatomy at the University of Otago in New Zealand, explains that these olfactory neurons involved in smell also have terminals in areas of the brain involved in memory and navigation indicating that protecting these neurons could lead to benefits in memory.   Cakmak is currently working on a device which would be worn as a pair of ""glasses"" to stimulation the olfactory nervous system, with the potential of alleviating symptoms or suppressing the progression of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Early modelling work has shown a person's sense of smell can be improved by receiving a targeted current of just one milliamp – equivalent to around two to three thousandths of the energy stored in a standard AA-rated battery. Clinical trials are due to begin in late 2021. If the trials are effective, we may one day be wearing electrical devices to protect our sense of smell. In the meantime, perhaps this long-overlooked sense deserves a little more appreciation. --  Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,The forgotten generation?,2024-09-15,2013-07-11,Ronald Alsop,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130710-the-forgotten-generation,"Lauren Leader-Chivée knew it would probably take years to reach a senior position at her employer Credit Suisse — or at any major company for that matter. She wasn’t sure she wanted to wait. So as her 30th birthday approached, Leader-Chivée jumped ship and joined other Generation X refugees from big corporations at the outsourcing firm OfficeTiger. She became OfficeTiger’s human-resources leader, working extensively in India and travelling the world. “When I have chosen to go with smaller employers, it’s because I knew I would get to lead and assume more responsibility,” said 37-year-old Leader-Chivée, who is now senior vice president at the Center for Talent Innovation, a research organization, as well as a partner at the consultancy Hewlett Chivée Partners.   Increasingly, she sees other Gen Xers following her path — or at least wishing they could. “Virtually every one of my friends is doing something entrepreneurial,” either starting a business or going to work for a start-up, she said. “Xers are drawn to flatter, less-hierarchical firms. They want to take their destinies into their own hands.”  Sandwiched between the larger baby boomer and millennial generations, Gen Xers are feeling quite frustrated by both groups. Born between 1965 and 1979, they continue to find boomers blocking their way to the top as older workers delay retirement. Nearly half of Gen Xers say they feel stalled in their careers, according to a 2011 study by the Center for Talent Innovation (then known as the Center for Work-Life Policy). At the same time, ambitious, impatient millennials are trying to jump ahead of their forty-something middle managers. Although Gen Xers are in their prime career building years, the pace of promotions had slowed for Gen Xers, while the rate for millennials had held steady, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers study of the workforce in the Canadian banking industry between 2008 and 2010. “There’s clearly a Generation X squeeze, but it was still surprising to see the decline for that generation,” said Karen Forward, director in the people and change practice at PwC, the global accounting firm. The study warned of the strong possibility of “disaffection” among Gen Xers who will increasingly be needed to provide leadership stability and absorb the organizational knowledge of retiring baby boomers.   Out of focus Despite that need, employers continue to focus more heavily on their boomer and millennial employees. Such neglect is nothing new to Gen Xers, who have long been used to getting little attention, much like the middle child in a typical family. Back in the 1970s, they became known as latchkey kids because many came from households with two working parents or a single parent, and they often returned to empty homes after school. This experience helped make Gen Xers an independent bunch, but they still would appreciate more recognition in the workplace. Gen Xers, though, may be contributing to their own invisibility. Because the term Gen X has carried some negative connotations — slacker, cynical, distrustful — people see the label as a stigma and avoid it altogether. “They don’t want Generation X to be something that defines them because they feel it always limited them,” said Sean Lyons, associate professor of leadership and management at the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario. “They were written off as underachievers even before they got out of the gate.” A Gen Xer himself, Lyons does generational research and found in a 2011 study a high level of career dissatisfaction and unmet expectations among his peers. “There’s sort of disgruntled acquiescence that we’re never going to win against the baby boomers, who control the resources,” said Lyons, who always draws a crowd of commiserating Gen Xers when he speaks about his research. “The appetite just doesn’t seem to be there for much of a Generation X imprint on the workplace before the millennials take over. There’s a feeling they won’t be there that long — kind of like Prince Charles who’s just in the way between Queen Elizabeth and Prince William.” But regardless of how long they’re in charge, Gen Xers bring valuable assets to the workplace. They are a technology savvy, self-reliant group that doesn’t require the constant guidance and positive feedback that many attention-seeking millennials demand. Their parents weren’t as involved in scheduling their lives as millennial parents, so they learned early to figure things out on their own. Yet because many Gen Xers possess this independent, entrepreneurial streak, they clearly could be a flight risk for companies looking to groom future leaders. More than a third of Gen Xers said they planned to leave their current employer in the next three years, the Center for Talent Innovation study found. In addition, 70% said they prefer to work independently, and of those who like being their own boss, 81% cited a desire for control over their work.   Keeping valued employees To keep their most valued Gen Xers, companies can try to tap into these entrepreneurial instincts and find ways to give these employees the freedom to be innovative. Employers also must provide some mobility within the organization — preferably movement up in terms of both pay and status. But many Gen Xers would settle for even lateral moves that help them develop their skills — as long as they see promotions on the horizon. Rather than make nebulous promises, employers should start handing over the keys by including Gen Xers in discussions about management succession and the future of the company. Employers also can retain restless Gen Xers by offering greater workplace flexibility, something they value highly as a group — perhaps as much as millennials do. Many have families, but even childless employees want more freedom to balance their lives — another possible motivation for starting their own businesses. Even if they’re never going to be in the spotlight, Gen Xers at least want to control how and when they work. While Gen Xers may yearn for a major career change, companies can take some comfort in the fact that they may not be able to afford the risk of starting a business or moving to a lower-paying, but more satisfying job. Several recent studies have found that Gen Xers are struggling more than other generations to pay their bills and to save for retirement. From 2007 to 2010, for instance, Gen Xers lost 45% of their wealth, significantly more than baby boomers, according to a study this year by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Many Gen Xers graduated into weak job markets, carrying hefty student debt. Then, along the way, they lost ground in recessions, the dot-com bust, middle management downsizings and the housing market collapse.  “The constant theme for Gen Xers is that they were thwarted at every turn in trying to get established,” Lyons said. “There’s always a lot of head nodding when I get to the point in my presentation about Gen Xers being disadvantaged. It’s a sore spot that just won’t go away.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,'Life-changing drug helped me lose 10 stone',2024-09-15,2023-12-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-67748987,"A woman who shed 10 stone (63.5kg) after using a weight-loss drug bought on the internet says the treatment was ""life-changing"". Lizz Adair, from Market Weighton, was overweight most of her life until she bought daily injection Saxenda from an online pharmacy. Doctors said people should always have a GP consultation because of potentially serious side effects. They also warned buying the drug online was ""dangerous"". Saxenda suppresses appetite and is only prescribed by doctors to help people with a high body mass index (BMI). Ms Adair found she could buy the drug over the internet.  ""My friend used it and [the weight loss] was so radical I just thought 'oh my goodness, this is amazing, this is a miracle drug, I need to get some',"" she said. ""Now I can walk miles and miles and my feet aren't aching the next day, I'm not laid up in bed.  ""It's definitely life-changing,"" she added. Saxenda, which is known as GLP1 medication, should only be used for weight loss after a consultation with a GP. However, Ozempic, which is also a GLP1 drug, is used in the treatment of diabetic patients but has seen a spike in demand because of use by people trying to lose weight. Dr David Sheehan, of Nettleham Medical Practice near Lincoln, said people should always see a doctor before taking the drugs because of potentially serious side effects and the dangers of buying them online. ""We're still having some difficulty getting the GLP1 medication for our diabetic patients,"" said Dr Sheehan. ""There are people who really need it for their health, either with significant obesity or with diabetes."" In August, a shortage of Ozempic meant a diabetic Lincoln man was told the drug was not available because it was popular with celebrities as a weight-loss aid. Dr Sheehan said buying the drugs online ""really is dangerous"". Up to one in 100 people experience rare side effects from the drug including reduced kidney function and kidney failure, according to Lloyds Pharmacy.  Anyone experiencing these side effects should contact their doctor immediately.  In July, some weight-loss jabs were investigated for a link to suicide. The Department of Health and Social Care said supply of GLP1 drugs was expected to increase by mid-2024. ""Our guidance is clear. Glucagon-like Peptide 1 receptor agonist medicines, that are solely licensed to treat Type 2 diabetes, should only be used for that purpose and should not be routinely prescribed for weight loss in order to protect supplies for patients with diabetes,"" a spokesperson said. Clarification 22 December 2023: This news story has been amended to clarify that Saxenda is not a drug approved for use in the treatment of diabetes in the UK.

risk appetite,UK wind farms sold to German company for £1bn,2024-09-15,2023-12-22,By August Graham and Katy Prickett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-67796231,"The rights to develop three of Britain's largest wind farms have been sold by Swedish company Vattenfall to German rival RWE for nearly £1bn. The projects are known collectively as the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone. Earlier this year, Vattenfall paused work on one of the sites, Norfolk Boreas, saying it was no longer financially viable.  Chief executive Anna Borg said: ""Today's agreement with RWE is great news for the UK's energy security."" All three sites have government consent to go ahead.  When built they will supply 4.2 gigawatts of power to the UK's grid - about the amount that four million households consume. In July, Vattenfall stopped work on the Norfolk Boreas site, about 50 miles (80km) off Cromer, saying the cost of building a wind farm had soared by about 40%. The two other sites, known as Vanguard East and Vanguard West, were also to be reviewed.  Last year, the company won the right to supply power to the grid from Boreas for £37.35 per MWh - a record low for offshore wind. Since then, the price paid to generate electricity by offshore wind farms has been raised by more than 50%, as the government tries to entice energy firms to invest. Vattenfall will stay in the UK as it still runs on and offshore wind farms and is developing a nearly 800 MW floating wind farm in the North Sea. Ms Borg said: ""Both the UK and the offshore market remain attractive over the long term, and we will focus our offshore investments in projects which are appropriate to our current risk appetite while continuing to operate and grow our existing fleet of assets."" The UK is a world leader in offshore wind and is home to the world's five largest farms, supporting tens of thousands of jobs. They provided 13.8% of the UK's electricity generation last year, according to government statistics. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

risk appetite,'My daughter was slashed with a machete',2024-09-15,2018-03-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43545438,"BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane writes about the anger and anguish of villagers caught up in the latest spiral of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  A dark line ran across the small, beautiful face. On either side were stitch marks that ran up under the white bandage covering the top of her head. The wound was deep. The scar would be with Rose all of her days.  I was sitting a few feet away, a stranger, someone from another world. But she was without curiosity. It was as if I did not exist at all. As her father said, she was ""far away. It's as if she hears and sees nothing.""  Like many of the small children of Maze village in north-eastern Ituri province, Rose Mapenzi, aged four, was strapped to her mother's back when the killers struck. The women were preparing the evening meal when they heard the cries of the attackers. Those carrying children, as well as the elderly, were an easy target. As they stumbled in panic, the machetes hacked and slashed.  Rose's father, Jeremy, recalled the moment the ethnic Lendu militia overran Maze on 1 March.  ""They started to chase us and those who could not run were caught and hacked. This child of mine was wounded but the assailants were in a hurry so they did not finish killing her. Hence she survived,"" he said.  Another man, Malobi Lika, managed to escape with his pregnant wife but saw his sister cut down. Again he described how the killers had hacked at the face and head.  As a senior UN official who visited the scene the following day said: ""It was vicious, savage and it was meant to terrorise people."" More than 40 people were killed in the rampage. Their bodies lie in two mass graves in the centre of Maze. Each day fresh bougainvillea are laid, bright violet flowers in memory of the dead.  As I stood beside the graves, a group of men came over. One pointed towards the grave and said 18 members of his family were buried there. He gave his name as David and he was angry.  ""You come to investigate, people come to investigate. But tell me who is going to be held responsible?  ""The people who are dead - who is going to be responsible for that? Who is going to help? People come to annoy us with their recorders but nobody brings a solution. What is the solution? I'm desperate,"" he said.  David knew the truth of DR Congo. For the mass of the poor there are few signs of hope.  More about DR Congo: The international community prays that President Joseph Kabila will accede to elections before the end of the year but is preoccupied with North Korea and the Middle East.  There is no appetite for scaling up the UN military presence - at the moment there are just over 15,000 troops in a country the size of western Europe.  The slaughter at Maze was committed by Lendus against the Hema. Survivors told us that the killers had come from a nearby village.  The massacre has bitter antecedents. I first reported on mass killings in this region 15 years ago.  But to label what is happening simply as ""ethnic violence"" is too reductive. It cannot be separated from current politics and a bloody history stretching to the 19th Century and the age of empire.  What was meant to be the hour of freedom from colonialism in 1960 brought a secessionist war. At the same time the CIA plotted the overthrow of the new nation's leader, Patrice Lumumba, and helped deliver into power one of the most corrupt dictators in African history, Mobutu Sese Seko. He ruled through patronage and fear.  After Mobutu came Laurent Kabila - murdered in January 2001 - and then his son Joseph who now clings to power beyond the two terms allowed under the constitution.  The elite amass wealth through control of the country's exceptional natural resources. The country - including Ituri - is rich in oil, minerals and precious metals.    Some of DR Congo's African neighbours proved themselves as ruthless as any Western imperialist in exploiting the country's resources. At one stage seven African nations had intervened in DR Congo.  More than four million people were killed in two prolonged wars between the mid-1990s and the early years of the new millennium. The state is not trusted in Ituri. In the minds of many it represents arbitrary executions and endemic corruption. The worst is expected of state power.  (Source: UN) Rumours abound in Ituri that the massacres were planned, that money and weapons were handed out in an attempt to foment ethnic violence.  The stories are unconfirmed but even before the eruption of violence in Ituri late last year, the opposition was accusing President Kabila of ""spreading chaos"" in other areas to prevent elections.  I put this to the local governor, Jefferson Abadallah Pene Mbaka. He acknowledged that the police and military had ""failed the people"" by not protecting them from the massacre.  But he defended the president against any suggestions  of manipulation, saying: ""I don't think that there could be a head of state, even if he doesn't want elections, who could stir up his population.  ""For what reason? So that he would become a super president of the republic? I don't see any reason."" Conflicts in the provinces of Tanganyika, Kasai, in North Kivu and South Kivu have uprooted more than four million people across the country.  The scale of loss in DR Congo is impossible to convey in the existing vocabulary of human suffering.  It is not hard to anticipate a greater tragedy if the present political instability continues.  In a country where millions have already died in conflict, the massacre at Maze is a warning to the world of what can happen as DR Congo slides ever deeper into crisis."
risk appetite,Diabetes patients struggling without 'wonder drug',2024-09-15,2024-01-26,By Sophia Seth,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-68083710,"Diabetes patients have told the BBC they are struggling without what they have called a ""wonder drug"". Experts estimate about 400,000 people with Type 2 diabetes could have been affected by a national supply shortage caused by rising demand. The new generation of medicines - GLP-1 receptor agonists - mimic a hormone that not only controls blood sugar levels but also suppresses appetite. The government said it was trying to help resolve the supply chain issues. NHS England has issued a National Patient Safety Alert for the drugs. The NHS alerts require action to be taken by healthcare providers to reduce the risk of death or disability. The diabetes medicines in short supply are Ozempic, Trulicity, Victoza, Byetta, and Bydureon. They work via injections instead of tablets. Type 2 diabetes causes uncontrolled sugar levels that can lead to serious complications such as amputations, visual problems and heart disease. Dave Pomfrey, 66, lives near Winchester, in Hampshire, and has had the disease for 26 years. He was prescribed Victoza 18 months ago. ""It swiftly got my blood glucose under control and it helped me lose weight,"" he said.  ""I lost about three or four kilos in the first six or eight weeks. The way it stops you wanting to eat is a game-changer."" Calling it a ""wonder drug"", he urged that it should be taken under the advisement of health professionals due to its possible side effects.  The group of medicines has been used by the NHS for diabetes for around a decade but in recent years there has been a growth in private clinics prescribing the same drugs for weight loss for people who do not have diabetes, pushing up demand. Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Victoza, told the BBC it was experiencing shortages of its medicines for people in the UK with Type 2 diabetes due to ""unprecedented levels of demand"". It said awareness of GLP-1 receptor agonists has ""significantly increased after unprecedented coverage in the media and on social media"". Mr Pomfrey said he was told in August that he would not be able to get any more Victoza and should consider alternatives. ""It was quite worrying as I was told I would be on Victoza for some time as it was working well for me,"" he said.  ""I thought my future would be back on insulin, which I didn't want. I also worried about my old medicines that stopped working so well for me."" Bob Oxenbury, 69, from Poole in Dorset, was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2013.  He said he was introduced to Victoza about six years later.  ""Wow, It was amazing, a game-changing wonder drug,"" he said.  ""I am now having to try a new drug in tablet form to control my sugar levels. This new drug has unpleasant side effects and my health and wellbeing is now being affected. ""Diabetics are now having health issues due to the lack of supply so that the overweight community can continue to eat unhealthy food and inject it away."" Novo Nordisk said its factories were running ""24 hours a day, seven days a week"" to address the high demand.  The pharmaceutical firm said it had dedicated more than $5bn (£3.9bn) by the end of 2023 to open new production lines and facilities. It added that it was also working closely with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and was doing its ""utmost to discourage the off-label use of our medicines"". Kerry Budd, supervisor and dispenser at Purbrook Pharmacy in Waterlooville, Hampshire, said diabetes patients had been coming in ""upset and some of them angry"". Mitesh Patel runs 12 pharmacies across Hampshire and Dorset and said there were ""many people using diabetes drugs for weight loss"".  He added: ""We often see private prescriptions coming to us and we can't fulfil them."" Phillip Newland-Jones, a consultant pharmacist for diabetes at the University Hospital Southampton, said: ""When we started to look at this, at a national level, it's expected to affect around 400,000 people."" He said there had been an increase in admissions over the last six months in the number of people with high glucose levels who had been unable to access their medicine. But Mr Newland-Jones added: ""Thankfully, in the last few weeks, we have been able to secure an increased amount of the tablet version of the medicine but is not available for all.  ""The tablet is not quite as good as some of the injections, adequate for some, but not suitable for all."" Dr Amish Budhathoki, who has the disease, has a diploma in Type 2 diabetes.  He said he had been helped by Ozempic until it was stopped due to the shortage and was concerned about people who buy it privately. ""I am empathetic to people who genuinely want to lose weight,"" he said. ""But people who use it multiple times a week are at risk of pancreatitis and then, if their pancreas fails, they might actually get diabetes - it is not a quick fix.  ""It is important to monitor your diet and exercise with medication."" The Department for Health and Social Care said: ""We understand how frustrating and distressing medicine supply issues can be and we work with industry, the NHS and others operating across the supply chain to resolve these as quickly as possible.""

risk appetite,"Charity seeks £1m to get 1,100 ex-inmates a job",2024-09-15,2024-01-30,By Hayley Coyle,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-68140663,"A charity that helps former prisoners find a job is asking the government for a £1m funding boost which it says could get 1,100 ex-inmates into work.  Tempus Novo said the cash would fund 22 caseworkers, each supporting 50 people. It said about half of those would not reoffend, saving £25m in prison costs. The charity said the investment would be ""very low risk with massive potential to change lives"".  The BBC has contacted the Ministry of Justice for comment.  Tempus Novo estimates the annual cost of keeping an inmate in prison is £46,600 - but the cost of helping one find employment is just £3,500. The charity was founded by Val Wawrosz and Steve Freer, who both worked at HMP Leeds in Armley, one of the UK's most overcrowded prisons, for 30 years.  They said it had already found sustainable jobs for almost 1,000 ex-offenders with no government funding. Mr Wawrosz said: ""The money we could actually save the country with £1m of government funding is nearer £51m, but the government says around 50% of ex-offenders are likely to stay out of prison - so we always halve our projections.""  The pair said they had seen first-hand how ""complicated"" the criminal justice system was to navigate and that most of the people they helped find work came from ""the type of nothing we have never experienced"".  Mr Freer told the BBC: ""There is a huge stigma nationally against people with convictions accessing work.  ""A lot of them have very little education, come from the depths of poverty and never had a chance. ""We saw there was a big appetite from within so we liaised with local businesses and found people who were looking for hard-working, loyal employees and that's what we provide.  ""We give them a bit of hope, people who haven't had a chance, never mind a second chance."" Mr Freer also said some businesses were nervous about employing convicted criminals so the charity offered a ""vital"" 12-month support plan for both parties.  One of Tempus Novo's staff is Sue, a former prisoner who came across the charity in her local job centre five years ago.  She said when she left prison it was ""heart-wrenching"" trying to find a job as she was met with so much judgement.  Sue started working at Tempus Novo in admin and is still on their staff today.  She said: ""I didn't come from poverty or the care system but it didn't make me any better, I also came out to nothing.  ""What they do is amazing.""

""Mentally, physically, it's a huge tournament to be involved in, so it's a credit to them that we were so fluent.""

Townsend was not unduly concerned by a one-point half-time deficit, despite Glasgow's clear supremacy in terms of territory and possession.

risk appetite,The engineer who wanted to burn all Earth's coal,2024-09-15,2024-02-01,Thomas Moynihan,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240201-a-us-engineer-had-a-shocking-plan-to-improve-the-climate-burn-all-coal-on-earth,"Less than a century ago, people believed setting alight every coal mine on the planet would be good for the climate. The fact we've come so far in our understanding since then provides hope for the future, argues historian Thomas Moynihan. Not a week goes by without a steady stream of headlines conveying our worsening climate predicament. There are stories about lack of preparedness, about perverse incentives, about political inaction and record-breaking metrics, or about the brute complexity of the problem. Swirling together, these meld into a general sense of intractability. Given this now-familiar news diet, it's sometimes difficult to maintain optimism when it comes to society's capacity to manage the climate crisis. But as a historian, I find it helps to zoom out. Looking to the not-too-distant past reveals that the sheer fact we are aware of the issue is a genuine achievement. Easy to otherwise overlook, history throws into relief how far we have already come in our understanding. Less than a century ago, even the experts of the day were talking about climate change in ways that would shock our 21st-Century sensibilities. To see why, you need only look at the claims of one prominent US engineer called William Lamont Abbott, who advocated an idea now unthinkable: he wanted to burn every gram of coal on Earth – and remarkably, he believed that would be a good thing. You may also like: Today, everyone is familiar with the idea that the Earth's climate is a complicated system. Although it contains predictable cycles and trends, even schoolchildren are aware that it can be erratic and sensitive to civilisation's interferences. But a century or so ago, people had far more simplistic outlooks. For much of the 1800s, physicists had been led to believe our planet was, essentially, a cooling body: inexorably losing its finite fund of heat to space's void, like a hot Christmas pudding dropped in snow. People feared encroaching cold, foreseeing life withering away on a dwindling diet of warmth. Changing these views took years of research – and even then, some scientific findings were not immediately recognised as important. For instance, suffragist Eunice Foote realised as far back as the 1850s that carbon dioxide retains heat and, thus, an Earthly atmosphere with more of it would be warmer. Foote's pioneering contribution was overlooked, likely due to sexism. (Watch: ""Three pioneers who predicted climate change"".) Only around 1900 did scientists begin making further connections between atmospheric CO2 and larger climate trends. This came from searching for the causes behind the Ice Ages: prehistoric pulses of planetary freezing which implied that — rather than being a heated ball monotonously losing its warmth in a nosedive decline — the Earth's climate is in a complicated equilibrium. One capable of maintaining balance over voluminous tracts of time, but also of severe oscillations. Around this time, scientists also first made the link between humanity's burning of fossil fuels and Earth's future climate. Liberating colossal amounts of CO2, the planetary juggernaut of industrial civilisation suddenly seemed poised to rapidly warm our globe. How did people respond to this conjecture? Having grown up fearing a frozen future, many rejoiced. And that brings us to William Lamont Abbott's case – and his erroneous beliefs about the benefits of burning all our reserves of coal. The plan to burn the world's coal An engineer by trade, Abbott was not uninfluential, nor some lone maverick. Chief operating engineer of Illinois's largest electric provider, he also held other prominent roles. Fittingly, a powerplant was named after him. In the late 1920s, he travelled the US delivering lectures to various learned societies. Talking to one room in the picturesque Pennsylvanian town of Scranton in 1927, Abbott welcomed industry's accelerating use of fossil fuels. Why? Because he had hastily concluded this could only benefit the world, by making climates more clement. For him, accelerating consumption wasn't enough. Estimating there are several trillion tonnes of carbon still locked underground globally, he reasoned that this storehouse, if ""returned to the air"", could increase atmospheric levels tenfold. With staggering self-assurance, Abbott announced such a dramatic increase in CO2 would double Earth's arable surface, by transforming polar countries into temperate paradises. He envisioned perpetual summers, jungles in America's north-east, unprecedented crop yields, and unimaginably verdant environments; an outcome, he said, which was demanded by humanity's ""increasing population"".  He even prophesied tropical animals — including elephants — would return to North America, becoming ""garden pests"". Abbott then arrived at his action plan. Despite nonchalantly acknowledging scientists didn't yet understand all the intricacies, he arrived at his conclusion: ""Let the nations of the Earth unite"", he said, in immediately setting alight all their deepest coal seams, so as to release the planet's entire ""treasure of carbon"". He even claimed countries ought not ""regulate the fire to the varying demand of power"", but simply ""let it rage day and night"" — luxuriantly and wastefully — in order to make the world's mines into one ""roaring furnace"". All this, he insisted, should be done in the name of ""posterity"", accelerating humankind towards future utopia: a ""return"" to Eden. Moreover, Abbott was not unique in holding these beliefs. Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius — the period's leading expert on climate change — had also remarked, cheerfully, that global warming will only precipitate better climates and crops. Others readily assumed similar things. When they acknowledged a hotter world might unevenly make the Global South ""suffer"", they shrugged rather than shuddered. Only very few scattered voices, such as geologist Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, were more prescient. He urged his contemporaries to practise self-restraint when it came to coal appetites, seeing this as necessary to safeguard a stable climate for future generations. But, despite sensing the gravity of the challenge, he also saw reason to hope people might rise to the task. Pointing out that, when cooperating at large-scale, humankind has so far only tended to disturb or destroy ecosystems, Chamberlin also hinted that we are the first and only animal to realise its impacts. What's more, when considering human history, people have only just begun grasping this and, thus, acting toward rectifying it. Today's consensus concerning climate change and its consequences rests, in part, on the past's egregious mistakes. Getting closer to truth unavoidably involves being wrong before. Because of this, Abbott's case suggests that one shouldn't be hasty when it comes to acting drastically in what you think is the interest of future generations. But the main lesson here is this: only by inspecting past mistakes do we see how far we've since come. This allows us to gain some sense of how much farther we might yet travel. Our knowledge of the imminent dangers of human-caused climate change rests on countless computer models alongside a vast, planet-wrapping array of sensors and satellites. An attempt to simulate Earth's changing states – like a planetary central nervous system – it is a staggering achievement. Through building up this megastructure, and through the unceasing efforts of countless researchers since Abbott's day, we've travelled leagues from the rash naiveté of even just a century ago. This proves societies can, and do, learn. It throws into relief just how much — and how rapidly — outlooks and priorities can change and become more sophisticated and insightful as we piece together more about the world. Several generations ago, it simply hadn't yet sufficiently occurred to scientists that climate change might unleash significant harms. Now it's overwhelmingly accepted. It's likely we are missing similarly vital insights today, insights that would enable us to navigate our world far more wisely. Strangely, this is cause for optimism, as having room for improvement is far better than having none at all. Historically speaking, we have only very recently become aware of our planetary predicament. Perhaps, then, it's still too early to dismiss Homo sapiens as inevitably, forevermore, doomed to be a blight upon its world. It's clear that we have so much more to do to avert the worst effects of climate change, but if we look how far we've come, in a relatively short time, there are reasons for cautious hope. *Thomas Moynihan is a historian of ideas and author of X-Risk: How Humanity Discovered Its Own Extinction (MIT Press, 2020).

risk appetite,Covid inquiry: Five things we learned last week,2024-09-15,2024-02-02,By Lorna Gordon,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-68166142,"Senior politicians from both the Scottish and UK governments gave evidence to the UK Covid inquiry on its third and final week of hearings in Edinburgh. Here are five things we learned. Nicola Sturgeon responded robustly to charges that she politicised the pandemic to advance the cause of Scottish independence.    She'd never thought about the subject less in her life, she said, than while trying to steer the country through the crisis.  Ms Sturgeon insisted the suggestion she'd seen it as an ""opportunity"" to differentiate her leadership from the UK government's ""just wasn't true"", one of several moments when she appeared tearful.  The UK government minister responsible for relations between the two governments at the time, Michael Gove, was also challenged on constitutional matters.  The inquiry was shown a paper Mr Gove presented to his colleagues in July 2020, called ""State of the Union"".   It contained notes on polling, indicating that voters in Scotland had a more positive view of the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic than they did of the UK government's response.    ""Absent Covid-19,"" Mr Gove wrote, ""I am firmly of the view that the risk to the Union would be the greatest challenge this government needed to confront.""  He advocated highlighting how being part of the UK benefited people grappling with ""hardship"" brought on by the pandemic.  Two days later, the then-prime minister, Boris Johnson, visited Scotland.  Mr Gove, who was a journalist before entering politics, delivered an attention-grabbing line when he observed: ""The political aim of the SNP is to destroy the United Kingdom, and from time to time they will make political points to that end.""  But elsewhere in his evidence, he repeatedly stated his admiration for the professionalism and integrity of Scottish government ministers and his belief that their ""overwhelming motivation"" was to protect the people of Scotland. It seems implausible that Ms Sturgeon, Mr Gove, or the governments they were part of entirely set aside their core political philosophies overnight when the pandemic hit.  The real question for Lady Hallett is whether this made any real-world difference to the decisions they made.  Was the Scottish cabinet in the driving seat when it came to deciding how to tackle the Covid pandemic or was power concentrated in the hands of a few?    Cabinet minutes dated December 2020 showed that ministers agreed to delegate to Ms Sturgeon the responsibility for finalising proposals to deal with the new Alpha variant of Covid.  The cabinet also agreed to give her and her deputy, John Swinney, the responsibility for further decisions if circumstances changed.  Mr Swinney said this was consistent with cabinet having set the direction. He also added said that some decisions during Covid had to be made quickly.  Mr Swinney was also asked whether a message from the national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch, which stated  Nicola Sturgeon wants ""to keep it small"", was an indication that the former first minister in effect expected to take the decisions herself.   ""The idea of it being a small cast list about who was discussing these points is not one I would accept,"" he said.   Ms Sturgeon also rejected this suggestion, pointing out that cabinet met around 100 times during Covid and that each time detailed minutes would record both the options assessed and decisions reached.  So called ""Gold Command"" meetings - involving Nicola Sturgeon, trusted advisers and a smaller revolving group of ministers - which met in the days ahead of cabinet were not, however, minuted, which means it's impossible to know what role ""Gold"" meetings played in decision making.  Ms Sturgeon denied she reached decisions based on her ""instincts"" and rejected suggestions she was given ""carte blanche"" by the Scottish cabinet. How many times did we hear WhatsApp mentioned? The use of the app, what was said in those informal messages, and why they were or were not deleted have been recurring themes.  Former Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he deleted his manually. Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, said he had deleted all of his to free up memory on his phone.   For Nicola Sturgeon, the question of what happened to hers - after months of press speculation on the subject - eventually came down to one, six-word exchange.   Senior counsel to this phase of the Inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, asked the former first minister: ""But did you delete them?"" She replied: ""Yes"".    She used WhatsApp with no more than a handful of people, she said, adding that the exchanges were only ever about ""routine"" matters or for ""passing on information"".  But the inquiry was also shown messages between her and her senior adviser Liz Lloyd, discussing what Ms Sturgeon should do about what she described as ""a bit of a crisis of decision-making"" on policies affecting the hospitality sector. The Scottish Covid Bereaved Group said they believed there was a culture of secrecy that continued to this day.  Ms Sturgeon's critics accuse her of a cover up. The former first minister insisted anything relevant to the business of government was recorded officially. The inquiry has to take her word for that. Another theme running through Nicola Sturgeon's five hours of testimony to the inquiry was regret. Regret, inevitably, over the loss of life during the pandemic - particularly in care homes. And regret, too, over what she called the ""loss of opportunity"" when it came to education. But the former first minister said her ""chief"" regret was not imposing the first lockdown - introduced on 23 March 2020 - one or two weeks earlier. That will come as little surprise to those who observed Ms Sturgeon and her largely safety-first approach at close quarters throughout the pandemic:  Mask-wearing was mandatory for longer in Scotland than anywhere else in the UK. And at the start of the second wave there were harsher restrictions on entering each other's homes.  But when it came to locking down at the very start of Covid  Ms Sturgeon acted at exactly the same time as the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Policy about health falls under the remit of the Scottish government. But there has always been a keen debate about how much economic policy is devolved.  The issue of furlough during the pandemic brought it into sharper focus.  When the third wave of Covid hit, Kate Forbes, who was the Scottish government's finance secretary, repeatedly requested that furlough, which was decided by the UK Treasury, be extended or  reintroduced.  One of her officials told her there was no appetite for this in the Treasury; that the reaction to this suggestion had been allergic.  Ms Forbes said she believed Treasury officials were speaking ""honestly and truthfully"" at the times when they said no further funding would be forthcoming but the position changed shortly afterwards.  She said ""it was largely because they didn't know rather than that they were being deceptive"".  When asked, she agreed that it was a failure of the UK government to communicate the change to its own officials.  The former finance secretary also said she thought the UK mechanism for allocating money back to the Scotland government, known as the Barnett formula wasn't flexible enough to deal with an emergency.   In his evidence, Michael Gove stated that he believed there was a case for ""greater clarity overall about reserved and devolved responsibilities"".  The inquiry also heard evidence that Matt Hancock, the then UK secretary of state for health, thought public health matters such as ""fat fighting"" were devolved while public health emergencies were for the Westminster government to decide.   Mr Gove rejected suggestions that Mr Hancock's views were  indicative of a wider attitude within the UK government but went on to say that some within the UK government occasionally found it ""irksome"" dealing with devolved governments taking a different view."
risk appetite,GAA not rushing return to play - Horan,2024-09-15,2021-02-11,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/gaelic-games/56029730,"GAA president John Horan says it is not yet safe for gaelic games to return GAA president John Horan says the association does have an ""appetite"" to return to the pitch but that it is ""not in any rush"" to do so because ""we don't feel it's safe or responsible."" The Irish Government clarified on Wednesday that inter-county gaelic games is not covered under current Level 5 exemptions for elite sports. The GAA does not expect a return to on-field activity until at least Easter. ""The GAA have an appetite to go back, of course,"" Horan told RTE.  ""Everybody within the GAA family would love to be back playing games and training in the morning but look, we've always acted with safety and responsibility as the key tenets of our decision-making process and that will remain and that's why we're not in any rush to come back at the moment because we don't feel it's safe or responsible. No GAA activity 'until Easter at the earliest' says Croke Park McConville 'devastated and confused' by delay to GAA return ""The virus is too virulent throughout society. The numbers are still too high and we're not going to put our members or their families at risk in making any decisions like that in the short term."" Horan was speaking after Irish sports minister Jack Chambers had said the GAA did not show a ""massive appetite"" for a return in the ""medium term"" before the delay of this season. ""They made it clear that there was not a massive appetite to return in the medium term,"" Minister of State for Sport Chambers said during an interview on Today with Claire Byrne on RTE Radio 1. Chambers also explained why inter-county GAA were no longer exempt from Level 5 exemptions, with professional football and rugby still classified as elite level sport. ""In the roadmap that was published last autumn, we gave exemptions for professional sports,"" he added. ""For example, the League of Ireland is a professional league. That is the distinction. ""But we do want to review the plan and how we live with Covid. That is why sport will be included in that."" The GAA confirmed on Wednesday that no on-field activity is now expected until Easter (4 April) at the earliest, meaning a likely reshape of the 2021 fixture calendar which included the All-Ireland Football and Hurling finals being held in mid-July. In 2020, the All-Ireland Championships ran between October and December when inter-county games were classed as elite sport and therefore exempt under Level 5 restrictions. ""To be clear, the government has been very thankful to the GAA and broader sporting organisations for supporting the public health effort,"" added Chambers. ""I want to see the Championship this year. I want to see our young people getting back playing. ""When the GAA Championship was run off, that was done in the context of Level 5 and there was a concession outside of Level 5 framework approved by government. Once the Championship finished in December, as you know there were no fixtures scheduled at that point. Dublin beat Mayo in the 2020 All-Ireland Football Final, which was held on 19 December ""There was also a very difficult Level 5 lockdown for the country so the regulations didn't capture that because there were no fixtures in the current schedule. The concession concluded at the end of last year. ""When you look at the context of the number of cases in January, that is why the government is revising the plan. I haven't any communication from NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) on this. ""It is a case of giving a direct answer on a concession for inter-county GAA."" The minister clarified that the GAA had not been removed from the elite category and added that he hopes to work with the Association and other sporting organisations to ""provide an update in the context of the revised plan"". ""We had a very positive discussion with the GAA and the other organisations. They've made it very clear they want to support the public health effort. ""We've had more Covid-19 cases in January than all of last year. It's also important to say in the broader context of the Return to Sport, as the Taoiseach said this morning, in the next two weeks. ""There was no decision taken to remove the GAA from the elite category. It's a case of giving clarity on the regulations as they currently stand. It wasn't a case of removing, it was a case of giving clarity. ""What I'm seeking to do is work with the GAA and other sporting organisations to provide an update in the context of the revised plan and hopefully we can give certainty on the timeline for the broader return to sport."""

Teaforthree is strongly fancied to make the frame."" 1. The Package, 2. Lion Na Bearnai, 3. Teaforthree, 4. Double Seven, 5. The Rainbow Hunter (Number, form, name, age, weight, trainer, jockey) 1 121-1532  TIDAL BAY (IRE)  13 11-10   Paul Nicholls Sam Twiston-Davies  Veteran still thriving at the grand old age of 13 under the astute care of eight-time champion trainer Paul Nicholls. Primed for a bold bid, although no top weight has won since Red Rum in the 1970s, and would be oldest winner for nearly a century. His 21-year-old jockey, whose father trained two National winners - Earth Summit (1998) and Bindaree (2002) - is a rising star who was aged just 14 when Tidal Bay won his first race in 2006. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 16-1 2 132-54U1  LONG RUN (FR)   9 11-09  Nicky Henderson Sam Waley-Cohen  Born 5 April, 2005. Defeated equine greats Denman and Kauto Star when winning 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup but patchy form this season. Horse owned by father of the jockey, who is an amateur but has best record over National fences of any in race - having won other contests four times, plus a second, fourth and fifth in the big race. A friend of Kate Middleton, he has initials etched in saddle in memory of brother Tom, who died aged 20 from cancer. Rating: 8/10 Odds: 16-1 3 13-606034 HUNT BALL (IRE)   9 11-07   Nicky Henderson Andrew Tinkler  Champion trainer still seeking first Grand National win. Was most improved horse in training three seasons ago and won at Cheltenham Festival for former trainer Kieran Burke but colourful ex-owner Anthony Knott later caused controversy when running the horse with a bookmaker's sign stencilled on his behind. Later sold to America, and has shaped promisingly on return to UK although stable jockey has picked Triolo D'Alene. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 80-1 4 301-1310  TRIOLO D'ALENE (FR) 7 11-06  Nicky Henderson Barry Geraghty Won the Hennessy at Newbury, then disappointed in Gold Cup. Trainer holds record for number of victories at Cheltenham Festival, but seven of his last 17 National runners have fallen at the first. Irish jockey one of the best around and scored aboard Monty's Pass in 2003. The old saying is 'weight stops trains' and question is whether the French-bred has enough puff to see off rivals with a lower burden. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 22-1 5 1113-22  ROCKY CREEK (IRE) 8 11-05  Paul Nicholls Noel Fehily  Runner-up to Triolo D'Alene in the Hennessy and highly regarded by trainer, who won the National with Neptune Collonges in a photo finish two years ago. Rocky Creek has been hindered by a few niggles this season, including piles and ringworm, but his form is solid. Bidding to become the first horse younger than nine to win the race since Bindaree (who was also eight) landed the spoils in 2002.  Rating: 7/10 Odds: 18-1 6 45-F405P QUITO DE LA ROQUE (FR) 10 11-01 Colm Murphy IRE Brian O'Connell Pulled up on last outing at Fairyhouse in February, but wouldn't be first winner to save his best for the big day. Has run well at Aintree before, winning the competitive Mildmay Novices' Chase for County Wexford trainer three years ago. Owned by Gigginstown House Stud, which was founded by airline boss Michael O'Leary. Jockey will be hoping for a comfortable ride, with plenty of room and to arrive at the right time.     Rating: 7/10 Odds: 50-1                       7 1U-03U0F COLBERT STATION (IRE) 10 11-00 Ted Walsh IRE Mark Walsh Owned by wealthy Irish businessman JP McManus, nicknamed the Sundance Kid for his gambling exploits. He retains 18-time champion jockey AP McCoy as rider of his horses. McCoy picked Colbert Station last year, and his mount travelled well before departing at The Chair. Jockey has opted for Double Seven this time. Trainer is the father of sidelined jockey Ruby Walsh. The pair triumphed with Papillon in 2000. Replacement Mark no relation. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1 8 22P52-U4 WALKON (FR)   9 11-00 Alan King Wayne Hutchison  Likely to be popular with the red half of Liverpool, fond of the refrain 'Walk On' as a line in the Anfield football club's anthem You'll Never Walk Alone. You never know, perhaps it might be fate, with the Reds chasing a Premier League title and Aintree paying tribute to Hillsborough victims and campaigners 25 years on from the tragedy where 96 fans died. Walkon has won at the Merseyside track before - a juvenile hurdle in 2009. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 50-1 9 20P-1111 BALTHAZAR KING (IRE) 10 10-13 Philip Hobbs Richard Johnson  There would be few more popular winners in the jockeys' weighing room than if perennial title runner-up Richard Johnson finally landed the world's most famous steeplechase at the 18th attempt. He was narrowly denied on What's Up Boys 12 years ago. Boasts a decent chance on Cheltenham Festival cross-country chase winner, who would relish drying conditions and good ground. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1 10 P06-52P0 WAYWARD PRINCE 10 10-13  Hilary Parrott Jack Doyle Boasts some useful form, particularly when racking up a hat-trick of victories in the 2010-11 season, which culminated in a close third in the RSA Chase at the Cheltenham Festival under AP McCoy for previous trainer Ian Williams. Twice a winner in other races at Aintree and a Charlie Hall Chase runner-up to the talented Harry Topper earlier this season, although subsequent runs have been more wayward than regal. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1 11 -4503112  MR MOONSHINE (IRE) 10 10-12  Sue Smith Ryan Mania  Represents same trainer, jockey and owners as last year's 66-1 winner Auroras Encore. Scottish jockey was taken to hospital the next day following a nasty fall at Hexham races. Now fully recovered, he will once again ride for the trainer married to former showjumper Harvey Smith. Mr Moonshine was pulled up four fences from home last year but then third to Chance Du Roy in the Becher Chase over the National fences in December, and has won twice since. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1 12 6203-020 TEAFORTHREE (IRE) 10 10-12  Rebecca Curtis Nick Scholfield  It's easy to see Teaforthree being in the first three. Third last year, he was narrow runner-up to Monbeg Dude in the 2012 Welsh National. Looked potential winner 12 months ago before being passed late on, but has 5lb less weight to carry. Would be first Welsh-trained victor since Kirkland in 1905, but third in six years for a female trainer. Prepared with run in Cheltenham Gold Cup, where the horse finished eighth. Rating: 8/10 Odds: 12-1 13 10-501U  ACROSS THE BAY (IRE) 10 10-11  Donald McCain Henry Brooke Ran well at the front for a long way last year before fading to finish 14th. Trainer won the race with Ballabriggs in 2011, and his father Donald 'Ginger' McCain was successful four times (a 1970s treble for Red Rum then Amberleigh House 2004). Jockey takes to the big stage after impressing producers with a moody performance in a TV trailer for the National. Runs for a syndicate of Merseyside owners. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 50-1 14 F111116  DOUBLE SEVEN (IRE) 8 10-11  Martin Brassil IRE AP McCoy Double Seven is number 14 on the racecard. How about that? Trainer won the 2006 National with Numbersixvalverde. Double Seven racked up five wins earlier in the season and sure to be well backed with 18-time champion AP McCoy booked. Jockey gained his sole success in the big race at 15th attempt aboard Don't Push It four years ago and may not have too many rides in the contest left. He turns 40 next month. Rating: 8/10 Odds: 14-1 15 11-1PRP  BATTLE GROUP  9 10-10 Johnny Farrelly Brendan Powell  Secured a notable double at last year's Grand National meeting when trained by Kevin Bishop, who was assisted by his current trainer. Hasn't sparkled since changing stables and refused to race on one occasion, so his appetite for this test has to be taken on trust. However, if you believe in the adage 'horses for courses' you might go into battle with this one. Jockey's dad Brendan Sr rode Rhyme 'N Reason to victory in 1988. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 50-1 16 5-05103  BUCKERS BRIDGE (IRE) 8 10-10  Henry de Bromhead IRE Andrew Lynch Third at Fairyhouse in February ensured qualification. Trainer, whose stable includes former champion chaser Sizing Europe, reports the horse schooled well over Grand National-style fences. But feeling this could be a bridge too far as yet to win beyond two-and-a-half miles, and this test is nearly four-and-a-half. Rating: 5/10 Odds: 80-1 17 1/PP-5014 LION NA BEARNAI (IRE) 12 10-10  Tom Gibney IRE Davy Russell Former winner of the Irish National, which has proved a profitable guide to this race in the past. Approaching twilight of a career in which he has scored victories at big prices. Jockey won the Cheltenham Gold Cup on 20-1 chance Lord Windermere and is thriving after a nightmare start to the year when he was ditched by Gigginstown House Stud for younger jockey Bryan Cooper. Rating: 8/10 Odds: 40-1 18 12-3004  PRINCE DE BEAUCHENE (FR) 11 10-10  Willie Mullins IRE Paul Townend Prominent in ante-post lists when ruled out with injury in both 2012 and 2013. Chance may have gone, although should not be dismissed for Ireland's dominant trainer, who won the National with Hedgehunter in 2005. Jockey comes in for the ride after Ruby Walsh was sidelined following a fall at last month's Cheltenham Festival. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1 19 13P-3415 MONBEG DUDE (IRE) 9 10-09 Michael Scudamore Paul Carberry  Winner of Welsh National in January 2013, owned by trainer along with rugby union internationals Mike Tindall, James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson. Liable to hit the odd obstacle, 'The Dude' has been sent for schooling sessions, supervised by Tindall's wife Zara, a leading equestrian rider and the Queen's grand-daughter. Jockey swung from rafters in old winner's enclosure when triumphing with Bobbyjo in 1999. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1 20 1/F0211-23 BIG SHU (IRE)  9 10-08 Peter Maher IRE Peter Buchanan  Fine jumper who has specialised in cross-country chases. Marathon tip should pose no fear as CV includes a victory over four miles and a furlong. Ran well again when third to Balthazar King at the Cheltenham Festival despite having a head cold in the run-up, although this represents step into the big league. Thought to prefer good to soft ground so trainer will be hoping for a few showers in the build-up to the race. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1 21 2/-500P02 BURTON PORT (IRE) 10 10-08 Jonjo O'Neill Brian Harding Nicely weighted based on his best form, including runner-up in the Hennessy. Was sidelined for 18 months with tendon injury and switched stables. In eight rides over the National fences, 41-year-old jockey has completed the course six times including a third place on Simply Gifted (2005). Respected trainer won the National with Don't Push It in 2010. Rating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1 22 0P/124-050 OUR FATHER (IRE) 8 10-08 David Pipe Denis O'Regan Three career wins from 12 starts, including comfortable victory at Cheltenham in November 2012. One of four greys in the race this year, along with Walkon, Rose Of The Moon and stablemate Swing Bill. Only two greys have won since the 1870s - Nicolas Silver in 1961 and Neptune Collonges two years ago. Pipe yard sometimes succeed with second string, but The Package appears their main hope this time.

Would appreciate rain to soften the ground conditions. Jockey had biggest win of his career when riding Sire De Grugy to victory in the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham on 12 March. Says he would not swap the ride for any other in the race. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1 24 4UP-261  THE RAINBOW HUNTER 10 10-07 Kim Bailey Aidan Coleman Second horse past the post last year, albeit without his rider, who says he took to the fences well before he was unseated at the Canal Turn. Impressive Doncaster win last time out suggests pot of gold may be in reach for The Rainbow Hunter. Jockey missed out on 100-1 winner Mon Mome in 2009 when choosing to ride Stan instead.  Trainer scored with Mr Frisk in 1990 and has enjoyed a revival in recent years after some leaner times.

Fell at the Cheltenham Festival last month. Breeding suggests a dry spell and good ground would help. Jockey has yet to get round in three attempts in the National, but says of his 2014 mount: ""He's a good ride to get. He's big and gives me the feel of a nice horse.""

risk appetite,'My daughter was slashed with a machete',2024-09-15,2018-03-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43545438,"BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane writes about the anger and anguish of villagers caught up in the latest spiral of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  A dark line ran across the small, beautiful face. On either side were stitch marks that ran up under the white bandage covering the top of her head. The wound was deep. The scar would be with Rose all of her days.  I was sitting a few feet away, a stranger, someone from another world. But she was without curiosity. It was as if I did not exist at all. As her father said, she was ""far away. It's as if she hears and sees nothing.""  Like many of the small children of Maze village in north-eastern Ituri province, Rose Mapenzi, aged four, was strapped to her mother's back when the killers struck. The women were preparing the evening meal when they heard the cries of the attackers. Those carrying children, as well as the elderly, were an easy target. As they stumbled in panic, the machetes hacked and slashed.  Rose's father, Jeremy, recalled the moment the ethnic Lendu militia overran Maze on 1 March.  ""They started to chase us and those who could not run were caught and hacked. This child of mine was wounded but the assailants were in a hurry so they did not finish killing her. Hence she survived,"" he said.  Another man, Malobi Lika, managed to escape with his pregnant wife but saw his sister cut down. Again he described how the killers had hacked at the face and head.  As a senior UN official who visited the scene the following day said: ""It was vicious, savage and it was meant to terrorise people."" More than 40 people were killed in the rampage. Their bodies lie in two mass graves in the centre of Maze. Each day fresh bougainvillea are laid, bright violet flowers in memory of the dead.  As I stood beside the graves, a group of men came over. One pointed towards the grave and said 18 members of his family were buried there. He gave his name as David and he was angry.  ""You come to investigate, people come to investigate. But tell me who is going to be held responsible?  ""The people who are dead - who is going to be responsible for that? Who is going to help? People come to annoy us with their recorders but nobody brings a solution. What is the solution? I'm desperate,"" he said.  David knew the truth of DR Congo. For the mass of the poor there are few signs of hope.  More about DR Congo: The international community prays that President Joseph Kabila will accede to elections before the end of the year but is preoccupied with North Korea and the Middle East.  There is no appetite for scaling up the UN military presence - at the moment there are just over 15,000 troops in a country the size of western Europe.  The slaughter at Maze was committed by Lendus against the Hema. Survivors told us that the killers had come from a nearby village.  The massacre has bitter antecedents. I first reported on mass killings in this region 15 years ago.  But to label what is happening simply as ""ethnic violence"" is too reductive. It cannot be separated from current politics and a bloody history stretching to the 19th Century and the age of empire.  What was meant to be the hour of freedom from colonialism in 1960 brought a secessionist war. At the same time the CIA plotted the overthrow of the new nation's leader, Patrice Lumumba, and helped deliver into power one of the most corrupt dictators in African history, Mobutu Sese Seko. He ruled through patronage and fear.  After Mobutu came Laurent Kabila - murdered in January 2001 - and then his son Joseph who now clings to power beyond the two terms allowed under the constitution.  The elite amass wealth through control of the country's exceptional natural resources. The country - including Ituri - is rich in oil, minerals and precious metals.    Some of DR Congo's African neighbours proved themselves as ruthless as any Western imperialist in exploiting the country's resources. At one stage seven African nations had intervened in DR Congo.  More than four million people were killed in two prolonged wars between the mid-1990s and the early years of the new millennium. The state is not trusted in Ituri. In the minds of many it represents arbitrary executions and endemic corruption. The worst is expected of state power.  (Source: UN) Rumours abound in Ituri that the massacres were planned, that money and weapons were handed out in an attempt to foment ethnic violence.  The stories are unconfirmed but even before the eruption of violence in Ituri late last year, the opposition was accusing President Kabila of ""spreading chaos"" in other areas to prevent elections.  I put this to the local governor, Jefferson Abadallah Pene Mbaka. He acknowledged that the police and military had ""failed the people"" by not protecting them from the massacre.  But he defended the president against any suggestions  of manipulation, saying: ""I don't think that there could be a head of state, even if he doesn't want elections, who could stir up his population.  ""For what reason? So that he would become a super president of the republic? I don't see any reason."" Conflicts in the provinces of Tanganyika, Kasai, in North Kivu and South Kivu have uprooted more than four million people across the country.  The scale of loss in DR Congo is impossible to convey in the existing vocabulary of human suffering.  It is not hard to anticipate a greater tragedy if the present political instability continues.  In a country where millions have already died in conflict, the massacre at Maze is a warning to the world of what can happen as DR Congo slides ever deeper into crisis."
risk appetite,Reluctant statesman Sunak turns focus to foreign affairs,2024-09-15,2024-01-19,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67884751,"When Rishi Sunak entered 10 Downing Street in October 2022, he had little experience in foreign affairs. His priorities were largely domestic: to try to repair the UK economy after the Covid pandemic and revive the Conservative Party's electoral fortunes.  Yet in recent days the prime minister has asserted himself on the global stage more emphatically than many might have expected.  He has gone to war against the Houthis in Yemen, the only European leader to send armed force to join the United States-led air strikes.  He has put Britain at the forefront of the pro-Ukraine alliance, promising increased military support and signing a new security pact with Kyiv, all while US and European Union allies hesitate amid division and fatigue.  I travelled with Mr Sunak on his recent trip to Kyiv and saw first-hand how the prime minister handled both the Red Sea and Ukraine crises at the same time. And what struck me was how far Mr Sunak has had to come in the 15 months he has been in office, from reluctant statesman to engaged international actor.  When the prime minister replaced Liz Truss, his foreign policy appeared limited to promising continued support for Ukraine. Calling President Macron of France ""a friend"" was seen as a bold act compared to his predecessor's hesitation. Mr Sunak's five priorities were mostly domestic: the only foreign consideration was stopping boats of migrants crossing the English Channel.  As his first year in office progressed, the prime minister showed at times what seemed like introspective instincts. He fluttered diplomatic feathers by ordering a corporate-style audit of UK military support for Ukraine.  At the G20 summit in New Delhi, he seemed more focused on national matters - fostering a UK-India trade deal, talking to EU partners about his migration policy.  Mr Sunak chose not to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York. I spent much time there being asked by diplomats why the new prime minister stayed away, missing an opportunity to meet many world leaders. In November, the PM snubbed his Greek counterpart, cancelling a meeting at short notice after Kyriakos Mitsotakis demanded the return of the Parthenon Marbles during a BBC interview. And while Mr Sunak has chosen so far not to visit Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin, he has attended a conference of right-wing parties in Italy.  The view in Whitehall was that Mr Sunak was uninterested in foreign affairs, more engaged on electoral and economic priorities. This impression was confirmed to many by the appointment of Lord Cameron as foreign secretary. Diplomats and officials interpreted this as Mr Sunak outsourcing foreign affairs to a more experienced predecessor. The prime minister all but confirmed this impression at the Liaison Committee before Christmas. Asked by one MP if he considered himself a leader on the world stage, he wriggled visibly with discomfort. ""I think others will make that determination,"" he said.  Yet only a few weeks later Mr Sunak has put British servicemen and women in harm's way, making choices other European heads of government have avoided. So what has changed?  One answer is that he had no choice but to respond to global events. As he admitted to the Liaison Committee: ""The increasingly complex and hostile international environment is something that, over the past year, has occupied more of my time than one might have anticipated."" A second answer is that he was always ready to be proactive on the world stage, just in a different way.  Take Ukraine. Where Boris Johnson was an instinctive supporter of Kyiv, Mr Sunak is more rational, talking about ""investing"" in European security. ""The difference is that the PM is pragmatic, as opposed to Johnson who was philosophically all-in,"" one senior defence source told me.  Mr Sunak's advisers say that when he engages with foreign policy in detail and reaches a conclusion, he can be as hawkish as Mr Johnson, if not more so. They say he has a greater risk appetite than some imagine.  They point to his early support for Ukraine getting tanks and long-range missiles, not fearing the threat of Russian escalation. And in the Red Sea, they note his readiness to deploy RAF warplanes when many European allies - such as the French and Italians - demurred.  That said, Mr Sunak's domestic instincts can still stay his hand. Whitehall sources say serious consideration was given to promising Ukraine a multi-year package of military support - not just one year - to send a clear signal of UK strategic patience to Moscow.  But those sources say Mr Sunak became all ""chancellorish"" and saw the issue through the prism of Treasury rules. There were discussions about whether part of the money could be promised for some years, a technical solution that muddied waters and was dropped.  A third pointer to Mr Sunak's increased global activism is simply time. The longer prime ministers are in office, the more they find foreign affairs unavoidable and at times alluring, compared to the messy compromises of home.  This was apparent when Mr Sunak addressed Ukraine's parliament, an emotional event where MPs bellowed their national anthem, held a minute's silence for the dead and cheered the leader of a major ally - the first to visit this year - who was showing them some love after months of what they see as growing Western indifference.  ""I come from the world's oldest parliament to address the world's bravest,"" Mr Sunak told them. For a man seen by some as a rational technocrat, he was clearly affected by the emotion. And for a prime minister behind in the polls, repeated standing ovations from any audience are not to be sniffed at.  Rishi Sunak has not suddenly become some global interventionist, seeking to reshape the world in Britain's interests. But nor too is he as unengaged in foreign affairs as some would have it. He may not be prime minister beyond an election later this year. But until then, there will be no shortage of foreign policy and the decisions he makes will matter. "
risk appetite,Diabetes patients struggling without 'wonder drug',2024-09-15,2024-01-26,By Sophia Seth,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-68083710,"Diabetes patients have told the BBC they are struggling without what they have called a ""wonder drug"". Experts estimate about 400,000 people with Type 2 diabetes could have been affected by a national supply shortage caused by rising demand. The new generation of medicines - GLP-1 receptor agonists - mimic a hormone that not only controls blood sugar levels but also suppresses appetite. The government said it was trying to help resolve the supply chain issues. NHS England has issued a National Patient Safety Alert for the drugs. The NHS alerts require action to be taken by healthcare providers to reduce the risk of death or disability. The diabetes medicines in short supply are Ozempic, Trulicity, Victoza, Byetta, and Bydureon. They work via injections instead of tablets. Type 2 diabetes causes uncontrolled sugar levels that can lead to serious complications such as amputations, visual problems and heart disease. Dave Pomfrey, 66, lives near Winchester, in Hampshire, and has had the disease for 26 years. He was prescribed Victoza 18 months ago. ""It swiftly got my blood glucose under control and it helped me lose weight,"" he said.  ""I lost about three or four kilos in the first six or eight weeks. The way it stops you wanting to eat is a game-changer."" Calling it a ""wonder drug"", he urged that it should be taken under the advisement of health professionals due to its possible side effects.  The group of medicines has been used by the NHS for diabetes for around a decade but in recent years there has been a growth in private clinics prescribing the same drugs for weight loss for people who do not have diabetes, pushing up demand. Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Victoza, told the BBC it was experiencing shortages of its medicines for people in the UK with Type 2 diabetes due to ""unprecedented levels of demand"". It said awareness of GLP-1 receptor agonists has ""significantly increased after unprecedented coverage in the media and on social media"". Mr Pomfrey said he was told in August that he would not be able to get any more Victoza and should consider alternatives. ""It was quite worrying as I was told I would be on Victoza for some time as it was working well for me,"" he said.  ""I thought my future would be back on insulin, which I didn't want. I also worried about my old medicines that stopped working so well for me."" Bob Oxenbury, 69, from Poole in Dorset, was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2013.  He said he was introduced to Victoza about six years later.  ""Wow, It was amazing, a game-changing wonder drug,"" he said.  ""I am now having to try a new drug in tablet form to control my sugar levels. This new drug has unpleasant side effects and my health and wellbeing is now being affected. ""Diabetics are now having health issues due to the lack of supply so that the overweight community can continue to eat unhealthy food and inject it away."" Novo Nordisk said its factories were running ""24 hours a day, seven days a week"" to address the high demand.  The pharmaceutical firm said it had dedicated more than $5bn (£3.9bn) by the end of 2023 to open new production lines and facilities. It added that it was also working closely with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and was doing its ""utmost to discourage the off-label use of our medicines"". Kerry Budd, supervisor and dispenser at Purbrook Pharmacy in Waterlooville, Hampshire, said diabetes patients had been coming in ""upset and some of them angry"". Mitesh Patel runs 12 pharmacies across Hampshire and Dorset and said there were ""many people using diabetes drugs for weight loss"".  He added: ""We often see private prescriptions coming to us and we can't fulfil them."" Phillip Newland-Jones, a consultant pharmacist for diabetes at the University Hospital Southampton, said: ""When we started to look at this, at a national level, it's expected to affect around 400,000 people."" He said there had been an increase in admissions over the last six months in the number of people with high glucose levels who had been unable to access their medicine. But Mr Newland-Jones added: ""Thankfully, in the last few weeks, we have been able to secure an increased amount of the tablet version of the medicine but is not available for all.  ""The tablet is not quite as good as some of the injections, adequate for some, but not suitable for all."" Dr Amish Budhathoki, who has the disease, has a diploma in Type 2 diabetes.  He said he had been helped by Ozempic until it was stopped due to the shortage and was concerned about people who buy it privately. ""I am empathetic to people who genuinely want to lose weight,"" he said. ""But people who use it multiple times a week are at risk of pancreatitis and then, if their pancreas fails, they might actually get diabetes - it is not a quick fix.  ""It is important to monitor your diet and exercise with medication."" The Department for Health and Social Care said: ""We understand how frustrating and distressing medicine supply issues can be and we work with industry, the NHS and others operating across the supply chain to resolve these as quickly as possible.""

risk appetite,The fish that eats piranhas for breakfast,2024-09-15,2023-12-28,By Bob Howard,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-66786995,"Guillermo Otta Parum has been fishing in the Bolivian Amazon his whole life, for more than 50 years.  At first, Guillermo was catching native fish, such as the various kinds of catfish which inhabit the river.  But then a giant freshwater fish arrived, known locally as paiche or Arapaima gigas, to give it its scientific name.  ""I thought this creature was a water snake, that it would attack everything, that eating it would be bad for you, that it might be poisonous,"" he recalls. In fact, it is one of the biggest freshwater fishes in the world, growing up to 4m (13ft) in length and weighing 200kg (440lb) or more.   It is estimated that every year, the paiche spreads another 40km (25 miles) deeper into the rivers of the Amazon basin.  Federico Moreno, director of the Beni Autonomous University's Centre for Aquatic Resources Research, says its size and appetite make it a serious threat to native fish stocks.  ""It is a territorial fish, it takes over a body of water and scares off the native species. [That] is one of the serious problems. The other species flee from the predator and enter other bodies of water much further away, more remote and difficult to access."" No one really knows the exact year that the paiche first appeared in Bolivia. It is generally believed its arrival was the result of a breach of a paiche fish farm in Peru, where the fish are native. From there, they spread into Bolivia's rivers. Fernando Carvajal is a biologist and expert on the paiche. He says they are a ravenous species. ""During the first years of life, the paiche grows at the rate of 10kg (22lb) a year. That means the paiche is eating a lot of fish."" Unlike other predatory fish like piranha, it only has small, not particularly sharp teeth.  But its lack of impressive teeth does not stop it from eating piranha and a host of other fish, along with plants, molluscs and birds, all of which it hoovers up like a giant vacuum cleaner.  It also frightens off any fish which tries to eat the paiche's young.  Fernando Carvajal says there is no firm data about the impact of the paiche, but he says that anecdotally, fishermen are reporting that the numbers of some native species are dwindling.   ""In the next one or two decades, the paiche is going to spread to all the potential areas where this species can live,"" he warns. ""We know that around the world, most invasive cases are bad for nature. Invasive species are considered the second-biggest reason for the loss of biodiversity after habitat destruction."" However, for local fishermen, the arrival of the paiche has been a boon. Having been initially afraid of it, it did not take long for fishermen to realize its potential, says Guillermo Otta Parum. ""When I brought the first fish, I would give the customers small pieces as a gift for them to try so they would get a taste for it."" Some fishermen even pretended it was a type of catfish to overcome people's suspicions about eating such a huge specimen.   Now paiche are eaten across Bolivia. Edson Suzano runs a paiche-processing plant in Riberalta, a town in north-east Bolivia close to the Brazilian border. ""We sell it everywhere - supermarkets, markets. There are different cuts, so it is affordable. We buy and process around 30,000kg (66,138lb) per month,"" he says. The challenge for the fishermen is trying to find the paiche in the huge expanse of the Amazon.  The fish has a lung-like organ and has to come up for air regularly to breathe and so likes calmer water. It prefers to live in lakes and lagoons, but migrates when it feels it is in danger. Most of the fish Edson Silvano processes used to arrive by boat.  Now the fishermen travel to ever more remote areas to catch the paiche and have to transfer from boats to canoes, on journeys of up to two weeks. This is putting them in conflict with indigenous communities. These communities have been given land titles to many of the remote lagoons where paiche are now to be found and have themselves started fishing for and selling the fish.  Now commercial fishermen have to obtain special licences to work in these areas. But fishermen like Guillermo Otta Parum say that even when they have the correct paperwork, they are often turned away. The indigenous communities argue that they are only trying to protect the resources which the Bolivian government has recognised they have a right to control.   Juan Carlos Ortiz Chávez belongs to the Alto Ivon Tco Chacobo indigenous community.  He says that in the past, indigenous people were scared of commercial fishermen. ""But this new generation of young people has changed, because we have made our rules so that people can't come and take from us any more,"" he explains. Scientists such as Federico Moreno hope that fishing generally, whoever is doing it, will keep paiche numbers in check.   ""Keep hunting them, keep fishing for them all the time and that could keep a balance between the different species.""  To hear more about the paiche, listen to Assignment on the BBC World Service"
risk appetite,What's gone wrong at Ulster and what's next?,2024-09-15,2024-02-22,Matt Gault,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/68362041,"This video can not be played Watch: Ferris 'not surprised' by McFarland exit Ulster's mid-season tumult took a dramatic turn on Wednesday with the club confirming the end of head coach Dan McFarland's near six-year reign. Arriving on the back of Ulster's third successive defeat, McFarland's exit may not have come as a shock to most.  But go back to the turn of the year and it would have been hard to predict the Englishman's departure would come before the end of February.  Indeed, Ulster cantered into 2024 with their chests puffed out after a stirring three-game run that included a storming bonus-point Champions Cup win over Racing and festive interprovincial scalps over Connacht and Leinster. That's where the good vibes ended.  After their Champions Cup campaign following humbling defeats by Toulouse and Harlequins, Ulster's malaise deepened on their return from a four-week break with Ospreys fly-half Dan Edwards' match-winning drop-goal effectively bringing the curtain down on McFarland's time in Belfast.  Murphy takes Ulster interim job as McFarland departs 'Top class' Murphy backed to succeed at Ulster Ulster need 'someone like' Schmidt - Best Ulster clearly possess a squad capable of delivering big results, so where did it go wrong under McFarland? Stephen Ferris, who won a league title with the province in 2006, believes the ""negativity"" McFarland began to show in his media duties had filtered down to the players and fanbase. ""Sometimes, and I've been there myself, you need a change of voice,"" said Ferris, who likened to Ulster's 2023-24 season to a Faberge egg (""looks good on the outside, hollow on the inside""). ""You listen to the same person week in, week out for years on end. There's a couple like [Saracens director of rugby] Mark McCall or [Rob] Baxter at Exeter who are a one-off, but it's good to have a new voice. ""Giving Dan McFarland a new contract when they did [in 2022] in hindsight probably wasn't the right idea."" There was a time when Ulster could confidently talk up their title ambitions without raising any eyebrows. But for Ferris, the current group are a ""far cry"" from the days of Johann Muller, Ruan Pienaar and John Afoa.  And while the long-term goal must be to return Ulster to a position where can challenge for trophies, the immediate concern is securing European rugby for next season, the financial importance of which was underlined by chief executive Jonny Petrie saying a behind-closed-doors match against La Rochelle in December 2022 cost the club ""around £700,000"".  ""Usually, Ulster would put European giants to the sword and there's been big upsets, like Toulouse and Saracens,"" recalled Ferris. ""Fans want more of that. To take that away would make a lot of fans unhappy and there might be fewer season tickets bought for next year."" Ferris believes the Ulster players may benefit from a ""new voice"" If failing to bloody the noses of Toulouse and Harlequins reflected the gulf that exists between Ulster and the European elite, Ireland head coach Andy Farrell's matchday 23 for the Six Nations opener against France being shorn of Ulster representation was evidence of where the club sit in the Irish pecking order. Indeed, former captain Best went as far as saying Ulster would be most at risk if the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) revised their governance model.  ""Ultimately, there will come a point in time, and it happened during my career with Connacht, when the IRFU will have to look and say 'is this a sustainable model?' to keep all four provinces,"" said Best. ""It pains me to say it but right now if you were sitting in [IRFU chief executive] Kevin Potts' position, you'd be looking to go 'if we had to lose a province, which one would it be?' It's potentially Ulster and that's the sad reality of it.  ""The good thing is now that it's addressed, there's going to have to be support and we'll have to almost put Ulster Rugby on to a life support machine and make sure we figure out how we get that out and put it in intensive care.  ""That's about engagement. We have to grow the game and get the sponsors involved. People will have to put their shoulder to the wheel and understand that it's going to take a bit of time.  ""But it can be done. Ulster has too proud a history to let it slip away. We want to be seen as the top province, not the bottom one."" Ulster are also in the process of finding a new sponsor with their long-standing partnership with Kingspan set to end in 2025.  All that is continuing in the background. For now, reversing fortunes on the pitch is a matter of urgency for the revised coaching structure. And while downbeat on Ulster's season to this point, Ferris believes the campaign is not beyond salvaging, although he believes the club's Irish internationals must step it up when they're in domestic action.  ""The next game is against the Dragons [who are second from bottom in the URC]. After that, you look at the next game and try to build on it.  ""The worrying thing in recent weeks has been some of the Ulster players played for Ireland against Italy and played very well. ""But when they've played for Ulster this season, they haven't been particularly good. It looks like they haven't got as much appetite and hunger.  ""They need the energy and buzz back into the place. They need to be enjoying it. McFarland's facial expressions and demeanour were so negative in the last month. That filtered down into the guys. ""When you're doing what you love and get the best out of yourself, it's always with a smile on your face.""

risk appetite,Can green 'super powders' really make you healthy?,2024-09-15,2024-03-03,By Annabel Rackham,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-68412650,"Companies selling super green supplements claim a scoop of their magic powder, mixed with water, is all you need to improve your health. Many promise a long list of potential benefits, such as stronger hair and nails, increased energy and decreased bloating. The clean, often green packaging advertises a list of ingredients such as pre and probiotics, antioxidants and vitamins. But experts have told the BBC there are easier and cheaper ways to get these nutrients into our diets. Tamsin Hill, a registered dietitian for the NHS, says she first came across them through targeted social media advertising and, because of her job, looked into what they were offering. She looked at the market leader, Athletic Greens, which was last valued at £945m ($1.2bn), and claims that taking its superfood powder AG1 made users feel more energetic, have clearer skin and less cravings. ""I looked on the back of the packet at the ingredients and thought they weren't likely to improve your health in a significant way,"" she tells the BBC. Another company, Rheal Superfoods, which was featured on BBC programme Dragon's Den in 2021, claims its daily super greens blend supports digestive health, immune system and ""overall wellness from within"". Free Soul's FS Greens blend also makes similar claims, promising to offer digestion and immunity support through key ingredients such as ashwagandha, golden kiwi and maca. A spokesperson for Athletic Greens told the BBC: ""Our team of scientists and researchers have reviewed thousands of studies as part of the formulation and continuous improvement process for AG1.""  The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"". Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing. These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety. Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality."" She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable.""  Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"". She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"". Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"". One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030. ""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC. ""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds. Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose. ""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says. ""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds. Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health. Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"". There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"". ""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds. Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit. ""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds. She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables. Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"". ""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds. She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist."
risk appetite,Council to seek advice over goose droppings,2024-09-15,2024-03-11,Nick Clark,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lwvqw9p8jo,"A council will seek expert advice on how to deal with gardens and pavements ""inundated"" with goose droppings. Residents complained that more geese from Maiden Erlegh Nature Reserve, in Berkshire, were wandering further from the lake. They raised concerns that their droppings could pose a health risk to children playing outside. Earley Town Council said cleaning the streets was the responsibility of Wokingham Borough Council, which has been approached for comment. The town council said it could do little to control the geese because they were wild animals, and suggested residents put up temporary fences along their lawns while they seek expert advice. Town councillors were told Canada geese may be searching for shorter grass to eat, as well as to avoid an aggressive new pair of wild swans who attack adult birds. Secretary of a local residents association Steve Feltham told councillors his members complained last summer that ""front lawns and pavements were becoming inundated"" with droppings. ""Many of our residents and visitors to the lake are pleased to see the geese touring the estate with their young, but this does become a nuisance as the season wears on and the amount of goose droppings increases substantially,"" he said. Mr Feltham said there was ""no appetite"" among residents for a cull, and that a plan to prevent some eggs from hatching was rejected by the town council last year. Town clerk Jo Friend said cleaning up after the geese is ""too big an ask for a town council"". ""We don’t have a staff member who could go out regularly to clean pavements. We’d have to get permission from Wokingham Borough Council,"" she said, adding ""they’re not our geese, it’s not our pavement"". She also said it was unlikely Wokingham Borough Council would put more resources towards the problem for financial reasons. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

risk appetite,Warning over 'surge' in deadly dog disease cases,2024-09-15,2024-02-09,By Duncan Kennedy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-68248909,"Vets have issued a warning to dog owners after seeing a spike in cases of the dog disease Alabama Rot. Anderson Moores Vets in Winchester has been investigating the deadly disease in the UK for more than a decade. The disease, which can cause kidney failure, has led to the deaths of 318 dogs in the UK since 2012 - with 10 dying so far this year.  Owners are being urged to check for skin lesions and wash pets after muddy walks, to curb the risk of the disease. What causes Alabama Rot, also known as CRGV (cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy) which vets describe as very rare, is unknown. They believe it could be bacteria or a toxin.  If a dog contracts Alabama rot there is only a 10% chance it can be saved. Joshua Walker, a vet at Anderson Moores, said: ""We know the disease is associated with increasing rainfall and increasing temperatures in the autumn. ""It might be that the very wet, slightly warmer November has led to a surge in cases - it's important for everyone to be aware of the signs."" Skin lesions are normally found on the feet, legs, chest and abdomen of an affected pet, which can look like bites, sores, wounds or stings. Some dogs go on to develop life-threatening kidney failure.  Mr Walker said: ""If walking in the woods, particularly between November and May when most cases have been reported, as a precaution wash off any areas with mud. ""We don't know if that will prevent the disease but that seems like a reasonable thing to do to try and reduce transmission."" He added: ""It's important for everyone to be aware of the signs. If you do see an unexplained lesion, particularly if your dog is unwell, go to you local vets. ""Research is ongoing and we hope a cause will be forthcoming."" Hannah Povey, from Farringdon, Hampshire, warned of the disease's threat after her cocker spaniel Betsy was put down in November. She has urged dog owner's to ""get to know the symptoms"". Any age, sex, or breed of dog can be affected - though to date there have been more cases in Labradors, spaniels and Hungarian vizslas. The disease was first discovered in the US during the late 1980s. In the UK, cases are mostly seen in winter months.

risk appetite,The second life of Bulgaria's communist-era flats,2024-09-15,2024-04-05,Laura Cole,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240403-the-race-to-retrofit-europes-ex-communist-housing,"From Prague to Plovdiv, engineers and architects are giving a second life to communist-built apartment blocks in Central and Eastern Europe, ready for the climate change era. One of the oldest residents of one of the tallest building in Gabrovo city, Bulgaria, is former engineer Hristo Hristov. At nearly 90 years old and ""still obsessed"" with how things fit together, Hristov has lived in the block since it was built three decades ago. The block was designed in the 1970s, before the arrival of energy efficiency standards in Bulgaria, and completed in 1994. Until 2020, this 16-storey tower block was typical of the apartment buildings that dominate the skyline of not just Gabrovo, but cities across Central and Eastern Europe. Many of these blocks are cold, draughty and expensive to heat. Today, Hristov's block is warm and dry and energy bills in the block are half what they used to be. The change is down to a full energy retrofit of the tower, coordinated by Hristov. It required getting the agreement of every resident in the block to proceed – but, incredibly, this was achieved. ""A final few had us like a slow roast on a spit,"" he says, making use of an old Bulgarian phrase. ""But there are 80 families here and even with full funding some people, understandably, needed persuading,"" he says. ""These are their homes."" Now the concrete block, left bare for decades, is well insulated, its old balconies are enclosed, and it is clad in clean pastel colours. As one of the first blocks to be renovated in Gabrovo, the tower signaled the start of a slow change to the post-industrial city. And Gabrovo's transformation is in turn part of a change happening across hundreds of cities in the region, as post-communist countries look to upgrade their crumbling apartment blocks. As climate change puts pressure on cities to use less energy to heat and cool buildings, and to help insulate residents against temperature extremes, the race to retrofit these apartment blocks is only getting more urgent. Monolithic skylines have become symbolic in Central and Eastern European cities. While brutalist apartments can be found in many parts of Europe, the rapid urbanisation of former-communist countries in the second half of the 20th Century means large, concrete blocks make up a high proportion of their building stock today. Though there were several evolutions of design – from the prefabricated panel blocks to modernist towers – they usually had something in common: bare outer walls made of concrete or brick, with little insulation. Approximately one third of the Bulgarian population lives in apartments built during communism, a similar proportion as in the Czech Republic and Poland. In Latvia more than 50% live in the ex-communist blocks, while in Estonia the figure is as high as 70%. Miles Glendinning, professor of architectural conservation at the Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, says that modernist housing blocks in Central and Eastern Europe usually don't receive the same level of public stigma as those in Western cities. They are simply a part of daily city life. But as the blocks age and become inadequate in terms of energy efficiency, there's the question of what to do with them – demolish or retrofit? Demolition is often not popular and rarely feasible. In Bulgaria, a high level of private ownership, at around 85%, means the buildings would be problematic to tear down and build anew. Plus, rebuilding housing is costly. A study by researchers at Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia, found that tearing down blocks to rebuild similar housing in the country would cost three to four times more than even an intense retrofit. ""For many reasons, the blocks are likely here to stay,"" says Dragomir Tsanev, director of EnEffect, an energy efficiency non-profit in Sofia, Bulgaria. Although many Bulgarian apartments have outlived their intended lifespans of 50 years, ""some studies have shown they should be no less structurally sound than newer buildings, so long as they are well maintained"". That said, more data is needed to fully understand the picture, Tsanev says, especially on energy efficiency. Most of the blocks fall into EU energy classes E, F and G – the worst performing bands. And while several post-communist states are addressing this inefficiency, it's less of an organised joint project across states than ""a movement, or even several parallel movements"" spurred by many factors, says Glendinning. Among the strongest drivers are national decarbonisation goals and European Union-backed renovation programmes. According to EU Commission estimates, buildings are responsible for 40% of its energy consumption and 36% of its greenhouse gas emissions. Governments have widely decided that modernising the continent's building stock is key to combatting climate change. A strategy published by the European Commission in 2020 aims to double energy renovation rates by 2030. Tsanev sees ""huge appetite"" for building renovation in Bulgaria. In the last funding cycle for a full grant, 3,068 hopeful buildings applied. There was only enough funding for 756. ""The unsuccessful proposals represent time and money the residents put into their buildings,"" he says. They all would have had to obtain 100% consent from neighbours, a huge challenge, and would have spent money on a technical and energy audits, he says. ""Residents end up disenchanted with renovation. On the technical side, refits go too slowly."" For Tsanev, the wave of energy retrofits will only take shape with easy, streamlined involvement for residents and ""fairer"" financial mechanisms. The Bulgarian government was contacted for comment but did not reply by the time of publication. Back in Gabrovo, Mogiliov Boulevard gives a snapshot of the Bulgarian situation. Here, a dual carriageway is lined with cheek-by-jowl panel blocks, a type of building constructed in the old Communist style from prefabricated concrete panels. Nine of the blocks applied for the recent funding round and just one block won. One half of a block, renovated in the last round, even won awards for best facade. Its conjoined twin remains concrete. Under the unrenovated portion, a restaurant is packed with locals at lunchtime. Diners share plates of grilled kebapche (a type of sausage) and talk over house music on radio N-JOY. ""We wanted to apply,"" says one diner who lives in one of the flats above, requesting anonymity because of the tense nature of the subject in the neighbourhood. ""The majority of us were in agreement [to seek full state funding for a retrofit] but a few hold-outs wouldn't bite."" ""We applied, but it didn't work,"" says another diner, Teodora, who lives in a block down the boulevard which was unsuccessful in getting funding. ""We want to be more energy efficient so we will just do it ourselves."" She says she will insulate her apartment with wraparound external insulation. To buffer an individual flat in this piecemeal way is something Tzveta Naniova, an energy efficiency expert, strongly advises against. ""It can scupper a building application down the line,"" she says, and it also presents fire safety hazards. But she can understand the thinking. ""People want to save money and are frustrated with the uncertain grant cycle,"" she says. Naniova is the owner of a ""one-stop shop"" in the capital of Sofia. The aim of the shops – a lynchpin of the European Union's plan for buildings – is to act as the first point of contact for residents to get up to speed with retrofit requirements and give them easy access to the contacts involved. ""Not everyone should have to get a degree in engineering or architecture,"" she says. ""We have experts in the field,” she says of her colleagues. ""We should use them."" Bulgaria, Naniova believes, must move away from requiring 100% resident support, to a majority of homeowners per block. She also believes Bulgaria should move towards a more market-based model. ""There is not enough state money to finance all the renovations,"" she says. Other countries take a different approach. Naniova points to Lithuania as an example of good practice, such as the city of Vilnius and the ""renovation capital"" Marijampolé. ""The country changed from a grant-only approach and instead harnessed public funding to de-risk the private investment,"" says Naniova. ""But what helps the most is that the loan is connected to the building, not individual residents."" In other words, if an apartment sells, the loan stays with the property, not the person. For the lowest-income residents, financial assistance is also available. ""[Lithuania] got started 10 years ago and we are trying to catch up,"" agrees Tsanev. ""Without attractive loans to be paid back from energy savings, we cannot expect people to accept the changes."" For Bulgaria, he would also like to see clarified, full grant support for apartment dwellers with low income. (The Bulgarian government was contacted for comment but did not reply by the time of publication.) Even in the fastest-renovating countries, there is a desire to ramp up the pace. ""We need to be faster,"" says Lauri Lihtmaa, an expert at the Net Zero Energy Research Group at Tallinn in Estonia. The rate for deep renovations, largely defined as buildings that improve the energy efficiency by at least 60%, are just 0.2% annually across the EU. Prefabricated technologies could spur the rate, Lihtmaa believes. In the Estonian city of Tartu's Annelinn neighbourhood, a deep renovation project has experimented with factory-made facades, and used a crane rather than scaffolding to install them. Another experiment, in the Baltic country's northern city of Saue, insulated a building with prefabricated panels made from re-used, recycled and locally based bio-based materials in order to reduce their environmental impact. Another option would be to renovate whole districts at once, Lihtmaa says. A model for district-based renovation is more ambitious, as it would increase the role of the local municipality and need more involvement from residents, he argues, but it could be a ""unique opportunity for greater volumes"" of retrofits. District-level renovation is already planned in some cities, such as the Mustamäe District of Tallinn, the Estonian capital, which was one of the first mass-produced housing projects under Soviet occupation. Back in Gabrovo, Hristo Hristov believes a model for renovating the blocks needs to include other improvements, not just energy efficiency – fire safety, in particular. And though he admits that going up and down the floors to check renovations lost him the full use of his knees, ""the effort was something worthwhile to leave behind"". Tsanev feels Hristov's achievement is bittersweet. ""His story should be the rule not the exception, if we're to succeed."" -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights. "
risk appetite,Will Starbucks be a hit in South Africa?,2024-09-15,2016-04-22,Pumza Fihlani,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36110392,"Residents of South Africa's biggest city are brand conscious and rarely need much persuasion to try something new - so many were up for tasting their first cup of coffee from Starbucks when the US giant opened its doors in Johannesburg this week. Long queues formed outside the cafe in Rosebank, an upmarket part of the city, braving the uncharacteristically chilly April weather.  Johannesburg - which boasts a healthy black middle class with a bit more disposable income - is as good a place as any in Africa to test out a luxury brand.  It is the first Starbucks in sub-Saharan Africa and the launch party on Wednesday night was attended by many city socialites. Those who waited outside, some overnight, for the public opening the next day took selfies which they posted on social media - and #StarbuckSA trended on Twitter for most of Thursday. Cousins Tsholo Moncho and Keabetswe Kgantisoe, who live in Boksburg about 30km (20 miles) away, made the trip just for the opening.   Cousins Tsholo Moncho and Keabetswe Kgantisoe were eager to savour a Starbucks ""I had my first Starbucks on holiday in England and I'm so happy that they've come here it's about time,"" says 18-year-old Ms Kgantisoe.  Ms Moncho said she had never tried a Starbucks before and was full of anticipation. ""Keabetswe dragged me here and I can't wait to try it. I really wanted to be one of the first people to have a taste,"" the 28-year-old says. But some on social media did not get what the excitement was about, saying they preferred other chains or complaining about the blandness of global brands.  Stand-up comic Mark Palmer tried to put it into perspective by making a wry comparison with the long queues for South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994 after the end of apartheid. Nonetheless, South Africans seem to lap up American consumer culture. Starbucks joins Walmart, Burger King, Krispy Kreme, Dominos Pizza - who are hoping to strike it lucky too like McDonalds and KFC which have been here for many years and are well loved.  Taste Holdings, Starbucks' South African franchise partner, also responsible for bringing in Domino Pizza, is optimistic about the market. ""The South African coffee market is vibrant and growing. With a growing consumption rate, this is a great opportunity to reach new customers,"" says the company's CEO Carlo Ganzaga. And South Africans do seem to love their caffeine fix - a coffee culture that has changed dramatically over recent years. They do not mind paying a bit more for a good cup of coffee and coffee shops are now a common sight in most cities. That selfie moment outside the new Rosebank Starbucks This might seem strange in a country of vast contrasts - where poverty, extreme mineral wealth and a growing middle glass intermingle.  But Starbucks seems to have positioned itself competitively with local established brands like Mugg n Bean and Nescafe.   A cup of coffee costs around $2 (£1.40) at all three outlets.  Starbucks plans to open 15 more stores in South Africa over the next two years.  It already sources a considerable amount of its coffee from farms in Africa and has franchises in North Africa - but has no other plans of expanding outlets into the rest of the continent. Financial analyst Celeste Fauconnier says investors come to South Africa because ""it has the easiest business environment to work in and has better infrastructure than some countries"". South Africa is happy to welcome companies that can help tackle unemployment, because in spite of being the continent's most industrialised nation - 25% of people are jobless. ""With the two stores openings we have created a number of opportunities not only by employing [38] baristas but also by using local contractors and through our supply chain,"" Mr Ganzaga tells me.  But some are worried that a second ""gold rush"" in South Africa by global corporations, and even China, could hamper the country's recovery from decades of white minority rule. Anyone for a Frappuccino? South Africans are open to trying something new So how can local industries be protected while opening up to world markets? ""The retail sector here is still largely informal so there is no threat that it will be overtaken by the companies looking to establish businesses here,"" says Ms Fauconnier. ""Big retailers coming in will however put pressure on entrepreneurs but Africans are known for being enterprising and will find ways around any challenges posed by the new competition."" One of the biggest challenges for small South African businesses is funding, in spite of some government schemes.  Banks are largely risk averse when it comes to start-ups and some argue big international firms with capital may have an unfair advantage.  But as Starbucks is not cheaper than the local competition, it will still have to work to win a place in the hearts of South Africans. And with their developing taste for the finer things in life, they are happy to be wooed. Anyone for a Frappuccino? South Africa's appetite for fast food.

risk appetite,Watch out for heat exhaustion and heatstroke,2024-09-15,2022-07-12,By Michelle Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-62120167,"During the hot weather, it can be easy to overheat.  Environmental temperatures of 40C (104F) can make it difficult to keep the body at its ideal 37C. While heat exhaustion is not usually serious, as long as you can cool yourself down, heatstroke is a medical emergency.  Heat exhaustion happens when your body becomes too hot and struggles to regulate its temperature. It can affect anyone, including fit and healthy people - especially if they are doing strenuous exercise in high temperatures or have been drinking alcohol in the sun all day. It can come on quickly, over minutes, or gradually, over hours. The symptoms you will feel are your body's way of warning you to cool down, fast. An obvious sign is excessive sweating, as well as feeling very hot and unwell.  Other symptoms include: Young children, who might not be able to tell you about how they are feeling, may become floppy and sleepy.  Heat exhaustion can turn into heatstroke, which is an emergency. It means your body can no longer manage the heat and your core temperature is rising too high. You should get urgent medical help.  The signs to watch for and quickly act on:   Older adults and young infants, as well as people with long-term health conditions, are particularly at risk.  The body's ability to regulate its temperature is not fully developed in the young and may be reduced by illness, medications or other factors in older adults. Being overweight or obese may also make it harder to cool down. If someone has heat exhaustion:  Stay with them until they are better. They should start to cool down and feel better within 30 minutes.  If they do not improve after 30 minutes of rest, and you think they may have heatstroke,you should get urgent medical help. "
risk appetite,More than 200 courses scrapped in T-level rollout,2024-09-15,2023-10-19,Nathan Standley,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-67132740,"The government has updated its list of over 200 qualifications to be scrapped as part of the rollout of T-levels. The qualifications, including BTecs and other post-GCSE courses, were taken by a total of over 50,000 students per year in England in 2020-21, according to the government's enrolment data. They are being removed to ""streamline further education"", the Department for Education (DfE) said. But some college principals have said it could be damaging to students. First launched in 2020, a T-level is roughly equivalent to three A-levels. They are two-year vocational courses aimed at 16 to 19-year-olds which focus on a particular area of employment, like construction, education or healthcare, and include 45 days of industry placement. T-levels are central to the prime minister's long-term plans to combine them with A-levels to form a single baccalaureate-style qualification called the Advanced British Standard. But there have been issues with the DfE's rollout of T-levels. In March, colleges faced disruption as the government said it was delaying four forthcoming programmes to ensure they could be ""delivered to a high standard"". And in April, the Education Select Committee said the DfE risked ""constricting student choice"" if it progressed with plans to withdraw funding for more established vocational courses like BTecs, collectively known as applied general qualifications. More than 130 such courses which ""overlap"" with the first T-level programmes will have their funding removed from next August. According to DfE data, more than 39,500 students were enrolled on these courses in 2020-21. Another 85, published in a new list on Thursday, will see their funding withdrawn from August 2025. The same data showed another 17,500 enrolments on these courses.  The courses to be defunded across both years (with number of enrolments in brackets) include: Hannah Cheesman, 17, is in the second year of her BTec in IT at Harlow College in Essex. She is one of 600 students at the college currently studying a course scheduled for defunding by 2025. Hers will be unavailable to new students from next year. ""It's quite scary,"" she said. ""If I'm going into the workplace and I'm up against someone who's done this T-level they're taking as the new standard, it worries me that down the line my courses aren't going to be recognised as highly."" Some college principals have said they are concerned the take-up of T-levels has been too slow to bridge the gap that will be left behind by the defunded courses. At Harlow College, 70 students out of 2,800 are doing T-levels, principal Karen Spencer said. She believes the current plan is too ""high-risk"". ""The issue for me with defunding qualifications is that we're ploughing ahead defunding things without actually knowing what we've got in their place,"" she said. There are no national entry requirements for T-levels, but the high standard of assessment means most colleges require strong GCSE grades to get on to a programme - leaving some principals worrying about a lack of options for those who do not achieve those grades once the alternative qualifications disappear.  Bill Webster, principal of Bolton College, said he ""sees the value"" of T-levels - as do the local employers running the work placements, he said - but there is still appetite for alternative courses. ""Where we switched off other courses for one of our T-levels, we lost students who went to do the BTec,"" he said. Cath Sezen, director of education at the Association of Colleges, advised on the development of T-levels, but says focus should now be on ""students for whom a T-level is not the right option"".  ""Often people who are left behind are people who, for whatever reason, have struggled in the school system,"" she said. ""We can't have people left behind - that's really important."" James Kewin, deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, has helped co-ordinate the Protect Student Choice campaign, which is calling on the government ""to stop the scrapping of BTecs in its tracks"". ""For some students, the T-level is a fantastic qualification, but our view is it's not a mass market qualification,"" he said. ""The government is attempting to replace, in the BTec, a mass market product with a minority product. And that's the problem."" Robert Halfon, minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said T-levels were a ""robust"" qualification, supporting the government's goal to ""future-proof education"". He said most of the 85 courses to be defunded from 2025 had fewer than 100 enrolments in 2020-21. ""Removing funding from the list of qualifications published today streamlines further education and ensures that anyone taking a technical course can be confident that they are getting a qualification respected by employers,"" he added.

risk appetite,Trump's Truth Social shares hit by sale plan,2024-09-15,2024-04-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68819567,"Donald Trump's social media company is eyeing plans to issue millions more shares, just as the former president's hush-money criminal trial begins in New York. The move from Trump Media also marked a step toward letting insiders, including Mr Trump, sell their holdings.The company has already been hit by a wave of selling since official trading started after its formal stock exchange debut in March.  Shares fell another 14% on Monday. As Mr Trump sat quiet and motionless in the courtroom shares in the company which runs the social media platform Truth Social slid to less than $28 apiece. It debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange last month, via a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp, a shell company that was created in 2021 to find a firm to buy and make public.  The deal, which briefly sent the share price surging above $70, injected about $200m into the company and has generated billions of dollars in paper wealth for Mr Trump, who is the majority shareholder.  Mr Trump, who is currently running for re-election while facing numerous legal battles, is currently barred from selling his shares until about September.  In a regulatory filing, Trump Media said a potential 146.1 million shares could be sold, including 114.8 million shares owned by Mr Trump.  It also notified investors of plans to issue roughly 21.5 million additional shares in connection with warrants, which give the owner the right to shares at a certain price. Trump Media said it expected to raise about $247m via such sales, which are common after a public listing like Trump Media's. The update, which had been expected, had been in the pipeline for some time.  ""There are no new issuances of shares being disclosed for the first time in the preliminary S-1 filed today. All categories of issuances were previously disclosed in public filings prior to the shareholder vote for our merger,"" the company said in a statement.  Still, shares in the firm fell to their lowest levels since January after the announcement.  Analysts say Trump Media shares remain over-valued compared with the size of Truth Social, which attracted an estimated 7.7 million visits last month. Its auditor has warned it is at risk of failure, after it reported less than $5m (£4m) in sales and more than $50m (£40.1m) in losses in 2023. Analysts have said appetite for Trump Media stock has been boosted by small-time investors, rather than big Wall Street firms. Their bets on the company caused a big spike in the price of Digital World shares when the plan to buy Trump Media was first announced in 2021 and again in January, as Mr Trump emerged as the leading Republican presidential candidate.  In recent weeks, Mr Trump has sought to raise confidence in the company, noting that Truth Social was ""the primary way I get the word out and, for better or worse, people want to hear what I have to say"". ""If people who believe in putting America First and want to Make America Great Again, support TRUTH, we will be your Voice like never before,"" he urged his followers on the platform over the weekend.  ""Think of this as a Movement, the Greatest Movement in the History of our Country,"" he said."
risk appetite,Where to find Italy's 'dolce vita' in real life,2024-09-15,2024-04-11,Andrea Carlo,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240410-ripleys-dolce-vita-is-in-black-and-white-but-the-amalfi-coasts-tiny-towns-are-in-technicolour,"Despite being a noir thriller, Netflix's Ripley brings new life to Italy's romanticised notion of la dolce vita. Here's how to experience it in the Amalfi Coast's sleepy villages. La dolce vita, or ""the sweet life"" – popularised by Federico Fellini's eponymous 1960 film – is the single phrase that sold Italy as a rainbow-coloured land where dreams are made. It's an ephemeral term that immediately evokes an unmistakable aesthetic: neon-orange Aperol Spritzes, Vespa scooters, cappuccinos in the piazza, Mediterranean expanses of sea and sky – images that have long fuelled the imagination of filmmakers, authors and, most recently, social media influencers. This year has given us yet another serving of ""la dolce vita"" with a sprinkle of something sour: Ripley, the newest rendition of Patricia Highsmith's 1955 crime novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley has just hit Netflix. Written, executive produced and directed by Academy Award winner Steven Zaillian (The Irishman) and starring Irish actor Andrew Scott (Sherlock, Fleabag), the series updates Hollywood's 1999 star-studded film, following the original's similarly oneiric trail – from the Amalfi Coast's crags to Venice's lagoon – while telling a story of a sociopathic fraudster whose obsession descends to unfettered depths. But Zaillian's Ripley is Hitchcock-inspired Italy noir; the country's legendary technicolour landscapes are literally painted in drab black and white. For once, viewers are treated to the sweet life in Italy where everything looks sublime, but terrible things happen. As Ripley freshly whets our appetite for all things Italian, it simultaneously begs the age-old question: does the fabled ""dolce vita"" even exist? And how can it be experienced today? In Ripley, the namesake protagonist, Tom, takes on a con job to persuade a rich man's son, Dickie Greenleaf, to return home from his prolonged Italian vacation. Leaving his crummy New York City brownstone for what turns into a romp across Italy, Tom's first stop is the village of Atrani on the Amalfi Coast. Much of the plot centres on this small corner of the country; indeed, nowhere better embodies ""the dolce vita"" vision than this region's rugged beauty, where lemon orchards flank medieval churches perched on scenic cliffs, and vintage cars lay nestled in pastel-coloured alleyways. In many ways, the Amalfi Coast feels like a time capsule; perhaps that's why it's so synonymous with the ""sweet life"". As a product of Fellini's own film, which was famously set in Rome, the iconography of the ""dolce vita"" concept is itself intrinsically imbued with mid-20th-Century imagery. The 1950s and '60s have long been seen as a ""golden era"" when Italy was suspended between two ages – its pre-war state as a land of tradition, rural life, religious devotion, decaying artistic glories, and a post-war industrial boom that saw Fiat 500, Vespa 98 scooters, Olivetti typewriters and Moka coffee machines. Rome eventually embraced modernity while the Amalfi Coast prefers things the way they were; Rome's chaos rises to the surface while the Amalfi Coast's problems simmer beneath the postcard veneer. Ripley itself is set in the same year as La Dolce Vita, each exquisite historical set detail wrought to perfection, from postage stamps to lire notes. Italian nationals of a certain age will inevitably suffer pangs of nostalgia to witness relics of the bygone era, like luxurious train cars and a soundtrack peppered with music by beloved Italian 1960s pop star Mina. Nowadays, in Positano and Amalfi, visitors are spoon fed a pre-packaged ""dolce vita"" – the ancient towns dominated by restaurants and hotels catered to satisfying expectations. Plasticised multilingual menus abound and tourists pack the narrow cobblestoned streets, blocking out the most stunning panoramas – every corner turned into someone's Instagram shoot. In winter, these cities effectively turn into liminal spaces: the streets empty and souvenir stalls lay dormant like closed-down rides at amusement parks, ready to entertain the throng of visitors once the high season kicks off again. It's in the Amalfi Coast's smaller localities, like the far less-touristed fishing villages of Praiano and Atrani – where a more candid version of ""the dolce vita"" still exists. In Praiano, heading east from Positano, locals gather at the Bar del Sole to sip cappuccino before noon and Campari before dusk. Neapolitan pop music plays on boomboxes and shops sell colourful ceramic tiles that locals display on the many homes peppered along the winding Via Masa down to the town's tiny beach. Once Sunday arrives, the bell of the Unesco-listed blue-and-white cupolaed Church of San Gennaro summons the town to the small square that overlooks the impossible, rugged beauty of the coast. Tourists are merely a part of the picture: Praiano's community life is alive and well. At local eateries such as chef Gennaro Galani's seafood restaurant Saghir or the Trattoria San Gennaro, locals are just as much of a presence as visitors. Take a stomach-wrenching bus voyage to Amalfi on the meandering clifftop SS163 state road with 300m death drops, then walk 800m east through the Luna Rossa car park to reach Atrani. The smallest municipality in Italy, Atrani has protected its traditions as tightly as it envelops its small beach, which remains free from the mass of tourists descending on Positano and Amalfi's shorelines. It's a magical place in many ways – in Ripley, Dickie's girlfriend, Marge, spends her time trying (and failing) to capture its essence in a book. In the real world, Atrani sheltered the Dutch artist MC Escher, who used its labyrinths of mesmerising staircases as inspiration for some of his works. Italy's staircases are a common symbol throughout the series, emblematic of Tom's constant uphill social and emotional struggle, and very much part of daily life for locals and visitors today. For those strong of heart, it's a 750-step climb to reach Atrani's crown jewel: the Sanctuary of Santa Maria del Bando, a Baroque chapel perched atop a cliff overlooking the bay. Venturing up to Dickie's Moorish-styled mansion (Villa Torricella), however, will require a boat ride – it's actually in Capri, and bookable via Airbnb. Behind the dolce often lies the amaro – the bitter. And Italy, alas, is not free from that. The country has long suffered from many troubles, from a north-south economic disparity to unemployment, crime and disillusionment. Many of those working to sustain tourists' ""dolce vita"" dreams are themselves young graduates, forced into low-paying service jobs due to lack of opportunities. The new Ripley frequently pinches us in the midst of our ""dolce vita"" daydreams, highlighting the cracks in the surface – much like Fellini's own film in 1960. Compared to the more postcard-perfect 1999 original, the newer incarnation is much darker. It references Italian bureaucracy, crime and even Naples's infamous local Mafia (Camorra). Tom is scammed by an unscrupulous taxi driver as soon as he sets foot in Napoli Centrale train station and is approached by a two-bit mafioso in a piazza in Atrani. As Tom goes about his own nefarious deeds, he is constantly eyed warily by locals, who have caught the whiff of another huckster among them. Much of the dialogue between Tom and Dickie centres around the art of the con, as Tom toys with his prey. Ironically, Dickie can smell the mafioso a mile away, but tragically fails to grasp the extent of Tom's dark genius. The series often references painter Caravaggio, and it feels much like one of his paintings – baroque, sensual, leaning heavily on a chiaroscuro (literally ""light-dark) showing Italy's stark contrasts. When romanticising Italy, people often offload all its sins to one place: Naples, long renowned for its crime and garbage problems. But Amalfi is set in the same cultural context as Naples, a city synonymous with several of ""the dolce vita's"" own staples, from pizza to espresso. It's a fairy tale place in many ways, with Baroque palaces set against the backdrop of Mount Vesuvius. But it airs its dirty laundry just like the sheets hanging on the clotheslines in its streets. It's a city that has suffered devastating economic and social woes, and where many of its most colourful traditions – from street art to local folklore – were born as a response to such oppression. To ignore or overlook Naples – a jewel of a city, despite its centuries-old woes – is to fundamentally misunderstand Italy and ""the dolce vita"" from the outset. While the dolce vita dream may have a clearly defined aesthetic, it also has a distinct modus operandi – dolce far niente, or ""doing nothing is sweet"". Indeed, it is the ""doing nothing"" that is the main driver of Ripley's plot, as Dickie's father worries about his son's inertia. Owing to its balmier climate and longstanding agricultural society, life in Italian villages was often slow and revolved around the lunch table. Golden Age Cinecittà-Hollywood packaged this lifestyle into a box with a ""dolce vita"" sticker. And now it's been adopted as Italy's unofficial way of living, and a lucrative selling point. But the truth is, you don't need to go all the way to Amalfi to find ""the dolce vita"" – you can find hints of it almost anywhere in the country, even in the larger cities. A quick espresso at the bar, an aimless vasca (lap) around the piazza, a lunch that takes four hours from antipasto to amaro. ""The dolce vita"" is about enjoying the small pleasures of everyday living, in its full spontaneity. In Ripley, Marge's choice to write an entire book about Atrani is something of an inside joke – not much happens in that tiny burg, then or now. Locals laze in piazzas, haul their groceries up staircases; visitors wander about in search of excitement, stopping just short of hiking up that last set of stairs, contenting themselves with a gelato and aperitivo in the piazza as they gaze out at the ink blue Gulf of Naples. Adopting the ""dolce far niente"" mindset can be a radical act at times. Learn to let go and embrace the silence. Or the chaos."
risk appetite,Living with obesity: Hard-wired to store fat,2024-09-15,2021-06-17,By Claire Kendall and Jeremy Cooke,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57419041,"Specialist health professionals say it is time for obesity to be regarded as an illness caused by genetics, biology and how we live today. New research adds to growing scientific opinion that ""healthy obesity"" does not exist. The findings show those who are significantly overweight have a 66% higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, compared with those of a normal weight. Many people with obesity say not only do they have to live with prejudice and stigma, but they struggle to find treatment. Sarah has lived with obesity her entire adult life. The 39-year-old mum has a Body Mass Index, or BMI, of over 40, which means she is medically classified as having ""severe obesity"" and is overweight enough for her health to be at risk. ""People think you're unintelligent, that you're lazy, that you eat too much, that you've done this to yourself. That it's a choice,"" she says. ""I just want to scream and say none of those things are right."" Sarah has spent most of her life trying to control her weight through diet and exercise, and says her obesity is something that she thinks about every day.  Growing up in Jersey, in the Channel Islands, Sarah was a ""normal-sized"" girl, until the end of primary school when she began to develop before some of the other girls in her class. By the time she went to an all-girls secondary school, the changes of puberty meant she started to feel different from many of her friends.  In her early teens, she was aware her mum had regularly struggled with her own weight and had tried lots of diets, so as Sarah's weight increased, she did the same.  At 16, she decided to go on an 800-calorie-a-day milkshake diet. Over the summer before starting her A-levels, she says she dropped from a size 14 to a size 10. At the time, it made her feel ""brilliant"". But, in hindsight, she realises this was the start of years and years of yo-yo dieting.  Sarah was around a size 12 when she started university. But when she graduated three years later, she had grown to a size 20. The student lifestyle - drinking and eating late - meant she couldn't keep on top of her weight.  But unlike when she was 16, this time diets weren't working. It was the start of a struggle to regulate her weight. Scientists have found that people's genetic background means their weight changes differently, even if they eat the same amount of calories. After university, Sarah started working in the pharmaceutical industry. She was performing well as a sales person, selling a diabetes drug. But she was taken aback after her boss told her that when he first met her he remembers thinking, ""You better be a bloody good sales rep, looking the way you do, trying to sell a diabetes drug"". Sarah now says it should be against the law to make comments about body shape and size. By the time she was 30, Sarah had severe obesity and was desperate to do something about it for the sake of her mental and physical health. She embarked on a year-long project with a personal trainer and completed an Olympic-class triathlon - swimming 1.5km, cycling 40km and running 10km. She also lost eight-and-a-half stone (55kg). Around this time, she had some tests which looked at her genetic make-up. The results found two important things:  Shaw Somers, a consultant surgeon who specialises in weight-loss operations, has been treating people with severe obesity for many years. He says people like Sarah, who have an inherited set of certain genes, are much more likely to develop obesity compared with those who don't.  But obesity is not just about genetics, he says. It is also about psychology, inequalities and the food environment we all live with. Historically, he says, people with these genetics would have done well in a famine, but with today's plentiful, high-calorie food they will put on weight ""without strong determination and support"". Dr Denise Ratcliffe, a clinical psychologist who supports patients through bariatric surgery, says people's past experiences can come into play. She says that many of the people she sees, have experienced trauma, abuse or neglect, for example, which leads to a dysfunctional relationship with food. ""I think there's something about the psychological experiences people have, and the relationships that they start to form with foods, that becomes almost like a perfect storm.""   Both the genetic and psychological components of obesity can be amplified when there is easy access to fatty, sugar-laden foods, which are available cheaply and conveniently.  Sarah's friend Jed has lived on an estate in Hull all his life. He lives with obesity, and thinks areas like his can have a big effect on the health of those living there. Across the road from his house, he remembers the parade of shops once having a greengrocer's and a butcher's - now eight of the 20 shops are fast-food outlets. ""We've got a chicken place, we've got a burger place, we have got a fish shop, we've got a kebab shop, another kebab place, another chip shop, and a Chinese,"" he says. Jed says that he recently signed a petition to try to prevent another takeaway from opening.  ""If you look at any area in your city, which is at a low level of socio-economic standing, I guarantee there's going to be more takeaways. We don't need to kick areas like this down. We need to lift them up."" After training for the triathlon and losing eight-and-a-half stone, Sarah continued to train regularly and eat well. But she noticed that gradually she started to become heavier. Whatever she did, it made no difference.  Dr Abd Tahrani, a senior lecturer in obesity medicine at the University of Birmingham, says there are a lot of people who are ""biologically pre-designed to conserve energy"", which is stored as fat. He explains that signals from the hypothalamus - the part of the brain that controls appetite - bombard the person with feelings of hunger and a desire to eat, that are almost impossible to fight.  So even if the person successfully loses several stone by dieting, their body remembers its baseline weight and strives to return to it. Studies from GP records in the UK showed that the annual chance of achieving normal weight in people with morbid obesity is one-in-700 to one-in-1,000. As Sarah started to research obesity, she realised that after a lifetime of blaming herself, she understood that it was actually her body ""working against her"".  New research from a team made up of specialists from the University of Birmingham, the University Hospitals of Birmingham, and Warwick Medical School, has found that people living with obesity have a 66% higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease than those with normal body weight. This is the case, even if they have no underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.  The work has just been published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease and involved studying 4.5 million patient records from GPs in the UK over 20 years.  This adds to a growing body of scientific research which has found that ""healthy obesity does not exist"", says Professor Indranil Dasgupta, consultant nephrologist at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, and senior author of the research paper. Previous studies from the same team found those living with obesity without any other health conditions also have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Obesity in the UK Many professionals with an understanding of obesity believe there needs to be a huge shift within the medical profession, and society as a whole, in how the condition is viewed.  ""Public perception hasn't quite understood that it's a real illness,"" says bariatric weight loss surgeon Shaw Somers. ""With each passing year that we fail to get on board with managing the obesity epidemic, it gets exponentially worse. Unless we start to take this issue seriously, it will totally undermine the NHS' ability to cope in the near future."" There also needs to be a big change in the understanding of treatment, according to Mr Somers. Too many weight management programmes for those living with obesity begin with ""moving more and eating less"", which in reality is a prevention for obesity, not a cure.   ""The number of people I've encountered in my 30-year career who've been able to go from morbid obesity, to normal weight, and sustain it by dieting alone - well I don't think I've ever met one. It's so hard to do."" Evidence suggests that people like Sarah, whose bodies are hard-wired to put on and retain fat, may put in all the work, and still not get the result they badly want. This can be a huge mental strain. ""I went through some really dark times, because I felt like a failure,"" says Sarah. Psychologist Dr Denise Ratcliffe says that many people accept the narrative that they are to blame for their obesity. That, and the harsh judgement of society, can lead to a situation where mental anguish and physical weight-gain feed off each other. ""Obesity is a cause of mental health problems. So if you've got mental health problems, you're more likely to have obesity. But if you're obese, that also creates mental health difficulties."" The NHS has a four-tier recommended treatment process for obesity. Tier 1 promotes healthy eating and active lifestyles, while Tier 2 is usually funding for slimming clubs. Both these tiers are normally paid for by the local authority. Tier 3 treatment is offered by the NHS. Health professionals can give medication, help with lifestyle behaviours and preparation for Tier 4 treatment, where patients are supported through bariatric weight-loss surgery.  But, as Sarah found when she previously sought help from her GP, to be told there was no provision for her, treatment is not available in all areas of the UK. ""There is a postcode-related issue here where some people will not have services available. Ultimately it means there's no support for them,"" says Stuart Flint, a director of Obesity UK, and associate professor in psychology at the University of Leeds. Sarah has decided she doesn't want bariatric surgery. She feels that if she were to go ahead with the major operation only to find she regained some weight in the future, she would find it too difficult to deal with mentally.  The NHS says bariatric surgery can achieve dramatic weight loss. Although patients need to make permanent lifestyle changes after surgery to avoid putting weight back on, it can also lead to hormone changes that can reduce appetite. And the evidence for cost-effectiveness and health improvement are clear, from many studies around the world. Around 6,000 people each year in England go ahead with an operation to help reduce their weight and improve their health dramatically.  Compared with other European countries, England has one the highest rates of adult obesity and one of the lowest rates of spending per capita on this kind of surgery.  The most common types are: The government says it has launched a strategy to tackle obesity. It plans to increase weight management services so that more people get NHS support to lose weight. It is also going to legislate to end the promotion of foods high in fat, sugar and salt. NHS England says it is focusing on support for those who live with obesity and have other health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Shaw Somers carries out weight loss operations at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, and privately in London for patients without Tier 4 services in their area, and who have had to fund the operation themselves.  ""Many people who struggle with severe obesity have a number of underlying illnesses, which are all harder to treat because of their obesity,"" he says. ""They get stuck in a vicious cycle, where their illness makes them more likely to put on weight and the weight makes their illness worse.""  One of his most recent operations was on a patient with chronic kidney disease. He explains that the surgery wasn't just to improve his life, it was to save the man's life. At the obesity clinic in Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, Mr Somers is joined by other specialists - a dietician, a psychologist, nurses, and an anaesthetist. They offer extensive pre- and post-operative care. All of his patients have been through Tier 3 of NHS treatment, as well as years of failed dieting, mental health anguish or illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure that many obese patients suffer.   For Sarah, her hope now lies with medical science. Research into drugs that suppress the appetite, like Saxenda and Semaglutide, are making strides forward, according to Dr Abd Tahrani.  There's also research into a drug for those, like Sarah, who have a mutation of the MC4 receptor. Dr Tahrani says that Semaglutide was approved in the US very recently, and could lead to 15-to-17% weight loss. In the future, he expects to see drugs that could result in 20-to-25% weight loss, which is the same outcome as bariatric surgery.   One in four adults in the UK live with obesity, and the condition can touch almost every area of their lives.  The Department of Health and Social Care described it as ""one of the most significant challenges we face today"". It said: ""Losing weight is not easy and our world-leading obesity strategy lays out extensive action to empower people to make more informed decisions and achieve a healthier weight.""  Sarah is concentrating on staying as healthy as she can, and is determined to make the best of the life she has. She is a successful professional living in a beautiful Yorkshire village. She says her self-confidence is high in all areas - apart from her weight. Despite what she now knows about obesity, Sarah still wants to be slimmer. She simply wants to fit in, and not be judged. Being big means thinking about what might go wrong. Even a catch-up with a friend in a pub garden brings anxiety. ""What are the chairs going to be like? Are there going to be these rickety chairs that I could sit on and it could collapse?"" But for some people living with obesity, Sarah's admission of being unhappy with her weight is at odds with their argument that it is time to reject the stigma - and the shame - and to live happily as they are. It's called being ""body positive"". Sarah respects it, but it is not for her.  ""I do look at some of the body positive community and kind of envy their self-love. But that's only a small community and the big community of the world feels very differently."" Given that Sarah's weight problems are mainly down to genetics, she does not know how that will impact her two-year-old daughter Emily.  After her own struggle with obesity, Sarah is hoping for something better for her daughter.  ""I want her to just know that everyone comes in different shapes and sizes, we have different hair colour, we have different heights, it doesn't matter what she looks like, I just want it to be her. And that's what I'm really passionate about getting that message across to her."" Sarah is setting up a charity to support those with obesity who feel misunderstood and stigmatised. She says the aim is to be a voice for a community that is seldom listened to.  For many scientists and doctors who have developed a deep understanding of obesity, the condition is a complex illness driven by a combination of factors. To blame someone for suffering with that illness flies in the face of the scientific evidence, they say.   ""If blame worked,"" says Dr Abd Tahrani, ""we would have a very thin society by now. Everybody who has obesity has been blamed an endless amount of times, either by their doctors, by their neighbours or their family, or wider society. It's not working, please stop it."""
risk appetite,GPs say parents need clearer strep A advice,2024-09-15,2022-12-08,By Smitha Mundasad,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63903051,"GP leaders have urged the government to put out clearer advice for parents about when to seek help over potential strep A infections.  Prof Kamila Hawthorne, of the Royal College of GPs, said many surgeries were struggling with the extra demand on top of existing pressures. The government should consider ""overspill"" services for surgeries unable to cope, she said.  Since September, 15 UK children have died after invasive strep A infections. This includes the death of one child in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland. There have been no deaths confirmed in Scotland.  The UK Health Security Agency figures (UKHSA) show there have also been 47 deaths from strep A in adults in England.  Most strep A infections are mild, but more severe invasive cases - while still rare - are rising. Prof Hawthorne, said: ""We do not want to discourage patients who are worried about their children to seek medical attention, particularly given the current circumstances. ""But we do want to see good public health messaging across the UK, making it clear to parents when they should seek help and the different care options available to them - as well as when they don't need to seek medical attention.""  Normally, mild strep A infections cause symptoms like a sore throat or skin infections. The bug can also cause scarlet fever - with a sore throat, skin rash that feels like sandpaper, a high temperature and a so-called ""strawberry tongue"". It is treated with antibiotics which may also help reduce the risk of complications and spread of the bug.  However, in a very small number of cases, strep A can get deeper into the body - for example, into the lungs and bloodstream - causing invasive Group A Streptococcus (iGAS), which needs immediate medical attention.  There can be a range of symptoms at this point, as the body battles an invasive infection, including persistent high fevers, poor appetite, dehydration, altered behaviour and feeling very sleepy,  Strep A infections tend to increase in the winter and peak in the spring, but figures show cases are rising earlier than usual this year.  The UKHSA says the last time there was a significant number of cases was in the 2017/18 season, when there were 27 deaths in children under 18 and 328 adult deaths in England. Seasons with high cases can occur every three to four years. But social distancing measures during the pandemic may have interrupted the cycle and that could help explain the recent increase, health officials say. So far, since September, there have been 85 cases of invasive strep A in children aged one to four in England and 60 in children aged five to nine.  The majority of cases are in people over 45.  Dr Colin Brown, deputy director of the UKHSA, said: ""We know that this is concerning for parents, but I want to stress that while we are seeing an increase in cases in children, this remains very uncommon.  ""There a lots of winter bugs circulating that can make your child feel unwell, that mostly aren't cause for alarm.  ""However, make sure you talk to a health professional if your child is getting worse after a bout of scarlet fever, a sore throat or respiratory infection - look out for signs such as a fever that won't go down, dehydration, extreme tiredness and difficulty breathing.""

risk appetite,Developing world economies hit hard by coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-04-22,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52352395,"The world is experiencing a sharp deterioration in economic performance, due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic. Developing countries are certain to be hit hard by what the International Monetary Fund, and others, warn will be the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Almost every country on the planet is being affected. The IMF expects 170 nations - rich and poor - to experience a decline in economic activity per person this year. That means falling average living standards. Developing economies are being hit in distinctive ways by the pandemic: Many are exporters of commodities used by industry. The shutdown of many factories around the world means there is less demand for those commodities, so their prices have fallen, sharply in some cases.  Oil is the starkest example. The loss of demand has been especially severe, as the crisis has led to a massive reduction in demand for transport fuels, more than 90% of which are made from crude oil. The situation was exacerbated for a period by what was in effect a price war between the two biggest exporters, Russia and Saudi Arabia. There has been an extraordinary situation where some oil prices have been below zero. It is not a general feature of the oil market, but it does highlight the huge imbalance between supply and demand. Other commodities have also seen sharp price falls, although not generally on the scale of oil. Copper, for example, is now about 18% cheaper than it was in mid-January, and zinc's price is more than 20% lower. These price falls are hitting businesses and government revenues in countries that export these commodities. Agricultural commodities have generally have been less affected. People still need to eat after all. The World Bank has described world food markets as ""amply supplied following recent bumper harvests, especially in wheat and maize"". Its report does however warn there is a risk that if concerns about food security do spread, hoarding could result. Low income countries would be especially vulnerable in that situation.  Already a fifth of the population in sub-Saharan Africa suffers from malnutrition. Some types of non-food commodity have been affected already. The Bank reports that following the travel restrictions Kenya's exports of fresh flowers dropped by 80%. Rubber prices have also been affected. As people are driving less they don't need to replace tires so much. Prices for maize and some other crops are also vulnerable to a drop in demand for biofuels. Developing countries have also had to contend with international investors pulling money out. The IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath says the appetite for risk among international investors has waned. This means they are more inclined to sell investments seen as relatively risky, including bonds and shares in emerging markets, and pull money back to what they regard as safer bets, such as the US, Europe or Japan. She says the result has been ""unprecedented reversals in capital flows"". In a blog published by the Brussels think thank Bruegel, Marek Dombrowski and Marta Domínguez-Jiménez set out a number of financial indicators showing the strains that have built rapidly in some emerging economies. They show how the difference between bond yields - which are a measure of borrowing costs in financial markets - in the US and in developing nations has widened in many cases. This is often a sign that investors believe there is an increased risk of borrowers, including governments, defaulting on their debts. Another sign of this is the increased cost of getting insurance against a default (that is, the price of financial instruments called credit default swaps). And then there have been sharp declines in currency values for many countries. That is another sign of investors wanting to get their money out.  That also raises another issue - foreign debt. A decline in the value of a national currency makes it more expensive to repay, or pay interest on, debts in other currencies.  At a time when developing country government budgets are under pressure to deal with the health crisis and its economic consequences, debt payments could be a serious diversion of scarce resources.  So there is a vigorous campaign to address developing countries' debt problems.  The IMF and the world's leading economies have taken some steps to ease this burden, by providing relief from the burden of debt interest and repayments over the next few months. The IMF agreed to cover the payments due from 25 countries, mostly in Africa, over the next six months, from a trust fund financed by donations from member countries, including a recent pledge of $185m (£150m) by the UK. In effect those payments have been cancelled. The G20 leading economic powers agreed to defer - not cancel - debt payments from May to the end of the year for a larger group of the poorest nations. This decision covers debt payments to G20 governments from a total of 77 countries.   It means that cash can be diverted in the coming months to dealing with the crisis rather than making those payments. But it does mean they will need to make the payments in the future. So campaigners for developing country debt relief think the G20 and others should go further.   The Jubilee Debt Campaign, for example, described the G20 move as a first step, but called for the payment obligations to be cancelled altogether. They also point out that the G20 deal does not address payments to private sector lenders. The G20 merely encouraged those creditors to offer similar payment deferral to the poorest countries. The Jubilee Debt Campaign wants the rich countries to make changes to the law to prevent private creditors using the courts to sue poor countries that miss payments. It is particularly relevant to New York and the UK whose laws govern most developing country debt contracts.   Dealing with the health issues presents particular problems in densely populated urban areas in developing countries. Social distancing is especially difficult in that context. So is staying at home for people who work in what's called the informal economy. Many need to go out to work to feed themselves and their families.  Oksana Abbouda runs StreetNet International, an organisation that represents street vendors around the world. She recently spoke to the BBC's Business Daily radio programme about what the people the organisation represents are saying about their situation. ""We have to make this horrible choice, either to put ourselves at risk [from infection] and continue our informal job, or put our families at risk because they will be starving,"" she says. ""This is the reality for billions of people around the world… informal is normal in developing countries."" Developing countries are also likely to be affected through a decline in money that migrant workers send to their families at home.  These remittances, as they are known, are often sent from rich to poorer countries, and they can be a very important support to a family's standard of living. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: A new report by the World Bank warns that they are likely to fall by as much as 20% this year due to the pandemic. Migrant workers, the bank says, tend to be particularly vulnerable to losing jobs and incomes. It adds that remittances enable people to eat better, to spend more on education and to reduce child labour. "
risk appetite,What is the Salisbury poisoning's legacy?,2024-09-15,2020-03-04,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51722301,"On 4 March 2018 emergency services received a phone call from members of the public in Salisbury who had seen an old man and a young woman ill on a bench. It was a call that would set in motion a chain of events leading to a major crisis with Russia.  After the pair were taken to hospital, local police did an online search on the name of the man taken ill. The result set off alarm bells. He was a former Russian spy. A call came into the duty officer at MI6 headquarters that Sunday evening.  The realisation that Sergei Skripal - a man who had provided MI6 with secrets from his time in Russian military intelligence - had been targeted sent shock waves through the building, challenging the very core of its work in recruiting agents to work with the organisation. A few hours later, the next call went to Porton Down, home to Britain's biological and chemical research establishment. A rapid-response team was quickly deployed. Samples analysed in labs on-site identified A234, a military-grade nerve agent from the Novichok family developed by the Soviet Union in the Cold War. The revelation caused shock. Detective work by police would identify two officers from Russian military intelligence as the main suspects and a perfume bottle as the means of delivery of the nerve agent onto Mr Skripal's front door handle.  A local woman, Dawn Sturgess would die months later when she came into contact with the Novichok after it had apparently been discarded. Russia denied any role - even putting the two accused men on TV to say they had visited Salisbury simply to see the cathedral spire - but London was convinced it knew who was behind the attack. When another former Russian intelligence officer, Alexander Litvinenko, was killed in 2006 (that time by radioactive polonium) the response was delayed and perceived as weak. London was determined to learn its lesson. Every known Russian intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover in the UK (apart from the declared liaison officer for each Russian intelligence service) was quickly expelled - 23 in total. Many other countries then followed suit, with 60 expulsions in the US. It seemed as if the Kremlin was taken by surprise by the strength of the reaction. But two years on, the legacy of those events looks more uncertain. British officials believe they did real damage to Russian intelligence operations in the country but that damage is likely to have been short term as new spies were dispatched to replace them and as Russia continues a shift to rely on alternative means of espionage. In the Cold War, spies under diplomatic cover and illegals were the primary way the Russians could recruit and run agents and steal secrets. Now there is cyber-espionage and the use of people travelling under different cover, as say businessmen, to operate.  In the wake of the attack, there was also considerable talk of a tougher line over Russian money and influence in London. But there has been relatively little public sign of action. The failure to publish the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee's ""Russia Report"" about influence and subversion in British life before the election has only added to questions as to whether the appetite to deal with this broader issue remains strong. There are also cracks in Western unity over a tough line on Russia, with President Emmanuel Macron of France pushing for trying to improve relations with the Kremlin and uncertainty over the position of the Trump administration in Washington. Mr Skripal himself has not appeared in public since the poisoning. MI5 and the Home Office carried out a ""refresh"" to check on the level of protection for defectors like Mr Skirpal - something officials acknowledge was overdue. The poisoning itself was a failure, several senior officials who served in British intelligence concede.  A risk assessment was carried out when Mr Skripal was swapped out of a Russian prison in 2010 but the Russia of 2018 was very different from Russia then. Russia appears to have stepped up a long-standing campaign to track defectors from 2014, including in the US as well as UK. That was also the point at which relations began to deteriorate rapidly over the crisis in Ukraine and Crimea and in which other alleged operations, like the deployment of online trolls to interfere in US politics increased. One question western intelligence officials have been asking is whether Russia has been deterred from taking such action again by the Western response. No one seems sure. "
risk appetite,Med diet 'may help prevent depression',2024-09-15,2018-09-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45641628,"Eating a Mediterranean diet may help prevent depression, research suggests.  But an expert in metabolic medicine says more rigorous, targeted trials are needed to confirm evidence of the potential link. The findings, in Molecular Psychiatry, come from a review of 41 studies published within the last eight years.  A plant-based diet of fruit, veg, grains, fish, nuts and olive oil - but not too much meat or dairy - appeared to have benefits in terms of mood.  Experts say trials are now needed to test the theory and to learn whether depression can be treated with diet. Why are Mediterranean diets so healthy? Dr Camille Lasalle, who carried out the analysis with colleagues at University College London, said the evidence so far pointed to the idea that the foods we eat can make a difference in lowering our risk of depression, even though there is no solid clinical proof yet. Explaining the link between mood and food is tricky.  There are lots of other factors that may be involved. Without tightly controlled trials, it is unclear how big an impact following a Mediterranean diet might have.  Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, recommended ""a heavy dose of caution"". ""Whilst eating healthier is good for many reasons, we need more evidence before we can say plant-rich diets can improve mental health,"" he said. ""The only way to prove whether the links are genuine is to conduct large randomised trials in people at risk of depression. Such trials would take considerable effort but seem worthwhile to conduct."" Stephen Buckley, from mental-health charity Mind, said it was good advice to eat a healthy diet, get regular physical activity and cut down on ""mood-altering products, such as sugar, caffeine and alcohol"".  ""It's widely accepted that there's a strong connection between what we eat and how we feel, with blood-sugar levels affecting our mood and energy. ""If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, it might be hard to focus on your health, or you may resort to unhelpful coping strategies, such as drugs or alcohol.  ""If this is the case, you might benefit from other forms of treatment such as medication or talking therapies."" Research into the traditional Mediterranean diet has shown it may reduce our risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Researchers have also found that people who closely follow a Mediterranean diet may live a longer life and be less likely to put on weight. A typical Mediterranean diet includes lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, cereals and cereal products, for example wholegrain bread, pasta and brown rice. It also contains moderate amounts of fish, white meat and some dairy produce. It is the combination of all these elements that seems to bring health benefits, but one of the key aspects is the inclusion of healthy fats. If you're worried about your mental health, speak to your family doctor."
risk appetite,Two metre social distance 'safe way to behave',2024-09-15,2020-06-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-53163402,"The original recommendation to stay 2m apart from others remains the ""safe way to behave"", Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said the original social distancing advice is staying in place in Wales. The UK government has eased it in England, allowing parts of the hospitality sector including pubs to reopen from 4 July. Welsh Conservatives have called for a ""similar lifeline"" for firms in Wales. Earlier Mr Drakeford's colleague, Health Minister Vaughan Gething, said he could not see how the measures being eased in England were consistent with scientific advice. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers will be able to reopen in England from 4 July. Concerns have been raised of the risk of a second wave. The UK government said it would continue to be guided by the latest scientific advice. Dates in Wales have not been given for the hospitality sector, including pubs and restaurants, to reopen, although the Welsh Government has promised ""detailed discussions"" on a phased reopening. In England a ""one metre plus"" rule has been introduced where two metres is not possible, taking steps to reduce transmission But in Wales the 2m advice is enshrined in law and workplaces are expected to follow it as much as they can, risking fines otherwise. At a virtual session of the Senedd Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservative group, said it was ""right"" to reassess the regulations as infection rates fall. He put it to Mr Drakeford that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had welcomed the prime minister's statement on Tuesday ""overall"" and believed ""the UK government is trying to do the right thing"". In response, the first minister said: ""In Wales, the message remains. Stay two metres apart. That is the safe way to behave."" He said the science of the UK government's scientific advisory group SAGE said ""if you halve the distance the risk increases somewhere between two and five times greater than if you stay within a two metre distance"". But Mr Drakeford did not totally rule out easing the advice. ""If it is possible, always using public health as our primary test, to reduce the two metre rule by exception then we will see what we are able to do in Wales, but we will do it by looking at the evidence first."" Evidence for the England decision had been promised by the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, the first minister said. ""That evidence had not arrived by the end of yesterday but we certainly hope to see it today."" Mr Drakeford faced calls from Paul Davies to provide a ""strategy"" for Welsh tourism for how it will support it in the short and long term, and for ""immediate action"" to help the hospitality sector. He said last week's statement on lockdown in Wales, which said self-contained tourist accommodation could take bookings from 13 July, ""resulted in more questions than answers"". But Mr Drakeford said ""none of us know how this disease will progress as we move through the summer and into autumn"". ""We do our best to provide forward guidance to sectors in Wales, but to ask us to provide clarity where none is possible, would be to provide a false prospectus to those industries."" Coronavirus travel restrictions are among the measures still in place in Wales, with people expected to stay local at least until 6 July. Vaughan Gething told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers the lockdown changes in England were ""a lot of measures to undertake on one day"". ""I don't think you'd see that same appetite for risk here,"" he added. He said Welsh Government officials are in contact with their counterparts in the UK government ""trying to get sight of the evidence"". ""And as soon as [we see it] we'll consider it, and it will inform choices that we make here in Wales."" Mr Gething claimed that the ""overwhelming majority of people in Wales support the approach"" taken by the Welsh Government - which has eased lockdown more cautiously than in England. ""Some people are thirsty for a much more rapid unlocking of the country but, actually, that isn't the overwhelming view of people,"" he said. Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative Covid recovery spokesman, said that the UK government's measures are ""safe and sensible"" and will ""come as a huge relief to those parts of society and the economy which would otherwise be unable to function and it is great to see them attracting cross-party support"". ""We encourage the Welsh Government to urgently review the restrictions here as soon as possible in order that a similar lifeline can be thrown to people and businesses across Wales."""
risk appetite,Should India break up its big conglomerates?,2024-09-15,2023-03-30,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65108865,"India should dismantle its large conglomerates to increase competition and reduce their ability to charge higher prices, former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Viral Acharya has argued in a new paper for Brookings Institution, an American research group.  According to Mr Acharya, who is now a professor of economics at NYU Stern, ""industrial concentration"" - which refers to the extent to which a smaller number of firms account for total production in a country - fell sharply in India after 1991 when the country opened up its economy and state-owned monopolies began giving away their market share to private enterprises. But after 2015, it began rising again.  The share of India's ""big five"" conglomerates - the Reliance Group, Adani Group, Tata Group, Aditya Birla Group and Bharti Airtel - in total assets of non-financial sectors rose from 10% in 1991 to nearly 18% in 2021.   They ""grew not just at the expense of the smallest firms, but also of the next largest firms"", says Mr Acharya, because the share in total assets of the next five business groups halved from 18% to 9% during this period.  There could have been many drivers of this, according to Mr Acharya -  their ability to acquire large distressed companies, a growing appetite for mergers and acquisitions, and India's conscious industrial policy of creating ""national champions via preferential allocation of projects and in some cases regulatory agencies turning a blind eye to predatory pricing"".  The trend raises several concerns, according to the former deputy governor. These include ""the risk of crony capitalism, i.e., political connections and inefficient project allocations, related party transactions within their byzantine corporate organisation charts"", taking on excess debt to fund their expansion and preventing competitors from entering the market.  Excess leverage was, in fact, one of the many red flags that US-based short seller Hindenburg Research had also raised against the Adani Group recently. The report led to billions of dollars being wiped from the stock market.  In other countries this has had far graver spillover effects in the past.  ""National champions can easily become overleveraged and collapse, severely damaging the overall economy, as has occurred in other Asian countries, most spectacularly Indonesia in 1998,"" Josh Felman, former India head of the International Monetary Fund, told the BBC.  In a February column for Project Syndicate, the economist Nouriel Roubini had also expressed concerns about India's economic model of giving a few ""national champions"" or ""large private oligopolistic conglomerates"" control over significant parts of the economy.  ""These conglomerates have been able to capture policymaking to benefit themselves,"" wrote Mr Roubini. The phenomenon was stifling innovation and disallowing entry of start-ups and other domestic entrants in key industries, he said. India's policy of creating ""national champions"" is similar to those adopted by China, Indonesia and particularly South Korea in the 1990s, where a group of mostly family-run business conglomerates - called chaebols, of which smartphone giant Samsung is the most prominent example - dominated its economy.   But unlike India, these countries ""did not protect their conglomerates with sky-high tariffs"", says Mr Acharya. India, however, has been becoming more protectionist in order to ""insulate domestic industries and conglomerates from global competition"", Mr Roubini wrote.    All of this has major implications on India's attempts to become the next factory of the world. According to both Mr Acharya and Mr Roubini, India needs to reduce tariffs to become more globally competitive and take advantage of the ""China plus one"" trend where supply chains are moving away from mainland China into geographies like India and Vietnam.  India's industrial concentration could also have domestic consequences, Mr Acharya argues - the rising market power of the ""big five"" may be one of the contributors to persistently high core inflation, or the rise in the price of goods and services barring food and energy. ""While a deeper and fuller inquiry is warranted, we find that there is a potentially causal link from market power to markups,"" writes Mr Acharya, adding that these companies are able to ""exert extraordinary pricing power and capture economic rents relative to other firms in the industry"".  But other economists told the BBC that they are sceptical of this correlation. ""If a 'big five' firm enters a new sector, the group may become bigger, but competition in that specific sector may increase and prices might actually fall. A most spectacular example of this dynamic occurred when Reliance decided to start [telecom company] Jio: telecoms prices crashed,"" says Mr Felman. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, says there isn't ""enough evidence"" to support this thesis. According to him, even in markets dominated by a small number of firms, such as airlines - where most of these conglomerates do not have a presence - prices have consistently been high. He adds that the sectors that feed into core inflation at the consumer level -  recreation, education, health, household goods, consumer care - don't have the presence of the big five either.

risk appetite,Instagram criticised over sale of weight gain drug,2024-09-15,2021-05-02,By Anna Collinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56930654,"NHS England has urged Instagram to clamp down on accounts selling an unlicensed, ""dangerous"" drug mainly targeted at younger women and girls. The sale of Apetamin is illegal in the UK, but BBC Three revealed it is available in shops and online. In an open letter, NHS leaders say they are concerned about the product's promotion and the impact on physical and mental health.  Instagram say selling non-medical drugs is ""strictly against our policies"". Apetamin is not licensed in the UK which means the regulator has not carried out tests to ensure it meets strict safety standards and it should not be sold, supplied or advertised. Doctors say misuse of the appetite stimulant can cause severe fatigue, jaundice and even liver failure.  However, the syrup is regularly promoted by social media influencers as a quick way to gain weight and develop an extreme hourglass figure, like celebrities Kim Kardashian and Cardi B. Instagram said it had taken down accounts that sell and advertise Apetamin in response to the BBC Three documentary Dangerous Curves, which aired on 21 April. However, NHS England says it's since found ""dozens of profiles"" are still active and when this was reported, ""no action was taken"". In the letter, National Medical Director, Stephen Powis and National Mental Health Director, Clare Murdoch, demand an urgent update on what action the site is taking to tackle accounts selling Apetamin.  ""We are concerned about both the physical and mental health impacts of the promotion of this drug and strongly urge you to demonstrate duty of care to your customers and clamp down now on this dangerous content."" They say they are sending the letter ""on behalf of NHS patients, staff and people experiencing body dysmorphia and other mental health conditions, as well as their families"". The letter, which has also been signed by the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, has asked Instagram to confirm whether it thinks social media firms should contribute more financially to young people's mental health services - which it's claimed are increasingly being called on. ""It's time these media giants stepped up to the plate and took some responsibility,"" Claire Murdoch told the BBC. ""Here we are investing more than ever in mental and physical heath, these media giants like Instagram need to contribute more as well."" The BBC has found Apetamin is also still being sold on other online sites and in shops, following its investigation. Two years ago, Vanessa was taking Apetamin on a regular basis. ""I used to be happy with my body, but social media has affected the way I think. I developed insecurities I never knew I had,"" explains the 23-year-old. ""When you take Apetamin you can't control the weight you gain. It doesn't go to the right places, just straight to the belly. I was also really bloated and tired."" Vanessa, who always bought the product in a shop, says removing accounts which sell Apetamin will help, but won't solve the problem. ""A lot of people are blind to the pressure that makes you do things you shouldn't do. People make rude comments and 'skinny-shame' you.  ""They say you don't look good and a curvaceous figure is the desired shape. ""It's madness women and girls like me are willing to take such a risk, but the pressures must be hitting us hard for us to think it's worth it."" In a statement from the Facebook company, which owns Instagram, a spokesperson said: ""The wellbeing of our community is our top priority and buying and selling non-medical or prescription drugs is strictly against our policies. ""We remove accounts that sell Apetamin when we become aware of them and block related hashtags so this content is harder to find.  ""We'll continue working with law enforcement and youth organisations to help keep drugs sales of any kind off Instagram.""  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is currently investigating the sale of Apetamin, which is made by TIL Healthcare in India.  The company's spokesperson has previously told the BBC it is not exporting the product to the UK and it has no information on its availability in the UK."
risk appetite,Wigan could be tip of a large iceberg,2024-09-15,2020-07-01,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/53256015,"Wigan have won all three of their games since the retstart Wigan Athletic could be followed into administration by ""10 or 15"" clubs unless some financial help comes from the top of the game, warns the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Administrators acting for the Latics have said the club is 'finished' if funding cannot be found to get it through to the end of the season after its Hong Kong-based owners pulled out. But the fear of many within the game is that Wigan will only represent the tip of a large iceberg as the full impact of Covid-19 starts to take effect. Wigan set for 12-point deduction Ex-captain Emmerson Boyce urges players to keep focus ""It would be tragic if a club that has been in existence for nearly 90 years is forced to the wall,"" said Julian Knight, chair of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport Committee.  ""We know that 10 to 15 clubs could find themselves in the same position. (On Monday) the DCMS Committee sought clarification from (Premier League chief executive) Richard Masters on what action it was taking to provide extra money for clubs at risk - he told us that the Football League hadn't asked for extra funding and the Premier League hadn't provided it.  ""That's a situation that has to change."" BBC Sport understands there has, in fact, been talks between Premier League executives and their EFL counterparts. The EFL has made its position clear, although the Premier League is thought to be concentrating on trying to complete the current campaign before looking at the wider state of football finances.  Privately, the EFL is braced for the coronavirus pandemic to cost its clubs a combined £250m. The Premier League already provides around £400m each year in funding to the EFL but around £260m of that goes to nine clubs in the form of parachute payments to those relegated from the top flight in previous seasons. In May, EFL chairman Rick Parry called those payments ""an evil that must be eradicated"". Many Championship executives feel the gulf in finances between the top two divisions is unhealthy and has created a situation where clubs spent far more than they can afford in the hope of reaching the Premier League. Speaking to the BBC in May, Huddersfield owner Phil Hodgkinson warned ""50 or 60"" clubs could go bust and some were only trading because they were deferring wages, tax and other creditors. Hodgkinson, whose club are among those currently receiving parachute payments, said there should be an across-the-board wage cut, with the money being combined with part of the £340m rebate Premier League clubs have had to give back to broadcasters to help those who need it survive the coronavirus pandemic. Then, he felt, stringent wage regulations should be applied to prevent clubs getting into trouble. The EFL wants to introduce salary caps for Leagues One and Two next season. However, the Professional Footballers' Association is opposed to this and say current Financial Fair Play rules should be monitored in a more effective way. As those arguments continue, clubs are starting to face the financial reality of the situation they now find themselves in. While the Premier League and Championship have decided to finish their current seasons 'behind closed doors', there has been no clarity over what happens to the 2020-21 campaign. The expectation is the Premier League will resume in September and the Championship on either 12 September or 29 August. What is not known is whether the appetite among clubs in League One, League Two and the National League will be to start their seasons in front of either no spectators or limited capacity, given match-going fans provide the bulk of their income. In addition, the developments around Wigan will again bring debate around the EFL's owners and directors test. The Hong Kong-based consortium who bought the club from Dave Whelan in 2018 passed it. However, as was the case at Bury and, now Charlton, clubs have been bought without EFL approval. Charlton have had two takeovers this season and so far, the EFL is still to say whether it is happy with either. On Tuesday, the Charlton Athletic Supporters Trust published a list of nine questions it wanted answering by new owner Paul Elliott, a Manchester-based businessman. Few would doubt 83-year-old Whelan's good intentions for the Latics. He bankrolled Wigan on their fairytale rise from the fourth tier of English football to the Premier League and has already been talking about what he can do to help. It is understood there are 600 full and part-time employees at the club, with administrators now set to face some uncomfortable decisions. ""What's needed now is leadership from the very top of the pyramid to help save the Wigan side and the jobs of those who work for it,"" said Knight."
risk appetite,Amber Rudd's political highs and lows,2024-09-15,2018-04-29,By Gavin Stamp,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43925160,"Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience.  Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes.  She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party.  But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis. Previously regarded as having more liberal views on immigration than her predecessor, she was soon accused of making the government's ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants even tougher, with disastrous repercussions for thousands of people in the country legally. More significantly, she was forced to publicly backtrack on claims that the Home Office did not have targets for removing immigration offenders, admitting to MPs she had been wrong.  The opposition soon called for her head, describing her as a ""human shield"" for the prime minister. But there was no appetite on the Tory benches - either from Brexiters or Remainers - for her to go, with three cabinet ministers already having had to quit in the past six months.  The final nail in her coffin was when her claim to the Commons that she was not aware of the targets was contradicted not only by a memo she had been sent by a top Home Office official, published by the Guardian, but also a letter Ms Rudd herself sent to the prime minister setting out ""ambitious but deliverable"" deportation targets. Before entering politics, Ms Rudd had successful careers working in finance, journalism and executive recruitment - as well as somewhat incongruously being ""aristocracy consultant"" on the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral. She was married for five years to the late writer and Sunday Times columnist AA Gill, with whom she had two children. At a recent lunch for Westminster journalists, she responded to questions about her future leadership ambitions by saying that she merely ""wanted to stay in the game"". She will now have more time to ponder her own future in that game from the backbenches and also to reflect on the conventional wisdom in Westminster - seemingly dispelled by Mrs May - that the Home Office is the graveyard of many a political career.  The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948. It is regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration known as the ""Windrush generation"". Now, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it has emerged that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation and denied access to the NHS, benefits and pensions.

risk appetite,Gaucho mulls closure of Cau restaurants,2024-09-15,2018-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44068045,"Steak and burger chain Cau, part of the Gaucho restaurant group, is under threat of closure with more than 700 UK jobs at risk. The chain, which has 22 restaurants, has been underperforming for some time. The BBC understands that one option under consideration is a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) that would allow the chain to be restructured. The group's 16 Gaucho restaurants are said to be trading well and are not affected by the closure threat. Gaucho is owned by private equity firm Equistone, which recently appointed new management in an effort to turn the group around. A company spokesperson said: ""As part of a comprehensive strategic review, the group's new management team, with the support of its shareholders, is at the early stages of exploring a number of financial restructuring options. No decisions have yet been made."" The casual dining sector has been experiencing tough times recently, as costs soar and consumer appetites falter. Prezzo, Jamie's Italian and Byron are among the chains that have already announced that they are closing some outlets."
risk appetite,Short intense exercise 'aids weight loss',2024-09-15,2019-02-16,By Laurel  Ives,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47242940,"Bursts of high intensity interval training (Hiit) may be more effective for weight loss than longer less intense workouts, a study suggests. The research, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, analysed results from 36 earlier studies. Although all the participants lost weight, those doing Hiit saw a 28.5% greater weight loss.  The researchers cautioned that Hiit may not be suitable for everyone.  ""Hiit might increase the risk of injury and impose higher cardiovascular stress,"" they said.  Researchers from the Federal University of Goias, Brazil, analysed data from 576 men and 522 women of varying levels of fitness.  Interval training was defined as cardiovascular exercise which involved repeated brief bursts of intense effort, interspersed with recovery periods. Cycling, swimming, running and boxing were included.  These workouts were compared with longer continuous moderate intensity workouts, most of which were between 30 and 45 minutes.  All participants exercised for at least four weeks.  Those doing interval training lost on average 1.58kg (3.48lb) compared with the 1.13kg (2.49lb) lost by those doing lower intensity workouts.  Sprint interval training seemed to be particularly effective for weight loss, although researchers did caution that the wide variety of training programmes made it difficult to recommend one regime in particular.  The NHS currently recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as cycling or brisk walking, every week. Dr Niels Vollaard, a lecturer in health and exercise science at the University of Stirling, said the results were counterintuitive as most people burned more calories during longer moderate exercise. ""There are two possible explanations,"" he said. ""Firstly, Hiit may lead to greater energy expenditure after exercise - metabolism may be increased for up to a day following a Hiit session. ""Secondly, after a Hiit session, you may be less hungry.  ""In our research, we have shown that appetite hormones are indeed affected.  ""It is, however, not easy to study whether energy intake is reduced as a result of this in the longer term when following a Hiit routine, so at the moment we are still unsure exactly what the reason is."" Michael Mosley, who was introduced to Hiit seven years ago while making the BBC Horizon documentary The Truth about Exercise, said: ""In 2012, I tested three lots of 20-second high intensity workouts on an exercise bike, three times a week.  ""My insulin sensitivity improved by 24%.  ""In the programme, we again saw very impressive results with younger, unfit people.  ""The biggest problem with exercise is compensatory eating and relaxing afterwards.  ""People go on a treadmill for 30 minutes, burn around 120 calories, then lie around and reward themselves with a muffin. ""The theory with Hiit seems to be that it suppresses your appetite and targets the visceral fat in your gut. ""It's not the calories you burn that matter - it's what you do next."""
risk appetite,"Corbyn supporters out of power, but not out of ideas",2024-09-15,2023-10-09,By Iain Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67057097,"Two visions of Labour were on display on Monday. In her speech to Labour conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves was cheered as she declared that ""you can't tax and spend your way to growth"". She set out differences with the Conservatives but also wanted to distance the current leadership from the previous one, declaring ""extremists"" had been thrown out of Labour. She was applauded by Labour grandee Lord Mandelson from a front row seat - a personification of how the party has changed in the four years since the era when Jeremy Corbyn was leader of the Labour Party. Yet in the same venue, a little earlier, there was also a standing ovation for the leader of the Unite union Sharon Graham when she called for the party to be more bold and to take the energy companies back in to public ownership. On a show of hands, this policy passed - a slap in the face for the party leadership, which had ditched plans for ""common ownership"". Most topics likely to cause Sir Keir Starmer any difficulty or irritation had already been kept off the agenda - including Brexit. In a ballot on Sunday, constituency delegates chose to prioritise motions which would not trouble the leadership. This in itself demonstrates a shift from the left wing of the party, and is in part due to the departure of some grassroots members who are disillusioned with the party's direction. But the trade unions can also vote to put items on the agenda and that's why the debate on public ownership occurred. Despite the victory on public ownership, the Left would concede - as a matter of fact - that they have lost control of the party.  The Labour leadership is making it clear that the re-nationalisation of energy will not make it in to the next election manifesto. The Left will be in a minority in the meeting, closer to the election, that draws up that document. So today's policy will head straight in to the dustbin of history. So how do they react? With less vocal opposition than you might imagine. Mick Lynch, leader of the RMT union, addressed a fringe meeting this weekend and declared that he wouldn't be saying ""this or that"" about Keir Starmer as ""we need to get the Tories out and that means getting him in"". This is reflective of a view of some on the Left. Labour is ahead in the polls and apparently on the cusp of power, and there may be a political price to be paid for being seen to undermine this.  And in any case the scent of power is a unifying force. Here on Merseyside, some MPs on the left are taking a tactical decision not to rock the Labour boat that may become a ship of state. Bell Ribiero-Addy, who worked for Diane Abbott before becoming an MP, told a Left fringe meeting: ""It's important you're still here fighting. I don't have time for people who quit the party in a huff... If Labour lose the country loses, regardless of our different views."" And Richard Burgon, secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, said he understood ""how difficult it can be with the current leadership"" but said: ""Wouldn't it be fantastic to see all the Tories out, and Labour again get the keys to 10 Downing Street?"" A Left source also suggested there was a ""fear"" that what happened to both Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott - suspended from the parliamentary party, and likely to be prevented from standing as Labour candidates - could happen to others. Party rules were changed this weekend to make crystal clear that anyone who campaigns for a non-Labour candidate will be expelled.  If Jeremy Corbyn were - as anticipated - to stand as an independent at the next election then any supporters who knock doors on his behalf would be out.  Those publicly backing the North of Tyne Mayor Jamie Driscoll, who quit Labour, would suffer a similar fate. Some will indeed be tempted to do so, and the Left inside Labour will be further weakened. But those who wish to stay and fight do not want to make the leadership's day, and are proceeding with caution. There are those on the Left who argue that the current leadership's victory has been more organisational than political. The Labour to Win grouping, which got behind the Starmer leadership when he embarked on a journey away from the Corbyn era, have helped him grab control of many of the levers of power - including the ruling National Executive Committee. The Left argue - as Monday's debate on public ownership demonstrates - there is still an appetite among some in the party for more radical policies. But the prospect of regaining power within the party is a distant one. Momentum - the group set up to support the Corbyn leadership - point out that some of their members are pursuing their politics via the local route. They are training members to be council candidates. Their co-chair Hilary Schan is a councillor in Worthing, where Labour is hopeful of taking the parliamentary seat. Preston Labour councillors have been practicing their form of municipal socialism for some time. As for Westminster, the Labour leader's office has taken an active role in ensuring some on the Left don't get on to parliamentary shortlists. But there could still be perhaps in the region of 30 or so MPs who are in the Socialist Campaign Group. So some hope if Labour were to win a narrow majority, they could yet exercise disproportionate influence. Meanwhile, Unite are building from below - diverting some of the cash that could have gone to Labour to running campaigns in key constituencies on issue that matter to them.  The thinking is that they can set off a political chain reaction. The aim is for voters to put pressure on candidates, then candidates put pressure on their party leadership and then, bang! A Labour government brings this about. And the Left hope that other unions which are less critical than Unite will nonetheless press for more progress on their priorities if Labour take power. There is also been some informal, and perhaps a little distasteful, chat on the reception circuit about what would happen if Keir Starmer were to fall under the proverbial bus.  Some on both the Right and Left of the party agree there would be no lurch to the Corbyn left.  But they feel Angela Rayner, who oversaw a robust workers' rights agenda, or Andy Burnham (were he to get a parliamentary seat) and who is re-regulating transport in Manchester, might be better placed to succeed than Rachel Reeves or Wes Streeting, as they are more acceptable to the unions.  In other words, though the party has been on a journey from Left to Right, it hasn't quite settled in a final destination.  But the speed at which the party leadership has moved has shocked some on the Left, and pleasantly surprised those who fondly remember the New Labour era."
risk appetite,How do we know which country is coping best with Covid?,2024-09-15,2020-10-05,By Kevin Connolly,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54391482,"As the Covid crisis has unfolded, infection rates have fluctuated and restrictions have proliferated. But it has always felt that there was one idea to cling to: that by working out which countries were doing well - and which were not - there was something to be learned. After all, historians will surely puzzle over how the countries of Western Europe, with broadly similar economies, produced such drastically different outcomes. So far, at least. We use international comparisons all the time, of course - they're a way of measuring how our own governments are doing. But even comparing the simplest data can be complex. There can be differences in how and when death is reported, how co-morbidities are reflected on death certificates, and for how long after a positive test a death is considered to be Covid-related. All will influence how a country's performance at any given moment is measured. For the moment, the gaps in performance appear to be startling.  The death rate in Germany stands at around 11.5 deaths per 100,000 people, while in neighbouring Belgium it's more than seven times higher at 87 per 100,000. France stands somewhere in between at around 48 per 100,000 while the UK is nearer the top of the European table, at 63.3 per 100,000. Each is a prosperous country with a capable health-care system and each has applied broadly similar tools to fight the virus, with  some combination of lockdowns, social distancing and the encouragement of improved hand hygiene bolstered by localised curfews in some cities. But the further you look into the data the harder it becomes to explain the differences. Lombardia and Veneto for example are neighbouring provinces in Northern Italy, but the differences between their experiences are striking - Lombardia's death rate is 167 per 100,000 and Veneto's  43. It's perhaps because of the sheer difficulty of explaining the numbers that the view from Germany on whether it is doing better than others is more cautious than you might imagine. One factor, it's acknowledged could be timing - how quickly you take action may be as important as the action you take. The influential German scientist Christian Drosten put it like this ahead of this month's World Health Summit in Berlin: ""There are already speeches celebrating German success but it's not very clear where that comes from. We have moved with exactly the same measures as others. We didn't do anything particularly well, we just did it sooner."" Germany does have an extensive testing system, a well-established network of public health track and trace officials, and a greater number of places in intensive care units than most other countries. But perhaps equally importantly, it has Angela Merkel - one of the few world leaders who is a scientist and who can understand and explain the data herself. At a news conference after meeting with the heads of Germany's regional governments for example Ms Merkel began one answer with the words: ""I simply conducted a model calculation."" She proceeded to talk her audience through the maths of exponential growth in a pandemic, concluding with a warning that Germany would need to take extra measures. She was careful to describe the situation as ""urgent"" but not dramatic. Christian Drosten says a population that feels well-informed is more likely to comply with government instructions or requests. As he put it: ""I'm reading about support rates of 85-90%, that's a huge accomplishment…everyone knows someone in their own circle who doesn't accept the measures but it's possible to talk to them and that's what we should be doing. I think this is one of the biggest advantages we have in Germany."" Prof Drosten's point is about where science meets society - in other words it's not about the nature of the tools in the toolbox but how the country reacts when the government gets the tools out. We raised this point with Prof Yves Van Laethem, an advisor to the government of Belgium, who said it was possible his government had confused its public by changing messages too quickly and too often. He said there was a need now for sustainable and stable measures as winter approaches, but the appetite of the Belgian people for further changes to regulations was limited - a phenomenon which can also be seen in the UK and elsewhere. ""It's a similar problem in Belgium,"" he says. ""The government proposes something and it gets disputed right away….in March and April people were so afraid they were complying and they didn't contest the rules as much. But now people see that as cases are increasing the death rate is remaining low and they wonder why they have to do all these things."" It perhaps explains why Belgium became one of the very few countries to ease a restriction as fears grew of an Autumn second wave. From the end of July it was compulsory in Belgium to wear a mask at all times, in all public spaces, both indoors and out - even if you were walking alone across a deserted park in the middle of the night. From 1 October, that rule has been relaxed. Masks are still compulsory in shops and on public transport, but only in crowded public areas outdoors. By contrast, after months of resisting promoting the use of masks its neighbour, the Netherlands, began tightening its rules, strongly recommending them in shops and on buses. The destination is the same - masks are a good idea in some circumstances, but the direction of travel is very different. Those issues of consistency and sustainability have been associated with Anders Tegnell, Sweden's chief virologist. His advice to leave bars and restaurants open and not to require mask-wearing was questioned in the first phase of the pandemic, but is increasingly borne out by evidence in the second. It is of course a myth that the Swedish government ""did nothing"" in response to the crisis. It has taken measures to slow the virus including social distancing and the encouragement of extra hand hygiene. Mr Tegnell talks of the importance of ""giving a lot of influence to the population"". Sweden's political culture of calm communitarianism may make the work of the virologist a little easier - and it raises an interesting question about the extent to which outcomes might be determined not just by the measures governments introduce but the reaction to them once they've been announced. If the German and Swedish populations can be trusted - by and large - to accept instructions and requests from their governments then what about those societies where governments are treated more sceptically, where opposition parties, trades unions, populist newspapers and angry local authorities in the worst-affected areas adopt a contrarian or disputatious approach to central power. In France, for example, the national minister for health, Olivier Veran, announced new rules for the populous southern coastal area around Marseille without consulting the local authorities. The mini-lockdown includes the closure of restaurants and bars. The regional president, Renaud Muselier, who is a doctor, described the decision as ""inappropriate, unilateral and brutal"", warning that it would lead to feelings of ""rebellion and revolt"". This is not of course an academic debate about epidemiology. Marseille would see itself as a rival of distant Paris and it would never be difficult to summon a sense of resentment of central power there. But it will be interesting to see what effect - if any - the hostile local reaction to the distant central government will have. There are all sorts of difficulties in making international comparisons at this point in the pandemic - even something as basic as social distancing is complex. France, Germany and the UK for example all have different social distancing measurements - 1m, 1.5m and 2m respectively. But establishing which of those is right and how the balance between risk and convenience was measured will take months, if not years, of study. The problems of making those comparisons struck me when I happened to be spending some time in the Belgian parliament with one of the country's leading politicians on a day when, by coincidence, scientists and politicians in the UK had been praising aspects of Belgium's response to the second wave. He was surprised. ""Honestly,"" he said, ""you can look at the TV every night and see an expert in Stockholm, or in London, or in Paris, say something slightly different. But of course they're all experts. It's too early now for comparison. Maybe that will be possible next year, maybe we'll have to wait until the year after, but not now."" That leaves us perhaps with one conclusion we can safely draw. That health outcomes in this crisis won't ultimately depend merely on what our governments tell us to do and not to do. They'll depend just as much if not more on the choices we choose to make about what we're told. Research by Sira Thierij"
risk appetite,How coronavirus is changing NHS technology,2024-09-15,2020-05-14,By Sooraj Shah,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52467443,"""Many people within the NHS are talking about two years of transformation done in two weeks,"" says Adrian Byrne, chief information officer at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHSFT). His hospital has been among the many seeing innovations, including the use of a chatbot to provide automatic alerts for Covid-19 test results.  ""Doctors don't look on the system every five minutes to see whether test results are back and this can waste time in being able to discharge or provide patients with care,"" says Mr Byrne. The coronavirus outbreak has spurred hospitals to deal with all sorts of technology issues, not least staff having to use devices while dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE). At the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Dr Peter Young, an anaesthetist and intensive care specialist, had to ask for an app to be built to help non-specialist staff in critical care units to communicate more effectively.  ""They continuously have many questions and while in full PPE they have to rely on a number of ad hoc WhatsApp lists to try and track down the right person who can help them or else they physically have to leave the unit to sort out their problem, wasting valuable PPE,"" he says. Through the Call 4 Help app, staff can request help from everyone in the ICU through a real-time message board. Senior doctors and nurses can monitor and assign tasks through the app, which has been built with PPE in mind. ""We've made sure it is easy to read through visors, and the onscreen buttons are sensitive enough to work easily through double gloved fingers,"" says Dr Young.  The iPhone X was chosen for the ICU as it is waterproof for cleaning, has a loud speaker and sensitive microphone. Once the requestor connects with the responder, the app provides a link to switch from the message board to FaceTime or a phone call if required. The app could be rolled out to all NHS hospitals nationwide.    Sarah Wilkinson, NHS Digital's CEO, says that the organisation has had to scale up its NHS 111 service, as it was receiving almost 100 time as much use as before the pandemic.  In addition, NHS Digital has worked with a team at Cambridge University that has built machine learning models to predict the upcoming demand for ICU beds and for ventilators. This is being extended to estimate how long patients will stay in hospital and eventually, Ms Wilkinson hopes, it could help to simulate the best environments and treatment decisions for patients. These models have been deployed across many NHS trusts already.  The pandemic has also accelerated a number of projects which had been on many NHS trusts' agendas for a very long time. ""The clamour for virtual smart cards instead of physical cards increased as we moved into PPE environments, where putting in the physical card was very difficult,"" Ms Wilkinson said, explaining that the NHS has rolled out virtual cards as a result.  Video conferencing tools had been put on the backburner too, but are now enabling GPs to communicate with patients, doctors to oversee wards and patients to speak to their families and friends. Mike Ogonovsky, assistant director of informatics at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board says the NHS Wales video consulting service reached 88% of GP practices within a month across Wales, and it has been extended to include hospitals, mental health services and care homes. ""It was an R&D evaluation programme which turned into an aggressive national rollout plan in Wales when the pandemic hit - it became a very black and white issue,"" he says.   Similar tools are being used across Scotland and England, while Microsoft Teams has been deployed to 1.2 million users with NHS mail.  Another programme of work has been to reduce the amount of paper created in wards.  ""If we're creating paper notes in a Covid-19 positive environment then those notes are a risk for 72 hours, so we're placing them somewhere else before scanning them. This is a hassle as the notes are not available immediately and there is a risk to any of the administrative teams who want to go through them,"" Mr Byrne explains.  One of the biggest frustrations within the NHS is the inability for every organisation to have access to patient details when they're required. Ms Wilkinson says that many of the patient-sharing initiatives that had been built prior to the pandemic, such as GP Connect, have now been commissioned to be made more accessible for Covid-19.  More Technology of Business The lingering question then, is why weren't many of these technologies being used prior to the pandemic? ""ICT budgets compete against the budgets of fixing a leaky roof or hiring another clinician, meaning there are immensely difficult judgements to make, particularly as some other costs pay off immediately and IT may be slower to pay off,"" says Ms Wilkinson.  For instance, some trusts had bought desktop computers instead of laptops because they were cheaper. Even though laptops allow staff to move around more freely and work from home, many trusts may not have believed that this would save money -  and all technology projects have to prove that they can save the NHS money to get the green light.  Dr Young says the Call 4 Help app would not have been possible in normal circumstances because of the funds and time required for development. Twenty engineers from Kulestar, 4 Roads, CK Alpha and Concept Softworks have voluntarily worked full-time on the app.  But during this crisis, those in the NHS making the financial decisions have been far more receptive to those on the technology side.  ""I think anyone in IT in the NHS would tell you it's been a lot easier to do things in the last few weeks than it would have been prior to the crisis. We're now seeing freeing up of money for digital because it has had to happen,"" says Mr Byrne.  How coronavirus is changing NHS technology But the NHS may have been in a better place to manage the crisis if certain projects had been given the go-ahead far earlier, says Cindy Fedell, the chief digital and information officer at Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. ""Video conferencing is something we could have done one or two years ago, but it was slow to get off the ground, not because of technical issues, but because of people."" Funding is just one part of the problem; there are also strategic and cultural barriers that those in IT in the NHS have to contend with, but Ms Wilkinson believes this will improve as a result of what is now being achieved. ""The art of the possible is so much better understood now, I think we will have a much better understanding [of]... the enormous potential for digitalisation. There will be a broader appetite to invest,"" she says. "
risk appetite,Interest rate rise - views from Wales,2024-09-15,2017-11-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-41835132,"Interest rates have risen for the first time in more than 10 years. But what does it mean for savers and borrowers, home-owners and businesses in Wales?  We asked three financial and business experts from Wales. Julie-Ann Haines is chief customer officer with Principality Building Society and chair of UK Finance's Wales Mortgage Committee; Siobhan Thomas is director and pensions and investment specialist at Seer Green Financial Planning in Newport; Ben Cottam is head of external affairs at the Federation of Small Business in Wales. Why is this happening now? Julie-Ann Haines, chief customer officer at Principality Building Society: There have been movements in some of the key economic indicators monitored by the Bank of England, which have caused the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to act.  Inflation has jumped to 3%, while unemployment is at its lowest since 1975. This means there is the chance of wage inflation which so far hasn't risen above inflation levels. Mark Carney warned that he expects inflation to rise a little further so these ingredients mean the MPC estimates the slack in the economy has fallen sufficiently for them to tighten monetary policy. Ben Cottam, Federation of Small Business: The rates rise is widely attributed to increasing inflation, following the longest period in living memory without a rates rise. Siobhan Thomas, director of Seer Green Financial Planning, Newport: Inflation is driving the rate rise. Interest rates are used to control inflation, a rate increase will help slow inflation, which in recent months has been peaking.  What does it tell us about where the economy is now? Julie-Ann Haines: The UK Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) surveys suggest that the economy will continue to grow but below the traditional pace given the current higher levels of inflation. According to the latest ONS statistics, the economy grew by 0.4% in Q3. Weak economic growth reduces the chances of an interest rate rise but an improving picture makes it more likely.  Ben Cottam: At FSB, we appreciate the effort that the Bank of England has gone to in order to ensure that this rates rise is widely predicted by businesses across the UK. Small business owners consume media like everyone else, so many will have priced in an increase. Siobhan Thomas: Economically, we remain vulnerable with so much uncertainty around Brexit. The interest rate rise will help strengthen the pound, but it may stagnate growth in the economy.  The rise to 0.5% today is the first since July 2007, when the rate rose to 5.75%, before falling again a few months later. It also reverses the cut in August 2016 after the Referendum vote. But looking back at the Bank of England rates over 40 years, interest rates hit a peak of 17% in 1980. Will it encourage more people to save? Julie-Ann Haines: Savers will welcome a rate rise, although the effects are unlikely to be felt immediately.  Banks now make it easier for savers to compare and switch products, and these improvements will help customers shop around to find the best deals as commercial rates reflect the increase. These have been frustrating years for savers. But banks and building societies have simplified their product ranges and made it easier for people to find the right savings product for their needs - which is good news for customers. The electronic Cash ISA Transfer Service has helped to reduce switching times; interest rate disclosure on savings accounts has improved; and some providers have streamlined their savings ranges to help customers navigate the market. These market improvements will help customers shop around to find the best deal as interest rates rise. Cash savings accounts offer a range of interest rate options from instant access accounts paying variable interest to long-term fixed interest deposits. The Financial Conduct Authority's recent Retail Banking Review identified 117 providers offering 1,737 different savings products. These accounts include easy access savings accounts, fixed-term products and tax efficient ISAs.  Most accounts are easy access paying variable interest which have the potential to follow the base rate higher. Siobhan Thomas: Initially it will be a small rise so the rates for savers will continue to be pretty unattractive and will struggle to protect savers from inflation. Ben Cottam: For businesses, the key is having the confidence to invest and grow their business. Businesses want to feel resilient and sustainable. What's critical in achieving this, is that rates rise at a pace that small firms can handle.  We cannot have a surge - an increase must be given time to settle before further rises. Small firms have lots to worry about with rising input costs, business rate hikes, flagging consumer demand, late payments, and an uncertain economic outlook - the last thing they need now is borrowing costs increasing at a speed they can't absorb. Who might it hurt? Julie-Ann Haines: The majority of borrowers will be protected from any immediate effects of today's small increase because they have a fixed-rate mortgage.  Over the last year, two thirds of first-time buyers have opted to fix their rate for up to two years, with a further one in four opting to fix for two to five years. The impact on individual borrowers will vary depending on the loan size, length of term and the repayment method.  According to UK Finance, assuming a 25-year repayment mortgage loan, a 25-basis point rate rise from where current mortgage rates are would lead to an increase in monthly repayments of under £13, per £100,000 of debt. Mortgage holders on a 'base rate tracker' product will automatically move to the increased rate. If you have a 'variable' or 'discount' mortgage product, your mortgage payment is likely to go up in the near future. However, consumers who have opted to take out 'fixed' rate mortgage product over the past few years will not see an increase until the end of the fixed period.   Given that variable rate lenders assess the ability of applicants to pay at much higher interest rates, most should be able to cope with any increases as they filter down.   If anyone is unsure or concerned about how the Bank of England base rate change will impact their mortgage payment, we would initially recommend they check with their mortgage provider. If people's mortgage payment is going to increase, people could review their household expenditure to cut back on luxuries or unnecessary costs to offset the rise in mortgage payments. Siobhan Thomas: Borrowers - variable rate/tracker mortgage borrowers or those coming to the end of a fixed period will feel the effect of the rate rise, especially just before Christmas when spending spikes.  Ben Cottam: Firms in the tourism and manufacturing sector in Wales have benefited from a weak pound. A rate rise could dampen output in these sectors. We already have an issue with small business appetite for finance - only one in 10 is currently applying for external finance. A rate rise won't help with that, both in terms of increasing borrowing costs and exacerbating the perception that finance is hard to secure if you're a small business owner. What would you like to see happen next?  Siobhan Thomas: We would like to see the Bank of England raising interest rates at a slow and steady pace during the next few years. There are too many uncertainties for us economically and a quick successive rate rise would run the risk of restraining growth at a time when economic activity is not high. Ben Cottam: Awareness is critical - any firm that has set up in the last decade has only known rock bottom rates. Policymakers have a responsibility to inform small business owners and the self-employed about the implications of a rate increase. Small firms have lots to worry about with rising input costs, business rate hikes, flagging consumer demand, late payments, and an uncertain economic outlook - the last thing they need now is borrowing costs increasing at a speed they cannot absorb.  Also, it is important to remember that for the smallest businesses, personal and business finance is closely interlinked - if, for example, their mortgage and car leasing costs start to rise in a way they hadn't considered, that could impact the ability of some to create jobs and growth.

risk appetite,Hunt 'would give Johnson cabinet job',2024-09-15,2019-06-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48798355,"Jeremy Hunt says Boris Johnson should have a ""very big role"" in his future cabinet if he wins the Tory leadership contest - despite his competitor refusing to make the same offer.   The foreign secretary told a hustings in Exeter he would love Mr Johnson on board as he was an ""enormous talent"". But his rival told the event he was ""not making commitments to anybody"". Mr Johnson also denied reports that he had offered a job to Home Secretary Sajid Javid.  He told the hustings that, if he made any comments on his prospective cabinet, he would be seen as ""measuring the curtains"" for 10 Downing Street and there was ""still a long way to go"" in the contest.  The two contenders are taking part in 15 hustings across the country as Conservative Party members decide on their party's next leader - and the next UK prime minister.  The 160,000 members will begin voting next week and the winner is expected to be announced on 23 July.  The pair were quizzed by the audience on a number of issues, from Brexit and Russia, through to animal welfare and the sugar tax.  Asked by an audience member whether he would give Mr Johnson a role in his government, Mr Hunt made a joke that he could be his ""secretary of state for collective responsibility"".  But after his ""light-hearted dig"", he added: ""Of course I would love to have Boris in my cabinet.  ""Boris is someone of enormous talent. He has changed the course of our history through his leadership of the Leave campaign and he should always have a very big role in taking things forward."" Mr Hunt also said he would be happy to serve under Mr Johnson, adding: ""We are in an incredibly difficult situation and I think whoever doesn't win in this contest needs to put their shoulder to the wheel and serve loyally the winner, so that we can get through this, get to the other side and give the country all the exciting things we want to do."" But asked the same question, Mr Johnson said there was ""a wealth of talent on the Conservative benches"". Pushed by the hustings' host, LBC radio presenter Iain Dale, on the convention of giving a losing leadership opponent a cabinet position, Mr Johnson added: ""I have a very, very high regard for Jeremy.  ""It sounds to me eminently fair and logical, but I am not making commitments to anybody because you would not expect that.""  The pair also discussed a story in the Sun that claimed the government was looking to extend its ""sugar tax"" on soft drinks to milkshakes.  Mr Hunt said the the country needed to ""tackle the obesity crisis"", but the ""quickest way"" was to target manufacturers of unhealthy food to reduce the level of sugar.  ""You threaten them,"" he said. ""You say, we would be prepared to legislate if you don't play ball. ""But my experience is, if you make that threat, you don't actually need to follow through with the dreaded milkshake tax."" Mr Johnson mocked his own weight while answering the question, but said he was ""very, very reluctant to imposes taxes... that clobber those who can least afford it"". He added: ""What we should be doing, if you want kids to lose weight, is make the streets safe... encourage kids to walk and cycle to school, which will help them to lose weight as well, and generally take more exercise and be more active"".   And Mr Johnson was also asked about accusations in the Daily Mail that he called the French ""turds"" during the filming of a BBC One documentary about the Foreign Office.  The newspaper accused the BBC of cutting the clip from the programme - which aired last November - at the request of the Foreign Office, who worried the comment would make Anglo-French relations ""awkward"". Mr Johnson said he had ""no recollection of this comment"", adding: ""Perhaps what everyone will want to know is, can I get a fantastic deal for our country from our French friends, can we go forwards in a friendly, collegiate way, and yes, of course we can.""  A spokeswoman for the BBC said: ""The programme set out to reflect the realities of life inside the Foreign Office. The production team made judgments about what was in the programme and they are satisfied that the programme achieves its ambitions and has the content they wanted."" The Foreign Office declined to comment."
risk appetite,Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future,2024-09-15,2020-05-14,By Ian Youngs,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52632475,"Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures. The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk. Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton, has already gone into administration. Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up. The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding. ""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe."" He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made £90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September. After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains. The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says. ""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room. ""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre."" It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds. The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark. The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity. When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present. ""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says. ""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental."" The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May. Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online. The five episodes of Connect Fest, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week. ""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise. ""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do."" When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows. ""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities. ""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like. ""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months."" How will the pandemic change theatre? Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"". He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in."" He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about our why as artistic leaders."" The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything. It really does rule the world. ""We have a real opportunity to allow people to understand the power of story, allow people to step into some of that power, who maybe haven't been able to step into that power before, and see the exciting ways in which our world can progress."" When the Royal Court shut in March, it put the words ""Back Soon"" up in big letters on the front of its building in west London. But how soon? ""We keep coming up with different scenarios for when we could open and how we could open, and we alight on one thing, and then that slips,"" artistic director Vicky Featherstone says. ""The closest I can imagine being able to invite a full capacity audience is around January."" It's too risky to commit the money for a big production before that. ""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging."" That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn.  ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains. As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point. ""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted. And now we need to think about how they are supported."" Most of the theatre's education and outreach work has continued digitally, and it has put David Ireland's play Cyprus Avenue online. The Royal Court website is now showing a live feed of the empty theatre. Theatres play a crucial role, she says, citing research that (in normal times) more people go to theatres than to Premier League football matches. They are also where many people in film and TV learn their craft. Featherstone points to Alice Birch, who came through the Royal Court's ranks before co-writing BBC Three's hit drama Normal People. ""We all need stories and we all need our imaginations to be fired up,"" Featherstone says. ""From Shakespeare onwards, we have absolutely led the world. We want to be able to continue that."" Pitlochry Festival Theatre in the Scottish Highlands has postponed its summer season, which had been due to start next week. But artistic director Elizabeth Newman has been busy organising activities, like a phone line for actors to have chats with lonely locals; three daily rays of ""Light Hope Joy"" on social media; and 50 works of art dedicated to the River Tay. One of the summer shows, David Greig's new play Adventures with the Painted People, is being made for BBC Radio 3 instead. ""We've tried to remain a producing organisation that is making art,"" Newman says. ""On the one hand we're doing that and on the other, myself and Kris [Bryce], the executive director, are working around the clock to work out how we can survive this crisis."" That means working out how to stage socially-distanced shows. ""We need to be looking at how we can make work that adheres to government guidelines, but also we need to make sure that we're solvent,"" she says. If they tried to socially distance the 538-capacity auditorium, they would only be able to admit 70 people, which ""is not financially viable"". So Newman and Bryce are looking beyond the building to its 11-acre grounds. ""We're going to have to conceive programmes of work that are not necessarily in the auditorium and are outside, and are quality and rich for our audience, but not necessarily about them being shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers. ""Those are the ideas I'm coming up with - work outdoors, different kinds of performances, different kinds of events, different kinds of social happenings that can occur, but that don't place peoples' lives at risk."" The theatre is the biggest employer in the area, but there are likely to be redundancies. ""I feel that weight very heavily on my shoulders,"" Newman says. ""Some tough decisions are going to have to be made. And it's not going to be small changes, it's going to be big changes for a time. And that feels incredibly painful if I'm honest."" Newman says Creative Scotland hasn't been in a position to offer extra financial support, so she is hoping for an extra package from the UK government. ""It's going to be the last industry that's going to be able to get up to full function, and we're just praying that they're going to come back with some sort of relief and support."" Adventures with the Painted People is on Radio 3 on 7 June. In response to a question about theatres at Wednesday's Downing Street briefing, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""All of us who care about the arts are very concerned for the future of theatres, museums and galleries, performing arts, all of those who work in the sector."" The arts are ""incredibly important to the UK"" and ""one of our great international strengths"" as well as being ""important for our wellbeing"", he said. Many arts organisations have had government support through the furlough scheme, while self-employed people could access grants, he explained. ""The culture secretary is also working very closely with our main cultural institutions to see how we can guide them through undoubtedly a very difficult time, and to put in place the social distancing guidelines so they are ready to reopen when the science and medical opinion allows,"" he continued. ""We hope that that will be later this summer,"" he added, citing the plan for easing the lockdown, which was published earlier this week. ""But it is very conditional on continuing to keep the rate of infection down, and continuing to control the virus."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

risk appetite,Prisoner died before early release decision made,2024-09-15,2023-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-64950379,"A prisoner died of terminal cancer while an appeal for early release on compassionate grounds was still being considered, a coroner heard. Bradley Derosa, 51, absconded from HMP Norwich in March 2022 after ""struggling to accept his diagnosis"". He was arrested in a London hospital, where his worsening condition was being treated. Norfolk assistant coroner, Johanna Thompson, said Mr Derosa wanted to be closer to his family before his death. Mr Derosa, a father-of-four, was jailed for five years in January 2021 after admitting drugs offences and was placed in HMP Norwich, a category D open unit, in July 2021. He had an existing gastric reflux disease, the inquest heard, but complained of indigestion and abdominal pain in January 2022. A month later, his symptoms worsened and his GP service said he had lost three stone without a change of appetite. On 15 March, he complained of difficulty swallowing and was admitted to the Norfolk & Norwich Hospital. The inquest heard Mr Derosa was diagnosed with malignant stomach cancer on 25 March, which a consultant said was ""complex in terms of treatment options"" and offered a poor prognosis. Mr Derosa and his family had requested a second opinion and a transferral to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford to be closer to his family in Essex. He absconded while in hospital in Norfolk and later attended the emergency department at Guy's Hospital in Southwark, with his custodial care transferred to HMP Wandsworth while he was in the capital.  A paperwork application to secure his early release on compassionate grounds was started on 5 May, according to a report from HM Prison and Probation Service.  He died at Guy's on 26 May - before a decision was reached.  In a statement read to the coroner, the deputy governor of Wandsworth prison, Robert Cunningham, said he had ""made recommendations"" that paperwork would be completed more quickly for inmates who have a prognosis of six months. Ms Thompson acknowledged that improvements were being made to risk assessments regarding terminally ill prisoners, but said there was ""no evidence the measure would not have altered the outcome"". The coroner concluded Mr Derosa died of natural causes and offered her condolences to his family.  Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

risk appetite,Forget 70 - what will the NHS look like at 100?,2024-09-15,2018-06-25,By Nick Triggle,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44567815,"The NHS is turning 70. It's a time for celebration.  But like any big birthday, it naturally prompts thoughts of what is to come. What will the NHS look like in the future? Let's see if we can forecast what the health service will be like on its 100th birthday. It seems inconceivable that there won't be. Tory politician Nigel Lawson once famously said "".... the NHS is the closest thing the English people have to a religion"". It means all political parties talk about the NHS being a priority. Earlier this month Prime Minister Theresa May was unveiling a new funding settlement - or birthday present, as it was dubbed - for the health service. It shows what a special case the health service is, given it's the only area of spending that has been agreed outside the normal process. Even the prospect of introducing more charges, for example for seeing a GP, missing a hospital appointment or using A&E, have been quickly dismissed by ministers of all colours in recent years. It suggests, says Nigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, that ""short of a huge political or economic upheaval"" the NHS will still be here in 30 years' time. But if you look even further ahead, the public is not so sure. Polling carried out by Ipsos MORI for the Health Foundation found 23% thought the NHS would not exist in 70 years' time. The 1960s featured a huge programme of hospital-building, creating the network of district general hospitals that are still in use today. These were upgraded by the Blair government, which struck deals with the private sector under PFI to renovate sites and build new ones. But there is now an undoubted shift away from hospital care. Everyone is agreed that the time has come to move care out of hospitals and into the community. It is cheaper and often better for the patient - older people are particularly at risk of losing their independence the longer they spend in hospital. Over the past 20 years the number of hospital beds has shrunk by a third You won't find too many people saying this trend should continue - with a growing and ageing population we may well have reached the minimum needed. But certainly there is an appetite to concentrate the most specialist care in larger centres, allowing more basic care, from diabetes consultations to minor surgery, to be carried out in smaller, community centres and GP hubs. The result could be the closure of some of those district general hospitals. They already are. Or at least robotic-assisted surgery, where doctors control robotic equipment from a console.  The equipment can be more precise and is able to go where human hands could find it difficult to reach. But having a robot carry out an operation independently of human control is another thing altogether.  What is more, the public do not seem so sure they would want that anyway. The Ipsos MORI poll found only 22% though the benefits of an autonomous robot doing surgery would outweigh the risks. However, artificial intelligence is starting to be used elsewhere. One of the most interesting opportunities is using algorithms to interpret scans. Dermatology and pathology also provide promising avenues, which is why Sir John Bell, the life sciences tsar, identified it as a potential ""big win"" for the NHS. In fact, technology overall is perhaps the area where we could see the biggest changes.  The flip side is that it is hard to predict what will happen. Fifteen years ago the human genome was sequenced and that was meant to unlock a revolution in healthcare.  Things are progressing, but it's not been as rapid as many predicted at the time. Genomic medicine - tailoring care based on an individual's unique genetic code - is beginning to change the way people are cared for. Genes can predict if a woman with breast cancer might respond to certain drugs, or whether radiotherapy is likely to shrink a tumour, for example. England's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has urged the NHS to move more quickly and embrace the ""genomic dream"". Others have said much the same about digital technologies.  Video consultations are beginning to be used to connect care homes and hospitals, while telecare is being installed in people's homes to allow health and care staff to remotely monitor and interact with vulnerable patients. But again progress has proved slow. While many of our daily activities are now done online - from shopping to socialising - the NHS still relies very heavily on older technologies. The service is said to be the biggest purchaser of pagers, faxes and stamps in the world.  If nothing else, that should certainly change by the time the NHS is celebrating its centenary year.

risk appetite,Smear test could check risk for some other cancers,2024-09-15,2022-02-01,By Michelle Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-60205239,"Cells collected during smear tests for cervical cancer might be useful for detecting early tumours elsewhere, such as in the breasts and ovaries, research suggests. Scientists say they have found tell-tale signatures in these neck-of-the-womb cells linked to other cancers. Looking for these patterns could provide a warning doctors can act on, they say in the journal Nature Communications.  Experts recommend larger trials.  Women are already invited for routine cervical-cancer checks and, every few years after the age of 50, breast-screening mammogram scans.  Early cancers are easier to treat. But despite much research, there is still no reliable screening test for early ovarian cancer. These tumours are often more advance and harder to treat when they are found.  Cells that turn cancerous often show distinctive early changes at the molecular level.  And researchers believe they have found some in smear-test samples that could help identify women at higher risk of specific other cancers, not just cancer of the cervix. To identify down the most important ones linked to breast and ovarian cancer, Prof Martin Widschwendter and colleagues analysed cervical smear cell samples from: They now recommend studies with more women to confirm their results. Prof Widschwendter told BBC News: ""What we are talking about is identifying women at higher risk who might not otherwise know it.  ""They can then have additional cancer checks.  ""It's a bit like checking blood pressure to see who is at risk of heart problems."" The work was funded by The Eve Appeal research charity that hopes to drive improved treatments for gynaecological cancers. Dr Julie Sharp, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""Screening for cervical cancer is already an invaluable tool, so it's interesting to see if cell samples taken through screening could be used in future to detect other cancers. ""However, we need further research to see how accurate this method is at detecting women with ovarian and breast cancer.  ""Like the authors of this research, we look forward to seeing larger trials over longer periods to establish whether cervical cells could diagnose other cancers at an earlier stage."" About 20 women a day are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK It often causes symptoms similar to other more common and less serious conditions, including: and occasionally: If you regularly have one or more of these symptoms, which are not normal for you, it is important to book an appointment with your GP. Breast and cervical screening is also recommended for some trans or non-binary people. Talk to your GP or gender-identity clinic about this.  Men can develop breast cancer too and should not ignore symptoms such as a lump. "
risk appetite,How coronavirus is changing NHS technology,2024-09-15,2020-05-14,By Sooraj Shah,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52467443,"""Many people within the NHS are talking about two years of transformation done in two weeks,"" says Adrian Byrne, chief information officer at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHSFT). His hospital has been among the many seeing innovations, including the use of a chatbot to provide automatic alerts for Covid-19 test results.  ""Doctors don't look on the system every five minutes to see whether test results are back and this can waste time in being able to discharge or provide patients with care,"" says Mr Byrne. The coronavirus outbreak has spurred hospitals to deal with all sorts of technology issues, not least staff having to use devices while dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE). At the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Dr Peter Young, an anaesthetist and intensive care specialist, had to ask for an app to be built to help non-specialist staff in critical care units to communicate more effectively.  ""They continuously have many questions and while in full PPE they have to rely on a number of ad hoc WhatsApp lists to try and track down the right person who can help them or else they physically have to leave the unit to sort out their problem, wasting valuable PPE,"" he says. Through the Call 4 Help app, staff can request help from everyone in the ICU through a real-time message board. Senior doctors and nurses can monitor and assign tasks through the app, which has been built with PPE in mind. ""We've made sure it is easy to read through visors, and the onscreen buttons are sensitive enough to work easily through double gloved fingers,"" says Dr Young.  The iPhone X was chosen for the ICU as it is waterproof for cleaning, has a loud speaker and sensitive microphone. Once the requestor connects with the responder, the app provides a link to switch from the message board to FaceTime or a phone call if required. The app could be rolled out to all NHS hospitals nationwide.    Sarah Wilkinson, NHS Digital's CEO, says that the organisation has had to scale up its NHS 111 service, as it was receiving almost 100 time as much use as before the pandemic.  In addition, NHS Digital has worked with a team at Cambridge University that has built machine learning models to predict the upcoming demand for ICU beds and for ventilators. This is being extended to estimate how long patients will stay in hospital and eventually, Ms Wilkinson hopes, it could help to simulate the best environments and treatment decisions for patients. These models have been deployed across many NHS trusts already.  The pandemic has also accelerated a number of projects which had been on many NHS trusts' agendas for a very long time. ""The clamour for virtual smart cards instead of physical cards increased as we moved into PPE environments, where putting in the physical card was very difficult,"" Ms Wilkinson said, explaining that the NHS has rolled out virtual cards as a result.  Video conferencing tools had been put on the backburner too, but are now enabling GPs to communicate with patients, doctors to oversee wards and patients to speak to their families and friends. Mike Ogonovsky, assistant director of informatics at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board says the NHS Wales video consulting service reached 88% of GP practices within a month across Wales, and it has been extended to include hospitals, mental health services and care homes. ""It was an R&D evaluation programme which turned into an aggressive national rollout plan in Wales when the pandemic hit - it became a very black and white issue,"" he says.   Similar tools are being used across Scotland and England, while Microsoft Teams has been deployed to 1.2 million users with NHS mail.  Another programme of work has been to reduce the amount of paper created in wards.  ""If we're creating paper notes in a Covid-19 positive environment then those notes are a risk for 72 hours, so we're placing them somewhere else before scanning them. This is a hassle as the notes are not available immediately and there is a risk to any of the administrative teams who want to go through them,"" Mr Byrne explains.  One of the biggest frustrations within the NHS is the inability for every organisation to have access to patient details when they're required. Ms Wilkinson says that many of the patient-sharing initiatives that had been built prior to the pandemic, such as GP Connect, have now been commissioned to be made more accessible for Covid-19.  More Technology of Business The lingering question then, is why weren't many of these technologies being used prior to the pandemic? ""ICT budgets compete against the budgets of fixing a leaky roof or hiring another clinician, meaning there are immensely difficult judgements to make, particularly as some other costs pay off immediately and IT may be slower to pay off,"" says Ms Wilkinson.  For instance, some trusts had bought desktop computers instead of laptops because they were cheaper. Even though laptops allow staff to move around more freely and work from home, many trusts may not have believed that this would save money -  and all technology projects have to prove that they can save the NHS money to get the green light.  Dr Young says the Call 4 Help app would not have been possible in normal circumstances because of the funds and time required for development. Twenty engineers from Kulestar, 4 Roads, CK Alpha and Concept Softworks have voluntarily worked full-time on the app.  But during this crisis, those in the NHS making the financial decisions have been far more receptive to those on the technology side.  ""I think anyone in IT in the NHS would tell you it's been a lot easier to do things in the last few weeks than it would have been prior to the crisis. We're now seeing freeing up of money for digital because it has had to happen,"" says Mr Byrne.  How coronavirus is changing NHS technology But the NHS may have been in a better place to manage the crisis if certain projects had been given the go-ahead far earlier, says Cindy Fedell, the chief digital and information officer at Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. ""Video conferencing is something we could have done one or two years ago, but it was slow to get off the ground, not because of technical issues, but because of people."" Funding is just one part of the problem; there are also strategic and cultural barriers that those in IT in the NHS have to contend with, but Ms Wilkinson believes this will improve as a result of what is now being achieved. ""The art of the possible is so much better understood now, I think we will have a much better understanding [of]... the enormous potential for digitalisation. There will be a broader appetite to invest,"" she says. "
risk appetite,Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia,2024-09-15,2022-03-03,By Michael Race & Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60571133,"Thirty years ago when communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, Western firms stepped up their presence in Russia.  The arrival of big Western companies symbolised the start of a new era with Russians becoming eager consumers of brands ranging from fast-food chain McDonalds to Levi jeans and luxury goods.  Now, in the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of firms have suspended activities in Russia. So which firms, in which sectors, are exiting and why have others held back?  McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken are the latest companies to announce they are halting business in Russia after mounting pressure to act. McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut. The firms were initially remained tight lipped over the conflict, but took action because shareholders ""wouldn't stand"" for the continued generation of profits from Russia, says Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors. ""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she told the BBC. Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia, but the company, which employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products. Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. British American Tobacco has announced it plans to sell its business in Russia due to it being ""no longer sustainable in the current environment"". The world's biggest cosmetics firm L'Oreal and rival Estee Lauder are both closing shops  and ceasing online sales. Estee Lauder, whose brands include Michael Kors, DKNY, Clinique and Bobbi Brown, has had a presence in the country for about 30 years and Russia was where it had some of its strongest sales. In fact, Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at £337.2bn. So some brands may not want to burn their bridges, if there's a chance of returning at a later date. That is why many firms, including other luxury retailers like Burberry and Chanel, simply say they are ""suspending"" sales and temporarily shutting stores rather than withdrawing altogether, says Chris Weafer, chief executive of consulting firm Macro-advisory Limited.  With sanctions limiting forms of payment and huge uncertainty over future prices and consumer appetite, the business climate is ""extremely challenging"" he adds, making the decision to hit pause easier.  The world's biggest fashion retailers H&M and Zara-owner Inditex, which has 502 stores in the country, for example have already suspended sales in Russia, citing ""tragic developments"" in Ukraine. Other brands like Nike have simply said they can't currently guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia. More brands are likely to follow suit, according to Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData. Boohoo, Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo which initially kept its 49 Russian stores open, saying clothes were a ""necessity of life"", are some of the other names to have now cut ties.  Even Levi's, the jeans brand that became a symbol of post-Soviet business in Russia, has closed its shops. The all-American jeans firm said about 4% of its total net sales came from Eastern Europe and Russia last year, but ""any business considerations are clearly secondary to the human suffering experienced by so many"". Samsung, the leading supplier of smartphones in Russia, has said it will suspend shipments to the country but has not said whether its shops will close. Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles, and Sony suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"". Apple has also halted all of its product sales in Russia, and limited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its shops have closed too. For a firm like Apple selling imported items, that's a relatively straightforward decision to take, suggests Macro-advisory's Chris Weafer.  ""Companies do not want to be associated with the Russian regime and what's happening in Ukraine,"" he says. Their Russian business may be profitable, but ""the rest of the world is more important"" when it comes to reputational risk. Some tech companies, flooded by misinformation, are also restricting Kremlin-linked media outlets posting on their platforms. Facebook was blocked in Russia after it said it had refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned news organisations.  Meanwhile, TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia and suspended live streaming, although it is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services. Large consultancy and law firms were some of the first to set up a presence in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union but they mostly operate out of the spotlight.  All of the Big Four accounting groups - Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - have said they will no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Top-tier law firm Freshfields says it will no longer work with any clients linked to the Russian state either. Others say they are reviewing their client base and Russian links.  A senior executive for consultancy firm McKinsey, for example, wrote online that the company would ""no longer serve"" any government or state-owned entities in Russia. According to McKinsey's website, it serves 21 of the 30 biggest Russian companies. When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure. And that is set to intensify now the UK, US and UK have announced bans or curbs on Russian oil and gas. BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting it had announced the operation would be hived off.  That was closely followed by pledges from Shell, ExxonMobil and Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public. Firms want to be seen to be doing the ""right thing"", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Meanwhile, Total Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it won't fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments. It is still far from clear what will happen to those investments - whether they can eventually be sold, recouping some of their value, or if they will simply be written off at great cost. Film fans in Russia wanting to go and see Warner Bros' new blockbuster The Batman won't be able to after the company suspended new film releases in the country. The US movie-maker was joined by Disney and Sony, with premieres of animation Turning Red and Marvel adaptation Morbius also being withdrawn. Disney has also paused its TV channels. Netflix, a fairly new entrant in Russia, has suspended its service in the country and put all ""future projects"" on pause. All companies said their decisions were based on the ""humanitarian crisis"" in Ukraine, rather than as a result of sanctions that have been imposed. All three of the world's major record labels - Sony, Warner and Universal - have closed their offices in Russia, and Spotify has announced it is cancelling its subscription service, although the free, ad-funded version will still work. Payment giants Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal are pulling out of the Russian market in protest. Russian banks have, however, already downplayed the impact of the announcements on their clients.  Sberbank, for example, said that Visa and Mastercard-branded cards would continue to work on Russian territory because all payments in Russia are made through a national system.   However, domestically issued cards won't work abroad, and foreign-issued ones won't work inside the country. US investment bank Goldman Sachs was the first Wall Street bank to say it was winding down its Russian business. The bank, soon followed by JPMorgan, said it was doing so in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements.  German lender Deutsche Bank, which had faced criticism for defending plans not to withdraw, has also said it was taking steps to exit, pledging ""there won't be any new business in Russia"". Jaguar Land Rover, General Motors, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce are among the car-makers that have halted deliveries of vehicles to Russia due to the conflict, while construction equipment manufacturer JCB has paused all operations. Cars are the biggest UK export to Russia, but still only 1% of UK cars went to Russia last year.  So any decision to stop exporting won't be particularly costly, and will have been made easier by nagging concerns over whether or not payments will arrive, says investment analyst Russ Mould. Transporting cars to Russia could prove difficult anyway, with the world's two largest cargo shipping companies, MSC and Maersk, suspending routes to and from Russia, except for food, medical and humanitarian supply deliveries. While the flood of announcements from companies stepping back goes on, there are calls for more to join them. Attention has turned to big food firms like Burger King who have condemned Russia's actions and have pledged support for Ukraine, but are yet to pull out. Some firms will also find it much harder to extricate themselves, even if pressure mounts in the coming days and weeks. In retaliation against sanctions introduced by Western countries, Moscow has banned the sale of Russian assets. So firms that, in recent years, have been encouraged to establish a presence in Russia are ""locked in"" with local businesses, staff and supply chains. Marks & Spencer, for example, has 48 shops in Russia but they are operated by a Turkish franchise company called FiBA. M&S has said it is suspending shipments of its goods to FiBA's Russian business, but the shops in the country remain open. Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchisees  with which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change. Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was suspending operations in the Russian KFC restaurants it owns, and finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Mr Weafer predicts it is likely that some large consumer brands may express concerns over the military conflict, but try to ""ride it out""."
risk appetite,NHS gets limited stock of Wegovy weight-loss jab,2024-09-15,2023-09-04,By Michelle Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66681892,"Some NHS patients could be prescribed the Wegovy weight-loss drug after limited stock arrived in the UK. The injection will be offered by some specialist NHS weight-loss management services, as well as some private clinics. As doses become available, it could help tens of thousands of patients in England, the NHS said. There has been a global shortage of the jabs, which blunt appetite. The cost to the health service is unclear. Research suggests the treatment can help people shed more than 10% of their body weight, by making users feel they are already full so they eat less. Experts warn the jabs - widely used in the US and endorsed by many celebrities - are not a quick fix nor a substitute for a healthy diet and exercise. In trials, users often put weight back on after stopping treatment. It is not clear how much stock the NHS will be able to access or what it will cost but the health service often negotiates a confidential discount with drug manufacturers. The list price for a month's supply ranges from £73.25 to £175.80 depending on the dose. Users inject themselves once a week. Some high street pharmacies, as well as private medical providers, have said they plan to sell it to customers too, offering a full prescribing and dispensing service.  The Danish maker of Wegovy, Novo Nordisk, said it would continue to restrict global supplies as it works to ramp up manufacturing.  It said in a statement there would be a controlled and limited launch: ""As we expect supply to be constrained for the foreseeable future, a proportion of available supply will be allocated for use only within the NHS.  ""We will continue to work with healthcare professionals to help ensure that patients with the highest unmet medical need are prioritised. ""We are closely monitoring demand and are working with regulators and providers to ensure people living with obesity can have access to and remain on the treatment."" NHS guidelines say patients can only access Wegovy, which contains the drug semaglutide, if they are significantly overweight and have weight-related health problems. Eligible patient can be prescribed it for a maximum of two years via specialist weight-management services, alongside diet and exercise advice. These services are largely hospital based, meaning only about 35,000 have access, but the government says tens of thousands more people could be eligible if a new scheme to let GPs prescribe it works.   An NHS spokesperson said: ""Despite global supply constraints, NHS England is taking action to begin implementing NICE guidance for weight management, while at the same time working to restore supplies of this class of drug for people with type 2 diabetes. ""Around 50,000 eligible patients in England could be prescribed Wegovy through NHS specialist weight management services, that are able to provide appropriate multidisciplinary care."""
risk appetite,How streaming services left us with too much to watch,2024-09-15,2022-01-27,By Susan Hornik,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60125013,"The stunning growth of video streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus, has transformed how we watch movies and TV shows.  Here we speak to industry insiders, from producers to executives, to get their take on future trends for the so-called ""streamers"" sector.  One of these is film producer, Miranda Bailey, who found that when her new movie premiered at this month's Sundance Film Festival there was a catch. Due to Covid restrictions, the film - God's Country, starring Thandiwe Newton - could not be shown on a cinema screen at the annual event in the small Utah town of Park City. Instead, it had to be streamed to the festival's virtual attendees. ""Obviously it's a great disappointment, to me and the other filmmakers, to not have the experience of showing our movie to an audience of indie film lovers at Sundance,"" says Ms Bailey. Historically, filmmakers show their new movies at Sundance and other festivals, to get cinema distribution deals. The focus has shifted to streaming platform contracts, or deals for distribution in cinemas and streaming simultaneously. ""Ideally, the filmmakers I work with would be sure to secure some sort of theatrical [cinema] run,"" says Ms Bailey. ""But with the pandemic right now that seems to be a promise no outlet can truly fulfil. ""Fortunately there are a plethora of streaming platforms with brilliant original content who care about indies, and are spending money for award campaigns like traditional [cinema] distribution used to do."" The video streaming sector has become a huge part of the entertainment industry - a dominance partly driven by cinemas being shut down during the pandemic. The world's largest platform, Netflix, had 222 million subscribers at the end of last year, 18.2 million more than in 2020. Meanwhile, Amazon Prime Video had 175 million viewers in 2021, while Disney Plus' base topped 118 million. These vast user numbers are supported by studies that show a growing number of people now prefer to watch new release movies at home, rather than go to a cinema. One report last October found that this was now the case for 71% of Americans. At the same time, we now stream TV shows at a time of our choosing more often than we watch programmes as they are broadcast by a traditional, linear channel such as BBC 1 or Channel 4. The convenience of on-demand viewing is obvious, but Lisa Holme, group senior vice president of content and commercial strategy at US television company, Discovery, fears consumers are now put off by the sheer number of streaming services available. ""We now have a lot of content available across six or eight major streaming services, of which [our] Discovery Plus is one,"" she says. ""I think consumers are now finding themselves a bit overwhelmed by the choice."" Ms Holme adds that some people are ""feeling confused and annoyed"" that they have to go to multiple streaming services to get all the content that they want.  For the US, figures show that 46% of homes with broadband subscribe to four or more video streaming services. While in the UK, one study found 65% of homes subscribe to two or more of the providers. Phil Hopkins, president of niche streaming channel Fandor, says in a crowded market like this standing out from the competition is crucial. His service specialises in showing independent or classic movies, plus foreign films and documentaries. ""The biggest challenge is that there are a lot similarities to the main streaming services, and they're not really doing much in the way of separating themselves to have their own identity,"" he says. Mr Hopkins thinks that among the big players in streaming, Disney Plus is on the most robust footing. ""They have such an amazing legacy [of Disney titles to show],"" he says. ""But I don't know how many other streaming platforms can survive on their own merits... eventually people are going to get fatigue and look elsewhere for something that's unique and different."" At streaming site Paramount Plus, its plan is to accelerate its popularity using live channels, a new feature where its most popular shows and movies go out at scheduled times on 20 genre-themed channels - mimicking traditional TV channels. ""Even in the era of on-demand, there is clearly a strong consumer appetite for reimagined linear channels that provide effortless, lean-back entertainment,"" says Tom Ryan, president and chief executive of ViacomCBS Streaming, the owner of Paramount Plus. Whereas at streaming app Struum, its plan is to make life easier by offering streams from numerous other providers all in one place. This means if you sign up you can access 25 sites, from the likes of the BBC, FilmBox, Magellan TV, Tribeca and Tastemade. ""Viewers want to find that next gem of a show or unknown movie,"" says Lauren Devillier, chief executive of Struum. ""We provide a curated experience so people can 'go deep' on a particular subject. ""You love documentaries? We have hundreds. True crime? LGBTQ? We have all of it for you in one subscription, making simple what might otherwise be confounding."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Paul Erickson, senior analyst at market research firm Parks Associates, says the growth of streaming services was fuelled by the pandemic and continues today despite the general relaxation of lockdown rules. Yet, he cautions that subscription growth in the streaming video market has already begun to slow. He says many consumers are now experiencing ""subscription overload"" and becoming more discriminating with their spending. But as the streaming services wrestle each other for our affections, what does it mean for cinema chains? Are they doomed?  Far from it, says Paul Serwitz, president of US firm Landmark Theatres. He points out that attendances ""steadily increased"" in 2021. ""[And] expectations are for cinema attendance to continue increasing as consumer confidence improves with the Covid evolution, and more compelling film content."" But Tearlach Hutcheson, vice president at US cinema chain Studio Movie Grill, says while regular film goers have returned to cinemas, ""it is the casual movie goer who hasn't"". US National Public Radio TV and media critic Eric Deggans says cinemas will need to improve the experience for film goers to compete with streaming.  ""We're always going to have movie theatres but what form are they going to take? How many of them are there going to be and what kinds of films are they going to show? All of that is up in the air."""
risk appetite,Not just any retail recession...,2024-09-15,2020-05-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52741496,"Never miss the opportunity of a big crisis, goes the advice. Marks & Spencer starts with a big advantage - it's already very used to being in crisis. With its annual results, its boss has seized on the opportunity to push further and faster than he was already doing. It's a ploy you can expect other business leaders to adopt, so it may be of interest to see how Steve Rowe is going about it.  The striking thing about this one-time flagship of British retail is that it has survived being in crisis for so long.  That's partly because the M&S food business has done at least OK in navigating changes to the grocery market. It has invested, for instance, in smaller outlets at locations with a big ""food-to-go"" footfall - notably at railway stations. That's causing it some pain at the moment, with so few rail travellers. Food has helped support it through a perpetual state of crisis with its clothing and home ranges. Criticised for being too frumpy, it has chopped and changed its design teams, its store design, its buying strategy, its marketing... and even when it got things right, it didn't order enough stock. Chief executive Steve Rowe says the turnaround strategy was on track. A 2% drop in revenue in the year to March isn't bad by M&S standards, even though pre-tax profits are down 21%. But clearly, the garment trade is now in a horrible mess, holding stock for summer that it can't sell, with an appetite for online sales sharply down, and no clarity about when it can get back to normal business. The Scottish Retail Consortium figures for April are out, and they make predictably dire reading. Inflation is down to only 0.8%, and at risk of heading into deflation, which would be a bigger nightmare for retailers. If consumers have an expectation that prices will keep falling, then they hold off purchases. Mr Rowe's message to investors and staff is to take ""£1bn of actions"" for the short term, including £100m less late summer stock on order, £50m down on marketing, £40m saved by freezing recruitment and pay, £40m less on technology, £60m through ordering less stock £50m saved by furloughing staff, and £140m less capital spend. Some £400m of stock is not seasonal, so it stays on the shelves. £200m of spring stock will be put in warehouses for next year.  Extra costs for changes in stocking: £145m. Note that a lot of that is bad news for the supply chain, in this country and for overseas garment workers. It's better news if you're renting warehouse space. Beyond the short term, M&S has a new mantra: ""never the same again"". Steve Rowe says it is learning lessons: of a smaller, nimbler top team, delegated decisions, with working groups and committees disbanded. Staff have improvised and learned to multi-task, in-store and in support roles. Microsoft Teams software is a key relationship. Buying policy is focussed on stocking ""more of less from fewer core suppliers"". It seems all that is going to remain in place. That saves cost, and costs mean jobs: ""central support costs and headcount will be examined at all levels"". Transformation plans get accelerated, and that means changes to supply chains: decisions are made closer to the supplier, which is often overseas, while more will be 'near-sourced' for online seasonal products that need quick turnaround. M&S wants to vacate older, underperforming store locations, and is joining other retailers in a hard-bargaining drive to lower rent levels. Commercial landlords won't be at all surprised. Intu, a shopping mall giant which owns Braehead shopping centre in south-west Glasgow, told its creditors this week to brace for their lending conditions to be broken, as rents simply aren't paid. The implicit message: if you collapse this business, good luck finding another one that can work the asset any better! Says Steve Rowe at M&S: ""Whilst some customer habits will return to normal others have changed forever, the trend towards digital has been accelerated and changes to the shape of the high street brought forward. ""Most importantly, working habits have been transformed and we have discovered we can work in a faster, leaner, more effective way. I am determined to act now to capture this and deliver a renewed, more agile business in a world that will never be the same again."" Talking of business strategy, one of the most awkward decisions facing company directors and auditors in the next few months is going to be signing off on accounts. The ""going concern"" statement is meant to reassure creditors and investors that the business will still be around in 12 months. Without a ""going concern"" signature, the red light starts flashing at your bank branch, so it's definitely preferable to have one. In current circumstances, and for many companies, getting from here to this time next year is not at all certain. So the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland is today offering updated guidelines. You might hope it would offer some reassurance.  Instead, its chief executive, Bruce Cartwright, says directors should ""consider the specific facts and circumstances of their company in determining the extent of the procedures to be undertaken when forming the going concern assessment, whilst being cognisant of wider macroeconomic conditions"". Reassured by that? No, me neither. What does it mean? Well, with no specialist qualification in such matters, my interpretation is ""Ca' canny, don't just hope for the best, and this is no time to bend the rules"". Mr Cartwright, a veteran insolvency practitioner, emphasises the need for such statements to be clear and transparent about the evidence available, as well as uncertainty. He adds that companies need to think about permanent changes in the markets where they operate, whether their business model remains sustainable, and whether they need to diversify."
risk appetite,Kenyan MPs' bid to evict UK farmers,2024-09-15,2014-05-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27416769,"Campaigners say that the Meru region cannot be used to grow other crops A group of Kenyan MPs have said they will table a motion in parliament for British farmers to be ejected from the khat-growing Meru region.  They are angry about moves by the British government to ban the use of the leafy substance from this July. Last year, the UK government decided - against some expert advice - to treat khat as a class C drug to ""protect vulnerable members of our communities"".  It is traditionally used by Ethiopian, Kenyan, Somali and Yemeni communities. The mildly narcotic leaf - a herbal stimulant - is already banned in most of Europe and in a number of other countries, including the US and Canada. The MPs say that the British move will force almost two million people out of jobs in Meru, which is one of Kenya's 47 counties and lies to the north-east of Mt Kenya. Campaigners say that khat is culturally significant in Kenya Khat has to be taken to the market quickly so that it is sold fresh It is not clear how many British nationals own farms in Meru. But the MPs say they have about a quarter of the farmland in Meru, including wheat and barley farms.  Florence Kajuju, one of the MPs behind the motion, said the government had the right to compulsorily buy property for later public use. The arable land in Meru owned by UK farmers should be made available to locals as areas used to grow khat could not be used for other crops, she said. ""If they cannot allow us to access their market then they should also then be willing to let go of tracts of land that could be occupied by the Meru people,"" Ms Kajuju told the BBC. She said Kenyans were used to fighting for their rights as they had had to do so to gain independence from Britain. Correspondents say even if the motion was passed by MPs it is unlikely the government would implement it given its policy of accommodating foreign investors.

It suppresses the appetite Heavy use can lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, heart problems and impotence Longer-term risk of developing mouth cancers Can create feelings of anxiety and aggression, and cause paranoid and psychotic reactions Can make pre-existing mental health problems worse Source: www.talktofrank.com Ms Kajuju travelled to the UK last year to appeal for the ban not to be enforced, saying it was important that the British government was not duped by a misinformation campaign. Khat was not only of economic importance but of cultural significance to many Africans, she said. Last year, the UK's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said there was ""insufficient evidence"" that khat caused health problems although regular users suffered withdrawal symptoms. It also said that there was also ""no evidence"" that khat, made from leaves and shoots of a shrub cultivated in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, was directly linked with serious or organised crime. But the UK's Home Office minister warned that failing to ban the drug could lead to the UK becoming a khat trafficking hub.  Kenyan farmers fear UK khat ban City Somalis angry over khat ban.

risk appetite,Anorexia stems from body as well as mind – study,2024-09-15,2019-07-15,By James Gallagher,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48989359,"The origins of the eating disorder anorexia nervosa are in both the mind and the body, according to an international study.  Anorexia is seen as a serious psychiatric disease. But doctors at King's College London showed changes hardwired into some people's DNA altered the way they processed fats and sugars and may make it easier to starve their bodies. The eating disorder charity Beat said the findings were groundbreaking. It is an eating disorder that leads people to lose as much weight as possible by eating little and sometimes exercising excessively. People with anorexia often have a distorted image of themselves and can feel fat even if they are dangerously underweight.  It is more likely to affect young women but can affect anyone of any age or gender. In the long term, anorexia can damage muscles, bones, the heart, fertility and can be fatal. It can be treated and people can make a full recovery. Laura Shah, 23, from Suffolk, was diagnosed when she was 15 and signed off school for treatment. She was a bright high-achiever using exercise as a coping mechanism but it ""spiralled out of control"". She said the disease had had a ""massive and quite horrible"" impact on her family.  Her mother had had to quit her job to be her carer (her father had been working abroad at the time) and it had created ""a lot of trust issues"". She is doing much better now - but anorexia continues to be a challenge, particularly: The researchers looked at 16,992 people with anorexia and 55,525 people without the disease, from 17 countries.  All their DNA - the blueprint for the human body - was analysed to find mutations in genetic instructions that were more common in anorexia patients. The study, published in Nature Genetics, found some mutations also presented in other psychiatric disorders such obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and schizophrenia. But they also found mutations in the instructions that control the body's metabolism, particularly those involving blood sugar levels and body fat. ""There is something in those systems that has gone awry,"" Prof Janet Treasure, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, told BBC News.  The researchers - at King's and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill - say anorexia should now be considered a ""metabo-psychiatric disorder"" as it is a disease of mind and body. The researchers have not fully explored the role played by the genetic instructions they discovered. However, they suspect the mutations allow people to starve their bodies for longer. When most people lose weight, there are signals in the body that push back, stimulating the appetite.. ""These are very important in controlling the set-point of weight,""  Prof Treasure told BBC News. ""It's possible that when people lose weight with anorexia nervosa, they haven't got such strong drivers getting the set-point back to normal."" ""It's very significant because there's been difficulty knowing what sort of disorder anorexia is,"" Prof Treasure told BBC News. ""There have been swings in our understanding ""Now, we know it's a complex mixture of aspects from the body and the mind that interact and cause this complex disorder."" Knowing anorexia was a mix of the physical and the mental could persuade patients to have treatment, she added. Andrew Radford, the chief executive of Beat, said: ""This is groundbreaking research that significantly increases our understanding of the genetic origins of this serious illness.  ""We strongly encourage researchers to examine the results of this study and consider how it can contribute to the development of new treatments so we can end the pain and suffering of eating disorders.""

risk appetite,What can we expect from the Queen's Speech?,2024-09-15,2017-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40204389,"The Queen's Speech on Wednesday will set out the government's proposed legislation and policies for the next session of parliament, as it continues negotiations on a post-election deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. BBC editors and correspondents have been looking at what might shape the government's programme.  A Queen's Speech sets out the government's proposals for legislation in the coming parliamentary session. It does not therefore necessarily have to set out the government's detailed plans for how it intends to conclude an international negotiation. So do not expect Her Majesty to reveal precisely what form of Brexit Theresa May now wishes to pursue after her electoral setback. That will be determined by future discussions she will have with her party and our parliament where she has no majority. Instead, the Queen's Speech will set out the legislation that will be needed howsoever we leave the EU. The largest measure by far will be what has been dubbed ""the great repeal bill"". This is a misnomer. In fact it should be called ""the great continuity bill"".  This bill will indeed repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and thereby take Britain out of the EU. But that is a technicality. More importantly the bill will transfer EU rules and regulations into UK law so there is no legal and financial chaos when we leave.  The idea is to preserve the status quo in the short term so that after Brexit parliament can go through these many laws at its leisure and delete, amend or keep what it wants.  This is such a huge exercise that the government will also have to set out how it intends to go through the estimated 19,000 laws it will need to transpose.  It is likely to use fast-track procedures - known as secondary legislation - that will ensure decisions are taken quickly by ministers and officials and there is no parliamentary gridlock potentially lasting years. But this will be controversial as there will be less parliamentary scrutiny than normal of what the government is doing.  And that is not all. The government has also made clear that it will also have to introduce other bills in areas where keeping EU law is not enough and where new legislation will be needed. These may cover immigration, customs, agriculture, fisheries, taxation, data protection, sanctions and nuclear safety. That is a lot of legislation.  The political point is this - parliament will provide the domestic battleground for Brexit, where MPs try to shape Theresa May's negotiating position, and the weapons they will use will be the bills set out in this coming Queen's Speech. James Landale is the BBC's diplomatic correspondent. This Queen's Speech would normally reflect the winning party's manifesto. But this year, much of the interest is on what's going to be dropped or watered down. Some of the most contentious pledges seem likely to be ditched.  So don't expect to see the scrapping of the winter fuel allowance or a reduction of the so-called ""triple lock"", under which the state pension rises in line with the highest of average earnings, the inflation rate or 2.5%. This was to be replaced by a ""double lock"" rising with earnings or inflation.  What would this mean for the public finances? The ""double lock"" on pensions wasn't going to happen until 2020. And the cost of retaining the triple lock could be zero if the forecasts on earnings growing more than 2.5% are correct.   It's hard to see how the controversial social care plan, which involved people having to sell their homes until they had only £100,000 left in their estates, could get through parliament in its current form, either.  We don't know how much it would cost to retain the winter fuel allowance as there wasn't any detail on how it would be means tested. As for the so-called ""dementia tax"", the IFS says there also wasn't enough detail to cost either the original proposal or the subsequent U-turn.  What would really make a big difference to public spending is if the government eases the restrictions on public sector pay increases, currently capped at 1%, or the freeze on working age benefits.  There's been much talk about reining back on austerity. The new government could end up borrowing more, not less. When it comes to business, this manifesto took a far more interventionist approach than previous Tory pledges. From wading into the energy market with a cap on standard variable tariffs, to plans to ensure worker representation at board level. Theresa May also wanted to increase the amount levied on firms employing migrant workers.  That hasn't gone down well with most firms who are wary of more regulation and fear any additional financial burdens when many are already grappling with rising costs and the uncertainty of Brexit. Could these measures also be diluted? Labour is keen on an even tougher energy cap so perhaps this eye catching measure will remain in the legislative programme.  But it's the spectre of leaving the EU which overshadows everything for business and the economy. Theresa May is certainly under some pressure to take a less rigid approach and several business organisations have already started to wade in.  Additionally, the so-called Great Repeal Bill, which aims to repatriate European law into British law before Brexit, should mean no sudden changes to rules and regulations over the next few years but deciding which laws should be kept or changed will be a huge undertaking. Emma Simpson is a BBC business correspondent. When the 91-year-old Queen begins to read out her speech, the ink freshly dried on the now much-discussed vellum, we should get our first clear indication of where providing support for the UK's ageing population sits in the new government's list of priorities.  Will they deal with the very real problems faced by the social care system head on, or will they veer away from the issue after getting their fingers burned during the election campaign?  The social care system helps people who are older or disabled with washing, dressing and medication, among many other things. With growing demand, squeezed budgets, fewer people getting council help, a shortage of care staff and care companies handing back local authority contracts, it is safe to say this complicated system is in crisis.   For many experts, the Conservative manifesto missed the point on care. It gave with one hand - increasing the amount of people's money that was protected - and took with the other, by including the value of a person's home in all calculations.  But it did nothing about what many see as the fundamental unfairness of a system that leaves some, particularly those with dementia, facing huge costs - sometimes running into the hundreds of thousands of pounds before they get help.  Only four days after the manifesto launch was a cap or limit on the highest care costs promised, but by then the opposition description of a ""dementia tax"" had stuck.  So has the election shifted the debate significantly? Is there now an appetite for finding a way to share the risk of very high dementia care costs in the way we share the risk of cancer or other health costs?  After putting short-term money into social care last winter, the government was planning a green paper on funding this autumn. The other main parties have also talked about working towards a cross-party consensus.  But what if the government puts social care into the ""too difficult to deal with right now"" tray? Well, that is described by at least one commentator as grim, because these problems won't go away.  Alison Holt is the BBC's social affairs correspondent. Officials at Number 10 are, understandably, giving away no details as to how many of the government's ideas on improving UK security will make it into the Queen's Speech.  There is talk of a Counter Extremism Bill, a Commission Against Extremism and measures to curtail online propaganda, but none of this is confirmed.  But we do know from Theresa May's speech on the steps of Downing Street on 4 June the broad areas where she wants to see more effort being focused. She named extremism and hateful ideologies as the sources of current terrorist threats. This means both tackling online radicalisation and no longer allowing intolerance to fester.  ""We need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning,"" she said in her speech.  Her meeting in Paris on 13 June with the new French president appeared to reinforce this in principle but it may be too early to see detail inserted into the Queen's Speech. The prime minister has also suggested that custodial sentences could be extended for terrorist-related offences in the light of the prevailing threat.  Military action against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, she said, is necessary to deprive terrorists of their safe spaces.  There will be a comprehensive review of Britain's counter-terrorism strategy, made all the more urgent by the Finsbury Park attack on Muslim worshippers.  After four terror attacks getting through in just three months, nearly everyone can agree this needs to be undertaken in order to give the police and MI5 the capabilities they need, and to avoid other potential attackers failing to be spotted and then slipping through the surveillance net. Frank Gardner is the BBC's security correspondent. At the outset of the election, the big talking point for education was the 11-plus and the return of grammars in England.   When the votes were counted, the most important figure was the 13-minus - the loss of Conservative MPs and the evaporation of the party's majority. With this new parliamentary arithmetic, there has been widespread speculation that plans for a new wave of grammars have already been ditched, as too controversial to get through the Commons. But nothing has been confirmed and grammar supporters might hold on to a couple of straws for a scaled-down return to selection. The Conservatives' new friends in the DUP are pro-grammar, and Graham Brady, the most high profile grammar-supporting MP, wields more influence than ever as the leader of Tory backbenchers. School funding proved to be one of the biggest grassroots issues during the election. And proposed changes to the funding formula, which looked vulnerable before the election, are now likely to be heavily revised, with a higher minimum amount per pupil.  Apart from how school cash is allocated, head teachers have been loudly telling parents (otherwise known as ""voters"") that the overall level of funding is much too low. If the new government is to avoid even more vociferous protests, they might need much bigger investments. And there must be every chance that the proposed source of extra money - scrapping universal free school lunches for infants - will be ditched as unpopular and requiring legislation that would now be difficult to get past MPs. The other big education story was the impact of tuition fees on a resurgent youth vote. Seats with big student populations, such as Canterbury and Portsmouth South, showed huge swings to Labour, suggesting the promise to scrap fees had been a vote-winner.  Will the government pause for thought? Will they want to be seen as piling more debt on to a younger generation already facing unaffordable housing and stagnating wages? Also will the new government press ahead with one of the overlooked give-aways in the manifesto - to write off teachers' tuition fees as long as they stay in teaching? If there is another election in the autumn, fees could be an even more topical issue, because that's exactly when fees and interest charges on loans are being increased again. Sean Coughlan is the BBC's education correspondent. The prime minister has made few pronouncements on NHS policy but from the moment she arrived in Downing Street last year she made clear her interest in mental health. It was, Theresa May said at the time and again in a speech in January, a ""burning injustice"" that not enough help was on hand for those suffering mental health problems.  Given that the Conservatives' main election campaign health announcement was on mental health, its possible that this might feature in the Queen's Speech.  The Tories said they would scrap the 30-year-old Mental Health Act which, they argued, had brought discrimination and injustice with concerns that individuals were held unnecessarily in hospitals and police cells. A new Mental Health Treatment Bill was promised.  Mental health charities and professionals welcomed the idea of scrapping the old act but warned that a new bill would need plenty of work on detail and extensive consultation. Theresa May could restate the government's commitment to the plan in the Queen's Speech without being specific about the timing for a bill. Beyond that, health legislation seems unlikely. There is no appetite in Whitehall and the NHS for further system-wide reform. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, has pushed on with radical plans for joined-up care involving local health and social care leaders.   But he says they don't need new legislation. Ministers, aware that trying to push changes through Parliament without a majority will be difficult, are likely to let Mr Stevens get on with it. Hugh Pym is the BBC's health editor. The terror attacks at Manchester Arena and London Bridge changed the course of the election campaign and - together with the Finsbury Park attack on Muslim worshippers- provide the backcloth to the government's law and order priorities.  Chief constables have begun putting the case for increased resources, in particular for neighbourhood policing, their arguments strengthened by public support following the heroic actions of officers during the attacks.  Indeed, funding issues, with proposals on the way for a new formula for allocating central government cash to the 43 forces in England and Wales, are likely to overshadow proposals for police reform.  Those plans - giving more control to police and crime commissioners, allowing outsiders to enter the police at senior ranks and establishing a national infrastructure police force - may have to be eased in gradually.   Ministers are expected to reintroduce the Prisons Bill, which was aborted when the election was suddenly called, giving governors more say over the running of jails and bolstering the powers of inspectors.  But the immediate challenge is to stabilise prisons, with more staff, improved drug-detection methods and a renewed focus on mental health. Watch out too for an overhaul of probation; a review of the semi-privatised system, brought in by Chris Grayling, should be published very soon.  Danny Shaw is a BBC home affairs correspondent."
risk appetite,Early brain 'signs of Parkinson's' found,2024-09-15,2019-06-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48691633,"Scientists say they have identified the earliest signs of Parkinson's disease in the brain, 15 to 20 years before symptoms appear. Scans of a small number of high-risk patients found malfunctions in the brain's serotonin system, which controls mood, sleep and movement. The King's College London researchers say the discovery could lead to new screening tools and treatments. Experts said larger studies and more affordable scans were needed first. Parkinson's is a progressive neurological condition affecting about 145,000 people in the UK. The main symptoms are shaking, tremors and stiffness but depression, memory and sleep problems are also common. Traditionally, the disease is thought to be linked to a chemical called dopamine, which is lacking in the brains of people with the condition. Although there is no cure, treatments do exist to control symptoms - and they focus on restoring dopamine levels. But the KCL research team, writing in Lancet Neurology, suggest that changes in the brain's serotonin levels come first - and could act as an early warning sign. The researchers looked at the brains of 14 people from remote villages in southern Greece and Italy who all have rare mutations in the SNCA gene, making them almost certain to develop the disease. Half of this group had already been diagnosed with Parkinson's and half had not yet shown any symptoms, making them ideal for studying how the disease develops. By comparing their brains with another 65 patients with Parkinson's and 25 healthy volunteers, the researchers were able to pinpoint early brain changes in patients in their 20s and 30s. These were found in the serotonin system, a chemical which has many functions in the brain, including mood, appetite, cognition, wellbeing and movement. Lead study author Prof Marios Politis, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's, said the abnormalities had been found long before movement problems had begun and before dopamine levels had changed. ""Our results suggest that early detection of changes in the serotonin system could open doors to the development of new therapies to slow, and ultimately prevent, progression of Parkinson's disease,"" he said. Prof Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London, said the research provided some valuable insights but also had some limitations.  ""Their results may not scale up to larger studies,"" he said.  ""Secondly, the imaging method they used is highly specialised and limited to a very small number of research centres, so isn't yet usable either to help diagnose patients or even to evaluate novel treatments in large clinical studies. ""The research does, however, provide encouragement for the approach of trying to treat Parkinson's disease at the earliest possible stage, which is likely to be the best chance of preventing the rising number of people whose lives are destroyed by this hideous disease."" Dr Beckie Port, research manager at charity Parkinson's UK, said: ""Further research is needed to fully understand the importance of this discovery - but if it is able to unlock a tool to measure and monitor how Parkinson's develops, it could change countless lives."""
risk appetite,Government launches probe into Cameron's lobbying,2024-09-15,2021-04-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56720141,"The government has announced a review covering David Cameron's efforts to lobby ministers on behalf of finance firm Greensill Capital. The former prime minister has been criticised for contacting ministers via text on behalf of the company, which collapsed in March. Downing Street said the probe would be led by lawyer Nigel Boardman on behalf of the Cabinet Office.  Labour says the government's response is ""inadequate"".  Mr Cameron has said he has not broken any codes of conduct or lobbying rules. But in a statement on Sunday weeks after reports of his lobbying emerged, the former Tory leader said that he should have contacted ministers through ""formal"" channels. A spokesman for the former PM told the BBC: ""David Cameron welcomes the inquiry and will be glad to take part.""  Mr Cameron began working as an adviser to Greensill Capital in August 2018, two years after he stepped down as prime minister. In recent weeks, newspaper reports have revealed he texted Chancellor Rishi Sunak and other Treasury ministers on behalf of the company.  Mr Cameron said he had been trying to involve the company in a government-backed emergency loans scheme for firms hit by the Covid pandemic.  The government went on to reject his plans to involve Greensill in the so-called Covid Corporate Financing Facility. It has also been revealed that Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019 to discuss a payment scheme for the NHS.  An ally of Mr Hancock said he had ""acted in entirely the correct way"". If you hope that the review that is meant to clear up what happened in this instance will propose some big crackdown, forget it.  Just like the organisation that provides rules for former ministers, it has no power of sanction, no statutory, or legal force.  Sources suggests its remit is to find out narrowly what happened with Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill, not to start a conversation about the rights and wrongs of lobbying, let alone to propose a new system.  That is not to cast aspersions either on the ability of the senior lawyer who will carry out the work, who may well turn up more interesting nuggets.  He'll report by the end of June, and has been promised access to the information he needs.  But the remit is tightly drawn, suggesting little appetite in government for a big rethink of the landscape. Downing Street insists the prime minster understands the significant public interest and wants to look at the issues raised and get more details. While there is no love lost between Boris Johnson and David Cameron, and it is pretty much impossible to think of a similar case where a serving PM commissions an investigation into one of his predecessors, Labour is already warning that it could be a ""Conservative cover-up"".  Despite that rather dramatic language, do not forget there are questions that remain for current government figures about conversations they had with Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill.  Read more here A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the review would look into ""the decisions taken around the development and use of supply chain finance (and associated schemes) in government, especially the role of Lex Greensill and Greensill Capital"". ""Mr Boardman will have access to all necessary government information required to conduct the review and will engage with those involved at the time when decisions were made."" The spokesperson also said that Mr Boardman would report his findings to the prime minister ""no later than the end of June 2021"" and that he will pause his work as a non-executive director of the Business Department while the review is carried out. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says it is understood the review will not have legal powers, and is likely to come up with findings rather than recommendations.  And Mr Boardman has not been asked to suggest ways of tightening up the lobbying system, but has been given a limited remit to ascertain how decisions about Greensill Capital were made.  The shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said what the government has announced ""doesn't go far enough"".  ""There is a real risk that the government are attempting to brush under the carpet or cover up this scandal of cronyism, of contracts and of involvement of the former prime minister in lobbying current ministers"" she said.  ""It is essential that everybody involved in this scandal comes before parliament and answers serious and important questions about possible wrongdoing"" she added.  Mr Cameron's predecessor at No 10, Gordon Brown, welcomed an inquiry, adding: ""it's important to get to the bottom of this"". The ex-Labour leader told BBC News: ""I don't really think former ministers and prime ministers should be engaged in lobbying for particular commercial companies, when they are lobbying their successors whom they know very well and could have privileged access to. ""Lobbying in this commercial way could also be a stain on our democracy, and therefore an inquiry is completely appropriate."" Former ministers and senior civil servants are banned from lobbying for two years after they leave government, a rule Mr Cameron followed. Mr Brown had suggested earlier on Monday the ban should be extended to five years if existing rules prove inadequate. "
risk appetite,NHS chiefs discuss having wealthy pay for treatment,2024-09-15,2022-11-21,By James Cook,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63659754,"NHS leaders in Scotland have discussed abandoning the founding principles of the service by having the wealthy pay for treatment. The discussion of a ""two-tier"" health service is mentioned in draft minutes of a meeting of Scotland's NHS leaders in September.  They also raise the possibility of curtailing some free prescriptions. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the principles of the NHS were ""not up for debate"". She acknowledged the ""very significant pressure"" facing health services worldwide but added that the process to ""redesign and reform"" would ""take place - for as long as I have got anything to do with it - within the confines of these founding principles"". The minutes of the meeting seen by BBC News are marked ""in confidence not for onward sharing"" and highlight the degree of official concern about the sustainability of Scotland's NHS in its present form. They include suggestions that hospitals should change their appetite for risk by aiming to send patients home more quickly, and pause the funding of some new drugs. According to the minutes, the meeting began with an update about ""recent conversations"" with NHS Scotland chief executive Caroline Lamb.  The group were then advised that they had been given the ""green light to present what boards feel reform may look like"" and that ""areas which were previously not viable options are now possibilities"". Describing a ""billion pound hole"" in the budget, the minutes warn that it ""is not possible to continue to run the range of programmes"" the NHS currently offers while remaining safe ""and doing no harm."" And they warn that: ""Unscheduled care is going to fall over in the near term before planned care falls over."" The minutes note ""concern"" about an alleged lack of clinical input into political decision-making which, they say, leaves some Scottish government suggestions feeling ""divorced from reality of life and purpose of service."" Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf told the BBC he disagreed with that assertion. He added: ""I meet with the chairs and chief executives on a very regular basis and we have very good conversations about reform of the NHS which I think can happen within a space but those parameters cannot compromise the founding principles of the NHS."" Last month the BMA in Scotland said the country's health service was in a ""perilous situation"" and urgent action was needed to tackle work load pressures. Official figures show about 6,000 nursing and midwifery posts are unfilled while A&E waiting time targets continue to be missed. The meeting minutes go on to highlight an alleged ""disconnect from the pressure that the boards are feeling and the message from SG [Scottish government] that everything is still a priority and to be done within budget"". They also state: ""Concern was noted that there may be siloed discussions ongoing within Scottish government that do not include CMO/CNO (Chief Medical/Nursing Officer)."" There is a suggestion that ""fundamental reform"" of the primary care model ""must be on the table"", and that the success of the NHS has been built on a model ""that no longer works today"". However, the minister Mr Yousaf said: ""The Scottish government's policy could not be clearer, our National Health Service must be maintained to the founding principles of Bevan - publicly owned, publicly operated, and free at the point of need."" It may be unusual to see these sorts of thoughts written down by NHS bosses, but the discussions in Scotland are - by and large - ones that are being had across the UK. Wherever you look services are struggling. And while plenty argue the NHS has seen its budget squeezed too much over the past decade, funding is only part of the issue. An ageing population, coupled with ever-more expensive drugs raises some very difficult, uncomfortable questions for decision-makers about where the boundaries of a health service should lie. They boil down to three key issues. 1. Does there need to be more rationing? Many drugs that come on to the market now are not treatments that cure disease, rather therapies that can extend life. The NHS pays a premium for these. It's why some are suggesting cutting back. 2. Should the NHS charge more? Payments are always controversial. But it's worth remembering in the early 1950s when budgets were tight charges were brought in for dentistry, prescriptions and spectacles. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have subsequently scrapped prescription fees, but it is noticeable reversing that is one of the proposals floated in this meeting. Beyond that charging for everything from bed-and-board while in hospital to missed appointments have been suggested. 3. And what about waste? Arguably the single biggest inefficiency in the NHS is patients being kept in hospital when they are medically-fit to leave. Everyday around half of hospital patients in England who are ready to leave don't. The biggest cause is the lack of support in the community. Interestingly, the Scottish NHS chiefs ponder whether hospitals are too risk-averse in these situations. There is evidence to suggest they are and what is more there are the obvious trade-offs with new patients who need beds coming to harm because they are kept waiting in corridors and in the backs of ambulances. The NHS was established on 5 July 1948 after Labour Health Secretary Aneurin Bevan promised ""a universal health service without any insurance qualifications of any sort...available to the whole population freely"". But controversial charges for dental and eye care were introduced within three years, contributing to Bevan's resignation from the government. In recent years health services across the UK have been beset by immense challenges including the Covid pandemic, an ageing population and staffing shortages. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said in his Autumn Statement on Thursday that the country must ask ""challenging questions"" on how to reform all public services for the better, including the NHS. He was speaking as Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told Holyrood that the pressure on the NHS is greater than it has ever been at any point in its history, but the amount the Scottish government is able to invest in the health service is dependent on decisions taken at Westminster. The minutes of the NHS Scotland meeting summarise ""themes, issues and ideas"" during 45 minutes of discussions on Wednesday, 21 September, about ""what a transformed NHS could look like"". They ask ""what can be done with the financial constraints that we have?"", and point out that some members of the public ""are already making the choice to pay privately"" while the NHS is ""picking up the cost for life enhancing not life-saving treatments"". It is in that context that the suggestion to ""design in a two-tier system where the people who can afford to go private,"" appears. At one point the minutes note that it is ""almost easier to identify what it is not possible to do anymore than what is/will be"". There is a proposal to change ""the risk appetite from what we see in hospitals,"" suggesting a target for patients to be discharged to their home for treatment after a maximum of 23 hours. ""It is not gold standard but what other countries can do without an NHS,"" it adds. According to the draft minutes, other points noted at the meeting included: Mr Yousaf, who praised the ""exceptional work"" of NHS staff, added: ""There is also frequent engagement between ministers and NHS board chief executives, and daily discussions between the Scottish government and individual health boards on service performance and pressures. ""Our NHS and care services continually evolve to meet the changing needs of the people of Scotland, and reflect changes in practice and medicine. In our five-year NHS Recovery Plan we have outlined our commitment to continued investment and reform of the NHS, alongside delivering the National Care Service."" The minutes of the September meeting also detail discussions about the government's proposed National Care Service (NCS), and state that: ""There are a group within SG who recognise that it may not be possible to provide what it was initially proposed within NCS.  ""Their challenge is how to get off that promise and do something different."" They also suggest that ""£800m for NCS does not make sense"" given the huge funding challenges for the NHS,  In recent weeks ministers have been under pressure about exactly how the new care service would work and be funded.   In its final section the minutes include a suggestion that clearer priorities must be established for the NHS. ""Everything is a top priority, what is the real focus?"" they ask, with the summary of the discussions concluding, bluntly: ""The fundamental model of healthcare is not working for us."""
risk appetite,Hepatitis A outbreak school vaccinates pupils,2024-09-15,2019-07-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-49017472,"Pupils and staff at a North Yorkshire school at the centre of a hepatitis A outbreak have been vaccinated after the virus spread to another pupil. Public Health England (PHE) said 30 cases were confirmed in Ripon, with 20 of those at Outwood Academy school and a further 10 in the wider community. In a letter, the school said it had seen ""transmission from pupil to pupil spread within the school"". PHE said hepatitis A cases were likely to rise as investigations continued. But the number of new illnesses connected to Outwood Academy ""continue to slow down"" and risk to the wider community ""remains low"", a PHE spokeswoman said. The school said it took measures ahead of the school holiday to prevent the infection from spreading ""throughout the summer"". Dr Mike Gent, deputy director of health protection at PHE Yorkshire and the Humber, said: ""Parents of pupils at Outwood Academy, and staff, have been asked to remain alert to the signs and symptoms of hepatitis A infection.  ""In particular, jaundice - a condition which causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow - could indicate infection with Hepatitis A. ""Anyone developing symptoms should contact their GP or NHS 111 for advice. People are urged not to contact GPs if they remain well."" He said the source of illness and ""any potential common links between these cases remains under investigation"". A food handler at So! Bar and Eats was among the confirmed cases and precautionary advice was given to anyone who ate at the Ripon pub between 8 and 23 June to be aware of the symptoms. But no further cases linked to the restaurant had been found, PHE said. Source: NHS England Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

risk appetite,Weight loss drug semaglutide approved for NHS use,2024-09-15,2023-03-08,By Annabel Rackham,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-64874243,"A weight loss jab that has gained popularity in the US has been approved for use by the NHS in England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded semaglutide, marketed as Wegovy, is safe, effective and affordable. Delivered via an injection into the skin, the drug makes people feel fuller and more satisfied, so they eat less. Famous personalities such as Elon Musk claim to have used it - with a ""craze"" allegedly developing in Hollywood. Based on evidence from clinical trials, NICE says semaglutide could help people reduce their weight by over 10%, if implemented alongside nutrition and lifestyle changes. It will be recommended for use by people with at least one weight-related health condition, as well as those who have a body mass index (BMI) which puts them near the top of the obese range. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres. Those who are lower on the obese BMI range - a BMI between 30 and 34.9kg/m2 - could also be offered the drug if they have a weight-related health condition. NICE lists these as someone who is pre-diabetic, has type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or obstructive sleep apnoea.  Once-weekly injections of Wegovy will have to be prescribed by a specialist, and an individual will only be able to take the drug for a maximum of two years. Semaglutide is also found in the diabetes medicine Ozempic, but, unlike Ozempic - which is intended for those with type 2 diabetes - Wegovy is recommended specifically for weight loss.  The drug works as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone called Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). This intestinal hormone is released after eating and typically makes people feel fuller, so should help reduce overall calorie intake.  An article published last year in Variety suggested the diabetes medicine Ozempic, which contains semaglutide, is being used by some professionals in the film and entertainment industry to lose weight quickly.  It has become so popular that there are currently widespread shortages in the US and concerns for those people who rely on the drug for medical reasons.  Insurance companies in the US are refusing to cover its use among people who are not diabetic and not taking it as a prescribed medicine.  Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which makes both Ozempic and Wegovy, says the products should only be used as recommended by a doctor. Like all medication, semaglutide comes with side-effects and risks - including nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea.  In addition, rapid weight loss can also lead to the skin losing collagen and elastin, causing what Vogue Magazine has dubbed the gaunt ""Ozempic face"".  Kailey Wood, 36, has been taking Ozempic for seven months, after being prescribed the drug by her doctor in New York.  She tells the BBC that she has lost just under 30kg - going from obese to healthy in the BMI range. ""I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and insulin resistance, but honestly I didn't really struggle with my weight until I hit my 30s - after I had my kids,"" she says. ""I was rapidly gaining weight. I had a personal trainer and was on every diet known to man - keto, low carbohydrate, intermittent fasting and nothing seemed to work,"". When Kailey went for tests with her doctor, she was told she had high blood pressure and high cholesterol and, due to the risks associated with PCOS, she was at risk of developing type 2 diabetes too. ""The long-term effects [of being obese] freaked me out having two daughters,"" she says. ""I just wanted to get to my best self - to show them what a healthy mum looks like; to get outside and play with them."" Kailey, who works for a tech start-up and runs her own TikTok page, says that people who want to use semaglutide need to know the drug does have side-effects. ""When you start taking this medication, your body almost goes into shock - you get headaches, nausea, tiredness,"" she explains. ""But your body starts to get used to it. You have to be mindful and listen to your body."" Kailey says those elements of the US media who promoting the drug as a ""get skinny quick product"" leave ""a bad taste"". She believes it sends the wrong message. ""What it's really doing is changing people's lives - treating the patient before they have the disease,"" she says. ""Diet and exercise"" has been the weight loss medical mantra for decades.  And on the whole it's failed - more than half the planet is projected to be overweight or obese by 2035, driving up cases of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. It's against that backdrop that semaglutide - and other drugs on the horizon - promise to do something different.  The impact on weight while taking semaglutide is undeniable, at least for the short term.  However, the drug is being offered only for two years and only in specialist services - raising issues of fairness.  Not everyone who may be eligible will be able to access it. And the evidence shows the weight goes back on when people come off the drug, with people regaining around two-thirds of their lost weight within two years.  There are also questions about the collision between these drugs (which are also available privately) with ideas of beauty and celebrity culture - particularly on those with eating disorders.  And more deeply, whether we're still ignoring the societal reasons that lead to obesity.  BBC Sounds: Inside Health on weight-loss drugs  Just over a quarter of adults in England are obese and around a third are overweight, according to official figures.  In the UK, obesity is thought to cost the NHS £6.1bn per year, government estimates show.  The drug semaglutide is currently under consultation in Scotland, with Wales expected to follow the NICE guidelines issued in England.  Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said: ""For some people losing weight is a real challenge, which is why a medicine like semaglutide is a welcome option. ""It won't be available to everyone. Our committee has made specific recommendations to ensure it remains value for money for the taxpayer."" Dr Duane Mellor, registered dietitian and senior lecturer at Aston Medical School, Aston University, said: ""It is important to remember that living with a higher body weight or obesity is not a lifestyle choice, and people wanting to improve their health should be supported to do that. ""It is also clear that semaglutide is not intended to be a lifestyle weight-loss product in the UK. It is to be used for the purpose of improving health."" Anyone who is offered semaglutide on the NHS will be supported by specialist weight management services, including support from a dietitian."

risk appetite,Night climbers: 'You feel very exposed up there',2024-09-15,2019-04-11,By Orla Moore,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47537261,"""At this very moment there may be a dozen climbers on the buildings of Cambridge. They do not know each other; they are unlikely to meet. And inadvertently they will find what we found, a love for the buildings and the climbs upon them, a love for the night and the thrill of darkness."" This is the passage that concludes The Night Climbers of Cambridge, a 1937 book that remains an influence on those with a head for heights in this famously low-lying city. The tome describes a familiar skyline: the four piercing spires of King's College Chapel, the tower of St John's, the pale Portland stone of the Senate House. And for decades, a clandestine group has sought distraction from the monotony of study by scaling some of these landmarks. ""If you like mountaineering or rock climbing, Cambridge is probably the worst place in the whole of Britain to be,"" says Tom Whipple - now science editor at The Times - who tiptoed across the rooftops as a restless maths student in 2000. ""I'm used to modern plastic drainpipes, but these were really sturdy cast-iron ones - you could get your hands behind them and climb.  ""Sitting up there in the fog, the clocks are chiming midnight; you cannot see anything of the modern world.  ""You flatter yourself; you feel part of this secret society, this continuum. I was hooked."" Whipple talks of abseiling into the Trinity Ball in a dinner jacket - and the kudos to be gained from ""leaving a wheelie bin on New Hall dome"". ""The fear of getting caught was more intense than the fear of injury,"" says Rebecca Wetten, who studied history of art between 2010 and 2014. She says her favourite climbs were at the New Museums Site and the Faculty of History, which is noted for its resemblance to an open book. ""None of the climbs needed special equipment but you worked out a pattern to them; you needed someone who knew the way and would help you figure out shortcuts. That's why it was good to do it as a pair."" And although membership of a club isn't necessary to partake in this renegade pastime, it does appear there is a shadowy group dedicated to night climbing.  A reporter with Cambridge student newspaper The Tab, who in March 2016 followed a small group on the rooftops, claimed to have seen a list of 24 initiation questions for night climbers who hoped to join a secret society dedicated to the practice. These ranged from ""How close have you come to dying?"", ""Do you ever have to consciously prevent yourself from deliberately jumping when you find yourself standing on a cliff or rooftop?"", to the apparently irrelevant: ""What do you know about central banking and currency laws?"" Looking up at the rooftops, tourist Leo Hayes, 70, who is visiting Cambridge from Ireland, is incredulous to learn of the activity. ""Just one word: mad,"" he says. ""Risk your life for nothing except a dare? Jumping between buildings? Crazy."" In 1899, British mountaineer and poet Geoffrey Winthrop Young was the first person to document the activity in his book The Roof-Climber's Guide to Trinity, written in part as a parody of an alpine guidebook. The third edition in 1960, edited by Richard Williams, describes the practice as ""like cat burglary, but without the robberies"". But 1937's The Night Climbers of Cambridge, by Whipplesnaith - the pseudonym of the author Noël Howard Symington - is the publication that is credited with inspiring generations of night climbers. It describes in detail the routes up particular colleges - and indeed the routes off them: the ""Senate House leap"" is achieved by jumping across the 6ft (1.8m) gap between the roof of Gonville and Caius College and the neighbouring Senate House. Jon Gifford, of Oleander Press, which reprinted later editions of Whipplesnaith's guide, says the work has ""great literary appeal"", with language that's ""evocative of another age"". ""It is melodious and romantic,"" he says. ""The thrill of being alive and one with nature, in many ways.  ""But it was also about civil disobedience, letting off steam, about risking lives."" Tom Whipple, who was given a copy by his father, remembers a particular passage with fondness: ""As furtively as the bats of twilight, they shun the eyes of the world, going on their mysterious journeys and retiring as quietly as they set out."" Whipplesnaith also writes of injured backs and torn trousers, of near misses and scorched hands - although no-one is known to have been seriously injured or killed. Two students were rusticated, or dismissed, by their colleges for climbing King's College Chapel in June 1937.  Another two were also ""sent down"" in the early 1960s after they were caught by police trying to scale the Senate House. ""One moment we were protected, isolated students, the next we had been abandoned, jobless, penniless in the last stages of a degree course,"" one of them wrote. The Fleet Street photographer and filmmaker John Bulmer - an engineering undergraduate between 1957 and 1960 - was ""asked to leave"" King's College six weeks before his finals after one of his images ""caused upset"" when it appeared on the front of The Sunday Times. ""It was a photo of a climber on King's College Chapel window. I was hauled up before the proctors,"" he remembers.  ""The college was dissatisfied that I was spending more time on photography than my studies."" The image was part of a feature written for Life magazine, which saw Bulmer, armed with a Canon 35mm and ""big old-fashioned flashbulbs"", following Cambridge's night climbers. ""It was challenging, but the aim with any photograph is always to kick the viewer in the gut,"" he says. These days, Cambridgeshire Police ""strongly discourages"" the practice on safety grounds, however the force says that no crime is being committed by night climbers, as long as damage isn't caused to the buildings. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents has previously warned urban climbers not to let an ""appetite for adventure"" override safety concerns. It points out that any accident affects not only the climber, but their family, the emergency services and staff who work on the sites. Trespassing, police say, is mostly a civil offence, although night climbing can be considered a ""public nuisance"". That's certainly how it must have seemed to the university over the years - although it declined to comment for this article. In June 1958, a battered Austin 7 appeared on the roof of the Senate House overnight. Seven years later, a banner reading ""Peace in Vietnam"" was attached to the lightning rods on the spires of King's College Chapel. And in November 2009, climbers scaled an 80ft (24m) external wall of the chapel to fix four Santa hats on the pinnacles. Ian Gray, the porter at King's at the time, says he and the college chaplain went up on to the roof to try to poke off the festive headgear with a stick. ""As it transpired the hats were on the very top of the spires and there was no way us less daring types were going to go up there and get them down,"" he says. ""I remember at the time just saying, 'wow - that is quite a feat'."" In the end, a steeplejack had to ""rescue each one in turn at great expense"". Andy Buckley, now a particle physicist at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, was a night climber during his time as a physics student between 1997 and 2005. By the time he had arrived at Cambridge, the contours of the colleges had barely changed from the days of Winthrop Young, although CCTV cameras have been installed, as have wall-top spikes in a bid to deter nocturnal ascents. ""I was secretary of the climbing club at the university, and it had this old book about night climbing, and I thought it was a good yarn,"" he says. ""A lot of the building work was decaying and I felt bad about the possibility of damaging them. But you could shinny up the drainpipe and get a fantastic view into the inner sanctum of the university.  ""You feel very exposed up there but you see the structures very differently."" For Rebecca Wetten, scaling the heights of the Faculty of History is an enduring memory of her time in Cambridge. ""I threw off my shoes and climbed it in my May Ball gown, in my bare feet, and saw the most wonderful sunrise,"" she says. ""It was an amazing send-off for my final year. ""No-one can take that from me."" You can hear more about Cambridge night climbing and other stories on the theme of ""Secrets"" on the BBC Multi Story podcast on the BBC Sounds app or on the podcast's website."
risk appetite,'Thrill of investing' leads young to take risks,2024-09-15,2021-03-23,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56496206,"Young people are investing in high-risk products for the ""challenge, competition and novelty"" it involves, the City regulator has said. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned they were getting involved in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, but could be taking on big risks. It said they were often more likely to be women, aged under 40 and from a diverse ethnic background. They were attracted by the ""thrill"", rather than saving for the future. The FCA commissioned research looking into ""self-directed"" investors - those who trade themselves rather than seeking financial advice. The study found many investors were willing to ""have a go"", had been tempted by using investment apps, and went with options because they had been ""hyped"" and assumed big name brands were ""safe"". The FCA has launched a campaign to prevent investment harm, using online advertising, advising people to ask: Sheldon Mills, executive director, consumer and competition at the FCA, said: ""Much of the consumer investments market meets consumers' needs. ""But we are worried that some investors are being tempted, often through online adverts or high-pressure sales tactics, into buying higher-risk products that are very unlikely to be suitable for them. ""This research has helped us better understand what drives and motivates consumers so we can tell them about the risks involved in these investments through our investment harm campaign. ""We want to make sure that we encourage the ability to save and invest for lifetime events, particularly for younger generations, but it is imperative that consumers do so with savings and investment products that have a suitable level of risk for their needs. ""Investors need to be mindful of their overall risk appetite, diversifying their investments and only investing money they can afford to lose in high risk products."" Becky O'Connor, from investment platform Interactive Investor, said: ""We want young people to invest - in their pensions and for their families' futures. But we want them to think long and hard about it, do their research and take the time and effort to understand things like risk from different types of asset classes. ""Most young people don't have money to burn - so potentially throwing it away on high risk investments is a big waste when there are so many life challenges down the road for them that they might need that cash for."""
risk appetite,Can the government deliver on radical care reform?,2024-09-15,2018-11-08,By Nick Triggle,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46103021,"Another week, another sign that the care system in England is in dire trouble. News that Allied Healthcare - one of the biggest providers of home care in the country - is at risk of going under, sent shockwaves around the sector. The 13,000 vulnerable people who rely on its staff for washing, dressing and help with eating now face an anxious wait to see if bosses can get the finances together to keep services going. But Allied is not alone. The UK Homecare Association, the body which represents the firms providing care, warned only last month that providers were refusing to sign up to council contracts because of the low fees being offered.  Its research shows only one in seven councils across the UK is paying a fair price for care. Care homes report a similar story. It is creating a situation whereby self-funders - those who pay for themselves because they are not entitled to council-funded care - are having to subsidise the state. The fees they pay are on average £130 per week more than what councils pay. The result is growing numbers of people going without the help they need. Among the elderly it is estimated that there are 1.4 million people - nearly one in seven older people - who fall into this group. It is figures like this that appear to have convinced many of the need for change. Simon Bottery, from the King's Fund health think tank, believes there is a real appetite for something radical. Focus group work he has been involved with suggests there is even a willingness to pay more tax. But he says in return they would expect ""some movement"" towards free care for all - currently only those with assets of less than £23,250 in England receive any help from their local council. Into this space was meant to step the social care Green Paper. Ministers had promised reform would be published by the summer after the bungling attempts to draw up plans during last year's election campaign. The Green Paper is close to being finalised, but the mood music coming out from the government is not encouraging for those who want change. Briefings to the media in recent weeks have been aimed at managing expectations.   And now even those involved directly in the process are publicly talking it down. Former Bank of England monetary policy committee member Kate Barber, who is part of the independent panel advising the government on the Green Paper, says it is likely to ""disappoint"" those who want more. In front of an audience of health and care professionals in London on Wednesday, she said it was unlikely there would be any move towards free personal care as ministers feared how the implications of that would play politically. The problem? ""It would not come cheap,"" she said.  But she believes there is no need to be timid, even if that meant taking some of the equity people have tied up in housing, particularly in the south-east, or charging for some NHS services, pointing out that we already do that for eyes and teeth. Indeed, there are plenty who reckon the NHS has had it too easy. Over the next five years, the government has promised funding will rise by more than £20bn. If a similar cash injection was made into social care, the budget would be doubled - more than enough to improve the quality of services and provide some form of universal offer to all.

risk appetite,Extended pub opening times come into effect in NI,2024-09-15,2021-10-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58749070,"Pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland will be able to stay open longer after changes to liquor licensing laws came into effect on Friday. The changes mean pubs and clubs can apply to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00 BST. Drinking-up time will also be extended to one hour, meaning pubs and clubs can stay open to 03:00. Easter drinking restrictions have also been removed in the first changes to NI licensing laws in 25 years. Restrictions on late opening on Sundays have also been removed. The Department for Communities (DfC) said it will be some time before businesses can take advantage of the new laws as applications could take about three weeks to process. Some of the changes happening from today include: It is hoped the extended hours will see a boost for the hospitality sector in the lead up to the Christmas period. Micro breweries and gin distilleries must wait for the introduction of secondary legislation on 1 April before they can apply for licences to sell their own produce in tap rooms, off sales and online, according to the DfC. Alcohol licences for cinemas will also be available from 1 April 2022, bringing them into the same category as theatres, ballrooms and race tracks. Petra Wolsey, of the Beannchor Group which owns a number of hotels, bars, and restaurants, said it was a ""really positive step in the right direction""  ""I'm delighted to see it,"" she added. ""It's been a long time coming, there's been a lot of work behind the scenes to get us to this point."" She added: ""The timing is unfortunate [with the pandemic], but we'll make it work. ""By virtue that all of us are going to take a little bit of time to get through the process of acquiring the new licences, that's going to take a matter of weeks and I would be hopeful that by that stage we'll be out the other end of all the social distancing requirements and so forth."" Connaire McGreevy is the founder of Mourne Mountains Brewery and has had applied to build a tap room at his premises. ""Delighted that we are now seeing the modernisation of licensing in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""We are waiting until April of next year before the changes will impact us fully, but that is welcome too because it gives us time to prepare what those changes mean to us such as the tap room."" He added: ""We've turned people away, we've turned busloads of people away - American tourists in particular have turned up here over the past six years of operation and we've had to say 'sorry, no can do'. ""So April next year we'll get the licence, we're now going to push on and get this built so we're ready to go."" Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said the changes will give ""more flexibility"" to pub and hotel licence holders ""particularly in the lead up to Christmas and the New Year"". She added that the increased drinking-up time - the period which customers have to finish their final drinks and leave the pub - will support a ""more gradual dispersal of people from licensed premises"". The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster said the new rules will give a much needed boost to the industry. ""We are still in restrictions so it will limit use of the new laws maybe for the next few months but there's a real appetite for business,"" Colin Neill told BBC News NI. ""They see the opportunities here and indeed, coming out of a period where we've done nothing but gather debt, this will give us an opportunity to actually make businesses more viable and bring down debt."" However, Jerry Maguire, a bar worker and trade union representative, said the majority of his union's membership were opposed to extended opening hours. ""What we want to see is the premises' duty of care being extended to staff,"" he said. ""We're seeing back-up of taxis and a lot of pub-goers would be waiting on the streets for hours. ""We don't want to see our staff and workers being put at risk by having to wait longer to get transport home."" Gary McMichael of the alcohol and drug campaign group ASCERT said the move increased the need for pub and club owners to be responsible so that they were not ""selling drink hand over fist and ignoring the harms to the customers"". Changes to the Licensing and Registration of Clubs (Amendment) Bill brings many of Northern Ireland's rules around alcohol sales in line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. It marks a significant liberalisation of Northern Ireland's laws on alcohol that has been in the making for nine years. A previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Féin, who share power together at Stormont. Guidance to businesses can be found on the Department for Communities website."
risk appetite,The rise and fall of 'Islamic State',2024-09-15,2016-03-09,Jim Muir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35695648,"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul.  ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians.  This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil).  Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.  As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west.  Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed.  Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.  In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.  After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds.  That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.  Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley.  In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.  Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.  The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price.  The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name.  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula.  A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah.  But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment.  The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow.  Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder.  Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.  For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.  Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader.  Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.  Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it.  By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today.  Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.  After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase.  But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004.  The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.  Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.  The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008.  Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies.  Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it.  Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.  Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in.  Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran.  The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in.  They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community.  Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.  Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core.  His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists.  Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military.  As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq.  But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion.  Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of.  The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.  By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq.  They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.  All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad.  The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him.  29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?  What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004.  Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.  Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.  The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam.  Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise.  It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis.  Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.  An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.  With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him.  By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global.  Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism.  A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north.  The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924.  So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.  For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad.  Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts.  Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of Bel and Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq.  It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion.  All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.  A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers.  And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documents published by Der Spiegel in 2015, external give some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.  At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later.  ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

They were stopped at an IS checkpoint,  the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.  ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city. ""Adulterers are stoned to death. Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, Shia militia prisoners are beheaded.""

School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu.  ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways.  As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint.  As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders.  ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

She managed to escape the city and became a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.  This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS.  Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.  But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.  Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army.  Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.  The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed.  The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach.  At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.  The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria.  The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that).  A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to the end of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad.  That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.  It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.  Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank.  ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success.  But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.  In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been a new generation of young militants, external drawn from local sources.  This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike.  He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets.  Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.  ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds.  ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan.  There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else.  Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences.  But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply.  In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS.  In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force.  In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies.  The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners.  Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.  In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in.  It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015.  ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south.  ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling.  In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found.  But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations.  Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants.  The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself.  Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces.  Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient.  In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences.  There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets.  The area around the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria.  But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses.  The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces.  In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province.  Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields.  But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three.  The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years.  IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different.   The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon.  That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS.  Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border.  Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march.  As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages.  Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology.  Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017.  By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour.  But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September.  US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments.  But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames.  So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise?  It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014.  With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing a defiant audio statement in September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence.  ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be.  But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.  ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants.  That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure.  In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before.  The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back.  There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003.  ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul.  ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive.  The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability.  The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul.  And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain.  There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011.  And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them.  Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria.  Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015.  A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia.  But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016.  But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over.  The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted.  Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better.   As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria.  ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed).  The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants.  Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services.  Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack.  While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough.  Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered.  The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge.  ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center.  ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser.  ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance.  Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root.  But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa.  Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, where a detailed survey, external in the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless.  IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.  In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:  the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased  the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam.  ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis.""  Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily.""   Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.  Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed.  ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli.  He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013.  ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups.  But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says.  ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path.  More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.  This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.  The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force.  Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"".  Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq.  ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo].""   ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies.  While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS.  They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever.  While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will.  Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity.  But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious.  By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost.  The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias.  For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus.  It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations.  Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours.  ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis.  ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

risk appetite,Financial sharks circling Metro Bank,2024-09-15,2019-03-19,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47609539,"Although Metro Bank recently came top of a consumer satisfaction league table, financial sharks are circling the challenger bank.  Metro Bank is now the second most shorted company on the UK stock market.  That means a lot of financial firms are betting the bank's shares will continue to fall - despite having already lost 80% of their value in the last 12 months.  Ever since Metro Bank revealed it had made an error in calculating how much shock absorbing capital it was holding, there have been some serious questions in the minds of regulators about the bank's operating competence and in the minds of investors about its basic business model.  So what's been going on? Earlier this year the financial regulator, the PRA, raised concerns with the bank about inconsistencies in the reports it was submitting.  It soon emerged that the bank had miscalculated the capital it needed to support some of its commercial lending. The news sent the bank's shares down nearly 40% in one day as the bank said it would need to raise more capital by selling new shares. Miscalculating the amount of capital you have or need to support your lending is one of the most fundamental mistakes a bank can make.  The bank's capital is a financial cushion to make sure that depositors' money is safe even if some of the borrowers can't pay back their loans.  One banking veteran told the BBC that it was ""staggering, beggared belief"" that a bank could get such a basic thing so wrong. ""Operating with insufficient capital is the cardinal sin that brought us the financial crisis"".  Metro Bank is clear that it had sufficient capital to support its current lending but analysts told the BBC that future growth plans also need to be supported as it planned to grow faster than it could earn additional money to support future lending. The amount of capital a bank needs is calculated by adding together three elements - or pillars - as they are known.  Pillar one is the basic minimum capital calculation based on how much lending you have done and in which markets - the more you do, the riskier the types of loans - the more you need.  Pillar two is the regulators assessment of bank specific risk. It's a qualitative measure that looks at the bank's size, maturity and operating history.  Pillar three is the amount you need to support future growth.  This is an important one for Metro which was trying to grow at 30% per year - which would require more additional capital than the bank could earn along the way. Well, those plans have changed. As Metro Bank licks its wounds after an embarrassing mistake, it has had to scale down its ambitions.  It is now targeting growth of 20% rather than 30% - and that looks ambitious given the bank will be spending a considerable amount of money and management time dealing with two regulatory probes from the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.  So far - no heads have rolled as a result of the capital blunder. The chief executive Craig Donaldson offered to resign but the board did not accept it.  Sources at the company told the BBC there was no appetite for ""a witch hunt"" but investors and regulators may need some blood on the carpet to satisfy them.  If the chief executive stays, the focus then shifts to the board and here is another area where investors are concerned that Metro Bank is falling short of the standards required of a bank.  The chairman and founder Vernon Hill is an engaging and charismatic figure whose mould breaking approach to banking was seen by many as a breath of fresh air.  I was present at the launch of the first UK Metro Bank in Holborn, London nearly 10 years ago. There was razzmatazz, balloons, bands, Saturday, Sunday and Bank holiday opening hours and dog bowls and biscuits - thanks to the influence of Vernon Hill's wife Shirley and her ever present companion Duffy the Yorkshire Terrier.  So what? Just what the High Street needs - a bank that's open when you want it to be with a sense of fun about it.  Customers liked it. What investors were unsure about was the £21m Metro Bank paid to Shirley Hill's company InterArch for its design work.  Royal London Asset Management and Glass Lewis - a firm that advises shareholders how to vote - both described the relationship as ""inappropriate"" and voted against Vernon Hill's re-election as chairman. They were convincingly outvoted.  Many of the board have been there a long time - a practice that is increasingly frowned upon as it can foster cosy relationships between the board and the management - leading to insufficient challenge and scrutiny.  Six of its nine non-executive directors have been on the board almost since day one - nine years ago - coincidentally the maximum recommended term for a director under the company governance code.  Even if, as seems likely, there is a boardroom clear out, doubts still remain in the minds of some about the underlying business model.  After all, Metro Bank is trying to do the exact opposite of what many other banks are doing.  It is growing its network of branches while others are shrinking theirs. It is opening in the most expensive locations in the towns and cities it operates in. Its branches are open Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays. Sometimes doing something counter-intuitive or a bit different is good. Sometimes there is a reason that no-one else is doing it. For many investors, it's a case of the latter.  One former shareholder said there were two important reasons why. First, this Metro Bank model ""will only ever appeal to a subset of customers - it is never going to be the same scale as even a TSB let alone a Lloyds and that matters because you can't get the cost as percentage of your revenue down without scale. It will always be a more expensive business and therefore lower returning business to own"".   Second, the rate of growth they are targeting means that for the next few years you are paying to own this company rather than being paid.  The bank will continue to need more capital put in by shareholders and that is a gamble for a niche bank that is expensive to run.  The chief executive Craig Donaldson insists that comparisons with the rest of the industry tell a misleading story.  ""You have to remember that RBS is coming down from over 2,000 branches, we are heading up from the current 66 to a target of 200. That is the size of business we are targeting."" As mentioned already, Metro Bank has proved popular with customers and has shown impressive growth with minimal advertising. To be clear there is no suggestion that customer deposits are at any risk.  But the model is not winning the popularity contest with investors - its shares have fallen nearly 80% and some heavyweight financial gamblers are betting heavily on it falling further.  In the final analysis, no amount of razzmatazz and dog biscuits can take investors eyes off the financial ball and right now it is a long way from being in the back of the net.  One to watch. "
risk appetite,Is the time finally right for a Friends reboot?,2024-09-15,2019-10-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49983937,"The one where they all come back and make another series. Friends fans have been calling for it since the final episode aired in 2004 but now we hear the cast have all met up at Courtney Cox's house.  Add to that the fact that for a second year it's the most streamed show in the UK. And Friends merchandise is selling in big numbers in high-street stores. Does this mean it's time for a comeback? There is no denying there could be a market for a Friends reboot right now. We have just had the 25th anniversary and Netflix's hosting of the series has brought it to a whole new audience. Hello to those who were too young get the jokes first time round.  Even the fact that certain aspects of the show haven't aged so well, hasn't done much to dent its enduring popularity.   In the UK it gets more streams than any other show, and earlier this year a British survey named it as the most popular programme for young people.  Scott Bryan, TV critic and co-host of BBC Sounds Must Watch podcast, says there is a huge appetite for it. ""The timing can't be any more right,"" he says. ""The multi-million pound deal Netflix signed for it showed just how much interest there is."" But Warner Brothers TV studios who made Friends told Radio 1 Newsbeat ""this isn't really a revival for us"" as ""the show's been consistently on air in the UK, first with Channel 4 and E4, then with Comedy Central"". So if the viewing figures aren't enough to convince the producers, how about the sales of Friends merchandise? On the high street you can hardly move for How You Doin? hoodies or The One Where It Seemed Like A Good Idea To Buy This T-shirt t-shirts. H&M is the latest in a long line of fashion chains selling Friends-branded clothing. They told us it's been a ""big seller"" for them.  Chloe Collins is a retail analyst at Global data. Her job is to look at what is trending in clothes shops. She says a lot of retailers are jumping on the trend for all things Friends.  ""H&M do it, I think Topshop has done it, ASOS has also done stuff before."" ""People still watch it every day. It shows that it doesn't really age.""  So, the big question is - might the cast be up for it? Hopes were raised when Courtney Cox shared a picture of of herself on Sunday with Jennifer Aniston and Matt LeBlanc, alongside the caption: ""A rare night and I love it."" The excitement peaked when Jennifer Aniston revealed the next day in an interview with US radio legend Howard Stern that actually all six of them had met up.  ""We just had dinner this week, on Saturday night,"" she said. ""The whole gang. Everyone was there."" Could it BE anymore exciting? Turns out yes it probably could.  Jennifer Aniston went on to downplay the idea that the reunion could mean a reboot. ""It's just Schwimmer was in town,"" the actress explained, ""and we all happened to have a window of time so we all got together."" Asked directly if she would be prepared to do a reunion show where everyone is older, she quickly dismissed it. ""I really think there is an idea that if there is a reboot of a show it wouldn't be even close to being as good at what it was... It would ruin it."" To be fair it wasn't a straight-up ""no"" but TV critic Scott Bryan thinks it is still unlikely to happen: ""The biggest issue is the stars,"" he says.  ""They have spent their careers trying to move on. You never want to be known as a one trick pony."" He also thinks a reboot would be a big risk. ""If a show returns, it can't survive on nostalgia alone. That will dry up pretty quick. It has to have storylines and characters that reflect 2019."" Ultimately it is down to the creators of the show to decide whether they make any new episodes and it seems they haven't been persuaded by this Friends revival.   When Marta Kauffman and David Crane were asked their thoughts at the Tribeca TV festival in September the answer was still the same. ""We will not be doing a reunion show, we will not be doing a reboot.""  Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

risk appetite,Health risks of recreational cannabis,2024-09-15,2018-06-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44532417,"The government has said there will be a review into the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes but has rejected suggestions by former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague that its recreational use could be legalised.  Home Secretary Sajid Javid said there was strong scientific evidence the drug could ""harm people's mental and physical health and damage communities"". Cannabis is thought to be the most widely used illegal drug in the UK. But while it can lead to feelings of relaxation, happiness and sleepiness, many experts say the drug is not the harmless ""natural"" high some claim it to be.   In some cases, it can increase anxiety and paranoia, lead to confusion and even hallucinations, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Beyond this, there's also ""compelling evidence"" that regular cannabis use increases the risk of developing psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, particularly in adolescents, says Dr Marta di Forti, from King's College London.  Younger people are thought to be particularly vulnerable because their brains are still developing, says Dr Michael Bloomfield, from University College London.  Studies have linked the increased risk of psychosis to potent strains of cannabis that have higher proportions of the psychoactive compound THC, says Dr Di Forti.  A previous study suggested the risk of psychosis was five times higher for people who smoked such cannabis every day compared with non-users. Milder forms contain less THC and more CBD, which works as an anti-psychotic and counteracts some of the negative effects of THC. However, research suggests the vast majority of cannabis being sold illegally in the UK is super-strength skunk. But it's worth pointing out that the vast majority of people who use cannabis do not develop psychosis and many people diagnosed with such disorders have never used cannabis. It is also thought that genes may play a role in the risk.  The exact health impact of cannabis use is still a subject of debate, with not all studies reaching the same findings.  While some studies have found an association between regular cannabis use and depression, Dr Di Forti says this link is less clear than that with psychosis.  And it may be the case that people who are depressed are more likely to use cannabis. There was a time when experts thought this was not the case.  But current evidence suggests that it can be - particularly if it's used regularly - with about 10% of regular users estimated to have a dependence.  For some people who quit, there can be withdrawal symptoms, such as cravings, difficulty sleeping, mood swings, irritability and restlessness, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists.   ""People end up having problems with relationships. It impacts on their ability to function at work and school,"" Prof Celia Morgan, professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Exeter, says. While some of this addiction may be psychological, Dr Bloomfield says there is good evidence to suggest that THC itself can be physically addictive for some people.  ""Cannabis addiction exists and it can potentially ruin lives,"" he adds.  Getting high on cannabis impairs memory and cognitive ability in the short term, says Prof Morgan.  And some of the effects of this, though mild and reversible, seems to remain for up to 20 days, the amount of time it takes for the drug to leave the system. Prof Morgan says that while some people who take hard drugs may also smoke cannabis, there is no strong evidence those who try cannabis will go on to become hard-drug takers.   However, cannabis may lead to a legal drug habit that is harmful in a range of ways - tobacco smoking.  Tobacco is ""one of the most damaging addictive substances"", Prof Morgan adds. Tobacco smoking is known to increase the risk of a range of illnesses, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. So does it follow that cannabis smoking also poses the same dangers? It's still not clear whether cannabis smoking itself raises the risk of cancer or if the increased risk seen among cannabis smokers is actually the result of them mixing the drug with tobacco. In any event, people who smoke cannabis regularly, with or without tobacco, are more likely to have bronchitis  - inflammation of the lining of the lungs - according to the NHS.  Many patients who have been self-medicating with recreational cannabis say it works for them.  Recently, the families of 12-year-old Billy Caldwell and six-year-old Alfie Dingley have made newspaper headlines. They say cannabis oil treatments have radically controlled the boys' epileptic seizures.  While these cannabis oils are not recreational drugs, they're not medically licensed treatments either.  A cross-party report found good evidence that cannabis treatments can help alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, nausea and vomiting, particularly in the context of chemotherapy, and anxiety. It also found moderate evidence it could help with sleep disorders, poor appetite, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson's symptoms. Now, a government review will look at the evidence and make its own recommendations on which cannabis-based medicines might offer real medical and therapeutic benefits to patients. But regardless of what they find, Mr Javid added: ""This step is in no way a first step to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use."""
risk appetite,Facebook sees daily users fall for first time ever,2024-09-15,2022-02-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60238565,"Social media giant Facebook has seen its daily active users (DAUs) drop for the first time in its 18-year history. Facebook's owner Meta Platforms says DAUs fell to 1.929bn in the three months to the end of December, compared to 1.930bn in the previous quarter. The firm also warned of slowing revenue growth in the face of competition from rivals like TikTok and YouTube, while advertisers are also cutting spending. Meta's shares slumped by more than 20% in after-hours trading in New York. The slide in Meta's share price wiped around $200bn (£147.5bn) off the company's stock market value. Shares in other social media platforms, including Twitter, Snap and Pinterest, also fell sharply in extended trading. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the firm's sales growth had been hurt as audiences, especially younger users, had left for rivals.  Meta, which owns the world's second biggest digital advertising platform after Google, also said it had been hit by privacy changes on Apple's operating system. The changes have made it harder for brands to target and measure their advertising on Facebook and Instagram and could have an impact ""in the order of $10 billion"" for this year, according to Meta's chief financial officer Dave Wehner. Meta's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertising sales, rose to $33.67bn in the period, narrowly beating market predictions. It also forecast revenues of between $27bn to $29bn for the next quarter, which is lower than analysts had expected. While the company has been making its own investments in video to compete with TikTok -owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance - it makes less money from those offerings than its traditional Facebook and Instagram feeds. Mr Zuckerberg said he was confident the investments in video and virtual reality would pay off, as previous bets on mobile advertising and Instagram stories have. But, he noted, the firm didn't have to contend with a major rival during previous shifts in strategy. ""The teams are executing quite well and the product is growing very quickly,"" he said. ""The thing that is somewhat unique here is that TikTok is so big a competitor already and also continues to grow at quite a fast rate."" Facebook has always been a platform that grows.  For every quarter in its existence the global numbers have been in one direction. Yet in the last few years, growth has stalled in Europe and US. That was masked by rises in users from the rest of the world. Facebook just isn't as popular with younger people as it was. By its own admission, TikTok is hurting business.  But there are other reasons too that investors are worried about Meta.  Meta changed its name because it wanted to focus on the Metaverse. But Meta is nowhere near building a Metaverse yet, it's a pipedream at the moment.  Instead it is pumping billions of dollars into trying to create one - all because Mark Zuckerberg thinks there's an appetite for it - a huge risk.  Perhaps the answer to Meta's immediate problems would be to buy TikTok? Well US regulators would never allow that due to anti-competition laws.  And Facebook is now seen by many in Silicon Valley as a poisonous brand. It's certainly not a cool place to work in the same way it was say ten years ago.  That makes attracting talent more difficult.  Meta has some serious problems going forward. This milestone could be just the beginning."
risk appetite,"Labour must unequivocally back Remain, says deputy",2024-09-15,2019-09-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49657006,"Labour should ""unequivocally back Remain"" in a fresh Brexit referendum and only then pursue power in a general election, its deputy has said. Tom Watson said there was ""no such thing as a good Brexit deal"" and the 2016 Leave vote had been ""invalidated"".  Jeremy Corbyn said he did ""not accept or agree with"" his deputy's view. ""Our priority is to get a general election in order to give the people a chance to elect a government that cares for them,"" he said.  The Labour leader wants to hold another referendum once Labour has won power, in which voters would have the choice to remain in the EU alongside a ""credible"" Leave proposal.  However, he has said he would only choose a side once the shape of any revised Brexit deal negotiated by a Labour government became clear.   The BBC's political correspondent, Chris Mason, said Mr Watson was directly elected as deputy leader by party members, not appointed by Mr Corbyn, and so has a right to roam on policy other shadow cabinet ministers might not get away with it.  In a speech in London, Mr Watson said while an autumn general election seemed inevitable ""that does not make it desirable"". ""Elections should never be single issue campaigns,"" he argued, suggesting vital issues such as the future of the NHS, economic inequality and crime would be ""drowned out"" by the prime minister's ""do or die"" Brexit message. ""The only way to break the Brexit deadlock once and for all is a public vote in a referendum,"" he said. ""A general election might well fail to solve this Brexit chaos."" In the event of another general election in the coming months, Mr Watson said Labour must be ""crystal clear"" about where it stands on Brexit if it wants to get a hearing for the rest of its domestic policy agenda. ""There is no such thing as a good Brexit deal, which is why I believe we should advocate for Remain. That is what the overwhelming majority of Labour Party members, MPs and trade unions believe."" Mr Watson will said that, though ""very difficult"", he and many others ""respected the result of the 2016 referendum for a long time"". But, he added: ""There eventually comes a point when circumstances are so changed, when so much new information has emerged that we didn't have in 2016, when so many people feel differently to how they felt then, that you have to say, no... the only proper way to proceed in such circumstances is to consult the people again."" The Liberal Democrats, who pushed Labour into third place in May's European elections with a strident anti-Brexit message, are pushing for Brexit to be stopped in its tracks by revoking Article 50 - the legal process for the UK's departure.  While stopping short of calling for that himself, Mr Watson said it was not too late for Labour to ""win back"" Remain voters. ""My experience on the doorstep tells me most of those who've deserted us over our Brexit policy did so with deep regret and would greatly prefer to come back,"" he added. ""They just want us to take an unequivocal position that whatever happens we'll fight to remain, and to sound like we mean it."" Former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith said Mr Watson was speaking for ""the majority of Labour members and Labour voters"", and that the party ""should be clearing the Brexit issue off the table before we get to an election"". But another Labour MP, Gareth Snell - one of a group of MPs in the party wanting to bring back an amended version of Theresa May's original withdrawal agreement - said the ""numbers simply don't exist"" in Parliament to approve a further referendum.   He told Today: ""The public have no appetite for a second referendum. The doors I knock every week… [voters] are not telling me they want to go back to the divisive referendum [but] they want a decision on this process to be taken as soon as possible.""  Just 24 hours after Jeremy Corbyn hammered out a deal with the Labour-supporting unions, his deputy, Tom Watson, shattered any fragile unity. Mr Watson and many Labour activists want a clearer commitment to campaign on a Remain platform - especially during a snap election. So, apart from his own scepticism towards an EU that he believes needs reform, what is the thinking behind Jeremy Corbyn's position? Well, it comes down to four things - psephology, party unity, politics and personal authority. Read more from Iain. Unite's Len McCluskey dismissed Mr Watson's intervention, accusing him of ""undermining"" the leadership and suggesting his views ""don't really matter"".  The two men, who used to be close friends, fell out spectacularly in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum during an uprising by Labour MPs against Mr Corbyn's leadership.  The union leader suggested Mr Watson was ""languishing on the fringes"" of the party, adding: ""It's sad. Now and again Tom pops up from where he has been hiding and comes up with something… which is normally to try and undermine his leader."" The Conservatives said Mr Watson had made it clear he wanted to ""cancel"" the 2016 Brexit referendum result. Labour has voted twice against Boris Johnson's plans for a poll on 15 October.  The party's leadership has insisted it is eager for an election after the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been ruled out. "
risk appetite,Plaid AM calls on Wood to share power,2024-09-15,2018-07-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44677514,"Leanne Wood faces a challenge for Plaid Cymru's leadership unless she agrees to share the job, a Plaid AM has said. In a highly critical intervention, Adam Price said the party had resorted to ""predictable, plodding politics"". Mr Price - urged by his local party activists to mount a challenge - said a male/female co-leadership was needed if Plaid was to win the 2021 election. Ms Wood has said she will stand down if she does not become first minister at the next assembly election. Under Plaid rules a window to challenge for the leadership comes around every two years, with assembly members having until Wednesday to step forwards to fight for the role. Ms Wood has not faced a challenge since being elected leader in 2012, but in a damning article in the Western Mail on Monday, Mr Price slates the party's progress and strategy on independence, saying change is needed ""badly"" and ""fast"". But claims by Carmarthen East and Dinefwr AM Mr Price that Plaid Cymru has lost 1,000 members in eight months were denied by the party. Another possible contender, Ynys Mon AM Rhun ap Iorwerth, has said he is considering whether to stand. Mr Price says simply ousting Ms Wood would ""leave a toxic residue of bitterness and recrimination"" and instead sets out plans which would see Ms Wood stay in power, while sharing the role with a man. ""I have to say it's my view, and I believe that of many others in this great party, that we have generally failed to consistently articulate a comprehensive and compelling vision of the future,"" he writes. ""Our comfort zone has been a strange mixture of philosophical abstraction and the predictable, plodding politics of the parsimonious press release, the tired tweet and the formulaic Facebook status. ""Nowhere has this shallowness been more exposed than on the question of independence, our very raison d'être, where our failure to present a clear and persuasive exposition explains why we have lost more than a thousand of our eight thousand members in the last eight months. ""Pressing the reset button for our party has to start now; and it comes with the hard but vital work of developing a creative and credible body of ideas that will excite the interest and inspire the confidence of the people of Wales.""  Mr Price writes that having a man and a woman jointly leading the party would give Plaid a ""radical and powerful leadership that will avoid the traditional vulnerabilities of placing power in a single pair of hands"". ""In our own party, co-leadership would allow us to embrace all viewpoints, to harness all drive and commitment for the widest political progress possible,"" he adds. But Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said co-leadership had been tried before in Plaid and had been ""disastrous"". ""Either back Leanne to lead or challenge her. There's no easy route to the top,"" he tweeted. Alun Lenny, a Plaid councillor in Carmarthenshire who has urged Mr Price to mount a challenge, told BBC Radio Wales he could not see why the party could not harness ""the considerable talents we have"" by having two leaders. Speaking on Good Morning Wales, Mr Lenny said he voted for Ms Wood in the 2012 leadership contest, but added: ""At best we are flat-lining,"" The greatest risk is that today's intervention leaves many questions unanswered at a time when Plaid desperately needs stability. Does Adam Price really want to share the job with Leanne Wood? What if Ms Wood rejects the offer and Adam Price wins a leadership election only for party members to reject co-leadership?  None of this detail has been thought through. More from Aled Also writing in the Western Mail on Monday, Mr ap Iorwerth said: ""I'm on the record saying I'm considering my response to Leanne's invitation for a debate on the leadership.  ""What that means in reality is that I'm speaking to as many people as possible about how best to take Plaid Cymru forward. We're in this for Wales, not ourselves."" BBC Wales understands Mr Price would be willing to see MPs as well as AMs stand for election as co-leader, subject to a change in party rules. It is understood that Mr Price wants Ms Wood to commit to his proposal at an assembly group meeting on Tuesday. Plaid Cymru chief executive Gareth Clubb said the party did not recognise the membership figures quoted by Adam Price. ""Our membership is currently growing and we are confident that it will continue to do so,"" he said. The party said it had around 8,000 members in April - Mr Price suggested the figure was 1,000 fewer. A spokesman for Mr Price said he stood by his figures.   On the call for co-leadership, a spokesperson for Ms Wood said: ""All proposals will be considered and will follow the appropriate procedures.  ""I am sure all of us are determined to ensure that we continue to work in the most open and democratic manner possible."" There has been mounting appetite within the party for a leadership challenge, with former Plaid leader in Westminster Elfyn Llwyd calling for a change in direction for the party and local constituency parties calling on both Mr Price and Mr ap Iorwerth to stand. Three other Plaid AMs - Llyr Gruffydd, Sian Gwenllian and Elin Jones - have signed a letter calling for a competition. On Saturday 53 councillors from across Wales - who make up about a quarter of Plaid's councillors - pledged their support to Ms Wood to continue as leader. Ms Wood has previously said she would welcome a leadership challenge.  Sam Smethers, chief executive of women's rights charity the Fawcett Society, said: ""The under-representation of men in our politics is not the problem.  ""But we do support job-sharing of MP and leadership roles. It is good to see that Adam Price does too."""
risk appetite,The battle over a whale's brutal death,2024-09-15,2021-01-31,By Flora Drury,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55714815,"A video showing the final, brutal 20 minutes of a minke whale's life at the hands of Japanese fishermen sent a ripple of shock through international media. But activists says the footage of the whale being slowly drowned, after becoming trapped in their nets, has merely highlighted an entirely legal loophole which is used to kill dozens of whales each year. ""This is neither an exceptional nor unexpected occurrence,"" Mark Simmonds, senior marine scientist at Humane Society International (HSI), said in a release after the whale's death.  ""But what is exceptional is that this whole process was witnessed and filmed for the world to see."" Indeed, the young mammal's death once again has exposed the gaping chasm between Japan and the wider world when it comes to whale hunting: activists see a cruel and avoidable death, but the fishermen see a gift from the sea. Warning: Upsetting content Japan - like a number of other nations around the world - has a centuries-long tradition of whale hunting. After the Second World War, as the country struggled to feed its population, whale meat became a staple of the Japanese table.  But for those who support whale hunting, it goes further than simply food on the plate: it is a source of national pride. Yet for more than 30 years, fishermen were not allowed to hunt whales off the coast of Japan. The country had signed up to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) following a decades of overfishing which had pushed whale populations to the brink of extinction. In July 2019, the whaling boats set off once more, despite demand for the meat having dropped. Supporters spoke to the BBC at the time of their relief that ""the culture and way of life will be passed on to the next generation"". This time, there were strict quotas in place, allowing for responsible hunting. The first year, the quota allowed for some 52 minke, which are not endangered, as well as 150 Bryde's and 25 sei whales, to be caught over the course of the season - a total of 227. In 2020 and 2021, that total rose to 383.  The numbers are split between the official whalers, the government and a third category, known as ""by-catch"". This year, 37 whales can be butchered and sold by fisherman under this heading.  The minke whose death was caught on camera was one of the 37 considered ""by-catch"" - a whale which no one set out to catch, but which just happened to swim into the wrong place, at the wrong time. Ren Yabuki, the head of Japanese animal rights NGO Life Investigation Agency (LIA), first spotted the whale trapped in the permanent net off Taiji - the same town made famous for its annual dolphin hunt in The Cove - on 24 December. Initially, he hoped the fishermen would raise the nets and release the whale. He watched as ""one guy tried for 10 minutes"".  ""But they stopped trying,"" he recalls. He suspected the fishermen ""did not want to open the net because inside there were too many fish"".  Over the course of the next 20 days, he lobbied the association which owns the net to work to release the whale. He also began to upload the videos his drone filmed each day, allowing people around the world to watch as the whale became more desperate, at times attacking the net, at times just spinning in the confined space. The whale's plight began to make headlines in other parts of the world. More and more people became invested in the whale's release. But then, on 11 January, he watched helplessly as two boats manoeuvred the whale so it was trapped between them. He then watched as they caught and held the whale's thrashing tail, forcing its head underwater for 20 minutes, until it finally drowned.  By this time, the boat was already covered in the whale's blood, lost as it injured itself trying to get free. Days after the minke's death, undercover footage recorded neatly packaged whale meat, priced at 398 yen ($3.80; £2.77) per 100g, in the local supermarket. Of course, it may not have been the whale which died off Taiji. For supporters of whale hunting, there was nothing amiss with what the drone captured that day. ""A number of Japanese people feel sympathy to such [an] animal... trapped in a set net and wish it [to] be released, if possible,"" acknowledged Hideki Moronuki, director for fisheries negotiations at the Fisheries Agency, in an email to the BBC.  ""However, at the same time, there are many people who consider that such an animal is a bounty from the ocean and has to be fully used with a great gratitude."" For the fishermen, the whale getting trapped in the net was a bonus. Under usual circumstances, they don't have the right licence to catch and sell whales. But this, say activists, is where the quota system falls down, as it disincentives fishermen from releasing the mammals. Mr Simmonds, of the HSI, suggests it goes further than that even.  ""The term 'bycatch' relates to accidental or incidental capture of non-target animals in all fishing operations,"" he tells the BBC. ""The capture of whales in traps in Japan is not bycatch."" In fact, he argues that catches like this are both ""predictable and deliberate"".  But just because they end up in the net doesn't mean they will be killed.  In this net alone three whales have been caught in six weeks, including the minke. The first, another minke whale caught in late November, was released the next day. The third, a humpback whale, was found dead floating tangled in the nets the day after the second minke was killed.  Taiji Fisheries Association has argued that it was left with no choice but to kill the second whale. ""The tide is fast and it is difficult to let go of the whale,"" it said in a statement at the time. And Mr Moronuki, director for fisheries negotiations at the Fisheries Agency, adds in his email that there was no other way to kill the animal when they finally decided to act. ""When it was decided to kill the animal the sea condition was too harsh to take other killing method,"" he wrote in his email. ""I believe that, for those reasons, most of Japanese people considered that a sole realistic and pragmatic method had been chosen and did not take any emotional nor commotional action."" But for Mr Yabuki and Mr Simmonds, it is the brutality of the animals death which lingers on. ""My hand was shaking with upset - it was so, so sad. I had so much anger,"" Mr Yabuki told the BBC. ""I want to rescue the whale, to release. But I could not."" ""Forcing underwater the head of a mammal evolved to hold its breath for long periods, so that it slowly runs out of oxygen, is an acutely cruel killing method by any standards,"" Mr Simmonds added. Activists hope that videos like the one of the minke's death will inspire change in Japan. But there is little will from the government to roll back on a policy which has proved popular among Japan's fishing communities, meaning this video is unlikely to be the last one the world sees."
risk appetite,Lily Allen talks about using drugs to lose weight,2024-09-15,2021-01-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55679233,"Lily Allen has given more detail about how she became addicted to the prescription drug Adderall in 2014. In a new interview, the 35-year-old said she had taken the drug in an effort to lose weight before supporting Miley Cyrus on tour. ""I was like 14 stone and just did not feel like a pop star at all,"" she told DJ Fat Tony on The Recovery podcast. ""So I started taking this drug called Adderall, which is like speed, to lose the weight. ""And I got addicted to this drug because it made me invincible and I could work really long hours and be all the people I was required to be."" It is not the first time Allen has discussed taking the drug, which is a prescription-only stimulant typically used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In her 2018 memoir My Thoughts Exactly, the singer wrote: ""I flirted with Adderall (which is really just a type of speed) as a way of getting or staying thin."" In the new interview, Allen recalled supporting Cyrus on her Bangerz tour, a job she took to help bolster her finances. She had given birth twice in the three years prior to the tour. Six months after her youngest child was born, Allen says she and then husband Sam Cooper had ""run out of money and I had to go out on the road again"". Allen, who was promoting Sheezus, her first album in six years, was conscious of her appearance ahead of the tour. ""It was when [Cyrus] was doing Wrecking Ball and the Bangerz tour and it was a highly sexualised tour. I had just spent the last three years pushing babies out. It couldn't have been less what I felt like,"" Allen said. ""I had never supported anyone so I was re-entering this phase of being a pop star again but not doing it on my terms any more. I was supporting this girl who was much younger and more attractive than I felt, and I just started acting out in all manner of ways."" She continued: ""I started cheating on my husband and I had always really drunk alcohol to take the edge off of the drugs, and then I realised I was getting up in the morning and downing those mini bottles of vodka or whisky or whatever was left, without the drugs any more."" She later considered taking heroin but stopped herself after ""seeing what happens to people"" who used the Class A drug. She decided instead to begin recovery. Allen has previously discussed her relationship with drugs openly and has written her experiences into her music. Her 2009 song Everyone's At It explores the widespread use of drugs in society, and includes the lyrics: ""How can we start to tackle the problem / If you don't put our hands up / And admit that you're on them?"" Adderall is a stimulant which is only available by prescription in the US. It is prescribed to treat ADHD, a neurobehavioral condition which is characterised by hyperactivity, trouble concentrating and impulsivity. Its use has increased in the last two decades as Adderall has been prescribed to more school-age children, along with another stimulant, Ritalin, which has similar effects. However, if taken by a person who does not suffer from ADHD, the effect is an increase in energy levels, concentration and performance. This has caused it become more popular among adults.  A 2004 episode of Desperate Housewives featured a storyline in which an exhausted Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) started taking Ritalin prescribed to her son, to help her cope with the demands of motherhood. A Netflix documentary released in 2018, Take Your Pills, explored the drug's popularity among groups such as students, who use it to improve grades. Decreased appetite and weight loss are possible side effects of Adderall use, and it can also cause anxiety, insomnia and tremors. Ritalin and Adderall can be addictive and both have a high potential for abuse. There is a long-term risk of psychological and physical dependence for users who feel they cannot fully function without it. Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

risk appetite,Early cancer vaccine for Tanzanian girls,2024-09-15,2018-04-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43716260,"More than 600,000 girls in Tanzania have started receiving vaccines to prevent cervical cancer. Girls aged between nine and 14 are being targeted to protect them from developing the illness at an early age. ""Prevention is better than cure, elongating lives and and reducing treatment costs,"" said Dr Daphrosa Lyimo, heading the government rollout.  Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in Tanzania and kills more women than any other form of the illness. Tanzania is the seventh African country to introduce the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine into its routine immunisation programme, after Uganda, Rwanda, Botswana, Mauritius, Seychelles and South Africa. The health minister says $15 (£11) will be spent treating each girl. Cervical cancer is a cancer that develops in a woman's cervix - the entrance to the womb from the vagina.  It is one of more than 100 types of human papilloma virus (HPV), of which at least 13 are cancer-causing. Cervical cancer is caused by sexually acquired infection with certain types of HPV. Risk factors include early first sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners and tobacco use, and immune suppression (such as in HIV-infected individuals). Symptoms can include: Screening for the virus is recommended to detect it at an earlier stage. HPV vaccines are another preventative measure. Treatment for patients with cervical cancer depends on far the cancer has spread, but can include surgery to remove some or all of the womb, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Source: World Health Organization Tanzania's government hopes the early-stage vaccines will help reduce the bill for cervical cancer treatment, which typically costs about $2,000 (£1,410) per patient.  Low-cost doses of the HPV vaccine are being supplied to Tanzania by the Vaccine Alliance, Gavi. Poor countries are disproportionately affected by cervical cancer. According to Gavi, the five worst-affected countries are in Africa - Malawi, Mozambique, Comoros, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Globally, more than 260,000 women die of of the illness each year, with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 85% of all deaths. ""The majority of these deaths are preventable, thanks to a safe and effective vaccine,"" says Gavi CEO Dr Seth Berkley.  ""That's why we are working hard to ensure girls across Africa, from Tanzania to Senegal, have access to this lifesaver."""
risk appetite,What future for England?,2024-09-15,2018-06-07,By Mark Easton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44357001,"The saccharine aroma of reminiscence pervades many an English front parlour. As mantel clocks tick, the faces of England stare regretfully through net curtains, yearning for yesterday. Nostalgia, the old joke goes, ain't what it used to be. But in England it appears to be making a comeback, with half the country saying things were better in the past.   The large survey commissioned by the BBC to answer ""The English Question"" suggests that only one person in six believes the country's best years lie ahead, a finding in contrast to the rest of the UK, where a higher proportion of people are optimistic for the future than wish to turn the clock back. As well as wistfulness for former glories, the English also feel impotent to respond. Seven in 10 people say they feel they have very little or no influence over the decisions that affect their neighbourhood. The sense of powerlessness applies to decisions local and national.   Relating survey findings to local demographics, towns like Great Yarmouth, Hartlepool, Hull and Basildon emerge as places likely to feel particularly disconnected from decision-making. The Brexit battle cry of ""taking back control"" would have resonated in many similar communities. The survey results pose important questions about how to bridge the treacherous divide between people and power.    Many in England look enviously at the authority devolved to the other UK nations, complaining that English local government has been emasculated, as central government has become more distant. Only 13% of people think politicians in Westminster reflect their real concerns.    Prioritising England's affairs, even if that threatens the United Kingdom, is a policy supported by a quarter of English residents, according to our survey, a figure that appears to rise to a third in counties like Lincolnshire and towns like Rotherham and Wakefield. One proposal is that England should have its own parliament, an idea included in the UKIP manifesto at the last election. Roughly four people in 10 support the creation of such a body, rising to half the population in parts of Essex, for example.   But the survey suggests greater enthusiasm for a form of devolution that also enjoys broader political support (even if it draws blank looks from many), introducing combined authorities. Few dinner tables echo joyously to fevered debate about a new tier of public administration for England, so it is remarkable that, after a brief explanation of their function, our poll finds almost half the population (48%) support having a combined authority in their area. If one removes those who said they didn't know enough to comment, support rises to three quarters (73%).  And the places that are apparently most enthusiastic about combined authorities are the places that already have one. Greater Manchester pioneered the approach. Ten local town halls joined together to take on powers for their area previously run from Whitehall.  As Chancellor, George Osborne gave the new body his blessing and significant new control over health and social care budgets, transport strategy, economic development and more. It appears that, whatever their politics, many Greater Mancunians support their region taking more control over its destiny.  In Stockport, for example, 72% are in favour of having a combined authority, a figure that rises to 87% when you exclude a dwindling number of ""don't knows"". There are currently nine combined authorities operating in England outside London, and plans for more. Their secret, it seems to me, is in being created from the ground up rather than designed by some committee of Whitehall bureaucrats who know too little of local allegiances and rivalries.  The prospect of real additional control over the region's development encourages sometimes fractious councils to come together. The arguments are fierce, and sometimes irreconcilable, but the rewards are tangible. Critically, there is flexibility on design - in England one size definitely does not fit all.  Up to now there has been scepticism as to whether the voting public would embrace what some have dismissed as another layer of politicians. Our survey suggests the debate has moved on. Given a choice as to whether central, local or combined authority government should be in charge of certain services, a combined authority was the most popular for NHS provision, building a new railway and how the police force is run.    Substantial numbers also thought combined authorities should control housing provision, the number of foreign workers an area allows and the level of unemployment benefit applied in a region. It is still early days for these new bodies and one must be careful not to assume the public has got beyond the swiping right stage.  A lot will depend on the performance of the metro mayors who are a government pre-requisite for substantial devolution.   The two mayor Andys - Burnham in Greater Manchester (Labour) and Street in the West Midlands (Conservative) - are vitally important in demonstrating that what is effectively the return of regional government in England works to bridge the democratic deficit. The clear appetite for greater control probably explains the apparent popularity of these embryonic institutions, but they must patently deliver or risk being mortally wounded by political infighting or strangled by public cynicism. England feels a discomforted place at the moment, riven over its relationship with the wider world, with its European neighbours and even the other nations in the Union.   Optimism is in short supply and a beguiling nostalgia threatens to turn into resentment or bitterness.  Instead of listening to the mantel clock ticking, reminiscing for a lost age, England needs to find a way to reconnect with its citizenry."
risk appetite,What pills women buy may help spot ovarian cancer,2024-09-15,2023-01-27,By Michelle Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-64411459,"Tracking what shoppers buy, via loyalty-card data, can help spot those with early signs of cancer, doctors who have been running a study say.  Frequent purchases of over-the-counter painkillers and indigestion tablets revealed a higher risk of ovarian cancer, they found. Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed late. There is no reliable screening test and the symptoms, such as bloating, can be vague and confused with other common, harmless conditions.  Symptoms include: Early diagnosis improves the chance of successful treatment.  Fiona Murphy was 25 when she was diagnosed and treated for a rare type of ovarian cancer.   She had been having stomach cramps and indigestion for a couple of years, which other doctors had repeatedly thought might be irritable-bowel syndrome.  She told BBC News: ""I lived on Gaviscon for months and months before my ovarian cancer diagnosis. It went everywhere with me. I couldn't leave the house without it. ""My symptoms were vague but they were frequent and continuous. That's what you need to be looking for."" Her symptoms continued and a scan revealed a large mass or growth.  Now 39, Fiona has been helping the team at Imperial College London with their research.  ""I wanted to help with developing this study because I had the wrong diagnosis for nearly two years,"" she said. ""If there is a way to get an earlier diagnosis, I want to help people who are in the same position I was in. ""Getting diagnosed early is vital. Had my cancer been spotted sooner, I might have had far less surgeries and better fertility options."" Dr James Flanagan, lead author of the Cancer Research UK-funded work, said: ""The cancer symptoms we are looking for are very common - but for some women, they could be the first signs of something more serious. ""Using shopping data, our study found a noticeable increase in purchases of pain and indigestion medications among women with ovarian cancer, up to eight months before diagnosis, compared with women without ovarian cancer.  ""This suggests that long before women have recognised their symptoms as alarming enough to go to the GP, they may be treating them at home."" The researchers worked with two big High Street retailers and 283 female customers, who agreed to share their shopping data going back over six years.  More than half had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.  More research is needed to confirm the findings. The team now plans to test if shopping data can help spot other cancers too - such as stomach, liver and bladder cancer.  The latest work is published in the journal JMIR Public Health and Surveillance. "
risk appetite,'Sweeping' new powers for head teachers,2024-09-15,2017-06-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40275330,"The Scottish government has set out ""sweeping new powers"" for schools as part of a shake-up of education. Education Secretary John Swinney said his reforms were aimed at ""freeing our teachers to teach"". The reforms will see head teachers take responsibility for closing the attainment gap, choosing school staff and deciding curriculum content. They also aim to give schools more direct control over funding, with a consultation on fair funding launched. There was a mixed response from opposition parties, who welcomed parts of the plan, but said others did not go far enough. And local government organisation Cosla said the plan ""erodes local democratic accountability"". The government has been consulting on a review of the education system, amid concerns over an attainment gap between pupils from different backgrounds and declining performance in international rankings. Mr Swinney said the ""simple plan"" at the heart of his reforms was to ""free our teachers to teach"" and ""put new powers in the hands of head teachers"". These new powers will be set out in a statutory charter for head teachers, and will include: However, Mr Swinney said he was ""acutely conscious that schools also need support frameworks to function well"", insisting councils would still have a ""vital"" role in education. The reforms will establish ""regional improvement collaboratives"" to ""pool and strengthen resources to support learning and teaching in schools"". These will be led by a regional director, who will report to the chief inspector of education. The plans will also see a ""significant change"" to Education Scotland, which will have a ""renewed focus on professional learning and leadership"" along with ""strengthened inspection and improvement functions"". Schools will also have access to a ""home to school link worker"" to support parents and families. The education secretary said: ""Improving the education and life chances of our children and young people is the defining mission of this government. While there are many strengths in Scottish education, recent Pisa and literacy scores underline that we can, and we must, achieve more. ""We will reform the system so that the key decisions in a child's education are taken by schools. ""Schools will have the freedom to make their own decisions to improve learning and teaching. Everyone else within the education system will have a collective and shared responsibility to support schools. ""We will free teachers to teach. We will put new powers in the hands of head teachers. And we will all - government, councils and public bodies - support our schools."" Cosla, an umbrella group representing local authorities, said the government had ""endeavoured to pull off a conjuring trick by pretending councils still have a role in the delivery of education"". A spokesman said: ""We will embrace change which promotes better outcomes, but we will resist any change which does not. ""We are clear that what has been announced today erodes local democratic accountability and most certainly will not close the attainment gap."" Responding, Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith welcomed the steps to empower head teachers, but said Mr Swinney's reforms did not go far enough. She said they were ""half-baked and only pay lip service to real devolution"", calling them ""not enough to deal with the root cause of the problems faced"". Labour's Iain Gray meanwhile said the first reform needed was to have more teachers, properly supported and resourced. He welcomed the fact Mr Swinney had decided against having a centralised national funding solution, but questioned whether the regional organisation board plans would just add another layer of bureaucracy. Mr Swinney said a formal procurement process for new routes into teaching would begin shortly, although he stressed that any new route would need to meet General Teaching Council for Scotland tests ""to maintain credibility and academic rigour"". GTCS Chief Executive Kenneth Muir welcomed the announcement, saying the body was ""committed to offering new, flexible routes into teaching"" while maintaining that it was ""imperative that new teachers are properly qualified and registered"". Green MSP Ross Greer said the ""huge changes simply aren't what teachers, pupils and parents have been asking for"", criticising the regional organisational bodies in particular. He said: ""The government's own analysis of the consultation even says there was a 'lack of appetite' for these unaccountable regional bodies."" And Lib Dem Tavish Scott singled out the fact the government was not separating the inspection and curriculum functions of Education Scotland. He said: ""Pupils are let down when the Scottish government is allowed to mark its own homework in this way. Combined with regional boards that shift control towards ministers in Edinburgh, these proposals risk continuing the failed, top down solutions of the past."" The largest teachers' union, the EIS, said in its response to the government's review that the main challenges facing schools were related to funding, resources and staffing. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""While it is early in the process, this Review provides an opportunity for a more constructive and consensual approach to education to be re-established which would be a positive step for schools, teachers and pupils.  ""It is by schools, local authorities and politicians of all parties, at local and national level, working constructively together, that we can deliver enhancements to our comprehensive education system to ensure it continues to meet the needs of Scotland's young people long into the future."""
risk appetite,Cameron warned over 'stupid' Brexit vote,2024-09-15,2019-01-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46951942,"European Council President Donald Tusk told David Cameron to ""get real"" over his ""stupid referendum"" before the 2016 Brexit vote, a BBC documentary reveals. Mr Tusk tells the three-part show that he warned the then prime minister there was no ""appetite for revolution in Europe"" and he ""could lose everything"". He claims that Mr Cameron, who did not take part in the programme, felt ""there was no risk of a referendum"" happening. But Craig Oliver, Mr Cameron's former communications director, denies this. ""David Cameron spent the whole of the 2015 election campaign making clear he would not lead any form of government that didn't have a referendum,"" he said on Twitter. In BBC Two's ""Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil"", which starts next Monday, Mr Tusk said Mr Cameron thought a referendum would not happen because of the coalition government with the Lib Dems. ""[He told me] he felt really safe, because he thought at the same time that there's no risk of a referendum, because his coalition partner, the Liberals, would block this idea of a referendum,"" Mr Tusk said. ""But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner. So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory."" Mr Tusk said he was ""really amazed and even shocked"" to learn from Mr Cameron that he decided to hold the referendum because of his own party. Mr Cameron decided to resign as prime minister when the Leave campaign won the referendum. The programme's producers said he did not take part in the programme because he has signed an exclusive deal for his memoirs.  Mr Tusk warned Mr Cameron that other European prime ministers would not be inclined to help him in the referendum, and says: ""For the first time I saw something close to fear in his eyes. He finally realised what a challenge he was facing."" And after hearing Mr Cameron's decision to quit, Mr Tusk says he told him: ""Yes David, it would be very difficult even to imagine that a prime minister who was the leader of Remain's campaign would be just two days later a prime minister negotiating Brexit. ""It was like his day of reckoning was coming, reckoning for his biggest mistake in his life."" The first episode of the three-part series features interviews with former chancellor George Osborne, ex-foreign secretary William Hague, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and former French presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. Nick Clegg, the UK's then EU ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers and Mr Oliver are also included. In the programme, Mr Sarkozy reveals how he warned Mr Cameron about his attempt at strong-arm tactics with EU leaders over concessions on migrant rules and integration, telling him: ""If you try to break our arm, you'll get nothing."" And Mr Hollande says that during a visit to Chequers in 2015 he tried to talk the Tory leader out of holding the referendum. ""Nothing obliged him to hold the referendum when he did,"" he tells the documentary. ""This would not be the first time that a commitment made at an election had not been kept afterwards, but he wanted to show he could negotiate successfully with Europeans."" Theresa May, who is criticised in the programme by Mr Osborne - who she sacked as chancellor, also declined to take part in the programme Describing a meeting held by Mr Cameron to get ministers' views on whether to back a referendum, Mr Osborne said: ""Theresa May didn't say very much, which was par for the course in those meetings."" The first episode of Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, 'We Quit', is on BBC Two on Monday, 28 January at 21:00 GMT and available on iPlayer afterwards."
risk appetite,Does the diplomatic boycott of Beijing 2022 matter?,2024-09-15,2021-12-13,By Dan Roan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59646231,"While concern over human rights has become almost a constant theme in international sport in recent years, few hosts of major events have provoked quite as much controversy as Beijing.  The venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics has been hit by a flurry of diplomatic boycotts from countries including the US, Australia, and Britain, because of widespread allegations of Chinese atrocities against the Uyghur community. Human rights groups and Western governments have accused China of genocide in the Xinjiang region. China denies this, saying its network of detention camps there is for ""re-education"" of the Uyghurs and other Muslims.  Relations are also strained over a crackdown on political freedoms and pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and more recently concerns over tennis player Peng Shuai, who disappeared from public view after she accused a top Chinese government official of sexual assault. Although the Chinese authorities have criticised ""malicious speculation"" over her case, there remains significant concern about her.  For the few Western governments who have said their representatives will not attend, such a move is a relatively easy way to be seen to issue a rebuke, while avoiding the much more contentious step of preventing athletes from competing via a full boycott.  It is not a new tactic. Three years ago some European countries, including Britain, announced diplomatic boycotts of the Russian football World Cup after the Salisbury Novichok poisoning.  The risk with sending politicians to Beijing to attend the Games is that inevitably it would be viewed as offering tacit approval of the government of President Xi Jinping, for whom the event is a matter of significant prestige.  While China accused the US of using the Games for political manipulation and vowed ""resolute counter-measures"", it is unlikely to have been too dismayed, or indeed surprised, especially given the likes of Italy and France have declined to join the boycott, with President Macron describing it as ""symbolic and insignificant"". Certainly it will make very little difference to the spectacle of the event for those inside venues or watching from afar.  While the coalition of Tibetan, Uyghur, Southern Mongolian, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese rights groups that make up the #NoBeijing2022 campaign welcomed the diplomatic boycotts, many campaigners feel they do not go far enough, and that athletes themselves, corporate sponsors and major broadcasters also need to act if pressure really is to be brought to bear on China.  Some ask - if a full boycott is not appropriate now, in a country that stands accused of genocide, when will it ever be? Indeed, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has been widely praised in the West for effectively boycotting China by suspending all tournaments there in response to continued questions over Peng Shuai's condition, a rare example of a sports body prepared to take such a stand against a country that is such a key commercial market.  Refusing to participate in the Olympics would perhaps do more to raise awareness of the violations that China stands accused of, and taking part risks appearing complicit - but it would also seem very unfair on innocent athletes who have spent years preparing for such an opportunity.  Those opposed to such a step insist that the Cold War boycotts of the Games in 1980 and 1984 had minimal political impact, with athletes ultimately the ones who were punished. Others, however, point to the sporting boycotts of apartheid South Africa in the 1970s and 80s as evidence that such an approach can play a crucial role in applying pressure to a country's rulers.  Some flip this argument on its head, insisting that engaging in sporting competition, rather than boycotting, ensures the opportunity for valuable sporting diplomacy, and means international scrutiny, both of which can result in positive change. This is an argument the FA uses when asked about participating in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where despite reforms, workers' rights remain a major concern for human rights organisations, and homosexuality is illegal.  ""Our view remains that change is best achieved by working collaboratively with others so that we can continue to ask the right questions while always being mindful that we also have our own human rights challenges in this country,"" the governing body said in a recent statement. ""As a legacy of the upcoming World Cup, we also see the opportunity for dialogue and engagement that can lead to real change beyond the borders of Qatar and into neighbouring countries in the region where there are also still some challenges regarding human rights."" Not everyone agrees. There seems little evidence of any such progress in China after the Beijing summer Games in 2008, nor indeed in Russia after it staged the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup.  But while there seems little appetite among athletes, governments or sports fans for a full boycott of Beijing 2022, could competitors still make a difference once there? It would be no surprise given the renewed activism of recent years, with more and more athletes speaking out about a range of social issues, from racism and women's rights, to mental health and the environment.  Although recently relaxed, the IOC's Rule 50 still seriously restricts what Olympians can say or do during the event, forbidding any form of political protest, demonstration or propaganda on the podium, at official ceremonies, or on the field of play. Freedom of speech is allowed in press areas, mixed zones and on social media, but whether athletes will take up that opportunity in a country criticised for censorship and the intimidation of foreign journalists is debatable. Especially after WTA Chairman Steve Simon recently said that he was ""greatly concerned about the risks that all of our players and staff could face if we were to hold events in China in 2022.""  It certainly seems the Chinese authorities do not take kindly to condemnation from sports stars. Outspoken Boston Celtics basketball star Enes Kanter sparked a major backlash when he was critical of President Xi and expressed support for the Free Tibet movement in October. His name was blocked from Chinese social media site Weibo, and the streaming of Celtics games was reportedly cancelled. Similarly, an Arsenal game was pulled from Chinese state television in 2019 after its former midfielder Mesut Ozil highlighted the treatment of the Uyghurs.  Many human rights groups have pleaded with the IOC to find a new location for the event. At this late stage, there is no prospect of that, of course. But the intense controversy surrounding Beijing 2022 has reinforced scrutiny over the organisation's choice of hosts and its relationship with them.  Human Rights Watch recently accused the IOC of ""collaboration"" with the Chinese after its President Thomas Bach held a video call with three-time Olympian Ms Peng in a bid to alleviate concerns. The IOC reject this accusation, and has defended its use of ""quiet diplomacy"". But it will have troubled many that when asked how China's record on human rights was compatible with the Olympic values, its longest-serving board member Dick Pound said he had no regrets about Beijing's selection as host and that he ""did not know"" about alleged atrocities, despite mounting evidence. ""You can berate me all you like about my not knowing, but I don't know for sure,"" he told Deutschlandfunk Sport on Monday. The IOC, he said, ""has no role to play in bringing about political change... when we award the Games to a country we don't do it as an indication that we support the political objectives of that country."" Critics firmly reject the IOC's insistence that it is entirely neutral and is above politics. They point, for example, to the talks that the organisation facilitated between North and South Korea in 2018.  And the way President Vladimir Putin hoped to use Sochi 2014 to project to the world the power of both Russia and himself.  What is certain is that while it was not the athletes' choice to select Beijing to host the Games, as geopolitical tensions rise, they are the ones now facing renewed questions about whether it is right to compete there, and left to decide what they should do once they arrive.  Many feel they have been placed in an impossible position. "
risk appetite,Schools to get guidance on supporting trans pupils,2024-09-15,2023-04-21,By Bethan Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65336915,"National guidance for schools in Wales on how to support transgender pupils will be published during the next academic year. The Welsh government said it required ""extensive consultation"" and would provide ""clear and well-informed advice"". One charity said teachers often lacked confidence in talking about issues relating to gender. School of Hard Knocks said the topic came up ""more and more"" in schools. The charity uses sports like rugby to help at-risk children re-engage with school and avoid permanent exclusion, but found there was an appetite from teachers for help in how to support transgender, non-binary and gender-exploring young people.  Sian Edwards said it ran focus groups to find out the key issues faced by teachers and pupils. ""More and more students are exploring their gender and being open with how they identify and using pronouns that differ to the ones they were given at birth,"" she said. ""That's something teachers are seeing more and more and it's not something that they're necessarily familiar with or comfortable with."" The Inc Project, led by School of Hard Knocks, now offers training to schools and other organisations. ""A key message from the training is - have the conversation. Students just want to know that you're trying to help - that is the biggest thing that will make a difference,"" added Dr Edwards. Alison Carney, a consultant who helps deliver the training, acknowledged it could be a sensitive area and teachers feared getting it wrong. ""We talked to the kids and the teachers about what are the problems they're having in school and this isn't about necessarily getting down to the [detail] of policy,"" she said. ""It's simply about what could make their day to day better."" The Welsh government committed to issuing guidance in summer 2023 as part of its LGBTQ+ Action Plan, but said it had been delayed to ensure a full consultation avoiding exam time and the school summer holidays. ""This is a complex area of policy which requires extensive consultation with experts, practitioners and the public, as well as children and young people themselves,"" the Welsh government said. It said the guidance was needed to help teachers make sure transgender children and young people ""feel safe and adequately supported in education"". Dan Hayes, 23, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said more guidance could have helped him while he was at school.  ""It started when I was maybe eight or nine. It was mainly me thinking 'these aren't the clothes I'm meant to wear'. As I went through puberty... 'I shouldn't look like this',"" he said.  ""I actually found the words to describe myself a lot later when I was 16 or 17. But even then it took a lot to identify with those words 'I am transgender'."" Dan said he found having to wear girls' uniform difficult. ""I always felt very uncomfortable going to school looking like that. I tried my best to fit in growing my hair long, wearing make-up but it just never worked,"" he said.  Dan said being transgender or non-binary was rarely mentioned in school, apart from as ""a joke"" and he said more guidance for teachers might help. ""I didn't want to talk to any of my teachers about it because I didn't think they'd understand. ""I think it's important for trans kids to know there are people like them out there."" The Welsh Conservatives said it was a ""delicate subject"" and ""vital"" to get right. The party's education spokesperson, Laura Anne Jones, said: ""The guidance should allow teachers to focus on teaching and not pander to identity politics and culture wars."" Any guidance ""should not come at the expense of women and girls' rights"", she added. The Children's Commissioner for Wales, Rocio Cifuentes, said it was important that adults were ""well equipped and confident in giving advice and help"". ""I expect the Welsh government's upcoming national trans guidance for schools to act as a comprehensive and practical tool to help schools to confidently respond to pupils' needs,"" she added. The UK government has promised guidance for schools in England during the summer term after an education union said members were having to navigate ""a minefield"". Some parents have previously sought to challenge the approach taken by schools and local authorities."
risk appetite,City's recycling fines 'may hit £21m',2024-09-15,2017-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-41124476,"Cardiff faces £21m of fines unless it recycles more than 90,000 extra tonnes of waste in the next three years, a report has warned.  It estimates an additional 32,000 tonnes of waste a year needs to be recycled in the city to hit 2020 targets, due to population growth.  The council is looking into opening a regional plant to sort glass, paper and plastic from across south Wales.  The report said there was not a ""do nothing option"" for the Welsh capital.  The Welsh Government - which set the first statutory recycling targets in the UK - has yet to fine any authority for missing them.  The target for 2016-17 was 58%, rising to 64% by 2019-20, and then 70% by 2024-25.  Any authority missing the targets faces a £200 per-tonne penalty. Last year, three authorities failed to hit the target - Newport and Torfaen both fell just short at 57% each, while Blaenau Gwent's performance was the lowest at 49% - however, none were penalised. This year, provisional figures showed Newport council had exceeded the target, at 61% for 2016-17, Torfaen had risen to 64%, and Blaenau Gwent had also improved at 57%. A report by Cardiff's environmental scrutiny committee, to be considered on Tuesday, said the majority of initiatives to meet targets have been delivered but ""constant thought is needed to ensure that the council achieves future targets"". ""This in effect means that after taking into consideration waste and population growth we have to recycle approximately 32,000 tonnes of additional waste in Cardiff each year,"" the report states. ""The financial risk of failing targets can be massive. For example, failing by 4,000 tonnes could equate to a fiscal penalty of over £800,000.  ""The 'do nothing option' has not been an option for Cardiff; if no further changes are made to the delivery of council recycling services, then the fines between now and 2020 could equate to over £21m."" A Cardiff council spokesman said: ""The council works with five local authorities to treat non-recyclable waste to create green energy through an Energy Recovery Facility.  ""This partnership gives significant benefits, as by working together through economies of scale, the price for each of the partners to treat this waste is lower than if they worked individually. ""Using the same logic, Cardiff is currently proposing to carry out a feasibility study to explore the possibility of a partnership for dry recyclables but no decision has been made."""
risk appetite,Would you buy shares in Uber?,2024-09-15,2019-05-10,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48228812,"For sale: shares in a company that has already burned through $27bn (£20.7bn; €24bn) in cash, will burn through tens of billions more of its new shareholders' money, has never made a profit and won't for many years - if ever.  Sounds too bad to be true, but that is precisely what is on offer when Uber shares start trading today. It seems impossible to imagine why anyone would want to buy them, and yet market watchers expect there to be no shortage of people queuing up to buy a slice of a company whose name has become a recognised noun in dozens of languages around the world.   Uber is selling shares to finance one of the most ambitious business plans in history. To revolutionise and then dominate global transportation.  This company is about much more than getting a car home after the pub when you don't fancy public transport. Uber wants to dominate food delivery, electric bikes, international freight and more.  That makes Uber a different animal from Lyft, its ride-hailing rival which has seen its shares fall 25% since it first sold shares publicly.  The most important part of Uber's business plan is scale. Spend whatever it takes, for as long as it takes to smash the competition. This was Amazon's plan. Amazon didn't make a profit until six years after it first sold shares. It spent every dollar of revenue - and more - in expanding its business. It worked. Amazon's market share of e-commerce in the US is now double the next biggest nine companies combined. As astonishing as that is, Uber has the potential to have an even greater impact.  It is the poster child of what is known as the gig economy. It provides a platform to match individual service providers/contractors (Uber drivers) with customers - taking a hefty slice (currently 25% in the UK) for matchmaking.  Some fear that if Uber succeeds in making its platform the dominant mode of transport around the globe, then it will have become the digital equivalent of a feudal landlord.  It owns the land on which the workers toil like peasants for low wages, while the economic spoils go to the landowner - dramatically skewing the returns of economic activity towards capital rather than labour.  And if and when driverless cars come along, that will eliminate the return to labour completely.   Who would you rather be, landlord or peasant? If landlord, then buy a share of the freehold on offer today.  But buyer beware: this may be the most ambitious and risky plan since Icarus wanted a better look at the sun.  In many countries, there is already something of a ""peasants' revolt"" under way. Drivers in cities across the US and UK have recently gone on strike to complain about pay and conditions.  It should probably be called a protest rather than a strike, because Uber insists the drivers work for themselves. That status is absolutely key to Uber's business plan and is under legal challenge in courts around the world.  But perhaps the greatest risk to Uber is that it succeeds in its plan for world domination, only to be broken up one day. There is a growing number of voices in Europe and the US calling for an end to what they see as the suffocating domination of tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. It seems unlikely that governments, regulators and citizens around the world will be comfortable with one or even a couple of companies dominating and monitoring the movement of all people and goods around the world.  My own hunch (neck uncomfortably out) is that there will be plenty of appetite for today's sale. Blockbuster market debuts like this don't come along very often: the last big one in the US was Facebook.  Fomo (Fear of missing out) is a powerful emotion which may overwhelm the uncertainty as to whether Uber will ever make a profit.   "
risk appetite,What does North Korea really want?,2024-09-15,2017-08-12,By Dr John Nilsson-Wright,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40913650,"Long-standing tensions over North Korea's weapons programme have worsened after it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. That prompted a new round of UN sanctions and an escalation of the war of words with the United States. As the provocations continue, what does Kim Jong-un really want to achieve? Given the escalating war of words between the US and North Korea, and Donald Trump's warning of ""fire and fury"" if Kim Jong-un overtly threatens the United States or launches missiles against the US territory of Guam, it is unclear how useful diplomacy is as tool for moderating regional tensions. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other senior Trump administration officials have stressed the importance of diplomacy, and even Mr Trump has in the past offered to talk to Mr Kim, but there are no signs that the North Koreans are open to dialogue. Recent informal track two level talks with North Korean officials in Europe suggest that Pyongyang is single-mindedly focused on continuing with its missile and nuclear-weapons testing programmes. Strikingly at the Asean Regional Forum meeting in Manila recently, there was no meeting between Mr Tillerson and Ri Yong-ho, the North Korean foreign minister, and a proposal for talks between Seoul and Pyongyang offered by Kang Kyung-wha, the South Korean foreign minister, was summarily rebuffed by the North Koreans.  In principle, there are incentives that the US could offer the North, including talks on a peace treaty ending the Korean War, preliminary steps towards diplomatic recognition (such as the establishment of a US liaison mission in Pyongyang), or an agreement on conventional arms reductions on the peninsula, but these are at best long-term objectives.  The North's repeated violations of past diplomatic agreements with the US has eroded any appetite for concessions in Washington where there is deep-seated distrust of the North on both sides of the political aisle and an assumption that pressure, via the latest round of tougher UN sanctions targeting the North's mineral and food exports, and restrictions on North Korean overseas labour, is the best way of bringing Pyongyang to heel.  How worried should you be? Reality Check: Are Trump's assumptions right? Since coming to power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un's priorities have been focused consistently on two simple objectives of military modernization and delivering economic prosperity for the North Korean public. The North's nuclear aspirations date from the 1960s and are consistent with the regime's desire for political and military autonomy in the face of opposition not only from its traditional enemies such as the United States, Japan and South Korea, but also over the objections of its historical partners such as China and Russia.  What damage could North Korea do? Kim Jong-un, North Korea's supreme commander Part of the North's motivation is a rational assessment of the country's strategic interests. The experience of Libya and Iraq is a reminder to Pyongyang that the only guarantee of national survival is the possession of a credible weapons of mass destruction capability. While Washington has expressed no ""hostile intent"" to the North, Pyongyang maintains that the United States, as a conventionally superior and nuclear armed power, with 28,000 troops in South Korea, and a policy of maintaining a first-use nuclear option, represents a clear threat to the country.  Mr Kim's nuclear and missile testing ambitions are also an expression of identity politics. The legitimacy of the Kim dynasty's political leadership is rooted in a narrative of defence against an implacably hostile United States. The 1950-53 Korean War, framed in North Korean propaganda as the result of direct US aggression, is used to depict the United States to the North Korean people as an adversary intent on destroying the country. For the country's older generation that recall US actions during the war, when virtually every urban centre in the North was obliterated by American bombing, this narrative is a convincing one and is routinely reinforced for the wider population in the state's daily political messages. Mr Trump's recent bellicose public statements are a propaganda gift to Kim Jong-un, allowing him to bolster his standing as the nation's commander in chief and protector of the country. Can the US defend itself? Can North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? The North's accelerated missile testing campaign and last year's two successful nuclear tests have materially enhanced the country's deterrent capabilities. Recent intelligence reports from the US have suggested that the country may have as many as 60 nuclear bombs (a figure disputed by some analysts) and its long-range missile tests of 4 and 28 July indicate that the North may have the capacity to hit parts of the United States. A recent report in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has questioned the extent to which this improved missile capability genuinely allows the North to deploy a nuclear warhead against the US, but there is little doubt that Pyongyang has made dramatic progress in the last year in securing full de-facto membership of the nuclear club.  Washington, however, has made it clear that it will not recognize or tolerate such a development. To do so would offer a propaganda victory to the North, critically undermine America's relations with its key regional allies - Japan and South Korea - prompt a destabilizing arms race in the region, and destabilize the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.  Trump's team mixed messages Who said what: Trump or Kim? Pyongyang's priority is to push ahead aggressively with testing, both of its missiles and its nuclear weapons, in an effort to solidify its deterrent capabilities. For Mr Kim, this makes sense as means of boosting his political authority and legitimacy at home.  He can take comfort from China's apparent reluctance to impose crippling economic restrictions on the North, despite its recent support for tougher UN sanctions. He can also calculate rationally that ultimately the United States, as many experienced observers are arguing, will accept the need to negotiate some form of intermediate freeze in the North's military capabilities in the hope that this will stabilize the strategic situation while keeping the door open to future disarmament. By then, Mr Kim may hope he will be able to secure a range of concessions from the US and South Korea, whether in the form of economic assistance, conventional arms reductions, or more importantly the political respect and status as an independent, sovereign state that the North has long craved. The wild card in the current situation is how far President Trump's rhetorical brinkmanship will deter the North from pushing ahead with its missile testing programme. The North Korean military has threatened to test fire four intermediate range missiles in the vicinity of the US military facilities  on Guam later this month. No US President could tolerate a direct attack, but a test launch in the international waters close to the island would arguably represent a ""grey zone"" contingency that would require a more nuanced response, stopping short of full-blown military conflict.   Discussions of the current stand-off have focused on the parallels with the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and the strategic judgment of the US president at the time, John F Kennedy. His caution in seeking to avoid nuclear war was shaped by his reading of Barbara Tuchman's book The Guns of August and its insights into the lessons of World War One.   It is ironic and telling that once again August is a time of acute strategic risk and uncertainty, when the rhetoric, assessments and actions of national leaders are likely to carry profound significance for regional and global security.

risk appetite,Second inquest for 'bubbly' toddler Poppi,2024-09-15,2017-11-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cumbria-42139089,"A 13-month-old girl who died after allegedly being sexually abused by her father was a ""bubbly and funny"" child, her mother has said. Poppi Worthington died in hospital after being found with serious injuries at her home in Barrow in December 2012. Last year a family court found her father Paul probably sexually assaulted her before her death. He has never been charged with any offence and denies responsibility. He is due to give evidence in the inquest. Poppi's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was the first person to give evidence at the second inquest at County Hall in Kendal. The new inquest was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"".  Alison Hewitt, counsel for the coroner, asked the mother what Poppi was like. She said: ""[Poppi] was very alive, bubbly and funny. You knew she was there."" She also said she had a good appetite, regular naps and was starting to walk. She said Poppi was like the family's ""alarm clock"" and usually woke ""bright and early"" every day between 05:30 and 06:00. On 12 December, a recording of the mother calling 999 just before 06:00 GMT was played to the hearing. She can be heard saying: ""Come on baby, come on Poppi, keep going"".  She can also be heard relaying instructions from the 999 call handler to Mr Worthington who was attempting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compressions. She told the operator: ""Ambulance please. My baby's not breathing, she's gone blue. ""She's not been well, on and off, last few days."" The call handler responds, asking her to keep calm before giving instructions to lie the child flat on her back, check her airways and begin CPR. The mother tells her partner: ""Oh my God. Two breaths, 30 pumps. Keep going until the ambulance arrives. ""Come on Poppi. Come on baby. Come on ambulance please. Please come on. ""What's wrong with her, Paul? She's not breathing."" Paramedics are then heard arriving in the background at the end of the call, which lasted up to 10 minutes. More than an hour later, Poppi was confirmed dead at Furness General Hospital. The day before, Poppi had started showing signs of a cold, which had already affected the rest of the family, the mother told the hearing.  During dinner that night Poppi ""threw herself back and just screamed out"", the mother said. She said Poppi was ""screaming as though something was painful"" and as if she had a sore stomach. After an unusual bowel movement, Poppi was fine, the coroner heard. She said she had never found Poppi's pyjama bottoms. The coroner asked her if she had specifically looked for them and she said she had. The mother later told the inquest she did not know an allegation had been made that Poppi had been sexually assaulted when she made the statement. Ms Hewitt also asked the mother about injuries discovered in Poppi's post-mortem examination including a fractured leg. She said she did not know what caused them. Gillian Irving QC, who represents the mother, asked her if Poppi was ever taken into her parents' bed. ""No"", the mother replied. She said Poppi was too small and was at risk of suffocation if she was put in the bed with the adults. Nicola Lynn, the paramedic who attended the house, said as soon as she saw Poppi she could see the girl was in cardiac arrest. Tests in the ambulance showed she no longer had a pulse. Once Poppi had been removed from the ambulance Ms Lynn said she could see ""bright red"" blood on the sheet where she had been lying. She said Mr Worthington travelled in the ambulance with Poppi and he said: ""She's gone hasn't she."" Ms Lynn later saw him at the hospital and she said he appeared ""shell-shocked"". The hearing, which is expected to last three weeks, continues."
risk appetite,Top five celeb 'diets to avoid' in 2018,2024-09-15,2017-12-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42264838,"The British Dietetic Association has released a list of diets they say we should steer clear of in the new year.  They include the Raw Vegan, Alkaline, Pioppi and Ketogenic diets, as well as Katie Price's Nutritional Supplements.  Sian Porter from the BDA said: ""If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.""  The British Nutrition Foundation agreed that the five diets are best avoided, while Dr Aseem Malhotra, author of The Pioppi diet, defended his meal plan. Gwyneth Paltrow, Megan Fox and Sting have all come out in support of a vegan diet of uncooked foods.   Supporters define raw food as anything that has not been refined, canned or chemically processed, and has not been heated above 48C. They argue that applying heat destroys some of the natural enzymes in food and that the body therefore needs to do more work to break the food down.  They also say you lose nutrients through this process.  But Mrs Porter said: ""People think that vegan is shorthand for healthy, but it requires careful planning to make sure you don't miss out on important nutrients."" The NHS suggests vegans consider taking vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements. Heat also brings out the nutrients in some foods, such as carrots while others, such as potatoes, cannot be eaten raw.  Tom Brady and the Duchess of York have been famous proponents of the alkaline diet.  The diet is based on the theory that you can change the pH balance (level of acidity) of your body and blood through the food that you eat - despite there currently being no substantial evidence to suggest that this is possible. Advocates have claimed that high levels of ""excess acid"" in the body contribute to a range of health conditions including arthritis, osteoporosis, kidney and liver disorders, and even cancer. They suggest eating ""alkaline foods"", primarily fruit and vegetables, to correct this. But, according to Cancer Research UK, while eating more fruit and vegetables may help you lose weight, the pH of your food will not impact the pH of your blood. Mrs Porter said: ""So if it works to lose weight, it's because you're cutting down on calories.""  The NHS says that the alkaline diet lacks evidence, and advises against cutting out whole food groups, as some versions of the diet suggest.  Katie Price has released a range of hydration, breakfast and meal replacement shakes.  According to the website, the drinks support muscle tone and maintenance as well as decreasing snacking and cravings.  Mrs Porter said: ""The problem is people need to reintroduce food so you want something you can stick to."" While rapid weight loss can be motivating, the BDA said it is unsustainable and that appetite suppressors are not a healthy or advisable way of losing weight. Sarah Coe from the BNF said: ""Meal replacement products can be useful for people that have a lot of weight to lose, but should always be used under supervision from a health professional."" Katie Price Nutrition did not respond to a BBC request for comment.  The Pioppi diet claims to promote the principles of the Mediterranean diet to promote weight loss and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The authors, Dr Aseem Malhotra and Donal O'Neill, recommend a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet with fruit and vegetables, fish, olive oil, alcohol in moderation and exercise.  They suggest intermittent fasting and discourage eating red meat, starchy carbs, and sweetened treats. The BDA accused the pair of ""hijacking"" the Mediterranean diet with their agenda, saying it was ""ridiculous"" to include coconut oil or cauliflower for a pizza base as one of their suggestions.  Mrs Porter said: ""We all know now that a Mediterranean-style diet is one of the most healthy diets to follow. But it's not low carb."" The British Nutrition Foundation agrees, saying that a traditional Mediterranean diet typically includes pasta and rice at every meal.  Mrs Porter added that the argument to eat a high level of saturated fat was based on evidence that had been ""cherry-picked rather than looking at it in its entirety"". She said: ""Why it might help you lose weight is because it's making healthier choices and you'd be having overall less calories.""  But Dr Malhotra, a cardiologist and adviser at the National Obesity Forum, said: ""The Pioppi Diet is an independent evaluation that marries the secrets of one of the world's healthiest villages with the latest medical, nutrition and exercise research to bust many myths prevalent in today's weight loss and health industries. ""It has received endorsements from a number of eminent international doctors, dieticians, Cochrane researchers and sports scientists. ""One has to question the financial links and influence of various food companies on the BDA. In my view, they cannot be trusted as an independent source of dietary advice.""  In response to this, a BDA spokesperson said: ""The analysis we release is always based on evidence and is unaffected by the important relationships we have with the nation's food producers.  ""Our spokespeople, like all dieticians, are required to adhere to evidence-based practice as part of their registration with the Health and Care Professions Council.""  A huge number of celebrities have been linked with this diet including Kim Kardashian, Kobe Bryant and Alec Baldwin. The premise is to eat a very low carb, high fat, moderate protein diet, with carbohydrates coming from non-starchy vegetables, nuts and seeds.  The aim is to push the body into a state of ""ketosis"". Because it doesn't have the glucose from the carbohydrates, it instead breaks down fat to produce energy.  Ms Porter said: ""The sinister thing here is people saying it can cure cancer and things like that - it absolutely cannot!"" She said by not eating carbohydrates, you avoid eating the calorie-laden things that generally accompany them: ""If you're cutting out carbs, such as pasta, you're cutting out creamy sauce. If you're cutting out bread, you're cutting out butter. If you're cutting out biscuits, you're cutting out sugar.""  The danger, she said, is that you can lose a lot of fibre from your diet which is important for gut health. Also, by removing whole grains from your diet you're depriving your body of many vitamins and minerals.  The BNF advises that it can be effective for losing weight in the short-term but this weight loss can be hard to sustain.  The BDA has a fact sheet recommending some of the best ways to lose weight.

risk appetite,Toshiba delivers long-awaited earnings,2024-09-15,2017-08-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40873088,"Toshiba has met a deadline to report its long-awaited earnings results, reducing the risk that the firm will be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The embattled electronics firm posted a loss of $8.8bn (£6.7bn) for the last fiscal year.  Auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata gave a ""qualified opinion"" on the financial statements, meaning it broadly endorsed the results. Toshiba has struggled to recover from a 2015 accounting scandal.  The firm's troubles started in 2015 when it was found to have inflated the previous seven years' profits by $1.2bn.  The accounting scandal led to the resignation of several members of the firm's senior management, including the chief executive.  In late 2016, billions of dollars in losses at its US nuclear unit Westinghouse were first revealed. Toshiba, looking to diversify away from consumer electronics, had bought the business in 2006.  Its financial troubles deepened after delays and costs overruns at two US reactors, and as global appetite for nuclear energy waned following the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Westinghouse was put into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which protects it from creditors while it undergoes restructuring. Toshiba had delayed the release of its financial results for months, as it struggled to secure sign-off from its auditors.  PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata on Thursday delivered a ""qualified opinion"" on the earnings for the year to March, as well as the April-June quarter.  That means it broadly vouched for its accounting despite finding minor problems. The auditor's sign-off reduces the immediate threat of Toshiba being delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The company was demoted from the first tier of the exchange in June after confirming its liabilities outweighed its assets. If Toshiba reports negative net worth - liabilities exceeding assets - for a second consecutive year it would likely prompt a delisting.  It's up to the Tokyo Stock Exchange to decide whether it can remain on the bourse.  Toshiba has narrowly escaped de-listing - for now at least. But the troubled firm's problems are far from over.  While auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata have broadly endorsed the results, there are reports that PwC also issued an ""adverse opinion"" on Toshiba saying the company didn't do enough to alert investors about the losses at its US Westinghouse unit soon enough. Toshiba says that it reported the losses as soon as it could.  But the risk hasn't gone away. Another deadline still looms - the company has until March 2018 to resolve its debt issues.  Analysts say it's hard to see how the beleaguered electronics giant won't face delisting soon - simply because trust in the firm's ability to resurrect itself is at an all time-low and the company hasn't done much to infuse investors with confidence. The company needs to sell its prized chip business to cover its hefty US losses. But the sale has hit hurdles.  Toshiba is trying to offload the unit to a consortium of US, South Korean and Japanese investors. The sale has been challenged by Toshiba's partner and rival bidder, Western Digital, in court.  Toshiba is the world's second-largest chip manufacturer. Its products are used in data centres and consumer goods worldwide, including iPhones and iPads. "
risk appetite,"Corbyn supporters out of power, but not out of ideas",2024-09-15,2023-10-09,By Iain Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67057097,"Two visions of Labour were on display on Monday. In her speech to Labour conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves was cheered as she declared that ""you can't tax and spend your way to growth"". She set out differences with the Conservatives but also wanted to distance the current leadership from the previous one, declaring ""extremists"" had been thrown out of Labour. She was applauded by Labour grandee Lord Mandelson from a front row seat - a personification of how the party has changed in the four years since the era when Jeremy Corbyn was leader of the Labour Party. Yet in the same venue, a little earlier, there was also a standing ovation for the leader of the Unite union Sharon Graham when she called for the party to be more bold and to take the energy companies back in to public ownership. On a show of hands, this policy passed - a slap in the face for the party leadership, which had ditched plans for ""common ownership"". Most topics likely to cause Sir Keir Starmer any difficulty or irritation had already been kept off the agenda - including Brexit. In a ballot on Sunday, constituency delegates chose to prioritise motions which would not trouble the leadership. This in itself demonstrates a shift from the left wing of the party, and is in part due to the departure of some grassroots members who are disillusioned with the party's direction. But the trade unions can also vote to put items on the agenda and that's why the debate on public ownership occurred. Despite the victory on public ownership, the Left would concede - as a matter of fact - that they have lost control of the party.  The Labour leadership is making it clear that the re-nationalisation of energy will not make it in to the next election manifesto. The Left will be in a minority in the meeting, closer to the election, that draws up that document. So today's policy will head straight in to the dustbin of history. So how do they react? With less vocal opposition than you might imagine. Mick Lynch, leader of the RMT union, addressed a fringe meeting this weekend and declared that he wouldn't be saying ""this or that"" about Keir Starmer as ""we need to get the Tories out and that means getting him in"". This is reflective of a view of some on the Left. Labour is ahead in the polls and apparently on the cusp of power, and there may be a political price to be paid for being seen to undermine this.  And in any case the scent of power is a unifying force. Here on Merseyside, some MPs on the left are taking a tactical decision not to rock the Labour boat that may become a ship of state. Bell Ribiero-Addy, who worked for Diane Abbott before becoming an MP, told a Left fringe meeting: ""It's important you're still here fighting. I don't have time for people who quit the party in a huff... If Labour lose the country loses, regardless of our different views."" And Richard Burgon, secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, said he understood ""how difficult it can be with the current leadership"" but said: ""Wouldn't it be fantastic to see all the Tories out, and Labour again get the keys to 10 Downing Street?"" A Left source also suggested there was a ""fear"" that what happened to both Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott - suspended from the parliamentary party, and likely to be prevented from standing as Labour candidates - could happen to others. Party rules were changed this weekend to make crystal clear that anyone who campaigns for a non-Labour candidate will be expelled.  If Jeremy Corbyn were - as anticipated - to stand as an independent at the next election then any supporters who knock doors on his behalf would be out.  Those publicly backing the North of Tyne Mayor Jamie Driscoll, who quit Labour, would suffer a similar fate. Some will indeed be tempted to do so, and the Left inside Labour will be further weakened. But those who wish to stay and fight do not want to make the leadership's day, and are proceeding with caution. There are those on the Left who argue that the current leadership's victory has been more organisational than political. The Labour to Win grouping, which got behind the Starmer leadership when he embarked on a journey away from the Corbyn era, have helped him grab control of many of the levers of power - including the ruling National Executive Committee. The Left argue - as Monday's debate on public ownership demonstrates - there is still an appetite among some in the party for more radical policies. But the prospect of regaining power within the party is a distant one. Momentum - the group set up to support the Corbyn leadership - point out that some of their members are pursuing their politics via the local route. They are training members to be council candidates. Their co-chair Hilary Schan is a councillor in Worthing, where Labour is hopeful of taking the parliamentary seat. Preston Labour councillors have been practicing their form of municipal socialism for some time. As for Westminster, the Labour leader's office has taken an active role in ensuring some on the Left don't get on to parliamentary shortlists. But there could still be perhaps in the region of 30 or so MPs who are in the Socialist Campaign Group. So some hope if Labour were to win a narrow majority, they could yet exercise disproportionate influence. Meanwhile, Unite are building from below - diverting some of the cash that could have gone to Labour to running campaigns in key constituencies on issue that matter to them.  The thinking is that they can set off a political chain reaction. The aim is for voters to put pressure on candidates, then candidates put pressure on their party leadership and then, bang! A Labour government brings this about. And the Left hope that other unions which are less critical than Unite will nonetheless press for more progress on their priorities if Labour take power. There is also been some informal, and perhaps a little distasteful, chat on the reception circuit about what would happen if Keir Starmer were to fall under the proverbial bus.  Some on both the Right and Left of the party agree there would be no lurch to the Corbyn left.  But they feel Angela Rayner, who oversaw a robust workers' rights agenda, or Andy Burnham (were he to get a parliamentary seat) and who is re-regulating transport in Manchester, might be better placed to succeed than Rachel Reeves or Wes Streeting, as they are more acceptable to the unions.  In other words, though the party has been on a journey from Left to Right, it hasn't quite settled in a final destination.  But the speed at which the party leadership has moved has shocked some on the Left, and pleasantly surprised those who fondly remember the New Labour era."
risk appetite,Amber Rudd's political highs and lows,2024-09-15,2018-04-29,By Gavin Stamp,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43925160,"Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience.  Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes.  She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party.  But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis. Previously regarded as having more liberal views on immigration than her predecessor, she was soon accused of making the government's ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants even tougher, with disastrous repercussions for thousands of people in the country legally. More significantly, she was forced to publicly backtrack on claims that the Home Office did not have targets for removing immigration offenders, admitting to MPs she had been wrong.  The opposition soon called for her head, describing her as a ""human shield"" for the prime minister. But there was no appetite on the Tory benches - either from Brexiters or Remainers - for her to go, with three cabinet ministers already having had to quit in the past six months.  The final nail in her coffin was when her claim to the Commons that she was not aware of the targets was contradicted not only by a memo she had been sent by a top Home Office official, published by the Guardian, but also a letter Ms Rudd herself sent to the prime minister setting out ""ambitious but deliverable"" deportation targets. Before entering politics, Ms Rudd had successful careers working in finance, journalism and executive recruitment - as well as somewhat incongruously being ""aristocracy consultant"" on the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral. She was married for five years to the late writer and Sunday Times columnist AA Gill, with whom she had two children. At a recent lunch for Westminster journalists, she responded to questions about her future leadership ambitions by saying that she merely ""wanted to stay in the game"". She will now have more time to ponder her own future in that game from the backbenches and also to reflect on the conventional wisdom in Westminster - seemingly dispelled by Mrs May - that the Home Office is the graveyard of many a political career.  The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948. It is regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration known as the ""Windrush generation"". Now, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it has emerged that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation and denied access to the NHS, benefits and pensions. READ: So who was on board the Windrush in 1948?"
risk appetite,Interest rate rise - views from Wales,2024-09-15,2017-11-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-41835132,"Interest rates have risen for the first time in more than 10 years. But what does it mean for savers and borrowers, home-owners and businesses in Wales?  We asked three financial and business experts from Wales. Julie-Ann Haines is chief customer officer with Principality Building Society and chair of UK Finance's Wales Mortgage Committee; Siobhan Thomas is director and pensions and investment specialist at Seer Green Financial Planning in Newport; Ben Cottam is head of external affairs at the Federation of Small Business in Wales. Why is this happening now? Julie-Ann Haines, chief customer officer at Principality Building Society: There have been movements in some of the key economic indicators monitored by the Bank of England, which have caused the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to act.  Inflation has jumped to 3%, while unemployment is at its lowest since 1975. This means there is the chance of wage inflation which so far hasn't risen above inflation levels. Mark Carney warned that he expects inflation to rise a little further so these ingredients mean the MPC estimates the slack in the economy has fallen sufficiently for them to tighten monetary policy. Ben Cottam, Federation of Small Business: The rates rise is widely attributed to increasing inflation, following the longest period in living memory without a rates rise. Siobhan Thomas, director of Seer Green Financial Planning, Newport: Inflation is driving the rate rise. Interest rates are used to control inflation, a rate increase will help slow inflation, which in recent months has been peaking.  What does it tell us about where the economy is now? Julie-Ann Haines: The UK Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) surveys suggest that the economy will continue to grow but below the traditional pace given the current higher levels of inflation. According to the latest ONS statistics, the economy grew by 0.4% in Q3. Weak economic growth reduces the chances of an interest rate rise but an improving picture makes it more likely.  Ben Cottam: At FSB, we appreciate the effort that the Bank of England has gone to in order to ensure that this rates rise is widely predicted by businesses across the UK. Small business owners consume media like everyone else, so many will have priced in an increase. Siobhan Thomas: Economically, we remain vulnerable with so much uncertainty around Brexit. The interest rate rise will help strengthen the pound, but it may stagnate growth in the economy.  The rise to 0.5% today is the first since July 2007, when the rate rose to 5.75%, before falling again a few months later. It also reverses the cut in August 2016 after the Referendum vote. But looking back at the Bank of England rates over 40 years, interest rates hit a peak of 17% in 1980. Will it encourage more people to save? Julie-Ann Haines: Savers will welcome a rate rise, although the effects are unlikely to be felt immediately.  Banks now make it easier for savers to compare and switch products, and these improvements will help customers shop around to find the best deals as commercial rates reflect the increase. These have been frustrating years for savers. But banks and building societies have simplified their product ranges and made it easier for people to find the right savings product for their needs - which is good news for customers. The electronic Cash ISA Transfer Service has helped to reduce switching times; interest rate disclosure on savings accounts has improved; and some providers have streamlined their savings ranges to help customers navigate the market. These market improvements will help customers shop around to find the best deal as interest rates rise. Cash savings accounts offer a range of interest rate options from instant access accounts paying variable interest to long-term fixed interest deposits. The Financial Conduct Authority's recent Retail Banking Review identified 117 providers offering 1,737 different savings products. These accounts include easy access savings accounts, fixed-term products and tax efficient ISAs.  Most accounts are easy access paying variable interest which have the potential to follow the base rate higher. Siobhan Thomas: Initially it will be a small rise so the rates for savers will continue to be pretty unattractive and will struggle to protect savers from inflation. Ben Cottam: For businesses, the key is having the confidence to invest and grow their business. Businesses want to feel resilient and sustainable. What's critical in achieving this, is that rates rise at a pace that small firms can handle.  We cannot have a surge - an increase must be given time to settle before further rises. Small firms have lots to worry about with rising input costs, business rate hikes, flagging consumer demand, late payments, and an uncertain economic outlook - the last thing they need now is borrowing costs increasing at a speed they can't absorb. Who might it hurt? Julie-Ann Haines: The majority of borrowers will be protected from any immediate effects of today's small increase because they have a fixed-rate mortgage.  Over the last year, two thirds of first-time buyers have opted to fix their rate for up to two years, with a further one in four opting to fix for two to five years. The impact on individual borrowers will vary depending on the loan size, length of term and the repayment method.  According to UK Finance, assuming a 25-year repayment mortgage loan, a 25-basis point rate rise from where current mortgage rates are would lead to an increase in monthly repayments of under £13, per £100,000 of debt. Mortgage holders on a 'base rate tracker' product will automatically move to the increased rate. If you have a 'variable' or 'discount' mortgage product, your mortgage payment is likely to go up in the near future. However, consumers who have opted to take out 'fixed' rate mortgage product over the past few years will not see an increase until the end of the fixed period.   Given that variable rate lenders assess the ability of applicants to pay at much higher interest rates, most should be able to cope with any increases as they filter down.   If anyone is unsure or concerned about how the Bank of England base rate change will impact their mortgage payment, we would initially recommend they check with their mortgage provider. If people's mortgage payment is going to increase, people could review their household expenditure to cut back on luxuries or unnecessary costs to offset the rise in mortgage payments. Siobhan Thomas: Borrowers - variable rate/tracker mortgage borrowers or those coming to the end of a fixed period will feel the effect of the rate rise, especially just before Christmas when spending spikes.  Ben Cottam: Firms in the tourism and manufacturing sector in Wales have benefited from a weak pound. A rate rise could dampen output in these sectors. We already have an issue with small business appetite for finance - only one in 10 is currently applying for external finance. A rate rise won't help with that, both in terms of increasing borrowing costs and exacerbating the perception that finance is hard to secure if you're a small business owner. What would you like to see happen next?  Siobhan Thomas: We would like to see the Bank of England raising interest rates at a slow and steady pace during the next few years. There are too many uncertainties for us economically and a quick successive rate rise would run the risk of restraining growth at a time when economic activity is not high. Ben Cottam: Awareness is critical - any firm that has set up in the last decade has only known rock bottom rates. Policymakers have a responsibility to inform small business owners and the self-employed about the implications of a rate increase. Small firms have lots to worry about with rising input costs, business rate hikes, flagging consumer demand, late payments, and an uncertain economic outlook - the last thing they need now is borrowing costs increasing at a speed they cannot absorb.  Also, it is important to remember that for the smallest businesses, personal and business finance is closely interlinked - if, for example, their mortgage and car leasing costs start to rise in a way they hadn't considered, that could impact the ability of some to create jobs and growth.

risk appetite,Hunt 'would give Johnson cabinet job',2024-09-15,2019-06-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48798355,"Jeremy Hunt says Boris Johnson should have a ""very big role"" in his future cabinet if he wins the Tory leadership contest - despite his competitor refusing to make the same offer.   The foreign secretary told a hustings in Exeter he would love Mr Johnson on board as he was an ""enormous talent"". But his rival told the event he was ""not making commitments to anybody"". Mr Johnson also denied reports that he had offered a job to Home Secretary Sajid Javid.  He told the hustings that, if he made any comments on his prospective cabinet, he would be seen as ""measuring the curtains"" for 10 Downing Street and there was ""still a long way to go"" in the contest.  The two contenders are taking part in 15 hustings across the country as Conservative Party members decide on their party's next leader - and the next UK prime minister.  The 160,000 members will begin voting next week and the winner is expected to be announced on 23 July.  The pair were quizzed by the audience on a number of issues, from Brexit and Russia, through to animal welfare and the sugar tax.  Asked by an audience member whether he would give Mr Johnson a role in his government, Mr Hunt made a joke that he could be his ""secretary of state for collective responsibility"".  But after his ""light-hearted dig"", he added: ""Of course I would love to have Boris in my cabinet.  ""Boris is someone of enormous talent. He has changed the course of our history through his leadership of the Leave campaign and he should always have a very big role in taking things forward."" Mr Hunt also said he would be happy to serve under Mr Johnson, adding: ""We are in an incredibly difficult situation and I think whoever doesn't win in this contest needs to put their shoulder to the wheel and serve loyally the winner, so that we can get through this, get to the other side and give the country all the exciting things we want to do."" But asked the same question, Mr Johnson said there was ""a wealth of talent on the Conservative benches"". Pushed by the hustings' host, LBC radio presenter Iain Dale, on the convention of giving a losing leadership opponent a cabinet position, Mr Johnson added: ""I have a very, very high regard for Jeremy.  ""It sounds to me eminently fair and logical, but I am not making commitments to anybody because you would not expect that.""  The pair also discussed a story in the Sun that claimed the government was looking to extend its ""sugar tax"" on soft drinks to milkshakes.  Mr Hunt said the the country needed to ""tackle the obesity crisis"", but the ""quickest way"" was to target manufacturers of unhealthy food to reduce the level of sugar.  ""You threaten them,"" he said. ""You say, we would be prepared to legislate if you don't play ball. ""But my experience is, if you make that threat, you don't actually need to follow through with the dreaded milkshake tax."" Mr Johnson mocked his own weight while answering the question, but said he was ""very, very reluctant to imposes taxes... that clobber those who can least afford it"". He added: ""What we should be doing, if you want kids to lose weight, is make the streets safe... encourage kids to walk and cycle to school, which will help them to lose weight as well, and generally take more exercise and be more active"".   And Mr Johnson was also asked about accusations in the Daily Mail that he called the French ""turds"" during the filming of a BBC One documentary about the Foreign Office.  The newspaper accused the BBC of cutting the clip from the programme - which aired last November - at the request of the Foreign Office, who worried the comment would make Anglo-French relations ""awkward"". Mr Johnson said he had ""no recollection of this comment"", adding: ""Perhaps what everyone will want to know is, can I get a fantastic deal for our country from our French friends, can we go forwards in a friendly, collegiate way, and yes, of course we can.""  A spokeswoman for the BBC said: ""The programme set out to reflect the realities of life inside the Foreign Office. The production team made judgments about what was in the programme and they are satisfied that the programme achieves its ambitions and has the content they wanted."" The Foreign Office declined to comment."
risk appetite,Blood scandal victims want more money,2024-09-15,2018-04-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-43898899,"Welsh victims of the infected blood scandal should get the same support payments as those in Scotland, the charity Haemophilia Wales has said. Chairwoman Lynne Kelly wants Welsh ministers to raise the annual payments for 60 people who contracted hepatitis C and HIV by thousands of pounds. The support payments in Scotland are as high as £37,000 a year in some cases. The Welsh Government said it would continue to work closely with Haemophilia Wales on the matter. At least 2,400 people died in the UK after they were given blood products from overseas infected with hepatitis C and HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. Much of the blood came from donors such as prison inmates in the United States, who had sold their blood. About 70 of those who died were Welsh. Jennifer Hutchinson contracted Hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood and plasma following an operation in the late 1970s. For more than 20 years she was unaware she had the virus until falling ill while on holiday in 2005 with her husband Norman. Since then, her husband has been her full time carer.  Mr Hutchinson said: ""The toll on Jennifer has been horrendous. And the plans that we had for our retirement have had to fall by the wayside.  ""Jennifer depends on me not just practically but also financially - and she wouldn't be able to live without me.  ""We have been lucky in the sense that we are retired - there are people out there who cannot get a mortgage or even holiday insurance. ""People who are seriously ill through no fault of their own are having to scrape by on what essentially is sick pay. Being seriously ill is hard enough - without having financial worries on top of that. ""These are not scroungers, they are victims of a scandal."" Haemophilia Wales calculates the total annual cost would be under £1m for the Welsh Government to match the Scottish Governments' payments in 2018-19. Lynne Kelly said the situation in Wales needed to change. ""In Wales we feel that we are now at a disadvantage for the people who are living with both HIV and hepatitis C,"" she said. ""For co-infected hepatitis C people we are asking for their payments to go up, if they are at stage 2 which means that they have already got cirrhosis of the liver, their payment needs to go up from £17,500 a year to £27,000 in line with Scotland."" Haemophilia Wales is also asking Welsh ministers to increase payments to people with HIV and hepatitis C from £21,500 or £34,500, depending on their condition, to £37,000 as is paid in Scotland. Those calls have also been echoed by victims of contaminated blood and their families. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We are aware of arrangements in other countries and will continue to work closely with Haemophilia Wales and others to develop our support for those affected in Wales.""

risk appetite,Runny eggs 'safe for pregnant women',2024-09-15,2017-10-10,By Dominic Hughes,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-41568998,"""Lion mark"" eggs have been declared safe for pregnant women and young children, nearly 30 years after a salmonella scare. Vulnerable groups had been advised not to eat raw, soft boiled or runny eggs. The Food Standards Agency says ""Lion Mark"" eggs, which include almost all of the eggs produced in the UK, are virtually free of salmonella.  The new advice comes after a vaccination programme, and improvements to animal welfare. In 1988, a scare over the presence of salmonella in eggs caused a dramatic collapse in sales of eggs and a series of warnings for vulnerable groups to avoid eating them if they were raw or runny.  The then junior Conservative health minister, Edwina Currie, declared: ""Most of the egg production in this country, sadly, is now affected with salmonella."" Salmonella bacteria can cause food poisoning. Mrs Currie's statement wildly overstated the danger and eventually led to her resignation. But there was a problem with salmonella in eggs and by the 1990s producers started a vaccination programme. The ""British Lion Mark"", printed on eggs in red ink, was introduced so that eggs could be traced back to the farm of origin and to show best-before dates.  Almost 30 years on from the initial scare, the Food Standards Agency's Heather Hancock, says runny eggs can now be eaten by everyone.  ""We are now saying if there is a British Lion egg, you're safe to do that. ""The risk of salmonella is now so low you needn't worry. ""And that's true whether you're a fit healthy adult, or whether you're pregnant or elderly or young. ""It's only people on strictly medically supervised diets who need to avoid those eggs."" The British appetite for eggs has been growing in recent years. Last year British hens laid 10,372 million eggs, while on average we consume more than 34.5 million eggs every day. And eggs are very good for you, packed full of vitamin D, protein and valuable omega-3 fatty acids. Mother of two Catherine Millington is a big fan, with eggs providing quick, cheap and nutritious meals for her two daughters, who are aged nearly 4 years old and 7 months.  ""Eggs are brilliant because you can boil them, break them into bits, and the baby can handle them so we can do baby-led weaning with it. ""And when you're in a rush, they're dead easy."" Just outside Penrith on the edge of the Lake District is The Lakes Free Range Egg Company. Egg farmer David Brass says the introduction of the British Lion standard has made all the difference. ""We know from back in the '80s when all the scare started, there was an issue with eggs. ""But what the Lion standard does, it is a fully independent, audited code of practice to make sure we have standards on the farm that make sure we can't have any of those disease problems again.  ""And it has shown time after time, in those intervening years, that it is just a brilliant food safety code."" Over the summer, millions of eggs were pulled from supermarket shelves in more than a dozen European countries - including the UK - after it was discovered some had been contaminated with a potentially harmful insecticide at Dutch farms.  British eggs were not affected. "
risk appetite,Hepatitis A 'outbreak' at school,2024-09-15,2019-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-48704125,"Eight individuals at a school in North Yorkshire have been treated for Hepatitis A, Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed. PHE did not confirm whether the cases involved staff, pupils, or both though the school - Outwoods Academy, Ripon - said two staff members were affected. All those affected were being treated and any health risk was low, said PHE. Hepatitis A is a viral infection which affects the liver and is different to Hepatitis B and C. In a letter to parents on Wednesday, the school, which has about 650 pupils aged 11 to 18, said two members of staff had Hepatitis A. It added that PHE was investigating other reported cases of illness. Source NHS England: Hepatitis A Dr Simon Padfield, consultant in communicable disease control at PHE Yorkshire and the Humber, said: ""Parents of pupils at the school, and staff members, have been informed about the cases and reassured that any health risk is low. ""Hepatitis A is usually a mild illness, though it can be more serious in adults, if left untreated. ""Children often don't show any symptoms, though they can pass on the infection to others."" He said families and staff had been provided with information about the signs and symptoms of the infection and had been asked to follow ""strict hand hygiene measures.""

risk appetite,Appetite drug could mark 'new era' in obesity,2024-09-15,2021-02-11,By James Gallagher,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56011979,"A drug that suppresses appetite has led to some people losing more than a fifth of their body weight, a major international trial shows.  A weekly injection of the drug, semaglutide, was given alongside advice on diet and fitness.  The study, conducted on almost 2,000 people, showed an average 15kg weight loss during the 15-month trial.  Scientists said the results could mark a ""new era"" in treating obesity with even more therapies on the horizon.  Jan, from Kent, lost 28kg (four stone), equivalent to more than a fifth of her body weight.  ""The drug changed my life and completely altered my approach to food,"" she said. She said dieting had made her ""miserable"" but taking the drug was completely different as she was less hungry.  However, now Jan has come off the trial her appetite has returned and she is putting weight back on. She said: ""It felt effortless losing weight while on the trial, but now it has gone back to feeling like a constant battle with food.""  Semaglutide will already be familiar to some people who use it as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, but this trial looked at giving it at higher doses.  The drug works by hijacking the body's appetite levels and mimicking a hormone - called GLP1 - that is released after eating a filling meal.  The trial gave some people the drug and others a dummy injection, while both groups were given the lifestyle advice.  The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed people lost an average of 15kg on semaglutide compared with 2.6kg without. However, 32% of people lost a fifth of their body weight with the drug, compared with fewer than 2% on the dummy treatment. Prof Rachel Batterham, from UCL and one of the UK researchers, told the BBC News website: ""This is a game-changer in the amount of weight loss it causes. ""I have spent the last 20 years doing obesity research, up until now we've not had an effective treatment for obesity apart from bariatric surgery."" She said losing weight would reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and of severe Covid-19. Semaglutide is being submitted to drugs regulators so cannot be routinely prescribed. However, Prof Batterham expects the drug would be used initially by specialist weight loss clinics rather than being widely available.  There were side-effects to the treatment including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation. And there are five-year studies taking place to see if weight loss can be sustained in the long term.  Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""The amount of weight loss achieved is greater than that seen with any licensed anti-obesity drug. ""This is the start of a new era for obesity drug development with the future direction being to achieve levels of weight loss comparable to semaglutide, while having fewer side-effects."" Dr Duane Mellor, a dietitian and from Aston Medical School, said: ""It is useful to have a potential option to help people lose weight, however we need to acknowledge that weight loss will still need lifestyle change, and that any medication or change in lifestyle can bring potential risks and side-effects.   ""So, it is always wise to speak to a health professional before trying to lose weight."" Follow James on Twitter"
risk appetite,Irish League behind closed doors unlikely,2024-09-15,2020-05-18,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/52716838,"Tipton's Portadown hold a six point lead at the top of the Championship Portadown manager Matthew Tipton has warned there will be little appetite for Irish League football if fans are not allowed inside the grounds. The Irish FA is to request an extension for the 2019-20 season, which has been suspended since mid-March. ""Everybody knows that while we haven't been given a set date in Northern Ireland, we aren't going to be playing any contact sport before the end of August or early September, and that's us being very optimistic,"" Tipton told Sportsound Extra Time. ""I don't think there would be very much will for Irish League clubs to play behind closed doors purely because we wouldn't be able to finance it in terms of players' wages and referees."" Tipton's Portadown hold a six point lead at the top of the Championship, however concerns are mounting that the season will not have time to finish before the scheduled start of the 2020-21 campaign in August. 'Self-interest must be put to one side' - Larne owner Kenny Bruce calls for united approach to NI football's return Northern Ireland Football League to seek extension of 2019-20 season The German Bundesliga was the first major league to return to action with no fans present last weekend, however Tipton says arrangements made in professional leagues offer little insight into problems facing Irish League clubs. ""Our players are part-time, they work and have other commitments,"" said the former Warrenpoint Town boss. ""How could I ask a player to put himself at risk playing a game of football yet he's not allowed to do his normal day to day job? ""We're that desperate to get a game of football played people are kind of thinking 'right, we'll just get a game played and it'll all be ok', ""We have to realise we're in the biggest crisis certainly of my lifetime."" Coleraine and Linfield were vying for the Premiership title when the season was halted in March Tipton also revealed that he had heard nothing from the footballing authorities with regards to a plan moving forward, adding that the rapidly changing situation makes it difficult for such plans to be formulated. ""I haven't had a phone call, email or message from any of the governing bodies,"" he said. ""I'm not having a go about that but I have to be honest. I take my guidance from what I see in the daily news briefings like everybody else in the country. ""The landscape is changing daily, we don't know what's going to happen down the line so there's no point planning for that. ""I feel sorry for NIFL and the IFA because I know they're working hard at it, but certainly if they came out and gave us a call today, that (information) could change tomorrow."""
risk appetite,Becca Cosmetics: Why Covid is bad news for make-up,2024-09-15,2021-03-01,By Annabel Rackham,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-56215557,"Are your make-up brushes laying unused in a corner? Is your favourite eye shadow palette gathering dust in a drawer? There's certainly not much appetite for going full glam at the moment - and it's having a major effect on the beauty industry.  We've already seen what the pandemic has done to fashion retail - with several shops disappearing from our high streets forever.  Now Becca Cosmetics has become the first major beauty casualty of the pandemic, with the Australian company announcing it is shutting down after 20 years. A statement on its website said: ""At Becca, an accumulation of challenges, together with the global impact of Covid-19, has sadly been more than our business can withstand, and we have had to make the heartbreaking decision to close down the Becca brand at the end of September 2021."" Founded by make-up artist Rebecca Morrice Williams in Perth, since 2001 it has been a huge name in luxury beauty with thousands of counters across the world. It's owned by huge beauty conglomerate Estee Lauder, which owns other companies including Bobbi Brown, MAC and Jo Malone. Over the years, it's collaborated with the likes of Chrissy Teigen, Khloe Kardashian and YouTuber Jaclyn Hill. ""I was so gutted for the brand and everyone that works there,"" says beauty influencer Amelia Liana. ""I really didn't think that Becca would be one of the brands affected, they have such a loyal following, they're huge on Instagram and they're in all the major retailers,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Polly Marchant, a make-up artist and beauty brand owner, says she was ""shocked and sad"". ""Not only are the small businesses having to close, but these huge global brands,"" she says. ""I just assumed where they're so big and have so many amazing brand ambassadors, they'd be fine and maybe their sales wouldn't have been as great, but nowhere near bad enough to have to close."" Amelia and Polly have over a million Instagram followers between them and have noticed a big change in what content their fans are now interested in. ""All my audience want to see me doing is my skincare routine - like Sunday pamper routines and what face masks I'm using,"" Amelia says. ""Everyone is taking time to look after themselves a bit more and skincare is quite meditative - my audience feel the same. ""Brands have been readjusting their plans - Charlotte Tilbury for example brought her skincare launches forward a couple of months and postponed her beauty launches until August because she saw how much people were interested in skincare."" ""Skincare has become the new make-up,"" Polly adds. ""People really have time to invest in their skincare regimes now and everyone is looking after their skin that little bit more - luxury make-up is just not in the priority list of things to buy anymore."" Not only are we staying in more at the moment, but when we are going out we're having to wear masks a lot of the time - which also reduces the need for make-up in everyday situations. ""You're not going to be whacking on a couple of layers of foundations and loads of skin make-up to then put a mask on - it will all come off and then there's the risk of breaking out,"" Polly says. ""I've gotten so used to wearing minimal make-up,"" Amelia adds, saying that she used to wear a full smoky eye every day, but now goes for a more natural look. ""I think that look will probably hang around for a little bit longer, especially with masks. ""Getting your make-up all over a mask and lines all over your foundation - it's very annoying!"" Lipstick has always been seen as recession proof - it's fairly cheap to buy a lipstick even from a luxury brand and has historically still sold in the hardest of circumstances. Amelia, who is a brand ambassador for Dior make-up, says the success of a new lipstick they launched in January was ""unexpected"". ""It shows there is definitely still a want and a need for make-up products,"" she says. Polly isn't so sure - and says sales of her own brand has reduced so much that she can't currently afford to release a new collection. ""Last March, I would do a swipe-up link or suggest a new product and people would go mental - they were so interested in buying new products,"" she says. ""Since then it's really slowed down and I can see it in my own sales - people don't have the funds to be splashing out on make-up."" ""But hopefully once things go back to normal I can bring out some more products, but in the meantime I genuinely don't have the money to invest,"" Polly adds.  And with coronavirus restrictions set to ease off, Amelia is hopeful people will learn to fall in love with make-up again. ""I think they'll definitely be a shift in priorities that will be taken forward into summer as we've got much more used to wearing minimal make-up. ""But, we'll hopefully have our summer and enjoy looking glam again.""  Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

risk appetite,Financial sharks circling Metro Bank,2024-09-15,2019-03-19,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47609539,"Although Metro Bank recently came top of a consumer satisfaction league table, financial sharks are circling the challenger bank.  Metro Bank is now the second most shorted company on the UK stock market.  That means a lot of financial firms are betting the bank's shares will continue to fall - despite having already lost 80% of their value in the last 12 months.  Ever since Metro Bank revealed it had made an error in calculating how much shock absorbing capital it was holding, there have been some serious questions in the minds of regulators about the bank's operating competence and in the minds of investors about its basic business model.  So what's been going on? Earlier this year the financial regulator, the PRA, raised concerns with the bank about inconsistencies in the reports it was submitting.  It soon emerged that the bank had miscalculated the capital it needed to support some of its commercial lending. The news sent the bank's shares down nearly 40% in one day as the bank said it would need to raise more capital by selling new shares. Miscalculating the amount of capital you have or need to support your lending is one of the most fundamental mistakes a bank can make.  The bank's capital is a financial cushion to make sure that depositors' money is safe even if some of the borrowers can't pay back their loans.  One banking veteran told the BBC that it was ""staggering, beggared belief"" that a bank could get such a basic thing so wrong. ""Operating with insufficient capital is the cardinal sin that brought us the financial crisis"".  Metro Bank is clear that it had sufficient capital to support its current lending but analysts told the BBC that future growth plans also need to be supported as it planned to grow faster than it could earn additional money to support future lending. The amount of capital a bank needs is calculated by adding together three elements - or pillars - as they are known.  Pillar one is the basic minimum capital calculation based on how much lending you have done and in which markets - the more you do, the riskier the types of loans - the more you need.  Pillar two is the regulators assessment of bank specific risk. It's a qualitative measure that looks at the bank's size, maturity and operating history.  Pillar three is the amount you need to support future growth.  This is an important one for Metro which was trying to grow at 30% per year - which would require more additional capital than the bank could earn along the way. Well, those plans have changed. As Metro Bank licks its wounds after an embarrassing mistake, it has had to scale down its ambitions.  It is now targeting growth of 20% rather than 30% - and that looks ambitious given the bank will be spending a considerable amount of money and management time dealing with two regulatory probes from the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.  So far - no heads have rolled as a result of the capital blunder. The chief executive Craig Donaldson offered to resign but the board did not accept it.  Sources at the company told the BBC there was no appetite for ""a witch hunt"" but investors and regulators may need some blood on the carpet to satisfy them.  If the chief executive stays, the focus then shifts to the board and here is another area where investors are concerned that Metro Bank is falling short of the standards required of a bank.  The chairman and founder Vernon Hill is an engaging and charismatic figure whose mould breaking approach to banking was seen by many as a breath of fresh air.  I was present at the launch of the first UK Metro Bank in Holborn, London nearly 10 years ago. There was razzmatazz, balloons, bands, Saturday, Sunday and Bank holiday opening hours and dog bowls and biscuits - thanks to the influence of Vernon Hill's wife Shirley and her ever present companion Duffy the Yorkshire Terrier.  So what? Just what the High Street needs - a bank that's open when you want it to be with a sense of fun about it.  Customers liked it. What investors were unsure about was the £21m Metro Bank paid to Shirley Hill's company InterArch for its design work.  Royal London Asset Management and Glass Lewis - a firm that advises shareholders how to vote - both described the relationship as ""inappropriate"" and voted against Vernon Hill's re-election as chairman. They were convincingly outvoted.  Many of the board have been there a long time - a practice that is increasingly frowned upon as it can foster cosy relationships between the board and the management - leading to insufficient challenge and scrutiny.  Six of its nine non-executive directors have been on the board almost since day one - nine years ago - coincidentally the maximum recommended term for a director under the company governance code.  Even if, as seems likely, there is a boardroom clear out, doubts still remain in the minds of some about the underlying business model.  After all, Metro Bank is trying to do the exact opposite of what many other banks are doing.  It is growing its network of branches while others are shrinking theirs. It is opening in the most expensive locations in the towns and cities it operates in. Its branches are open Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays. Sometimes doing something counter-intuitive or a bit different is good. Sometimes there is a reason that no-one else is doing it. For many investors, it's a case of the latter.  One former shareholder said there were two important reasons why. First, this Metro Bank model ""will only ever appeal to a subset of customers - it is never going to be the same scale as even a TSB let alone a Lloyds and that matters because you can't get the cost as percentage of your revenue down without scale. It will always be a more expensive business and therefore lower returning business to own"".   Second, the rate of growth they are targeting means that for the next few years you are paying to own this company rather than being paid.  The bank will continue to need more capital put in by shareholders and that is a gamble for a niche bank that is expensive to run.  The chief executive Craig Donaldson insists that comparisons with the rest of the industry tell a misleading story.  ""You have to remember that RBS is coming down from over 2,000 branches, we are heading up from the current 66 to a target of 200. That is the size of business we are targeting."" As mentioned already, Metro Bank has proved popular with customers and has shown impressive growth with minimal advertising. To be clear there is no suggestion that customer deposits are at any risk.  But the model is not winning the popularity contest with investors - its shares have fallen nearly 80% and some heavyweight financial gamblers are betting heavily on it falling further.  In the final analysis, no amount of razzmatazz and dog biscuits can take investors eyes off the financial ball and right now it is a long way from being in the back of the net.  One to watch. "
risk appetite,Council declares itself bust after failed investing,2024-09-15,2022-12-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-64028633,"A Conservative-run council with a £469m funding black hole has declared itself in financial distress and barred itself from making any non-essential spending. The acting director of finance at Thurrock Council in Essex has issued a section 114 notice. It means a local authority is in financial distress, cannot balance its budget and is effectively bankrupt. The council, which has seen resignations at the top, said it was seeking financial help from government. ""Today is a very worrying day but I see this as the start of our recovery,"" said the council's Conservative leader Mark Coxshall. ""Now we must look forward at how we can make a bright future for Thurrock. ""I am absolutely determined to make that happen with tough decisions and working with all our council's staff to do the right thing to get this council back on its feet."" Over the course of several years, Thurrock Council provided £655m to companies via bonds which included the purchasing of 53 solar farms. Evidence obtained by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), and seen by the BBC, revealed that, in March 2018, financial advisors wrote to the council's former corporate director of resources to express concern about the authority's ""extreme"" appetite for risk. The council paused its investment policy in September 2020, and two years later, the government said it was intervening because of the ""serious financial situation"" and it appointed neighbouring Essex County Council as ""commissioner"" for Thurrock, which meant it oversaw any new spending. At the time, council leader Rob Gledhill resigned, saying ""the political buck stops with me"". The local authority's chief executive Lyn Carpenter, who had been on extended leave since the government intervention, announced her resignation last week. by Simon Dedman, BBC Essex political correspondent Issuing the S114 notice formalises what we know - that Thurrock Council is in a perilous position financially. It is part of the process of asking the government for financial support to get itself out of a huge £469m budgetary hole this year. Things like cleaning streets, collecting rubbish and providing social services will still be carried out because they are among the services that Thurrock has a statutory obligation to provide. There can be no spending on, say, a brand new playground. Thurrock is going to have to accelerate looking at selling off assets, like land, housing and its theatre, which comedian Russell Brand recently spoke out in support of saving. The council's financial shortfall is one of the largest ever reported by a UK local authority. Croydon, Slough and Northamptonshire have also issued section 114 notices in recent years. John Kent, the former leader of the council and current leader of the opposition Labour group, said staff would be fearing for their jobs and vulnerable people fearing for the ""services they rely on"". ""This disaster has been made and delivered by Thurrock Conservatives and it's high time they accept responsibility for their actions and resign,"" he said. Mr Coxshall however said ""residents and staff should feel safe"" knowing that essential services such as street lighting, road gritting and social care would continue.

risk appetite,The Texas Chinese bitcoin gold rush,2024-09-15,2021-09-03,By Zhaoyin Feng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58414555,"China's ban on cryptocurrency mining has forced bitcoin entrepreneurs to flee overseas. Many are heading to Texas, which is quickly becoming the next global cryptocurrency capital.  When China announced a crackdown on bitcoin mining and trading in May, Kevin Pan, CEO of Chinese cryptocurrency mining company Poolin, got on a flight the next day to leave the country.  ""We decided to move out, once [and] for all. [We'll] never come back again,"" Mr Pan told the BBC.  Headquartered in Hong Kong, Poolin is the second largest bitcoin mining network in the world, with most of its operations in mainland China. The country was home to around 70% of global bitcoin mining power, until the clampdown sent the price of bitcoin into a tailspin and caught miners off guard.  Now China's ""bitcoin refugees"" are urgently scrambling to find a new home, whether in neighbouring Kazakhstan, Russia or North America, because for bitcoin miners, time is literally money. ""We had to find a new location for the [bitcoin mining] machines,"" Poolin's vice-president Alejandro De La Torres said. ""Because every minute that the machine is not on, it's not making money."" In what some call the ""Great Mining Migration,"" the Poolin executives are among the many bitcoin miners who have recently landed in a place reputed as part of America's wild wild west: Austin, Texas. Bitcoins are a digital currency with no physical form - they exist and are exchanged only online. They are created when a computer 'mines' the money by solving a complex set of maths problems and that is how bitcoin 'miners' who run the computers earn the currency.  This takes a lot of energy.  As a new form of money that transcends national boundaries, there is also much confusion and potential to run afoul of government rules - so two things bitcoin entrepreneurs value are cheap electricity and a relaxed regulatory environment. The Lone Star State fits the bill to a tee. For Mr Pan, Texas felt like home almost instantly. Days after his arrival, he was gifted an AR-15 rifle, which he says he may use to ""hunt hogs from a helicopter"" one day.  While the shooting ranges and Texas barbeque provide for welcome entertainment, legal protection for business is the major attraction for the bitcoin miners. ""What happened to us in China won't happen in the US,"" Mr De La Torre says. Governor of Texas Greg Abbott has been a vocal supporter for cryptocurrency. ""It's happening! Texas will be the crypto leader,"" he tweeted in June. In the same month, the Lone Star State became the second US state after Wyoming to recognise blockchain and cryptocurrency in its commercial law, paving the way for crypto businesses to operate in the state.  Many Chinese bitcoin companies have looked to Texas for stability and opportunity. Shenzhen-based firm BIT Mining has planned to invest $26 million to build a data centre in the state, while Beijing-based Bitmain is expanding its facility in Rockdale, Texas. This small town with around 5,600 residents once housed one of the world's largest aluminium plants, and now it's emerging as the next global hub for bitcoin mining. There might be another underlying connection between the industry and the state, as De La Torre says that bitcoiners and Texans share the same values.  ""Texans take their freedom and rights very seriously, and so do we bitcoiners.""   Experts believe China's bitcoin crackdown was motivated by having greater control over the financial markets, and it may become a boon for America.  ""The migration benefits the US in terms of talent acquisition and furthering the innovation ecosystem,"" says Kevin Desouza, a business professor at the Queensland University of Technology who has done research on China's digital currency policy. In return, the bitcoin miners get access to a thriving and innovative community, as well as more diverse sources of capital, according to Prof Desouza.  Other than a stable regulatory environment, the energy-hungry industry is hunting for cheap electricity in Texas.  Texas has some of the cheapest energy prices in the world, due to its deregulated power grid. Consumers enjoy more choices of electricity providers, which encourage providers to lower prices to stay competitive. During peaks of electricity demand, bitcoin farms can even sell unused power back to the grid. Although El Salvador is set to become the first country to adopt bitcoin as a national currency, bitcoin miners prefer the US because of its well-developed electrical infrastructure, says Mr De La Torre. But some analysts warn that the ""Great Mining Migration"" may lead to serious repercussions, as cities and towns struggle to meet the huge energy appetite.  In February, blackouts following a deadly snowstorm left millions of homes and businesses in Texas without power for days. More than 200 people died. During the power outage, bitcoin farms were compensated to stay offline.  The increased scrutiny of Chinese companies in America may also lead to more attention on these mining newcomers. Texas recently passed a law that prevents ""hostile foreign actors"" from accessing critical infrastructure, including its power grid. The new law was reportedly prompted by a Chinese billionaire's plan to build a wind farm in southwest Texas. Critics allege that the project could be used to hack into the Texas energy grid and to gather intelligence from a nearby US military base. Prof Desouza says that while access to electricity grids is unlikely to be an issue for bitcoin miners in the short term, political risk will continue to evolve.  The bitcoin miners do miss something in China - cheap labour cost and speedy construction. According to Mr Pan, while a new bitcoin farm takes up to five months to build in China, it could take as long as 18 months in Texas. Global shipping prices have also skyrocketed during the pandemic, making it significantly more expensive to ship mining machines from China to the US. Despite the costly and time-consuming efforts, Mr Pan says his company is committed to settle in Texas, ""It's a free land, and a lot of bitcoiners are here,"" he says, ""so we feel: 'whoa, family reunion.'"""

risk appetite,Living with obesity: Hard-wired to store fat,2024-09-15,2021-06-17,By Claire Kendall and Jeremy Cooke,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57419041,"Specialist health professionals say it is time for obesity to be regarded as an illness caused by genetics, biology and how we live today. New research adds to growing scientific opinion that ""healthy obesity"" does not exist. The findings show those who are significantly overweight have a 66% higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, compared with those of a normal weight. Many people with obesity say not only do they have to live with prejudice and stigma, but they struggle to find treatment. Sarah has lived with obesity her entire adult life. The 39-year-old mum has a Body Mass Index, or BMI, of over 40, which means she is medically classified as having ""severe obesity"" and is overweight enough for her health to be at risk. ""People think you're unintelligent, that you're lazy, that you eat too much, that you've done this to yourself. That it's a choice,"" she says. ""I just want to scream and say none of those things are right."" Sarah has spent most of her life trying to control her weight through diet and exercise, and says her obesity is something that she thinks about every day.  Growing up in Jersey, in the Channel Islands, Sarah was a ""normal-sized"" girl, until the end of primary school when she began to develop before some of the other girls in her class. By the time she went to an all-girls secondary school, the changes of puberty meant she started to feel different from many of her friends.  In her early teens, she was aware her mum had regularly struggled with her own weight and had tried lots of diets, so as Sarah's weight increased, she did the same.  At 16, she decided to go on an 800-calorie-a-day milkshake diet. Over the summer before starting her A-levels, she says she dropped from a size 14 to a size 10. At the time, it made her feel ""brilliant"". But, in hindsight, she realises this was the start of years and years of yo-yo dieting.  Sarah was around a size 12 when she started university. But when she graduated three years later, she had grown to a size 20. The student lifestyle - drinking and eating late - meant she couldn't keep on top of her weight.  But unlike when she was 16, this time diets weren't working. It was the start of a struggle to regulate her weight. Scientists have found that people's genetic background means their weight changes differently, even if they eat the same amount of calories. After university, Sarah started working in the pharmaceutical industry. She was performing well as a sales person, selling a diabetes drug. But she was taken aback after her boss told her that when he first met her he remembers thinking, ""You better be a bloody good sales rep, looking the way you do, trying to sell a diabetes drug"". Sarah now says it should be against the law to make comments about body shape and size. By the time she was 30, Sarah had severe obesity and was desperate to do something about it for the sake of her mental and physical health. She embarked on a year-long project with a personal trainer and completed an Olympic-class triathlon - swimming 1.5km, cycling 40km and running 10km. She also lost eight-and-a-half stone (55kg). Around this time, she had some tests which looked at her genetic make-up. The results found two important things:  Shaw Somers, a consultant surgeon who specialises in weight-loss operations, has been treating people with severe obesity for many years. He says people like Sarah, who have an inherited set of certain genes, are much more likely to develop obesity compared with those who don't.  But obesity is not just about genetics, he says. It is also about psychology, inequalities and the food environment we all live with. Historically, he says, people with these genetics would have done well in a famine, but with today's plentiful, high-calorie food they will put on weight ""without strong determination and support"". Dr Denise Ratcliffe, a clinical psychologist who supports patients through bariatric surgery, says people's past experiences can come into play. She says that many of the people she sees, have experienced trauma, abuse or neglect, for example, which leads to a dysfunctional relationship with food. ""I think there's something about the psychological experiences people have, and the relationships that they start to form with foods, that becomes almost like a perfect storm.""   Both the genetic and psychological components of obesity can be amplified when there is easy access to fatty, sugar-laden foods, which are available cheaply and conveniently.  Sarah's friend Jed has lived on an estate in Hull all his life. He lives with obesity, and thinks areas like his can have a big effect on the health of those living there. Across the road from his house, he remembers the parade of shops once having a greengrocer's and a butcher's - now eight of the 20 shops are fast-food outlets. ""We've got a chicken place, we've got a burger place, we have got a fish shop, we've got a kebab shop, another kebab place, another chip shop, and a Chinese,"" he says. Jed says that he recently signed a petition to try to prevent another takeaway from opening.  ""If you look at any area in your city, which is at a low level of socio-economic standing, I guarantee there's going to be more takeaways. We don't need to kick areas like this down. We need to lift them up."" After training for the triathlon and losing eight-and-a-half stone, Sarah continued to train regularly and eat well. But she noticed that gradually she started to become heavier. Whatever she did, it made no difference.  Dr Abd Tahrani, a senior lecturer in obesity medicine at the University of Birmingham, says there are a lot of people who are ""biologically pre-designed to conserve energy"", which is stored as fat. He explains that signals from the hypothalamus - the part of the brain that controls appetite - bombard the person with feelings of hunger and a desire to eat, that are almost impossible to fight.  So even if the person successfully loses several stone by dieting, their body remembers its baseline weight and strives to return to it. Studies from GP records in the UK showed that the annual chance of achieving normal weight in people with morbid obesity is one-in-700 to one-in-1,000. As Sarah started to research obesity, she realised that after a lifetime of blaming herself, she understood that it was actually her body ""working against her"".  New research from a team made up of specialists from the University of Birmingham, the University Hospitals of Birmingham, and Warwick Medical School, has found that people living with obesity have a 66% higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease than those with normal body weight. This is the case, even if they have no underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.  The work has just been published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease and involved studying 4.5 million patient records from GPs in the UK over 20 years.  This adds to a growing body of scientific research which has found that ""healthy obesity does not exist"", says Professor Indranil Dasgupta, consultant nephrologist at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, and senior author of the research paper. Previous studies from the same team found those living with obesity without any other health conditions also have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Obesity in the UK Many professionals with an understanding of obesity believe there needs to be a huge shift within the medical profession, and society as a whole, in how the condition is viewed.  ""Public perception hasn't quite understood that it's a real illness,"" says bariatric weight loss surgeon Shaw Somers. ""With each passing year that we fail to get on board with managing the obesity epidemic, it gets exponentially worse. Unless we start to take this issue seriously, it will totally undermine the NHS' ability to cope in the near future."" There also needs to be a big change in the understanding of treatment, according to Mr Somers. Too many weight management programmes for those living with obesity begin with ""moving more and eating less"", which in reality is a prevention for obesity, not a cure.   ""The number of people I've encountered in my 30-year career who've been able to go from morbid obesity, to normal weight, and sustain it by dieting alone - well I don't think I've ever met one. It's so hard to do."" Evidence suggests that people like Sarah, whose bodies are hard-wired to put on and retain fat, may put in all the work, and still not get the result they badly want. This can be a huge mental strain. ""I went through some really dark times, because I felt like a failure,"" says Sarah. Psychologist Dr Denise Ratcliffe says that many people accept the narrative that they are to blame for their obesity. That, and the harsh judgement of society, can lead to a situation where mental anguish and physical weight-gain feed off each other. ""Obesity is a cause of mental health problems. So if you've got mental health problems, you're more likely to have obesity. But if you're obese, that also creates mental health difficulties."" The NHS has a four-tier recommended treatment process for obesity. Tier 1 promotes healthy eating and active lifestyles, while Tier 2 is usually funding for slimming clubs. Both these tiers are normally paid for by the local authority. Tier 3 treatment is offered by the NHS. Health professionals can give medication, help with lifestyle behaviours and preparation for Tier 4 treatment, where patients are supported through bariatric weight-loss surgery.  But, as Sarah found when she previously sought help from her GP, to be told there was no provision for her, treatment is not available in all areas of the UK. ""There is a postcode-related issue here where some people will not have services available. Ultimately it means there's no support for them,"" says Stuart Flint, a director of Obesity UK, and associate professor in psychology at the University of Leeds. Sarah has decided she doesn't want bariatric surgery. She feels that if she were to go ahead with the major operation only to find she regained some weight in the future, she would find it too difficult to deal with mentally.  The NHS says bariatric surgery can achieve dramatic weight loss. Although patients need to make permanent lifestyle changes after surgery to avoid putting weight back on, it can also lead to hormone changes that can reduce appetite. And the evidence for cost-effectiveness and health improvement are clear, from many studies around the world. Around 6,000 people each year in England go ahead with an operation to help reduce their weight and improve their health dramatically.  Compared with other European countries, England has one the highest rates of adult obesity and one of the lowest rates of spending per capita on this kind of surgery.  The most common types are: The government says it has launched a strategy to tackle obesity. It plans to increase weight management services so that more people get NHS support to lose weight. It is also going to legislate to end the promotion of foods high in fat, sugar and salt. NHS England says it is focusing on support for those who live with obesity and have other health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Shaw Somers carries out weight loss operations at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, and privately in London for patients without Tier 4 services in their area, and who have had to fund the operation themselves.  ""Many people who struggle with severe obesity have a number of underlying illnesses, which are all harder to treat because of their obesity,"" he says. ""They get stuck in a vicious cycle, where their illness makes them more likely to put on weight and the weight makes their illness worse.""  One of his most recent operations was on a patient with chronic kidney disease. He explains that the surgery wasn't just to improve his life, it was to save the man's life. At the obesity clinic in Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, Mr Somers is joined by other specialists - a dietician, a psychologist, nurses, and an anaesthetist. They offer extensive pre- and post-operative care. All of his patients have been through Tier 3 of NHS treatment, as well as years of failed dieting, mental health anguish or illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure that many obese patients suffer.   For Sarah, her hope now lies with medical science. Research into drugs that suppress the appetite, like Saxenda and Semaglutide, are making strides forward, according to Dr Abd Tahrani.  There's also research into a drug for those, like Sarah, who have a mutation of the MC4 receptor. Dr Tahrani says that Semaglutide was approved in the US very recently, and could lead to 15-to-17% weight loss. In the future, he expects to see drugs that could result in 20-to-25% weight loss, which is the same outcome as bariatric surgery.   One in four adults in the UK live with obesity, and the condition can touch almost every area of their lives.  The Department of Health and Social Care described it as ""one of the most significant challenges we face today"". It said: ""Losing weight is not easy and our world-leading obesity strategy lays out extensive action to empower people to make more informed decisions and achieve a healthier weight.""  Sarah is concentrating on staying as healthy as she can, and is determined to make the best of the life she has. She is a successful professional living in a beautiful Yorkshire village. She says her self-confidence is high in all areas - apart from her weight. Despite what she now knows about obesity, Sarah still wants to be slimmer. She simply wants to fit in, and not be judged. Being big means thinking about what might go wrong. Even a catch-up with a friend in a pub garden brings anxiety. ""What are the chairs going to be like? Are there going to be these rickety chairs that I could sit on and it could collapse?"" But for some people living with obesity, Sarah's admission of being unhappy with her weight is at odds with their argument that it is time to reject the stigma - and the shame - and to live happily as they are. It's called being ""body positive"". Sarah respects it, but it is not for her.  ""I do look at some of the body positive community and kind of envy their self-love. But that's only a small community and the big community of the world feels very differently."" Given that Sarah's weight problems are mainly down to genetics, she does not know how that will impact her two-year-old daughter Emily.  After her own struggle with obesity, Sarah is hoping for something better for her daughter.  ""I want her to just know that everyone comes in different shapes and sizes, we have different hair colour, we have different heights, it doesn't matter what she looks like, I just want it to be her. And that's what I'm really passionate about getting that message across to her."" Sarah is setting up a charity to support those with obesity who feel misunderstood and stigmatised. She says the aim is to be a voice for a community that is seldom listened to.  For many scientists and doctors who have developed a deep understanding of obesity, the condition is a complex illness driven by a combination of factors. To blame someone for suffering with that illness flies in the face of the scientific evidence, they say.   ""If blame worked,"" says Dr Abd Tahrani, ""we would have a very thin society by now. Everybody who has obesity has been blamed an endless amount of times, either by their doctors, by their neighbours or their family, or wider society. It's not working, please stop it."""
risk appetite,Mumps cases hit 10-year high in England,2024-09-15,2020-02-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51493496,"Health officials are urging people to have both parts of the MMR vaccine after cases of mumps in England reached their highest level in a decade. Outbreaks in universities and colleges raised the number of cases of the painful viral illness to 5,042 in 2019 - four times the number in 2018. Most were in young adults who missed out on the MMR jab. Public Health England said the full two doses of the vaccination were needed to maximise protection. The vaccine prevents most cases of mumps - but not all, and so some young people are still getting the illness. There were also increases in mumps cases in Wales and Scotland in 2019. It is a viral infection that used to be very common in children before the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1988. A classic sign is puffy cheeks under the ears. Mumps is contagious and spread through infected droplets of saliva breathed in through the mouth or nose.  Most people usually recover without treatment. But in rare cases, there can be serious complications, such as inflammation of the testicles in males, meningitis and deafness. Source: NHS UK ""I went to bed normal, everything fine, and then I woke up, and bang - my face was so puffed out, so swollen,"" says Olly Finch, a student at Leeds University. ""I got prescribed morphine - it was that bad."" Flora Cox, another Leeds student, said: ""It started out with just neck pain in my ear and jaw, and then it started swelling - it was so painful.  ""Your jaw pretty much locks."" David Buckley, 32, ended up with a swollen testicle ""the size of an avocado"" when he had mumps. That followed 10 days at home in bed with symptoms and a trip to hospital with a locked jaw. ""It was so painful, really horrible. I tried to ice it... but it's just something you have to ride out,"" he told Radio 1 Newsbeat. David wasn't sure if he'd had the second dose of the MMR vaccine, so he got the jab again - just in case. The best and safest way is to get two doses of the MMR vaccine - the middle 'M' stands for mumps. It's never too late to catch up, says Dr Vanessa Saliba, from Public Health England. ""We encourage all students and young people who may have missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past to contact their GP practice and get up to date as soon as possible,"" she said. Adults and children who missed out on the vaccine as babies can also have it on the NHS at any age - it is given in two doses, with the second at least a month after the first. The part of the triple vaccine that specifically protects against mumps isn't quite as effective as the elements protecting against measles and rubella. However, getting the jab is still crucial - because the more people who are protected, the less likely mumps is to be shared around.  During outbreaks among students, which are common, completely unvaccinated people are at highest risk. Even if you get the illness after being vaccinated, you are likely to have a less serious form of it and fewer complications. Cases of mumps consistently outnumber measles and rubella cases every year. Teenagers and young adults in colleges and universities are now the ones who tend to be affected - for several reasons. Many of the 2019 cases were born in the late 1990s and early 2000s and missed out on the MMR vaccine when they were children. Research by a disgraced UK doctor falsely linking the vaccine to autism undoubtedly had an impact on uptake. Current students may also be too old to have been immunised or offered the MMR, or may only have had one dose of the vaccine and thus not be fully protected. It is also possible the vaccine's protection against mumps may have worn off. Despite the recent rise in cases, mumps hasn't just reappeared. Before the MMR vaccine, eight out of 10 people developed it and most of them were children of school age. At that time, there were five deaths a year from mumps, mainly due to encephalitis or swelling of the brain. The illness then became relatively rare before returning in the 2000s. There was a particularly large outbreak (43,000 cases) in 2005."
risk appetite,Gaining weight? You may need more sleep,2024-09-15,2022-02-26,By Ruth Alexander,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-60291027,"Not getting enough sleep can lead to a vicious circle of over-eating and further sleep deprivation, but it may be possible to create a virtuous circle - where healthy eating actually improves your sleep. Tania Whalen finds it impossible to get enough sleep between her shifts, working early mornings and nights as a fire brigade dispatcher in Melbourne, Australia. So to help her power through a long night of answering emergency calls and sending out crews she would often take snacks to work. ""It might be a muffin or some biscuits that you could eat in a break just because you felt a bit peckish or to lift your energy a bit,"" she says. Tania was also a regular at the fire station vending machine, buying crisps or chocolate most night shifts. It was a diet she knew wasn't doing her much good - she was piling on the pounds - and yet it was difficult to resist. And Tania's behaviour was not unusual. When people haven't had enough rest, they crave food.  ""Some rather fiendish changes unfold within your brain and your body when sleep gets short, and set you on a path towards overeating and also weight gain,"" says Prof Matthew Walker, director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California.    When we're awake for longer, we do need more energy, but not that much - sleep is a surprisingly active process and our brains and bodies are working quite hard, Prof Walker says. Despite that, when deprived of sleep we tend to overeat by more than twice or three times the amount of calories we need.  That is because sleep affects two appetite-controlling hormones, leptin and ghrelin. Leptin will signal to your brain that you've had enough to eat. When leptin levels are high, our appetite is reduced. Ghrelin does the opposite - when ghrelin levels are high, you don't feel satisfied by the food that you ate.  In experiments it has been shown that when people are deprived of sleep these two hormones go in opposite directions - there's a marked drop in leptin, which meant an increase in appetite, while grehlin rockets up, leaving people unsatisfied.   It's like double jeopardy, Prof Walker says. ""You're getting punished twice for the same offence of not getting sufficient sleep."" Why might this be happening? Prof Walker thinks there is an evolutionary explanation. Animals rarely deprive themselves of sleep, unless they are starving and need to stay awake to forage for food. So when we don't have sufficient sleep, from an evolutionary perspective, our brain thinks that we may be in a state of starvation and will increase our food cravings to drive us to eat more.  And not having enough sleep doesn't only affect how much we eat, but also what we eat.  A small study carried out by Prof Walker showed that participants were more likely to crave sugary, salty and carbohydrate-heavy foods when they were sleep-deprived.  None of which is good news for tired night-shift workers like Tania Whalen. In fact, the situation may be even worse for them since it's not just what they're eating that is a problem, but when they're eating it too.  Our bodies are primed to follow a regular 24-hour rhythm, says Dr Maxine Bonham, an associate professor of nutrition dietetics and food at Monash University, Melbourne. ""We expect to work and eat and exercise during the day, and we expect to sleep at night, and our body is geared to do that. So when you work a night shift, you're doing everything in opposition to what your body's expecting.""  And that means we struggle to process food when we eat night-time meals.  Eating at night can lead to higher glucose levels and more fatty substances in the blood, as the body is less able to break down and metabolise nutrients in the small hours, says Dr Bonham.  Shift workers are known to be more at risk of weight gain, type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  People who work at night are also more likely to be overweight. They may eat out of boredom or to stay awake, and there may not be anything healthy for them to eat, just a vending machine or takeaway food.   All this has inspired Dr Bonham and her colleagues to set up an experiment to see if they can help people who work night shifts lose excess weight and improve their overall health.   They've recruited some 220 shift workers who want to lose weight, and have been putting them on a variety of diets for a six-month period. Tania Whalen, the fire brigade dispatcher, signed up to follow a fasting programme: for two days each week, she had to consume just 600 calories in 24 hours.  ""It was tough,"" Tania says. ""I was quite worried that I wouldn't be able to do it. Some weeks it felt like a 12-hour shift took 20 hours."" But she stuck with it, distracting herself by reading, playing games, going for walks and drinking gallons of peppermint tea. The study's results are not yet in, but Tania feels like it's been a positive experience that's prompted her to make other changes - for example, she now walks 5km every day. ""I certainly have more energy and more desire to move, and I have lost a considerable amount of weight,"" she says.  Interestingly, Tania thinks it has helped her sleep better, too. ""Even in the limited hours that I get, I don't toss and turn as much and I've stopped snoring mostly, or so my husband tells me."" It's not clear whether this improvement is down to the new diet, the exercise, the weight loss, or something else entirely, but it does raise the question of whether what you're eating can affect how you're sleeping. Until now we've been talking about how sleep - or a lack of it - can affect what you eat. But what if you could eat your way to a good night's sleep? Dr Marie-Pierre St-Onge is a nutrition and sleep researcher in New York. She had spent years studying the impact of insufficient sleep on diet when, in 2015, she was contacted by the committee drawing up the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Should they be advising people on what to eat to improve their sleep, they asked? ""My first reaction was, 'Why didn't I think of that?'"" Melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleep and which rises in the evening, comes from a dietary amino acid called tryptophan. ""So, if the hormone that regulates your sleep is produced entirely from an amino acid that must be consumed in the diet, then it makes sense that diet would be important in regulating sleep,"" she says. And yet Dr St-Onge couldn't find any studies focusing on this relationship. So she and her team began looking at research into other health matters, which had recorded participants' sleep and dietary habits. Examining that data, a clear pattern emerged, she says.  Individuals who followed a Mediterranean-style diet - eating lots of fruits and vegetables, fish and whole grains - had a 35% lower risk of insomnia than those who didn't, and were 1.4 times more likely to have a good night's sleep.  So what is so sleep-inducing about that diet? Foods such as fish, nuts and seeds are high in melatonin-producing tryptophan. And a number of small studies have shown that some specific foods such as tomatoes, tart cherries and kiwi fruit, which contain melatonin, may help people fall asleep more easily and stay asleep for longer.  There are also foods to avoid before bed. Most people know about caffeine, which is a stimulant, but perhaps they don't realise salty foods can make you thirsty, which can disturb your sleep. Dr St-Onge's study also suggests eating sugary foods may lead to a more disturbed night. Her team is looking into why that may be.  Studies examining the influence of food on sleep are still few in number, and small in size, so Dr St-Onge says little can be taken as scientific fact. However, they do raise the possibility that eating certain foods can lead to better sleep.  "
risk appetite,Single tuberculosis case linked to a school,2024-09-15,2022-01-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-60073315,"A single case of tuberculosis (TB) linked to a secondary school is being investigated but no outbreak has been declared, health officials have said. Authorities said the individual was associated with Blackwood Comprehensive School, in Caerphilly county. As a precaution all pupils and staff who have had contact with the person will be offered TB screening. Public Health Wales has said screening is routine and if more cases are found appropriate treatment will be offered. Public Health Wales, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board and Caerphilly County Borough Council said in a statement: ""There is nothing to suggest that the case contracted TB at the school, rather they have attended the premises when they unknowingly had the infection.  ""No outbreak has been declared."" Lika Nehaul, locum consultant in health protection at Public Health Wales and chair of the multi-agency incident management team, said: ""Following established infection control procedures we have identified individuals who may have had contact with the individual concerned, these individuals have been contacted and offered screening for TB which is easily treated with a course of antibiotics."" He added local GPs had been informed and that TB was ""difficult to transmit"". ""It requires close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual for a person to become infected,"" he said. ""In this instance, and to limit the potential spread of infection, we are treating all pupils and teachers who may have had contact with the individual as close personal contacts. ""I would stress that the risk of infection with TB to the general public remains very low, however we encourage parents, pupils and staff members to be aware of the symptoms.""

risk appetite,Has the UK woken up to the China spy challenge?,2024-09-15,2023-09-11,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66779117,"The allegation that a researcher in Parliament may have been spying for China has thrown a spotlight on Chinese intelligence activity in the UK - and whether the UK has been slow to respond. Spying used to be fairly straightforward. An intelligence service recruited an agent to steal or photograph some documents stamped 'Top Secret' from a safe and pass them on at a clandestine meeting.  That was the world in which the UK's 1911 Official Secrets Act was passed. But much has changed since then. Now, there is cyber-espionage - the stealing of secrets remotely over computer networks.   And the type of information being sought has also changed.  In 1911, the fear was Germany getting hold of plans for the latest Royal Navy ship. Now, it might be the scientific research on bio-engineering at a university which has never been formally classified as a government secret. And intelligence services do more than just steal secrets. There is covert influence and interference. This might involve finding people who know the inside track on a policy debate - say about sanctions - and who might be able to shape it in a particular way. This can be hard to distinguish sometimes from diplomacy and lobbying (hiding who you really are is often the best sign). And in this new world, China poses a particular challenge. It has vast and well-resourced intelligence services - probably the largest by number in the world. It also engages a wider range of people than just spies to carry out its work - including companies and individuals - part of what is described as a 'whole of state' approach.  The Chinese services often sweep up as much information as they can - some of it not what is typically considered secret and which would not have been of interest to Britain's MI6.  This can all make it harder to spot. This summer's report from the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) outlined some of the ways China operates - including when it comes to politics. ""It appears that China has a high level of intent to interfere with the UK government, targeting officials and bodies at a range of levels to influence UK political thinking and decision-making relevant to China,"" the committee said.  This included encouraging people whose views align with the Chinese Communist Party to seek political office. The ISC report also said MI5 investigations of Chinese intelligence officers found one of those gaining access to at least one UK parliamentarian. One of the problems is that the UK seems to have been slow to wake up to the challenge. In the early part of the last decade, the government was pursuing closer links with China but even as late as 2019, UK security agencies were saying that preventing interference - as opposed to espionage - was not primarily their job but instead one for other government departments, for instance education when it came to activity in universities.  This led to an 'intelligence gap' where Britain's spies were not seeking to identify the activity since it was not their job to deal with it. Meanwhile other departments lacked the expertise or ability to do this.  ""The nature of China's engagement, influence and interference activity in the UK is difficult to detect, but even more concerning is the fact that the government may not previously have been looking for it,"" the ISC said. The security services have also long complained that they did not have the tools to confront the new reality of what foreign intelligence services get up to. In particular, they argued the Official Secrets Act was not fit for purpose. Under the UK's laws, even being an undercover intelligence officer for China or Russia was not in itself illegal. The government did finally pass new a new National Security Act this summer.  This will allow people to prosecuted for being or helping an undeclared spy. But this power is not yet in effect - officials say it is due by the end of the year.  Another part of the act is due to set up a Foreign Influence Registration Scheme in which people will have to register if they are working on behalf of a foreign state, with the risk of prosecution if they do not. But this also is not ready and a further consultation means it will not be up and running until at least next year. And it is not yet clear if China will be placed on the 'enhanced' tier which would mean extra checks. Then there is the political context - does the government want to keep relations with China on a stable footing for the sake of economic investment and trade and if so what does that mean for the appetite to take action? And so while the challenge from China may now have been identified, dealing with it may still not be straightforward."
risk appetite,Facebook urged to end Instagram for children idea,2024-09-15,2021-04-15,By Jane Wakefield,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56757586,"A group of public health advocates from around the world wants Facebook to scrap its plans to launch a version of Instagram for children. A letter from the Campaign for a Commercial-free Childhood, signed by 99 groups and individuals, claims the ""image-obsessed"" platform is dangerous for children's health and privacy. Plans for an Instagram for under-13s have been mooted in recent weeks. Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it would be ""managed by parents"". ""Kids are already online, and want to connect with their family and friends, have fun, and learn. We want to help them do that in a safe and age-appropriate way, and find practical solutions to the ongoing industry problem of kids lying about their age to access apps,"" the social media giant told the BBC. ""We're working on new age verification methods to keep under-13s off Instagram, and have just started exploring an Instagram experience for kids that is age-appropriate and managed by parents.   ""We agree that any experience we develop must prioritise their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it. We also won't show ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13.""  In March, Buzzfeed reported on an internal company post in which executives discussed plans to build a version of the photo-sharing app that could be used by children who are under the legal age to join Instagram. Facebook, along with other social media platforms, is under growing pressure to find ways to stop the under-13s joining. But children can do so by lying about their age. In the letter, the signatories point out that those under the age of 13 already on Instagram are unlikely to ""abandon it for a new site that seems babyish"". ""The real target of Instagram for kids will be much younger children,"" it said. Josh Golin, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood executive director, said: ""Instagram's business model relies on extensive data collection, maximising time on devices, promoting a culture of over-sharing and idolising influencers, as well as a relentless focus on often altered physical appearance. It is certainly not appropriate for seven-year olds."" Kathryn Montgomery, senior strategist at the US digital rights group Center for Digital Democracy, said: ""Facebook claims that creating an Instagram for kids will help keep them safe on the platform. ""But the company's real goal is to expand its lucrative and highly profitable Instagram franchise to an even younger demographic, introducing children to a powerful commercialised social media environment that poses serious threats to their privacy, health and wellbeing."" The letter cites research from the The Royal Society for Public Health which rated Instagram as the worst social media platform for youth mental health. The report claims Instagram is linked to a increased risk of eating disorders, cyber-bullying and sexual grooming. Just this week, Instagram was forced to apologise after a ""mistake"" meant diet content was promoted to users with eating disorders. And the father of UK teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, said that the platform was partly responsible, because she had viewed material about depression and suicide on it, even though such content is banned. ""Instagram's focus on photo-sharing and appearance makes the platform particularly unsuitable for children who are in the midst of crucial stages of developing their sense of self,"" the letter reads. ""Children and teens (especially young girls) have learned to associate overly sexualised, highly edited photos of themselves with more attention on the platform, and popularity among their peers."" There is also unnecessary commercial pressure on children, says the letter, quoting analysis by digital monitoring agency Sprout Social that suggests one in every three Instagram posts is an advert. YouTube for Kids, which doesn't show adverts, was recently criticised for ""smuggling in"" marketing and advertising with product placements. Instagram has also faced criticism for not making it clear when posts are paid-for ads. The letter added that Facebook had ""a long track record of exploiting young people"", citing a design flaw in Messenger Kids which allowed young children to circumvent parental controls. The letter, addressed to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, is signed by 35 organisations and 64 individual experts, including the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Global Action Plan and Kidscape. Facebook is not the only platform under fire for the way it treats young people.  Dutch privacy group the Foundation for Market Information Research has alleged that TikTok violates children's privacy under GDPR rules. It plans to file a formal complaint. "
risk appetite,The Texas Chinese bitcoin gold rush,2024-09-15,2021-09-03,By Zhaoyin Feng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58414555,"China's ban on cryptocurrency mining has forced bitcoin entrepreneurs to flee overseas. Many are heading to Texas, which is quickly becoming the next global cryptocurrency capital.  When China announced a crackdown on bitcoin mining and trading in May, Kevin Pan, CEO of Chinese cryptocurrency mining company Poolin, got on a flight the next day to leave the country.  ""We decided to move out, once [and] for all. [We'll] never come back again,"" Mr Pan told the BBC.  Headquartered in Hong Kong, Poolin is the second largest bitcoin mining network in the world, with most of its operations in mainland China. The country was home to around 70% of global bitcoin mining power, until the clampdown sent the price of bitcoin into a tailspin and caught miners off guard.  Now China's ""bitcoin refugees"" are urgently scrambling to find a new home, whether in neighbouring Kazakhstan, Russia or North America, because for bitcoin miners, time is literally money. ""We had to find a new location for the [bitcoin mining] machines,"" Poolin's vice-president Alejandro De La Torres said. ""Because every minute that the machine is not on, it's not making money."" In what some call the ""Great Mining Migration,"" the Poolin executives are among the many bitcoin miners who have recently landed in a place reputed as part of America's wild wild west: Austin, Texas. Bitcoins are a digital currency with no physical form - they exist and are exchanged only online. They are created when a computer 'mines' the money by solving a complex set of maths problems and that is how bitcoin 'miners' who run the computers earn the currency.  This takes a lot of energy.  As a new form of money that transcends national boundaries, there is also much confusion and potential to run afoul of government rules - so two things bitcoin entrepreneurs value are cheap electricity and a relaxed regulatory environment. The Lone Star State fits the bill to a tee. For Mr Pan, Texas felt like home almost instantly. Days after his arrival, he was gifted an AR-15 rifle, which he says he may use to ""hunt hogs from a helicopter"" one day.  While the shooting ranges and Texas barbeque provide for welcome entertainment, legal protection for business is the major attraction for the bitcoin miners. ""What happened to us in China won't happen in the US,"" Mr De La Torre says. Governor of Texas Greg Abbott has been a vocal supporter for cryptocurrency. ""It's happening! Texas will be the crypto leader,"" he tweeted in June. In the same month, the Lone Star State became the second US state after Wyoming to recognise blockchain and cryptocurrency in its commercial law, paving the way for crypto businesses to operate in the state.  Many Chinese bitcoin companies have looked to Texas for stability and opportunity. Shenzhen-based firm BIT Mining has planned to invest $26 million to build a data centre in the state, while Beijing-based Bitmain is expanding its facility in Rockdale, Texas. This small town with around 5,600 residents once housed one of the world's largest aluminium plants, and now it's emerging as the next global hub for bitcoin mining. There might be another underlying connection between the industry and the state, as De La Torre says that bitcoiners and Texans share the same values.  ""Texans take their freedom and rights very seriously, and so do we bitcoiners.""   Experts believe China's bitcoin crackdown was motivated by having greater control over the financial markets, and it may become a boon for America.  ""The migration benefits the US in terms of talent acquisition and furthering the innovation ecosystem,"" says Kevin Desouza, a business professor at the Queensland University of Technology who has done research on China's digital currency policy. In return, the bitcoin miners get access to a thriving and innovative community, as well as more diverse sources of capital, according to Prof Desouza.  Other than a stable regulatory environment, the energy-hungry industry is hunting for cheap electricity in Texas.  Texas has some of the cheapest energy prices in the world, due to its deregulated power grid. Consumers enjoy more choices of electricity providers, which encourage providers to lower prices to stay competitive. During peaks of electricity demand, bitcoin farms can even sell unused power back to the grid. Although El Salvador is set to become the first country to adopt bitcoin as a national currency, bitcoin miners prefer the US because of its well-developed electrical infrastructure, says Mr De La Torre. But some analysts warn that the ""Great Mining Migration"" may lead to serious repercussions, as cities and towns struggle to meet the huge energy appetite.  In February, blackouts following a deadly snowstorm left millions of homes and businesses in Texas without power for days. More than 200 people died. During the power outage, bitcoin farms were compensated to stay offline.  The increased scrutiny of Chinese companies in America may also lead to more attention on these mining newcomers. Texas recently passed a law that prevents ""hostile foreign actors"" from accessing critical infrastructure, including its power grid. The new law was reportedly prompted by a Chinese billionaire's plan to build a wind farm in southwest Texas. Critics allege that the project could be used to hack into the Texas energy grid and to gather intelligence from a nearby US military base. Prof Desouza says that while access to electricity grids is unlikely to be an issue for bitcoin miners in the short term, political risk will continue to evolve.  The bitcoin miners do miss something in China - cheap labour cost and speedy construction. According to Mr Pan, while a new bitcoin farm takes up to five months to build in China, it could take as long as 18 months in Texas. Global shipping prices have also skyrocketed during the pandemic, making it significantly more expensive to ship mining machines from China to the US. Despite the costly and time-consuming efforts, Mr Pan says his company is committed to settle in Texas, ""It's a free land, and a lot of bitcoiners are here,"" he says, ""so we feel: 'whoa, family reunion.'"""
risk appetite,Has the world started to take climate change fight seriously?,2024-09-15,2020-09-29,By Justin Rowlatt,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54347878,"A surprise announcement at this year's UN General Assembly has transformed the politics of cutting carbon, says the BBC's chief environment correspondent, Justin Rowlatt. As the meeting of the so-called ""global parliament"" comes to an end, he asks whether it might just signal the beginning of a global rush to decarbonise. You probably missed the most important announcement on tackling climate change in years.  It was made at the UN General Assembly. It wasn't the big commitment to protect biodiversity or anything to do with the discussion about how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic - vitally important though these issues are. No, the key moment came on Tuesday last week when the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, announced that China would cut emissions to net zero by 2060. The commitment is a huge deal on its own, but I believe his promise marks something even more significant: China may have fired the starting gun on what will become a global race to eliminate fossil fuels. I'll get to that later. First off, Xi's pledge. It is fair to say environmentalists were stunned by Xi's surprise pledge.  Let's be clear what it means:  China, the most polluting nation on earth - responsible for around 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - is saying it is going cut that back to virtually zero within 40 years. ""Enormously important"" is how Todd Stern - the man President Obama put in charge of climate negotiations - described it to me. ""A massive move"" and ""a happy, happy surprise"" was Li Yan's take: she's the head of Greenpeace in China. The commitment is so significant because China has never promised anything near as bold as this on climate before. And it comes after the European Union committed billions of euros towards a green stimulus package and - only last week - toughened up its own 2030 climate targets. It therefore raises the prospect of a carbon-cutting coalition of Europe and China covering more than a third of world emissions.  Climatologists just aren't used to such good news. International negotiations to reduce carbon emissions all too often end in ugly squabbles. With good reason, says Todd Stern, who was instrumental in making the most successful climate agreement to date: the Paris Agreement of 2015.  The problem is cutting carbon has always been regarded as an expensive chore. The effort to control climate change impacts virtually every element of a country's economy, says Mr Stern, ""so countries have traditionally been nervous about what they're going to be asked to do."" Indeed, Paris was the first time the world actually agreed that all nations needed to do their bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And then, of course, the deal was promptly dumped by US President Donald Trump after he was elected the following year. But even before the US said it wanted out, nobody involved in the negotiations thought the goals laid down in Paris were anywhere near strong enough to meet the objective of keeping the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees of pre-industrial levels. The idea was that every five years countries would be asked to come up with more ambitious targets, ramping up their efforts. The conference at which those new targets were to be discussed was to be held in Glasgow this November.  Thanks to the pandemic it will now be held in November next year. Many observers had expected China to keep its powder dry and produce any ambitious new targets with a flourish at a crucial moment in those negotiations. President Xi definitely had an eye on global politics. His address was a very deliberate contrast to that of President Trump a couple of days earlier. Where Trump blames China for the world's problems, Xi calls for global cooperation and highlights all the good work China has been doing.  He called on the world to work together, investing in a green recovery to lift the global economy from the post-Covid doldrums. ""We are living in an interconnected global village with a common stake,"" says Xi. ""All countries are closely connected and we share a common future. No country can gain from others' difficulties or maintain stability by taking advantage of others' troubles."" ""we should embrace the vision of a community with a shared future in which everyone is bound together,"" he continues. Heart-stirring stuff, eh? It is also presumably no coincidence that Xi's announcement came weeks before the US Presidential election, and just as the terrible fires on the west coast and a series of fierce storms in the east made climate an issue in the polls for the first time. And a cynic might think his reassuring words were partly a ploy to reingratiate China with the climate-conscious Europeans, and isolate a climate-sceptic US President. It came straight after a virtual bilateral summit between Beijing and Brussels. But there is a much more important broader context for his announcement: the fact that the collapsing cost of clean energy is completely changing the calculus of decarbonisation. Renewables are already often cheaper than fossil fuel power in many parts of the world and, if China and the EU really ramp up their investments in wind, solar and batteries in the next few years, prices are likely to fall even further. Why?  Because the cost of renewables follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets. It's like pushing on an open door - the more you build the cheaper it gets, the cheaper it gets the more you build. The Europeans have been quite open that their strategy is to entice other countries to join them by driving down the cost of renewables globally. Alongside this carrot, they also plan to wield a stick - a tax on the imports of countries that emit too much carbon. Meanwhile, President Xi's 2060 pledge was notably unconditional - China will move ahead whether or not other countries chose to follow. This is a complete turnaround from past negotiations, when everyone's fear was that they might end up incurring the cost of decarbonising their own economy, while others did nothing but still enjoyed the climate change fruits of their labour. How things have changed. Very soon, renewable power is likely to be the cheapest and therefore almost certainly the most profitable choice in large parts of the world. Think what this means:  investors won't need to be bullied by green activists into doing the right thing, they will just follow the money. Why invest in new oil wells or coal power stations that will become obsolete before they can repay themselves over their 20-30-year life? Why carry carbon risk in their portfolios at all? The change of appetite on financial markets has become ever more obvious over the last decade. This year alone, Tesla's rocketing share price has made it the world's most valuable car company. Meanwhile, the share price of Exxon - once the world's most valuable company of any kind - fell so far that it just got booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of major US corporations. And this is where the idea of a race comes in. Countries - and companies - may soon rush to decarbonise as they see opportunities to make profits in what will be an enormous new market. President Xi is well aware of his country's leading position in the market for clean energy - investing in renewables has been a priority for China for many years. It is already the world's biggest manufacturer of solar panels and wind, it makes more electric cars and buses than anyone else and has also become the international hub for battery production.  ""It is going to keep on driving down the prices, so that everybody can get onto this parade, as it were, and go along,"" says Rachel Kyte, Dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, in Medford, Massachusetts, and a former adviser to the UN Secretary General on sustainable energy.  So, it looks like Xi has judged that the economics of clean energy mean that decarbonising is now the most sensible choice for the Chinese economy as well as for the world's climate. He is not alone. Look at how oil companies like BP and Shell are saying they want to move away from the black stuff and into clean energy. Sadly we cannot.  The idea of a global race to decarbonise is a thrilling new prospect for anyone interested in limiting climate change, but I am sorry to say there are still many hurdles along the way. First off, Mr Xi's did not give any details of how his country would achieve his carbon-neutral target. Remember, China is by far the biggest consumer of coal in the world, hoovering up about half of the global supply.  It is also the world's second biggest user of oil - after the US. Across its economy, some 85% of its power comes from fossil fuels with 15% from low carbon sources.  Those ratios will need to be turned on their head to have any chance of meeting the net zero pledge.  That will take eye-popping investment in wind, solar and nuclear power. But all Xi said at the UN about how it would get to its 2060 goal was that China would peak its emissions of greenhouse gases ""before 2030"" - little change from China's previous promise that the peak would come ""around"" 2030.  Li Yan of Greenpeace says the acid test will be whether a raft of new coal plants proposed by provincial authorities are approved. ""Existing core industries are still fighting their survival in China,"" she says, ""and that's why we're still seeing coal plants proposed everywhere."" We'll see whether they get the go-head - and how aggressive the investment in clean energy is - in a few months when the details of China's next five-year plan are published. So even as the economics tilts in favour of renewables the task of decarbonisation is still enormous. Meanwhile, the effects of climate change will only accelerate. But there is another reason for optimism. The US is the world's biggest economy and the second biggest producer of greenhouse gases, and is therefore essential to any effort to tackle climate change. Under Donald Trump it has steered clear of carbon-cutting commitments. But his challenger, Joe Biden, has said he will re-join the Paris accord, and has promised a $2 trillion green recovery plan for the US, which would aim to slash emissions and tackle the effects of climate change. That holds out the promise of the world's three largest economies, responsible for nearly half of all emissions, all making a serious effort to cut carbon. Once half the world is on-board with the project it is hard to see how the rest could hold out. So - and this isn't something we often say about climate change - there are powerful new reasons for optimism. Follow Justin on Twitter. I've travelled all over the world for the BBC and seen evidence of environmental damage and climate change everywhere. It's the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. Tackling it means changing how we do virtually everything. We are right to be anxious and afraid at the prospect, but I reckon we should also see this as a thrilling story of exploration, and I'm delighted to have been given the chance of a ringside seat as chief environment correspondent."
risk appetite,What might happen next in the South China Sea?,2024-09-15,2020-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53344449,"Despite all the other issues demanding China's attention this year - the virus, its trade war with the US, Hong Kong's national security law, and a host of economic woes - the South China Sea has been revived in recent months as an arena for serious tensions. With US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo now - for the first time - calling China's territorial claims in the South China Sea unlawful, Alexander Neill examines China's plans to extend its reach in the region. The South China Sea, home to vital shipping lanes, has been a flashpoint for years, with several countries claiming ownership of its small islands and reefs and with it, access to resources. In recent years, China has been increasingly assertive over what it claims are its centuries-old claims to the contested region, and has been rapidly building up its military presence to back up those claims.  Former Commander of US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris once referred to this as the ""Great Wall of Sand"" - a ""nine-dash line"" creating a protective ring and supply network around Chinese territory at sea, as the wall did on land. But while China and the US have traded increasingly barbed comments over the South China Sea, broadly speaking, they had managed such differences. Despite their trade conflict, the US had avoided taking sides in China's territorial disputes with other countries - other than to demand freedom of movement for its vessels.  Then, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Criticism of China's early handling of the outbreak, led by the US, has enraged China.  Many Western leaders appear to be persuaded by Mr Pompeo's argument that China was exploiting the pandemic to double-down on its coercive behaviour in general. And those rising tensions have been playing out in the South China Sea. In early April, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel close to the Paracel Islands, which China and Vietnam claim as theirs.  Then, a Malaysian oil exploration project also found its operations disrupted off the coast of Borneo by a Chinese marine survey vessel, the Haiyang Dizhi 8, backed by China's Navy and Coast Guard.  Consequently, the USS America, a US Navy amphibious assault ship, joined by an Australian frigate, was deployed to waters nearby. The escalation continued with the deployment of two US Navy guided missile destroyers, USS Bunker Hill and USS Barry to the Paracel and Spratly Islands (known as the Xisha and Nansha in Chinese) respectively.  The warships conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) aimed at challenging what the US views as a pattern of China's unlawful claims in international waters. Most recently, China closed off a swathe of sea space to conduct naval exercises in the waters surrounding the Paracel Islands. The US angrily said this violated Chinese commitments to avoid activities exacerbating disputes.  Meanwhile, the US Navy deployed not one but two aircraft carrier strike groups - the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan - for joint operations in the region.  In addition to the US Navy fighters conducting carrier operations and the P8-Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft criss-crossing the sea, the US Air Force sent a B-52 strategic bomber for good measure. China's state media reacted with predictable vitriol.  The US Navy's surge into the South China Sea increases the risk of an incident between the two rival powers and a rapid escalation in hostility. The situation is particularly dangerous in light of a recent pattern of increasing assertiveness by China over its ""core concerns"". Its recent use of lethal force on its disputed border with India, and the imposition of the National Security Law on Hong Kong, have prompted many to ask how restrained China is likely to be in its response to these challenges. Beijing views the South China Sea as a crucial part of its maritime territory, not only serving as a bastion for its seaborne nuclear deterrent based on Hainan island but also as a gateway for the Maritime Silk Road, part of China's Belt and Road Initiative.  The South China Sea is critical, for example, for the future success of China's Greater Bay Area economic development plan, into which Hong Kong is incorporated.     China's plan for populating the South China Sea was launched in 2012 when ""Sansha City"", the administrative centre for all Chinese-claimed features in the South China Sea on Woody Island in the Paracels, was upgraded from county to prefecture-level status. The government re-settled the small fishing community there into modern dwellings, built a primary school, a bank and a hospital and installed mobile communications. Tourists have been visiting on regularly scheduled cruises to the islands. The second phase of the plan was initiated in April this year, when China created two further county level administrative districts subordinate to Sansha City, including the establishment of Nansha District People's government, headquartered on Fiery Cross Reef and administering all the Chinese claimed features of the Spratly Islands.  In the six years since China began reclamation of several reefs and atolls in the Spratlys, satellite and air surveillance has revealed one of the world's greatest feats in maritime engineering and military construction.   In addition to the military facilities on the islands - including 3,000m runways, naval berths, hangars, reinforced ammunition bunkers, missile silos and radar sites - images show neatly arranged accommodation blocks, administrative buildings roofed with blue ceramic tiles, hospitals, and even sports complexes on the reclaimed islands, which have become visibly greener. Subi reef is now home to a farm - including a six-acre fruit and vegetable plot pollinated by bees imported from the mainland, a herd of pigs, flocks of poultry and fish ponds.  Meanwhile, the China Academy of Sciences established an Oceanographic Research Centre on Mischief Reef in January 2019. China's top hydrologists have announced that the water table on Fiery Cross - once little more than a rock in the sea - has been expanding rapidly and will allow water self-sufficiency within 15 years (link in Chinese). The residents of the island already enjoy 5G mobile data access and availability of fresh fruit and vegetables shipped in refrigerated containers. Imagery also shows large fishing fleets moored in the larger lagoons on Subi and Mischief reef.  Perhaps before too long, fishing families could be permanently housed on China's southernmost islands, their children schooled alongside those of party and government officials. The most symbolic evidence of China's push into the South China Sea is quite literally set in stone - transplanted from mainland China.  In April 2018, 200-tonne commemorative megaliths, erected on each of the three biggest island bases in the Spratly Islands were unveiled amid some secrecy. Quarried from Taishan stone and shipped to the Spratly islands, the monuments resonate with President Xi Jinping's China Dream of national rejuvenation.  Mount Taishan is viewed as the most sacred of China's mountains, a symbol of unbroken Chinese civilisation for thousands of years. All of this shows China has moved into a second phase of a calculated plan to make this great strategic waterway of South East Asia an irreversibly Chinese one. The recent US Navy exercises in the South China Sea were aimed at demonstrating US resolve to protect the ""freedom of the seas"": for the US Navy to operate in and ultimately protect the seaspace across these international waters. Alongside the US Naval manoeuvres, Mr Pompeo's announcement formally stating that China's claims across the region are ""completely unlawful"" begs the question of what the US is prepared to do next.  At a minimum, Mr Pompeo wants to build a diplomatic coalition to demonstrate China's self-isolation, not just with some of the other claimants but also along with bigger powers. The US could very rapidly reduce China's new Nansha district to concrete and coral rubble - but this would entail a war for which neither the US nor China has an appetite.

risk appetite,Two metre social distance 'safe way to behave',2024-09-15,2020-06-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-53163402,"The original recommendation to stay 2m apart from others remains the ""safe way to behave"", Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said the original social distancing advice is staying in place in Wales. The UK government has eased it in England, allowing parts of the hospitality sector including pubs to reopen from 4 July. Welsh Conservatives have called for a ""similar lifeline"" for firms in Wales. Earlier Mr Drakeford's colleague, Health Minister Vaughan Gething, said he could not see how the measures being eased in England were consistent with scientific advice. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers will be able to reopen in England from 4 July. Concerns have been raised of the risk of a second wave. The UK government said it would continue to be guided by the latest scientific advice. Dates in Wales have not been given for the hospitality sector, including pubs and restaurants, to reopen, although the Welsh Government has promised ""detailed discussions"" on a phased reopening. In England a ""one metre plus"" rule has been introduced where two metres is not possible, taking steps to reduce transmission But in Wales the 2m advice is enshrined in law and workplaces are expected to follow it as much as they can, risking fines otherwise. At a virtual session of the Senedd Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservative group, said it was ""right"" to reassess the regulations as infection rates fall. He put it to Mr Drakeford that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had welcomed the prime minister's statement on Tuesday ""overall"" and believed ""the UK government is trying to do the right thing"". In response, the first minister said: ""In Wales, the message remains. Stay two metres apart. That is the safe way to behave."" He said the science of the UK government's scientific advisory group SAGE said ""if you halve the distance the risk increases somewhere between two and five times greater than if you stay within a two metre distance"". But Mr Drakeford did not totally rule out easing the advice. ""If it is possible, always using public health as our primary test, to reduce the two metre rule by exception then we will see what we are able to do in Wales, but we will do it by looking at the evidence first."" Evidence for the England decision had been promised by the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, the first minister said. ""That evidence had not arrived by the end of yesterday but we certainly hope to see it today."" Mr Drakeford faced calls from Paul Davies to provide a ""strategy"" for Welsh tourism for how it will support it in the short and long term, and for ""immediate action"" to help the hospitality sector. He said last week's statement on lockdown in Wales, which said self-contained tourist accommodation could take bookings from 13 July, ""resulted in more questions than answers"". But Mr Drakeford said ""none of us know how this disease will progress as we move through the summer and into autumn"". ""We do our best to provide forward guidance to sectors in Wales, but to ask us to provide clarity where none is possible, would be to provide a false prospectus to those industries."" Coronavirus travel restrictions are among the measures still in place in Wales, with people expected to stay local at least until 6 July. Vaughan Gething told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers the lockdown changes in England were ""a lot of measures to undertake on one day"". ""I don't think you'd see that same appetite for risk here,"" he added. He said Welsh Government officials are in contact with their counterparts in the UK government ""trying to get sight of the evidence"". ""And as soon as [we see it] we'll consider it, and it will inform choices that we make here in Wales."" Mr Gething claimed that the ""overwhelming majority of people in Wales support the approach"" taken by the Welsh Government - which has eased lockdown more cautiously than in England. ""Some people are thirsty for a much more rapid unlocking of the country but, actually, that isn't the overwhelming view of people,"" he said. Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative Covid recovery spokesman, said that the UK government's measures are ""safe and sensible"" and will ""come as a huge relief to those parts of society and the economy which would otherwise be unable to function and it is great to see them attracting cross-party support"". ""We encourage the Welsh Government to urgently review the restrictions here as soon as possible in order that a similar lifeline can be thrown to people and businesses across Wales."""
risk appetite,Short intense exercise 'aids weight loss',2024-09-15,2019-02-16,By Laurel  Ives,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47242940,"Bursts of high intensity interval training (Hiit) may be more effective for weight loss than longer less intense workouts, a study suggests. The research, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, analysed results from 36 earlier studies. Although all the participants lost weight, those doing Hiit saw a 28.5% greater weight loss.  The researchers cautioned that Hiit may not be suitable for everyone.  ""Hiit might increase the risk of injury and impose higher cardiovascular stress,"" they said.  Researchers from the Federal University of Goias, Brazil, analysed data from 576 men and 522 women of varying levels of fitness.  Interval training was defined as cardiovascular exercise which involved repeated brief bursts of intense effort, interspersed with recovery periods. Cycling, swimming, running and boxing were included.  These workouts were compared with longer continuous moderate intensity workouts, most of which were between 30 and 45 minutes.  All participants exercised for at least four weeks.  Those doing interval training lost on average 1.58kg (3.48lb) compared with the 1.13kg (2.49lb) lost by those doing lower intensity workouts.  Sprint interval training seemed to be particularly effective for weight loss, although researchers did caution that the wide variety of training programmes made it difficult to recommend one regime in particular.  The NHS currently recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as cycling or brisk walking, every week. Dr Niels Vollaard, a lecturer in health and exercise science at the University of Stirling, said the results were counterintuitive as most people burned more calories during longer moderate exercise. ""There are two possible explanations,"" he said. ""Firstly, Hiit may lead to greater energy expenditure after exercise - metabolism may be increased for up to a day following a Hiit session. ""Secondly, after a Hiit session, you may be less hungry.  ""In our research, we have shown that appetite hormones are indeed affected.  ""It is, however, not easy to study whether energy intake is reduced as a result of this in the longer term when following a Hiit routine, so at the moment we are still unsure exactly what the reason is."" Michael Mosley, who was introduced to Hiit seven years ago while making the BBC Horizon documentary The Truth about Exercise, said: ""In 2012, I tested three lots of 20-second high intensity workouts on an exercise bike, three times a week.  ""My insulin sensitivity improved by 24%.  ""In the programme, we again saw very impressive results with younger, unfit people.  ""The biggest problem with exercise is compensatory eating and relaxing afterwards.  ""People go on a treadmill for 30 minutes, burn around 120 calories, then lie around and reward themselves with a muffin. ""The theory with Hiit seems to be that it suppresses your appetite and targets the visceral fat in your gut. ""It's not the calories you burn that matter - it's what you do next."""
risk appetite,Should India break up its big conglomerates?,2024-09-15,2023-03-30,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65108865,"India should dismantle its large conglomerates to increase competition and reduce their ability to charge higher prices, former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Viral Acharya has argued in a new paper for Brookings Institution, an American research group.  According to Mr Acharya, who is now a professor of economics at NYU Stern, ""industrial concentration"" - which refers to the extent to which a smaller number of firms account for total production in a country - fell sharply in India after 1991 when the country opened up its economy and state-owned monopolies began giving away their market share to private enterprises. But after 2015, it began rising again.  The share of India's ""big five"" conglomerates - the Reliance Group, Adani Group, Tata Group, Aditya Birla Group and Bharti Airtel - in total assets of non-financial sectors rose from 10% in 1991 to nearly 18% in 2021.   They ""grew not just at the expense of the smallest firms, but also of the next largest firms"", says Mr Acharya, because the share in total assets of the next five business groups halved from 18% to 9% during this period.  There could have been many drivers of this, according to Mr Acharya -  their ability to acquire large distressed companies, a growing appetite for mergers and acquisitions, and India's conscious industrial policy of creating ""national champions via preferential allocation of projects and in some cases regulatory agencies turning a blind eye to predatory pricing"".  The trend raises several concerns, according to the former deputy governor. These include ""the risk of crony capitalism, i.e., political connections and inefficient project allocations, related party transactions within their byzantine corporate organisation charts"", taking on excess debt to fund their expansion and preventing competitors from entering the market.  Excess leverage was, in fact, one of the many red flags that US-based short seller Hindenburg Research had also raised against the Adani Group recently. The report led to billions of dollars being wiped from the stock market.  In other countries this has had far graver spillover effects in the past.  ""National champions can easily become overleveraged and collapse, severely damaging the overall economy, as has occurred in other Asian countries, most spectacularly Indonesia in 1998,"" Josh Felman, former India head of the International Monetary Fund, told the BBC.  In a February column for Project Syndicate, the economist Nouriel Roubini had also expressed concerns about India's economic model of giving a few ""national champions"" or ""large private oligopolistic conglomerates"" control over significant parts of the economy.  ""These conglomerates have been able to capture policymaking to benefit themselves,"" wrote Mr Roubini. The phenomenon was stifling innovation and disallowing entry of start-ups and other domestic entrants in key industries, he said. India's policy of creating ""national champions"" is similar to those adopted by China, Indonesia and particularly South Korea in the 1990s, where a group of mostly family-run business conglomerates - called chaebols, of which smartphone giant Samsung is the most prominent example - dominated its economy.   But unlike India, these countries ""did not protect their conglomerates with sky-high tariffs"", says Mr Acharya. India, however, has been becoming more protectionist in order to ""insulate domestic industries and conglomerates from global competition"", Mr Roubini wrote.    All of this has major implications on India's attempts to become the next factory of the world. According to both Mr Acharya and Mr Roubini, India needs to reduce tariffs to become more globally competitive and take advantage of the ""China plus one"" trend where supply chains are moving away from mainland China into geographies like India and Vietnam.  India's industrial concentration could also have domestic consequences, Mr Acharya argues - the rising market power of the ""big five"" may be one of the contributors to persistently high core inflation, or the rise in the price of goods and services barring food and energy. ""While a deeper and fuller inquiry is warranted, we find that there is a potentially causal link from market power to markups,"" writes Mr Acharya, adding that these companies are able to ""exert extraordinary pricing power and capture economic rents relative to other firms in the industry"".  But other economists told the BBC that they are sceptical of this correlation. ""If a 'big five' firm enters a new sector, the group may become bigger, but competition in that specific sector may increase and prices might actually fall. A most spectacular example of this dynamic occurred when Reliance decided to start [telecom company] Jio: telecoms prices crashed,"" says Mr Felman. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, says there isn't ""enough evidence"" to support this thesis. According to him, even in markets dominated by a small number of firms, such as airlines - where most of these conglomerates do not have a presence - prices have consistently been high. He adds that the sectors that feed into core inflation at the consumer level -  recreation, education, health, household goods, consumer care - don't have the presence of the big five either.

risk appetite,Instagram criticised over sale of weight gain drug,2024-09-15,2021-05-02,By Anna Collinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56930654,"NHS England has urged Instagram to clamp down on accounts selling an unlicensed, ""dangerous"" drug mainly targeted at younger women and girls. The sale of Apetamin is illegal in the UK, but BBC Three revealed it is available in shops and online. In an open letter, NHS leaders say they are concerned about the product's promotion and the impact on physical and mental health.  Instagram say selling non-medical drugs is ""strictly against our policies"". Apetamin is not licensed in the UK which means the regulator has not carried out tests to ensure it meets strict safety standards and it should not be sold, supplied or advertised. Doctors say misuse of the appetite stimulant can cause severe fatigue, jaundice and even liver failure.  However, the syrup is regularly promoted by social media influencers as a quick way to gain weight and develop an extreme hourglass figure, like celebrities Kim Kardashian and Cardi B. Instagram said it had taken down accounts that sell and advertise Apetamin in response to the BBC Three documentary Dangerous Curves, which aired on 21 April. However, NHS England says it's since found ""dozens of profiles"" are still active and when this was reported, ""no action was taken"". In the letter, National Medical Director, Stephen Powis and National Mental Health Director, Clare Murdoch, demand an urgent update on what action the site is taking to tackle accounts selling Apetamin.  ""We are concerned about both the physical and mental health impacts of the promotion of this drug and strongly urge you to demonstrate duty of care to your customers and clamp down now on this dangerous content."" They say they are sending the letter ""on behalf of NHS patients, staff and people experiencing body dysmorphia and other mental health conditions, as well as their families"". The letter, which has also been signed by the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, has asked Instagram to confirm whether it thinks social media firms should contribute more financially to young people's mental health services - which it's claimed are increasingly being called on. ""It's time these media giants stepped up to the plate and took some responsibility,"" Claire Murdoch told the BBC. ""Here we are investing more than ever in mental and physical heath, these media giants like Instagram need to contribute more as well."" The BBC has found Apetamin is also still being sold on other online sites and in shops, following its investigation. Two years ago, Vanessa was taking Apetamin on a regular basis. ""I used to be happy with my body, but social media has affected the way I think. I developed insecurities I never knew I had,"" explains the 23-year-old. ""When you take Apetamin you can't control the weight you gain. It doesn't go to the right places, just straight to the belly. I was also really bloated and tired."" Vanessa, who always bought the product in a shop, says removing accounts which sell Apetamin will help, but won't solve the problem. ""A lot of people are blind to the pressure that makes you do things you shouldn't do. People make rude comments and 'skinny-shame' you.  ""They say you don't look good and a curvaceous figure is the desired shape. ""It's madness women and girls like me are willing to take such a risk, but the pressures must be hitting us hard for us to think it's worth it."" In a statement from the Facebook company, which owns Instagram, a spokesperson said: ""The wellbeing of our community is our top priority and buying and selling non-medical or prescription drugs is strictly against our policies. ""We remove accounts that sell Apetamin when we become aware of them and block related hashtags so this content is harder to find.  ""We'll continue working with law enforcement and youth organisations to help keep drugs sales of any kind off Instagram.""  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is currently investigating the sale of Apetamin, which is made by TIL Healthcare in India.  The company's spokesperson has previously told the BBC it is not exporting the product to the UK and it has no information on its availability in the UK."
risk appetite,Wigan could be tip of a large iceberg,2024-09-15,2020-07-01,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/53256015,"Wigan have won all three of their games since the retstart Wigan Athletic could be followed into administration by ""10 or 15"" clubs unless some financial help comes from the top of the game, warns the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Administrators acting for the Latics have said the club is 'finished' if funding cannot be found to get it through to the end of the season after its Hong Kong-based owners pulled out. But the fear of many within the game is that Wigan will only represent the tip of a large iceberg as the full impact of Covid-19 starts to take effect. Wigan set for 12-point deduction Ex-captain Emmerson Boyce urges players to keep focus ""It would be tragic if a club that has been in existence for nearly 90 years is forced to the wall,"" said Julian Knight, chair of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport Committee.  ""We know that 10 to 15 clubs could find themselves in the same position. (On Monday) the DCMS Committee sought clarification from (Premier League chief executive) Richard Masters on what action it was taking to provide extra money for clubs at risk - he told us that the Football League hadn't asked for extra funding and the Premier League hadn't provided it.  ""That's a situation that has to change."" BBC Sport understands there has, in fact, been talks between Premier League executives and their EFL counterparts. The EFL has made its position clear, although the Premier League is thought to be concentrating on trying to complete the current campaign before looking at the wider state of football finances.  Privately, the EFL is braced for the coronavirus pandemic to cost its clubs a combined £250m. The Premier League already provides around £400m each year in funding to the EFL but around £260m of that goes to nine clubs in the form of parachute payments to those relegated from the top flight in previous seasons. In May, EFL chairman Rick Parry called those payments ""an evil that must be eradicated"". Many Championship executives feel the gulf in finances between the top two divisions is unhealthy and has created a situation where clubs spent far more than they can afford in the hope of reaching the Premier League. Speaking to the BBC in May, Huddersfield owner Phil Hodgkinson warned ""50 or 60"" clubs could go bust and some were only trading because they were deferring wages, tax and other creditors. Hodgkinson, whose club are among those currently receiving parachute payments, said there should be an across-the-board wage cut, with the money being combined with part of the £340m rebate Premier League clubs have had to give back to broadcasters to help those who need it survive the coronavirus pandemic. Then, he felt, stringent wage regulations should be applied to prevent clubs getting into trouble. The EFL wants to introduce salary caps for Leagues One and Two next season. However, the Professional Footballers' Association is opposed to this and say current Financial Fair Play rules should be monitored in a more effective way. As those arguments continue, clubs are starting to face the financial reality of the situation they now find themselves in. While the Premier League and Championship have decided to finish their current seasons 'behind closed doors', there has been no clarity over what happens to the 2020-21 campaign. The expectation is the Premier League will resume in September and the Championship on either 12 September or 29 August. What is not known is whether the appetite among clubs in League One, League Two and the National League will be to start their seasons in front of either no spectators or limited capacity, given match-going fans provide the bulk of their income. In addition, the developments around Wigan will again bring debate around the EFL's owners and directors test. The Hong Kong-based consortium who bought the club from Dave Whelan in 2018 passed it. However, as was the case at Bury and, now Charlton, clubs have been bought without EFL approval. Charlton have had two takeovers this season and so far, the EFL is still to say whether it is happy with either. On Tuesday, the Charlton Athletic Supporters Trust published a list of nine questions it wanted answering by new owner Paul Elliott, a Manchester-based businessman. Few would doubt 83-year-old Whelan's good intentions for the Latics. He bankrolled Wigan on their fairytale rise from the fourth tier of English football to the Premier League and has already been talking about what he can do to help. It is understood there are 600 full and part-time employees at the club, with administrators now set to face some uncomfortable decisions. ""What's needed now is leadership from the very top of the pyramid to help save the Wigan side and the jobs of those who work for it,"" said Knight."
risk appetite,Couple raffles home for £3 after mortgage refusal,2024-09-15,2022-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-63307659,"A family is raffling their four-bedroom home to raise the funds to hopefully upsize with their seven children after being refused a new mortgage. Leoni Webb and physics teacher Declan Garrett were told by four lenders there were ""affordability issues"" because of the size of their family. They said they hoped to raise more than the £350,000 house valuation but needed to sell thousands of £3 tickets yet. If they fail to reach their target the winner receives a cash prize instead. In that event the family said they would stay put in their current home and look to extend the house further. Leoni Webb, 35, has four children from a previous relationship, and 38-year-old Declan Garrett has three.  He said: ""We were told that because we had so many children all we could borrow was £50,000, which wouldn't buy you a beach hut round here. A case of computer just says no."" UK Finance represents lenders and said: ""Lenders carry out a thorough income and expenditure assessment ahead of any new borrowing to ensure mortgages are affordable in the long term.  ""It would not be in the customer's best interest to borrow more than they can reasonably afford and each lender will develop their own approach depending on their risk appetite."" The family's target is to sell 300,000 tickets to raise £900,000. ""Somebody could get this house mortgage-free,"" Ms Webb said. ""We give £90,000 to Raffique [the company the raffle is being organised through].  ""Then we pay the legal costs and stamp duty for the new owner. After we pay off our outstanding mortgage we'd have about £600,000 to get a five-bedroom house around here."" The extra bedroom was needed as more of the children became teenagers, she said.  They have already converted the garage of the house in Worle into a bedroom. The house has a large front and rear garden, two bathrooms and a utility room.   Some 12,000 tickets have been sold and the raffle is due to end on Friday. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk "
risk appetite,Gloria Estefan’s show ‘not a jukebox musical’,2024-09-15,2019-07-04,By Steven McIntosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48784893,"Appropriately, Gloria Estefan spends very little time sitting down at the West End premiere of On Your Feet. The opening night of the musical based on her life sees the singer mingling with the crowd in the stalls, signing autographs and dancing with children in the audience. Later in the night, as the show reaches its climax, she takes to the stage at London's Coliseum for a duet with Christie Prades, the actress who is portraying her. On Your Feet has already been successful on Broadway, where it opened in 2015, and Estefan confirms a big-screen adaptation is already in the works. It will follow recent music-based biopics like Bohemain Rhapsody and Rocketman (about Queen and Elton John respectively).  ""I think that right now music is in a moment where it's really difficult to build a career of that length, to be able to have decades in the business, so Broadway and the West End and everyone else is focusing on the careers of big acts,"" Estefan says backstage. ""Queen had a show here in the West End, We Will Rock You, before anything ever happened [in film], so it makes for a great story because it's things that have actually happened, they're actual people. And I think it's expanded into film because people are interested in seeing how these careers happened."" Despite its unpopularity with critics, Bohemian Rhapsody won four Oscars earlier this year, including best actor for its star Rami Malek. When it came to scripting On Your Feet, Estefan enlisted another Oscar winner - Birdman writer Alexander Dinelaris (although he began work on the musical before his recognition from the Academy). ""The trick is getting it right, because to me this isn't a jukebox musical,"" Estefan says. ""Alex Dinelaris, our book writer, did a fantastic job of telling our story, so for us it's just an expanded way to do what we did through music but also now through dancing and a theatrical production."" But bringing On Your Feet to London isn't without risk. Estefan may have sold more than 120 million records worldwide across her 40-year career, but in the UK she doesn't have quite as many huge hits to her name as Queen, Abba or Michael Jackson - all of whom have had musicals staged in the West End.  ""Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine may be massive stars in much of the Spanish-speaking world and in the US, but their UK appeal is rather more niche,"" wrote John Lewis in The Guardian. But, he added: ""Fortunately, the show is carried by a superb performance from the Miami-born Cuban-American Christie Prades as Gloria... For all the show's flaws, the rhythm really does get you."" It's certainly fair to say Estefan has had a long and distinguished career. Her family escaped from Cuba to Miami after the revolution. Her father joined the US military and fought in the Vietnam War, but was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis - all of which is reflected in the stage retelling of Estefan's life. In 1975, Gloria met Emilio Estefan, and she began singing with his band, Miami Sound Machine. Her vocals helped propel the group to global success, and she became a star in her own right. But her tour bus was involved in a crash which almost killed her in 1990, severely injuring her spine and requiring her to take a year out for intensive physical therapy. She made a full recovery and continued to have chart success, and in 2014, she was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama. Much of this makes it into On Your Feet, although Sarah Carson of the i paper. said that having such a rich story to tell poses challenges. ""There is almost so much to pack in that the storytelling has no choice but to rush,"" she wrote.  The show received just two stars from Dominic Maxwell in The Times. ""Rhythm Is Gonna Get You? Not everyone, it's not. The megamix finale got the crowd on its feet, but I remained in my seat,"" he said. ""While On Your Feet is not without its pleasures for fans of Estefan's music, it's more like an all-singing, all-dancing Wikipedia entry than something to stir the Este-neutral."" The production's debut in London is the start of its UK tour, which continues into April 2020. As a result, Estefan says a couple of minor tweaks were made to the script to ensure British audiences could understand it. ""Q-tips changed to cotton buds, because a British audience wouldn't know what Q-tips are,"" she explains. ""And the Ford Cortina was a station wagon before, they wouldn't know what this was, so it was just things so they would get the joke. I just wanted to make sure they understood what they were trying to say."" The last few years have seen Latin American-inspired music go through something of a chart revival. Some of the biggest hits of the last couple of years have had a distinctly Latin flavour, such as Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's Despacito, J Balvin's Mi Gente and Havana by Camila Cabello. Added to the artists like Jennifer Lopez and Shakira who have had sustained success in recent years, singing in both Spanish and English, it's clear audience appetite for the genre is high.  Asked what's behind the continued appeal, Estefan says: ""It's rich, it's rhythmic, it's fun.  ""When I wrote Rhythm Is Gonna Get You, the idea came from the fact that our first communication - I studied psychology and communications in college, by the way - the first communication in the world was drums, this is how we talked across distance, so to me, percussion and rhythm has always been what unified our audiences worldwide.  ""It didn't matter where you were from, they understood it, so I think that is always going to reach people. You don't have to understand it, you feel it."" On Your Feet is currently playing at London's Coliseum for 12 weeks before touring the UK until April 2020."
risk appetite,Euro press sees populist advance 'halted',2024-09-15,2019-05-27,By BBC Monitoring,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48423991,"The press and news sites across Europe agree that populist groups made gains in the EU parliamentary elections, but failed to overwhelm mainstream parties of the centre-right and centre-left. They largely attribute this to higher voter turnout, especially among young people, and awareness of climate issues, rather than enthusiasm for the European Union's institutions. The vote in Britain could not compete for attention with the results in each given country, but a few papers did consider its impact. For Italy's centre-left La Stampa, Nigel Farage is the ""big winner"" in what its correspondent Francesco Guerrera dubs the ""milkshake election"".  The main impact, in his view, is that the result has ""completely shaken up British politics"". Germany's Handelsblatt business daily was unusual in thinking Brexit was significant in stalling the populist wave elsewhere in Europe. ""Brexit... led citizens to understand the importance of the EU and the dangers of leaving it. Europe's political and economic elites were much more consistent in and committed to promoting the EU ahead of the elections than in the past. For the first time, the pro-European forces have mobilised en masse against nationalism - and it has paid off,"" the paper says. ""A populist front from Paris to Warsaw, but its advance has been halted,"" says La Stampa, voicing the consensus media view. Germany's centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, in common with many other papers, sees climate concerns as having boosted the Greens in all countries. The Greens are ""singing victory songs after their success... both the spectre of a shift to the right and the major climate issue ensured a significant leap in turnout,"" it says. The Czech centre-right daily Lidove Noviny thinks the ""migration crisis most likely boosted turnout"" in central Europe, but not enough to benefit the populists, noting that centre-right parties still beat the Czech right-wing ANO movement. Belgium's liberal daily Le Soir is more cautious, saying the gains are ""far from trivial for the European populist radical right"", which will ""move in the next few days to form alliances"".  Some papers warn that the populist tide was halted not by enthusiasm for the European Union, but rather by voters demanding change. In Italy's centre-left La Repubblica, columnist Andrea Bonanni says European citizens ""sent a clear request for a fresh start... when they pushed back the dark shadows that appeared on the continent"".  He says the result is thanks mainly to young people - ""if today Europe is saved, the credit first and foremost goes to them"".  Romania's centre-right Adevarul agrees that ""young people have found their electoral appetite, understand that their vote is important, and the significant increase in the vote... is due mainly to them.  But the conservative Polish daily Rzeczpospolita sees challenges for the EU in the higher voter turnout, as it was motivated ""not by large integration projects, like the euro, the EU expansion to the east and the development of the Schengen area"", as before, but by the ""voice of protest against the current principles the Union is following"". Spain's conservative La Razon sees this as reason for the mainstream parties of centre-right and centre-left to reach out to liberal parties and the Greens, in order to ""restrain the Europhobic boom"". Hungary's Magyar Hirlap daily, which supports the country's populist government, says the increase in the populist vote could frustrate the hopes of the leading candidates to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the EU Commission. ""The Commission leadership process appears to have broken down because the traditional party blocs have haemorrhaged support, meaning Manfred Weber, the top candidate of the centre-right European People's Party, and Frans Timmermans of the Socialists, can wave goodbye to their ambitions,"" it says.  Italy's centre-right Il Foglio sees the main centre-right and centre-left blocs uniting around the Danish Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to succeed Mr Juncker. ""She starts in pole position... after the voters decided to mobilise en masse and back the most pro-European parties, and the feared populist wave never materialised,"" it says. Germany's centre-left Sueddeutsche Zeitung sees this as a promising boost for democratic debate.  ""Finding a majority in the European Parliament will be more difficult, but also more exciting - there will be more arguments in Strasbourg and Brussels,"" it says. At the national level, the French press thinks President Emmanuel Macron could gather some comfort from an election that saw his La Republique en Marche! party beaten by Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally. The main centre-right daily Le Figaro see a ""symbolic victory"" that ""wipes out Marine Le Pen's humiliating defeat by Emmanuel Macron two years ago"" in the presidential election.  Nonetheless, La Republique en Marche!'s result is ""proof of the strength and political coherence of the president's electoral base"" only two years after it was formed, the paper says.   ""Even coming in second, even beaten, it is not an accident of history, but still one of the two parties that set the national agenda,"" the left-wing Liberation daily agrees. In Germany, Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the poor showing of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and the slide in support for her Social Democrat coalition partners are ""in line with the European trend"", attributing this to their ""losing touch with many younger voters"". The right-wing tabloid Bild sees the Social Democrats' ""debacle making Merkel's grand coalition stumble"", and wonders ""how much longer the government can hold on"".

risk appetite,The rise and fall of 'Islamic State',2024-09-15,2016-03-09,Jim Muir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35695648,"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul.  ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians.  This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil).  Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.  As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west.  Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed.  Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.  In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.  After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds.  That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.  Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley.  In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.  Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.  The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price.  The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name.  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula.  A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah.  But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment.  The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow.  Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder.  Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.  For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.  Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader.  Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.  Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it.  By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today.  Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.  After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase.  But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004.  The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.  Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.  The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008.  Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies.  Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it.  Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.  Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in.  Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran.  The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in.  They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community.  Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.  Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core.  His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists.  Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military.  As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq.  But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion.  Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of.  The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.  By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq.  They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.  All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad.  The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him.  29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?  What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004.  Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.  Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.  The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam.  Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise.  It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis.  Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.  An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.  With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him.  By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global.  Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism.  A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north.  The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924.  So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.  For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad.  Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts.  Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of Bel and Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq.  It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion.  All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.  A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers.  And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documents published by Der Spiegel in 2015, external give some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.  At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later.  ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders."" This video can not be played Citizen journalists from Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS) describe life in the IS-controlled city A Falluja resident recounted the story of a taxi-driver who had picked up a middle-aged woman not wearing a headscarf. They were stopped at an IS checkpoint,  the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.  ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city. ""Adulterers are stoned to death. Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, Shia militia prisoners are beheaded."" This video can not be played A Raqqa resident describes daily life under so-called Islamic State. An activist based in Raqqa from a group called Al-Sharqiya 24 has been keeping a diary of what life is like under Islamic State group rule.  Life under 'Islamic State': Diaries IS departments carried the organisation's grip into every corner of life, including finance, agriculture, education, transport, health, welfare and utilities.  School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu.  ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways.  As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint.  As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders.  ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

She managed to escape the city and became a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.  This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS.  Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.  But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.  Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army.  Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.  The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed.  The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach.  At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.  The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria.  The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that).  A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to the end of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad.  That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.  It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.  Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank.  ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success.  But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.  In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been a new generation of young militants, external drawn from local sources.  This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike.  He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets.  Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.  ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds.  ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan.  There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else.  Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences.  But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply.  In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS.  In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force.  In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies.  The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners.  Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.  In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in.  It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015.  ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south.  ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling.  In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found.  But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations.  Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants.  The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself.  Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces.  Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient.  In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences.  There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets.  The area around the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria.  But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses.  The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces.  In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province.  Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields.  But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three.  The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years.  IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different.   The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon.  That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS.  Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border.  Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march.  As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages.  Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology.  Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017.  By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour.  But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September.  US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments.  But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames.  So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise?  It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014.  With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing a defiant audio statement in September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence.  ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be.  But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.  ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants.  That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure.  In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before.  The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back.  There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003.  ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul.  ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive.  The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability.  The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul.  And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain.  There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011.  And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them.  Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria.  Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015.  A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia.  But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016.  But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over.  The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted.  Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better.   As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria.  ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed).  The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants.  Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services.  Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack.  While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough.  Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered.  The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge.  ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center.  ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser.  ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance.  Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root.  But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa.  Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, where a detailed survey, external in the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless.  IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.  In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:  the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased  the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam.  ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis.""  Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily.""   Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.  Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed.  ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli.  He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013.  ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups.  But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says.  ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path.  More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.  This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.  The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force.  Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"".  Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq.  ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo].""   ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies.  While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS.  They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever.  While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will.  Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity.  But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious.  By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost.  The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias.  For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus.  It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations.  Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours.  ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis.  ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

risk appetite,Holyrood’s budget watchdog growls,2024-09-15,2022-12-02,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63831950,"To underspend by £1bn is unfortunate. To do so by £2bn looks like carelessness. Or so Oscar Wilde might have said if he were commenting on the Scottish government's accounts for last year. But this wasn't his dramatic dialogue to write. The auditor general was commenting, however, and Stephen Boyle's assessment of the underspend on a £51bn budget was not as harsh as some of the government's critics. About 40% of that was due to money allocated to student loans but not drawn down. A large share of it was due to funds being allocated but not spent on business support grants to help them through Covid, or those grants you could get if financially losing out due to self-isolation. The total budget for handling the pandemic last year came to £5.8bn. It's perverse to criticise government for not paying out money that wasn't needed. At worst, it was a failure of budget planning rather than budget spending. The financial year 2020-21 was a second exceptional period of extra funds pouring into the budget to tackle the pandemic, and some fast manoeuvring to spend it effectively. The auditor general had other issues in his sights, with his comment on the accounts which were published on Thursday. And he highlighted some startling figures where policy had gone badly wrong. Remember that spat with the European Commission, which began in 2019, with the Scottish government accused of failing to fit with the rules for spending the European Social Fund? It reached the point where the Scottish government gave up trying to defend its position. So it has written off £43m. Remember the civil case of malicious prosecution brought against the Crown Office for its handling of the controversial administration of Rangers football club? That has so far cost the government £60m. That's right. Sixty million pounds. It won't take you long to think how that might have been better spent. The Scottish government now controls some welfare benefits, most of which are administered through Whitehall's Department of Work and Pensions. An estimate of overpayments of these devolved benefits comes to £67.5m.  There is no estimate of the overpayment of welfare benefits by the new Social Security Scotland agency. Mr Boyle says there should be, as administration is transferred. Then there are those investments the Scottish government made in trying to shore up troubled firms deemed to be of strategic significance. Prestwick Airport is of strategic significance, at least as a fuelling stop for military flights between the US and points east of here. It was taken over by the Scottish government nine years ago, and for several years turned in sizeable losses. While not much of a passenger airport, it's turning a modest profit these days. But the accounts show that the cost of keeping it open has passed the £50m mark, including £7m of interest on loans that will never be repaid. There was the controversial deal in 2016 with Sanjeev Gupta's complex web of companies that took over steel and aluminium works in Scotland.  The 25-year agreement to guarantee payments for production of energy from the Lochaber hydro scheme that feeds the aluminium smelter near Fort William carries a very high potential cost. That liability means a provision of £114m is made in the accounts. The potential cost per year is up to £32m. There was the loss on the BiFab fabrication plant in Fife, which meant a £37m write-off in previous years' accounts. And there was the notorious cost of the Cal-Mac ferries being built in the government-owned Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow. During the 2021-22 financial year, the government wrote off a further £52m to keep the yard open and to help get the ships finished. The total cost is heading north of £250m, when the original contract was for £97m. By last March, the two ships were valued at only £78m. In comments on previous accounts, Stephen Boyle told the Scottish government that it needed a framework with which to judge the risk tolerance and risk appetite in taking on such companies, particularly because of the lack of flexibility in the budget. Such guidelines have been drawn up. The auditor general would like them to be clearer about risk, and to have less flexibility for ministers to get round them. His main concerns are of the type that auditors can be expected to care about more than most, but they matter for all of us, as government budgets head into some very tight squeezes. The accounts that are published don't cover the Scottish government's agencies. They're not clear about some of its liabilities, including those companies it has taken over. So Mr Boyle is particularly keen to see comprehensive whole-of-government accounts. These were promised in 2016, but six years later, they still have not been produced. He wants to see more transparency in capital borrowing and in the way the Scottish government flexes its finances. He is not the only one to notice how extra millions can be found down the back of the St Andrew's House sofa, and he wants MSPs, in scrutinising budgets, to be given a better idea of how that is done. The auditor general is calling for a comprehensive workforce plan, warning that tight budgets can take a mental health toll on civil servants. And he is concerned about the governance of government. There's been change at the top, but he warns of unnecessary duplication and inefficiency in handling decision-making. Much of this is going to become all the more relevant in less than two weeks when John Swinney, as acting finance secretary, sets out his draft budget for the next financial year. And in emphasising the need for a fuller picture of the whole of government's spending, risks and liabilities, Stephen Boyle doesn't hold back in arguing that the need for it has never been greater: ""The consequences of the pandemic, challenging global economic conditions, the cost of living crisis together with existing pressures in public services all pose significant risks to the sustainability of Scotland's public finances,"" says his report. A fuller set of accounts will be ""important for decision-making over the longer term as it will provide information about the impact of past decisions on future budgets, the potential risk to financial sustainability, the scale of assets and liabilities and the opportunity to re-think how public finances are managed as the Scottish government seeks to deliver public service reform"". It's worth dwelling a while over the words ""the opportunity to re-think how public finances are managed"". In response to the audit report, Mr Swinney emphasised the careful management required to avoid an overspend, the upheaval of the pandemic and ""an extremely challenging time for the public sector"". The deputy first minister also pointed to the auditor general's recognition of a strengthened focus on longer-term financial planning. ""The Scottish government is committed to producing additional accounts and the auditor general's report recognises the steps we have taken,"" Mr Swinney said. ""Progress has been slower than planned as we prioritised work on tackling the current exceptional financial challenges."" So the Scottish government says it is committed to improved transparency. Its watchdog wants to see that made clear."
risk appetite,"Rise in tourism at wartime wreck, operators say",2024-09-15,2022-02-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-60416597,"Visitor numbers to a wartime shipwreck full of explosives have increased after reports it will be partially removed, according to local tour operators.   The cargo ship SS Richard Montgomery was anchored in Sheerness, Kent, when it grounded in the Thames Estuary and broke up in 1944. In 2020 contractors were sought to remove the above water masts from the vessel.  The Department for Transport would not comment on a removal timetable. Martin Hamer, who runs tours out to the wreck, said: ""We are normally very, very quiet up until around April time - this has blown up beyond all our expectations."" ""There seems to be an appetite for seeing the ship,"" he added. The Department for Transport (DfT) said contractors are undertaking surveys and risk assessments of the site with the help of two Royal Navy specialists before any removal takes place.  The wreck, which is packed with 1,400 tonnes of explosives, is monitored round the clock by port authorities and protected by a 500m exclusion zone. Richard Bain, managing director of Jetstream Tours, has also seen an increase in interest in visits to the wreck site.  Mr Bain said: ""Normally at this time of year we would be concentrating on other routes and preparing for dry dock. We're being asked for trips out there mainly from photography groups and the general public.  ""Seeing the masts gives you a sense of the dangers that lurk beneath the water and whilst the ship is still laden with bombs, having the masts there helps to see something tangible in front of them."" The DfT said: ""We continue to monitor the wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery closely and it is understood that it is in a relatively stable condition."" ""Expert wreck assessors are now undertaking detailed surveys which will inform future work to reduce the height of the masts.""  Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

risk appetite,Journalists attacked at Israeli march in Jerusalem,2024-09-15,2023-05-18,By Tom Bateman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65631330,"Thousands of Israeli nationalists have marched into the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, with violence directed at media covering the event. The flag parade is part of Israel's Jerusalem Day, marking its capture of the east of the city in the 1967 war. A group of marchers threw stones, sticks and bottles at Palestinian and foreign journalists at the Damascus Gate entrance.  They also cheered and chanted racist slogans, including ""Death to Arabs"". Far-right Israeli cabinet ministers joined the procession. One of them, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, declared: ""Jerusalem is ours for ever."" Palestinians along the route in occupied East Jerusalem earlier shuttered homes and shops over fears of abuse. The march has increasingly become a show of force for Jewish ultranationalists, while for Palestinians it is seen as a blatant provocation undermining their ties to the city. Racist, anti-Arab chants are often shouted by nationalist marchers. The event has in the past sparked much wider violence. Israeli police vowed to stop law-breaking, but blamed regional ""terrorist elements"" for ""wild incitement"" about the march on social media. They also said it was only ""a small minority on both sides [who] try to agitate"". Palestinian Authority leaders called the East Jerusalem events a ""provocative act"", saying far-right cabinet ministers Mr Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - staunch supporters of the parade - were ""planting seeds of conflict"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the event would go ahead as planned.  Along the route in the Old City, Samir Abu Sbeih pulled down the shutters of his sweet shop, saying that police had advised Palestinian businesses to do so by mid-afternoon. ""It's not their land to celebrate,"" he said of the march. ""We live under occupation and that's why we have to accept it."" Kebab restaurant owner Basti, who did not want to give his full name, said the event had become ""worse"" over the years.  ""People, when they dance with the flag, sometimes they try to put the flag in your face, sometimes they spit on your face. And this is not nice."" He said police told him he was not being forced to close, but that if he kept his business open, it would be at his own risk.  ""For me, I just want to be inside. I don't like problems, for both sides,"" he said. Jerusalem Day events have been marked by Israelis for decades, but in recent years, parts of the route have been the focus of spiralling tensions. In the late afternoon, tens of thousands of Israelis headed from the west of Jerusalem to the Old City, ending with a so-called flag dance at the Western Wall, the holiest site for Jewish prayer.  Before that, marchers went their separate ways and thousands of mainly men and teenage boys headed into East Jerusalem.  They walked through Damascus Gate, which Israeli forces usually clear of Palestinians in advance, and then into the Old City's Muslim Quarter.  Previous years have seen groups of marchers chant ""death to Arabs"" and ""may your village burn"", while others banged the shutters of Palestinian shops. One of the marchers, Pini, who didn't want to give his surname, said he had attended for decades to mark the day ""Jerusalem was reunited and returned to the hands of the Jewish people"".  ""From 1948 to 1967, we were prevented from accessing the Western Wall,"" he said referring to the period that East Jerusalem was under Jordanian control. ""We returned to the Western Wall,"" he added. Asked about a threatening atmosphere for Palestinians, he said he opposed any harassment. But, echoing highly controversial comments this year from a far-right minister, he added: ""There is no such thing as a Palestinian people; when was Palestine established? Is there a Palestinian king? Is there a Palestinian currency?""  Palestinian militant group Hamas warned Israel this week that it would reignite conflict, were it to cross ""red lines"" in Jerusalem during the event.

risk appetite,The lure of the get-rich-quick scam in Kenya,2024-09-15,2021-06-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57255600,"In our series of letters from African journalists, Kenyan broadcaster Waihiga Mwaura writes about cryptocurrency scams, including one that traded on his name to fleece investors. I got a call from a doctor I did not know, asking whether I had interviewed a Kenyan billionaire about a new Bitcoin product on some nondescript website. I sighed with concern because I knew he had fallen victim to a two-year-old online scam which alleged that along with a local billionaire, I had endorsed a cryptocurrency trading platform. Despite my best efforts to warn Kenyans about the scam via my social media platforms, it seems that the conmen had kept changing web addresses and strategies to target vulnerable Kenyans, who wake up hopeful that the day will bear better tidings. In what is a mix of high appetite for risk - and desperation - many fall for Ponzi schemes that initially seem like an answer to prayer. The latest scam to be unearthed in Kenya was around the app named Amazon Web Worker Africa, which claimed to be an affiliate of Amazon Inc and was accessible via a mobile and web application. It had nothing to do with the global retail giant. A few weeks back, investors in Amazon Web Worker woke up to find the app had been deleted from the Google Play Store without official communication and their investment, for some running into thousands of dollars, was now inaccessible. The proposal had been simple - get paid for referring others to the app and also get paid for saving your money on the app. You were promised a percentage of returns as your principal investment remained safe. As soon as the app vanished, hundreds of Kenyans flooded various social media platforms to express their concerns, with some lamenting that close friends and family had introduced them to the ""investment opportunity"".  The good news was that the Kenyan authorities have announced the arrest of a 50-year-old American alleged to be involved in what became known as the ""Amazon Web Worker scam"".  Police said she was suspected to be part of a syndicate and would be charged with money laundering and cyber-fraud. Her arrest - which took place after she flew into the main airport in the capital, Nairobi - has given hope to some investors that their money will be recovered.  Investment scams in Kenya have now become common and this might have something to do with the rate of unemployment. Pre-pandemic data from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics shows that 40% of Kenyan youth lacked jobs in February 2020 and, with the pandemic in its third wave, the employment situation is now even worse, though the latest data has not yet been released. The scams come in all shapes and sizes - from lucrative land deals, once-in-a-lifetime farming investments, off-plan housing bonanzas, online forex trading schemes and even, puzzlingly, cryptocurrency mining schemes.   The cryptocurrency trading arena has also been dogged by controversy with two Bitcoin Ponzi schemes collapsing in Kenya over the last two years. In one of the cryptocurrency scams investors, mostly Kenyans, are said to have lost more than $25m, and have not recovered their money. I spoke to an investor who lost nearly $30,000 (£21,000) to an African cryptocurrency scheme and, to my surprise, he reckoned that his appetite for risk would still drive him to give it another shot if the offer was good enough. If people have such a mentality, then it is no wonder that they keep losing money.  Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"
risk appetite,Chickenpox jab offered on the High Street,2024-09-15,2017-07-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40592297,"Vaccinations against chickenpox are to be offered on the High Street for the first time.  Superdrug will be offering it at 58 of its specialist pharmacist stores at the cost of £130 for a two-dose course.  The vaccine is only available on the NHS for people at high risk of spreading the virus to those with weakened immune systems.  The NHS says a routine childhood chickenpox vaccine would raise the risk of more serious infections in adults.  Ninety per cent of people catch the chickenpox virus by the age of 15 and in most cases it is uncomfortable but leaves no lasting effects.  Symptoms include an itchy red rash of spots and blisters, and a fever, as well as tiredness, nausea, headache, muscle ache and loss of appetite. People who catch the virus as a child normally become immune for life, although one in three adults can develop shingles.  Adults can still contract the virus but symptoms and possible complications are usually more serious, including the risk of pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis. The NHS said a chickenpox vaccine is not offered as part of routine immunisations as it would leave unvaccinated children more susceptible to contracting the virus as an adult.  There could also be a significant increase in shingles cases as being exposed to infected children boosts immunity to this. People have for some years been able to pay to get the vaccine from a variety of sources outside of the NHS such as travel clinics.  Dr Pixie McKenna, a TV doctor who advises Superdrug, said: ""Chickenpox is often seen as a rite of passage in childhood resulting in anything from a very mild to a more serious infection in different people. Even in straightforward cases, spot picking can lead to long-term scarring which can linger long after the infection is gone.  ""A chickenpox immunisation has been available for many years but not on the High Street until now. Having suffered from severe chicken pox at the age of 19, I would far rather have undergone the vaccine than be struck down with the infection!"" The vaccine will be available in 58 Superdrug stores, across the UK.  The store recommends two injections, four to eight weeks apart.  Chickenpox immunisation has been available in the US for children under 13 for 20 years and research by the Paediatric Infectious Diseases Society shows it has seen hospitalisations due to the disease fall by 93%.

risk appetite,Does pornography still drive the internet?,2024-09-15,2019-06-04,By Tim Harford,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48283409,"Consider the opening lines of The Internet is for Porn, a song from the Broadway musical Avenue Q.   Kate Monster: ""The internet is really, really great."" Trekkie Monster: ""For porn!"" Kate Monster: ""I got a fast connection so I didn't have to wait."" Trekkie Monster: ""For porn!"" Innocent kindergarten teacher Kate Monster is trying to celebrate the usefulness of the internet for shopping and sending birthday greetings.  Meanwhile, her surly neighbour Trekkie Monster insists that people really value it more for more intimate activities.  Is he right? Sort of... but not really.  50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast. Credible-seeming statistics suggest that about one in seven web searches is for pornography. This is not trivial - but of course it means that six in seven web searches are not. The most-visited pornography website - Pornhub - is roughly as popular as the likes of Netflix and LinkedIn. That's pretty popular but still only enough to rank 28th in the world when I checked. But Avenue Q was first performed in 2003, an age ago in internet terms, and Trekkie Monster might have been more correct back then.  New technologies often tend to be expensive and unreliable. They need to find a niche market of early adopters, whose custom helps the technology to develop.  Once it is cheaper and more reliable, it finds a bigger market, and a much broader range of uses.  There is a theory that pornography played this role in the development of the internet, and a whole range of other technologies. Does it stack up? How credit cards changed the way we spend  How seller feedback helped build eBay, Uber and AirBnB  Just Google it: The student project that changed the world  The surprising ways video games have shaped the economy  Since the very dawn of art, sex has always been a subject. Prehistoric cave-painters record buttocks, breasts, vulvas and comically large penises.  Carvings of copulating couples date back at least 11,000 years, to goat herders in Judea.   About 4,000 years ago, a Mesopotamian artist lovingly crafted a terracotta plaque of a man and woman having sex as she sips beer through a straw.  A couple of millennia later, the Moche in northern Peru depicted intercourse through the medium of ceramics. India's Kama Sutra dates from about the same time.  But just because people used the arts and crafts to depict erotica does not mean it was the driving force behind these techniques. There's no reason to think it was. Consider Gutenberg's printing press. Although titillating books were certainly printed, the main market for reading material was religious.   A more plausible candidate, leaping ahead to the 19th Century, is photography.  Pioneering studios in Paris did a roaring trade in so-called ""art studies"", a euphemism the authorities didn't always accept.  Customers were willing to pay enough to fund the technology: for a time, it cost more to buy an erotic photograph than to hire a prostitute.  The word ""pornography"" derives from the Greek for ""writing"" and ""prostitutes"".  By the time of the next big technological breakthrough in artistic expression - the moving picture - the word had taken on its modern meaning.  But pornography didn't really drive the film industry, for obvious reasons.  Films were expensive. You needed a big audience to recoup your costs. That meant public viewings.  And while many people paid to look at pornographic pictures in the privacy of their home, far fewer people were comfortable watching an adult film in a public cinema.   One solution came in the 1960s with the peepshow booth - an enclosed space where you'd put coins in a slot to keep a film playing.  One booth could bring in several thousand dollars a week.   But the real privacy breakthrough came thanks to the video cassette recorder (VCR).  In his book The Erotic Engine, writer Patchen Barss argues the VCR meant pornography ""came into its own as an economic and technological powerhouse"".  At first, VCRs were a hard sell: they were pricey, and they came in two incompatible formats - VHS and Betamax.  Who would risk plunging a significant chunk of cash into a device that might soon be obsolete? People who really wanted to watch adult films at home, that's who.  In the late 1970s, most videotape sales were pornographic.  Within a few years, the technology was more affordable for people who wanted to watch family films - and as the market expanded, pornography's share of it shrank.  A similar story can be told about cable television - and, yes, the internet.  Older readers might remember when getting online meant coaxing a dial-up modem into establishing a connection, then fretting about phone charges as it slowly chugged through a file that would nowadays download in the snap of a finger.  What would motivate an ordinary person to persevere? You've guessed it.  One 1990s study of Usenet discussion groups suggested five in six images shared were pornographic.   A few years later, research into internet chat rooms indicated a similar proportion of activity devoted to sex.   So in those days, Trekkie Monster's analysis wouldn't have been far wrong.  And, as he suggests to Kate, appetite for pornography helped to drive demand for faster connections: better modems and higher bandwidth.  It spurred innovation in other areas, too. Online pornography providers were pioneers in web technologies, such as video file compression and user-friendly payment systems, and in business models, such as affiliate marketing programmes.   All these ideas went on to find much wider uses. And as the internet expanded, it gradually became less for pornography and more for all that other stuff.  Nowadays, the internet is making life hard for professional pornographers.  Just as it's hard to sell a newspaper subscription or a music video when so much is available free online, it's hard to sell pornography when sites such as Pornhub are giving it away.  Much of this free pornography is pirated and it's an uphill struggle to get the illegally uploaded content removed, as Jon Ronson chronicles in his podcast series The Butterfly Effect.  One emerging niche is to produce ""custom"" pornography, for clients such as the man who paid adult star Casey Calvert - and others - to contemptuously destroy his stamp collection on film.  But, of course, what's bad for the content creators is good for the aggregator platforms, which make their money through advertising and premium subscriptions.  The big player in pornography at the moment is a company called Mindgeek, which owns Pornhub and several other top adult websites.  Its absolute dominance of the market is a problem, according to Prof Marina Adshade, of the Vancouver School of Economics, author of Dollars and Sex: How economics influences sex and love. ""Having a single buyer has put pressure on producers to lower the price of their films,"" she says. ""This hasn't just cut into pornographers' profits, it has radically changed the work of porn actors, who are now under greater pressure to perform acts that they would have been able to refuse in the past - and at a lower price."" In Avenue Q, Trekkie Monster appears to do nothing all day but surf for pornography, so the other characters are surprised when he reveals he's a multi-millionaire.  His explanation? ""In volatile market, only stable investment is… porn!"" And, once again, Trekkie Monster is nearly right, but not quite.  For sure, there's money in pornography.  But the best way to make it may be to invest in the technologies that enable it and which it enables. In the past, that meant Parisian photo studios or companies making VCRs or high-speed modems; today, Mindgeek's algorithms that suggest content and keep eyeballs on screens.  And what will Trekkie Monster be singing in the future? ""Robots are for porn"", perhaps?   The role of sex in accelerating technology is unlikely to be finished yet.

risk appetite,Tranmere shock Watford to set up Man Utd tie,2024-09-15,2020-01-13,Phil Dawkes,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51092335,"This video can not be played FA Cup: Watch highlights as Tranmere stun Watford with an extra-time win League One Tranmere shocked Premier League Watford in an FA Cup third-round replay to set up a tie against 12-time winners Manchester United. In a game rescheduled from earlier in the month because of a waterlogged pitch, Rovers capitalised on a hugely under-strength Hornets and best navigated a dire, sand-covered Prenton Park surface to finally settle the tie in extra time. Substitute striker Paul Mullin, who came off the bench to score a late penalty at Vicarage Road and complete a remarkable Rovers comeback from 3-0 down to set up this replay, went one better with a headed winner 14 minutes into the extra 30. The Hornets had come back themselves in normal time, with Kaylen Hinds firing in through a mass of players to level after Manny Monthe had given the home side the lead. The silver lining for Nigel Pearson's side is that they will not have to play what would have been a fourth game in nine days in the fourth round on Sunday, and will instead be able to focus all their efforts on avoiding relegation from the top flight. Tranmere, though, get to do this all over again at the weekend, hosting Manchester United with an even greater shock in mind and on a pitch unlike any other the Red Devils will have played on this campaign.  This video can not be played Tranmere edge closer to a big cup upset as Mullin scores in extra time against Watford This FA Cup run has been something to savour in what has been an otherwise tough season back in League One for Tranmere. The club have been on an upward trajectory over the past two campaigns, returning to the Football League in 2018-19 after three seasons in the National League and then following that up with a second successive promotion to the third tier. But they have won just five of 25 league games since then and sit 21st in the League One table. However, both the original tie and this replay have showcased the battling spirit that Micky Mellon has instilled in his players. And on a sandy, rapidly deteriorating surface such as this, that appetite for battle was key. They won tackles, stuck a boot in where their opponents would not and remained alive to the opportunities that chaos can create in a minefield of a penalty area. Blackett-Taylor and 37-year-old veteran midfielder Neil Danns both went close before defender Monthe - also a scorer in the original tie - struck his opener in the first half, and they did not wilt when Watford levelled in the second. They could easily have won the tie in normal time, but Mullin hit the outside of the post from a tight angle and Danns fired just past the far post with seconds left. They were not to be denied, though, as Mullin timed his run to perfection to meet a flicked on cross from Liam Ridehalgh and head his side into the fourth round and the chance to show what they have got against a struggling Manchester United. ""I don't think it's an opportunity because of the form United are in. I know they have a threat. We have to make sure we are ready,"" said Mellon. ""We will give it everything we have got. There is no doubt we will be up against a good side. ""We have to go out there and understand that is what will come here. They are an unbelievable football club and we are a League One club, at the bottom end of League One, but we are going to give it everything we've got. ""We will try to represent the club again and the players will run their socks off again and who knows?"" Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side will not relish the prospect of facing Tranmere on this pitch. The FA Cup represents one of United's main potential avenues to silverware this season and you would therefore expect Solskjaer to field a stronger XI than Watford did for this game. But they will face the same, alien problems of inconsistent bounce and roll on a surface that is as much sand as grass. Plus, they come into the tie at arguably the lowest moment of Solskjaer's time at the club, having meekly lost their last two games - at fierce rivals Liverpool and then at home against Burnley. Clearly, Solskjaer has the superior players at his disposal but Tranmere will have the bit between their teeth and a leveller beneath their feet. Kaylen Hinds joined Watford in August 2019 following a spell in Germany with Wolfsburg Precariously placed in the Premier League and having just lost at relegation rivals Villa, this was a game Watford could have done without, and one they should have avoided in the first place. Leading 3-0 at half-time in the original fixture at Vicarage Road, their place in round four was essentially booked, before their second-half capitulation allowed Tranmere parity and a replay. When the elements then intervened and the game on 14 January was postponed, it left the Hornets facing a horror run of fixtures at a crucial juncture in their season. No wonder then that Pearson opted to make so many changes from the defeat at Villa, with Christian Kabasele, Jose Holebas and Andre Gray the most recognisable first-team figures in a team largely comprised of under-23 players. As an indication of how deeply the Watford boss dug into his squad, the average shirt number for the 18 named in the match-day squad was 38, with the highest on display the 72 sported by unused substitute Andi Janjeva. None of them particularly covered themselves in glory, never fully getting to grips with their opponents or environment. Teenage Brazilian forward Joao Pedro showed the briefest of flashes and drew a good save out of home keeper Scott Davies, who was also called into action to superbly palm away a curling Callum Whelan shot in extra time, while Holebas hit the post with an angled drive. But these were rare moments of attacking flair in an encounter that will be quickly forgotten if the returning first team can return to winning ways in the league in nine days' time. ""It was a tough game,"" said Pearson. ""We learned a lot about our young players tonight and I thought the senior players were excellent. ""Congratulations to Tranmere. For people who possibly thought we weren't too interested in it, we were but we couldn't risk too many first-team players."" Pearson also dismissed any notion that the pitch was to blame for the loss, adding; ""It is the same for everyone. They showed a lot of energy and desire. In the first half we were second-best in terms of desire."" Monthe scored the opener and then stood tall to help keep Watford at bay with four clearances Tranmere welcome Manchester United to Prenton Park for the fourth-round tie, kicking off at 15:00 GMT on Sunday. Watford get a short break from action to lick their wounds before hosting Everton in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 February. The FA Cup"
risk appetite,How can we make washing machines last?,2024-09-15,2021-03-03,By Maddy Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56167505,"When his family washing machine stopped working just a few months outside its warranty, Johan Rääf was less than impressed. ""It was really strange because it's not been used every day, or not even that much,"" says the 36-year-old from Stockholm. Like many Swedish parents, Mr Rääf deals with the constant stream of laundry generated by his two small children by using the larger communal washers available in his apartment block, alongside the machine in his own flat. ""So, it was a problem that needed to be fixed, but it wasn't like my life depended on it,"" he laughs. He paid a local repair firm 1,500 Swedish krona (£130; $180) to provide and fit a replacement part the following day; making use of a Swedish tax break which halves the cost of hiring people to repair white goods in your home. But fixing things that break down often isn't that easy, cost-effective or even desirable. Most of us tend to replace things that break instead of mending them. More Technology of Business According to iFixit, which campaigns for the right-to-repair, at least 30% of electric and electronic products are discarded when they are still in a repairable state. This kind of rubbish is becoming one of the world's fastest growing waste streams. Many customers don't repair household items simply because they have become more affordable to produce and buy new, in recent decades, says Thomas Opsomer, a spokesperson for iFixit. He estimates that the price of a new washing machine adjusted for inflation is between 10 and 20 times cheaper now than it would have been in the 1960s.  ""If a new appliance is very cheap, then already that makes the case for repair harder,"" he says. At Lund University in southern Sweden, sustainable business researcher Jessika Luth Richter says there's also been a big cultural shift in how we value things we own.  We live in an ""age of fast consumption"" where gadgets have become viewed as ""disposable"" and ""it's fashionable to upgrade our products to the latest models available"", she says.  Meanwhile, brands are in tough competition with one another, and seek to lure us in with special offers and speedy delivery options to encourage us to buy new products and enjoy the ""instant gratification or instant hit"". Washing machine makers might not agree with that. Britain's Ebac already designs its washing machines to last 10 years. Founder and chief executive John Elliott thinks most washing machines are ""quite well built"", but does have his doubts about the cheapest ones on the market. ""There's some cheap washing machines - they sell them at a price lower than we can buy the components. That tells you something, doesn't it?"" While Mr Rääf was able to find a company in his Stockholm neighbourhood to fix his washing machine, Ms Luth Richter says the number of local repair stores has fallen across Europe, as our appetite for this kind of fast consumption has grown. That means even customers who want to live more sustainably can find it hard to source the expertise to fix broken products at an affordable price. iFixit's research suggests people aren't willing to pay repair costs that amount to more than 30% of the price of a new product. ""What most of them are feeling is that they don't know what it will cost and they don't know when they can get it [repaired]. And that makes all the difference,"" agrees Måns Ljungmark, a manager at Swedish appliance brand Electrolux, which has its headquarters in Stockholm. The company's actively trying to encourage more customers to fix broken products as it tries to become a more sustainable business. It has increased its online and phone advice, to help enable customers to carry out simple repairs themselves. Plus, it is trialling a £150 (1,785kr) flat fee repairs service in parts of Sweden and in Denmark.  ""We are taking a risk because some repairs are more expensive and some repairs are less expensive, because we want to enable repairs,"" says Mr Ljungmark. The initiative could drive down profits from new sales, he accepts, but he hopes the business will still benefit in the long run, from ""building loyalty and trust"". So far the flat-fee service is proving popular, with a 20% increase in bookings during 2020. In Sweden, it's been enabled by the same tax break Johan Rääf used to fix his washing machine. White goods repairs have increased steadily since they were included in the scheme (known as ROT) in 2017, and jumped by 16% in 2020.  There's a lack of data on customer motivations, but the Swedish Tax Agency and manufacturers like Electrolux speculate that job losses and economic uncertainty brought on by the pandemic may be encouraging more people to repair rather than splash out on newer products. Sustainability campaigners want more countries to offer similar tax incentives or other ""economic levers"" to help promote repairs. But with public finances already squeezed during the pandemic, that could be a challenge even for governments with a strong environmental agenda.  Another method is punishing manufacturers that make it deliberately tricky to repair products. In the EU a new law has just come in, forcing firms to supply spare parts for machines for up to 10 years and to design products to make them longer-lasting. The rules apply to washing machines, dishwashers, fridges and lighting. Repairs should be possible with commonly-available tools and without damaging the product. Campaigners say it is a step in the right direction. But the law doesn't specify anything about the price of parts. Plus only professionals, not consumers, will be able carry out the repairs, a move backed by manufacturers who were worried about risk and liability. At iFixit, Mr Opsomer is also worried that as products in our homes become more high-tech and connected, this could ""introduce new possibilities for failure and make things harder to fix"". But manufacturers like Electrolux argue the opposite. Måns Ljungmark says that as our household products become smarter, this will actually help enable repairs and longevity. For example, if your dishwasher can suggest when you need to rinse a filter, this may prevent a future breakdown.  However this still leaves consumers with a dilemma: buy a shiny new smart product designed to enable sustainability, or repair something older with fewer functions. Sustainability specialists insist it is almost always both cheaper and more sustainable to stick with what you've got. If you throw away a product, you're both contributing to the two billion tonnes of rubbish the world generates each year, and adding to the planet's carbon footprint by buying a new item, often made from newly-mined materials.  But experts are split on whether profit-driven companies or fast-consuming customers will really be able to adjust their habits. ""As long as it is more profitable for a company to sell a new product than to repair that product, a company will be under very much pressure from their shareholders to do just that,"" argues Mr Opsomer.  Jessika Luth Richter is more optimistic that it will become both easier and trendier to fix stuff in future. ""The more people that are repairing and are choosing to buy repair services or more repairable products, the more we will see this becoming mainstream,"" she says.  ""And it used to be mainstream. So that's what makes me positive too, that. It is in some ways a return to what we used to be able as a society to do more of."""
risk appetite,Virus forces offline sex workers to start again online,2024-09-15,2020-04-06,By Sebastian Shehadi and Miriam Partington,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52183773,"Most sex workers meet customers in person. For them, the coronavirus spells economic ruin. ""The virus is a disaster for client-facing businesses - and sex work is no different,"" says Goddess Cleo, a dominatrix from London. ""Most of my income is generated from one-on-one sessions and events. I [normally] only make a bit of money through online avenues.""  But like many others, Cleo has switched focus to digital since the lockdown came into effect. Online dominatrix Eva de Vil says: ""There's lots of new girls joining the scene right now - or offline sex workers moving online to help with finances."" And she has seen a growing appetite from her clientele for isolation-themed roleplay ""clips"" - on-demand videos not filmed live. ""It's not so hard for established cam girls like me to adapt to coronavirus. We're used to working [online] and from home,"" she adds. But for many client-facing sex workers, moving online is not a simple solution.  ""It's not about flashing ya nipple and earning big bucks"", wrote UK sex worker Gracey on Twitter.  ""It takes ages to gain an online following and even longer for [them] to buy your content."" Using the online platforms means having to give them a cut of earnings. And there is a need to invest in equipment, including ""tripod, decent lighting, sex toys, et cetera"", which can be challenging to acquire during the lockdown. ""The marketing requires so much effort, it is unreal,"" Gracey says. ""I'm not brave enough to [be] naked online and [receive audience] criticism.  ""The emotional labour that goes into camming is unreal - constantly chatting, trying to be yourself [and] pleasant."" Privacy is another concern.  It is much harder to hide one's identity online and video content can be stolen. In February, for example, London-based OnlyFans saw 1.5TB of content-makers' pre-recorded videos and images leaked. UK sex worker Lizzy says camming has become even more competitive since the pandemic began. And data from the world's largest ""camming"" websites supports this. Max Bennett, from the Stripchat website, where audiences pay to watch livestreamed sex, says: ""Adult performers are moving to livecams, as traditional [markets] have largely shut down."" US-based livestreaming site Chaturbate has reported a 75% rise in the number of sex workers signing up since the outbreak began - an increase faster than the rate at which audience traffic is rising.  ""We're seeing traffic changes worldwide, especially in lockdown areas,"" Max says. ""For those who live alone, we'll see more traffic. ""But in [homes] with roommates or family situations, it may be more complicated."" To drive demand, some online sex workers are taking special measures.  ""I've seen quite a lot of girls running discounts,"" Eva says. ""We're sensitive to [customers'] drop in income - although I don't yet see any evidence of a dip in spending.""  Camming websites are also taking action.  StripChat, for example, is handing out hundreds of free tokens to new viewers worldwide, enough for each recipient to pay a sex worker for a 10-minute private session. ""By acting as a central bank, we can increase the money supply and help the new wave of performers survive the crisis,"" Max says. ""We've also doubled our payouts to our Italian models.  ""As a social network of over 60 million people a month, we have a tremendous platform to [help] keep users off the streets."" But for some sex workers, the costs and challenges of moving online are simply too large. ""There are sex workers still meeting clients in person because they don't have a choice,"" Lizzy says. ""That anyone has to choose between having enough money to live on and risking their and others' health during a pandemic is ridiculous."" Some support is available to these workers.  For example, Butterfly - an Asian and migrant sex worker support network - has published a Covid-19 guide that recommends sexual positions that minimise face-to-face contact, among other precautions.  But the nature of the industry makes it difficult for workers to tap into government schemes to compensate self-employed workers for lost earnings. Prostitution itself is not illegal in England, Wales and Scotland - though it is unlawful to pay for sex in Northern Ireland - but the trade is often cash in hand and unrecorded. In the US, the massive Covid-19 bailout bill explicitly excludes legal sex workers from protection. According to the English Collective of Prostitutes, many sex workers are single mothers already made poorer by austerity measures - and the coronavirus is now exacerbating their situation. With these concerns in mind, hundreds of online initiatives have popped up worldwide, such as the Covid-19 hardship fund from Swarm, a UK sex worker-led collective.  It says it has already used donations to support 234 sex workers in need The long-term solution, however, is for better government support for sex workers, says Goddess Cleo.  ""When sex work is treated as actual work  and fully decriminalised, sex workers will have access to the same human rights as every other worker,"" she says."

He is due to give evidence in the inquest. Poppi's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was the first person to give evidence at the second inquest at County Hall in Kendal. The new inquest was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"".  Alison Hewitt, counsel for the coroner, asked the mother what Poppi was like. She said: ""[Poppi] was very alive, bubbly and funny. You knew she was there."" She also said she had a good appetite, regular naps and was starting to walk. She said Poppi was like the family's ""alarm clock"" and usually woke ""bright and early"" every day between 05:30 and 06:00. On 12 December, a recording of the mother calling 999 just before 06:00 GMT was played to the hearing. She can be heard saying: ""Come on baby, come on Poppi, keep going"".  She can also be heard relaying instructions from the 999 call handler to Mr Worthington who was attempting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compressions. She told the operator: ""Ambulance please. My baby's not breathing, she's gone blue. ""She's not been well, on and off, last few days."" The call handler responds, asking her to keep calm before giving instructions to lie the child flat on her back, check her airways and begin CPR. The mother tells her partner: ""Oh my God. Two breaths, 30 pumps. Keep going until the ambulance arrives. ""Come on Poppi. Come on baby. Come on ambulance please. Please come on. ""What's wrong with her, Paul? She's not breathing."" Paramedics are then heard arriving in the background at the end of the call, which lasted up to 10 minutes. More than an hour later, Poppi was confirmed dead at Furness General Hospital. The day before, Poppi had started showing signs of a cold, which had already affected the rest of the family, the mother told the hearing.  During dinner that night Poppi ""threw herself back and just screamed out"", the mother said. She said Poppi was ""screaming as though something was painful"" and as if she had a sore stomach. After an unusual bowel movement, Poppi was fine, the coroner heard. She said she had never found Poppi's pyjama bottoms. The coroner asked her if she had specifically looked for them and she said she had. The mother later told the inquest she did not know an allegation had been made that Poppi had been sexually assaulted when she made the statement. Ms Hewitt also asked the mother about injuries discovered in Poppi's post-mortem examination including a fractured leg. She said she did not know what caused them. Gillian Irving QC, who represents the mother, asked her if Poppi was ever taken into her parents' bed. ""No"", the mother replied. She said Poppi was too small and was at risk of suffocation if she was put in the bed with the adults. Nicola Lynn, the paramedic who attended the house, said as soon as she saw Poppi she could see the girl was in cardiac arrest. Tests in the ambulance showed she no longer had a pulse. Once Poppi had been removed from the ambulance Ms Lynn said she could see ""bright red"" blood on the sheet where she had been lying. She said Mr Worthington travelled in the ambulance with Poppi and he said: ""She's gone hasn't she."" Ms Lynn later saw him at the hospital and she said he appeared ""shell-shocked"". The hearing, which is expected to last three weeks, continues."
risk appetite,Top five celeb 'diets to avoid' in 2018,2024-09-15,2017-12-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42264838,"The British Dietetic Association has released a list of diets they say we should steer clear of in the new year.  They include the Raw Vegan, Alkaline, Pioppi and Ketogenic diets, as well as Katie Price's Nutritional Supplements.  Sian Porter from the BDA said: ""If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.""  The British Nutrition Foundation agreed that the five diets are best avoided, while Dr Aseem Malhotra, author of The Pioppi diet, defended his meal plan. Gwyneth Paltrow, Megan Fox and Sting have all come out in support of a vegan diet of uncooked foods.   Supporters define raw food as anything that has not been refined, canned or chemically processed, and has not been heated above 48C. They argue that applying heat destroys some of the natural enzymes in food and that the body therefore needs to do more work to break the food down.  They also say you lose nutrients through this process.  But Mrs Porter said: ""People think that vegan is shorthand for healthy, but it requires careful planning to make sure you don't miss out on important nutrients."" The NHS suggests vegans consider taking vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements. Heat also brings out the nutrients in some foods, such as carrots while others, such as potatoes, cannot be eaten raw.  Tom Brady and the Duchess of York have been famous proponents of the alkaline diet.  The diet is based on the theory that you can change the pH balance (level of acidity) of your body and blood through the food that you eat - despite there currently being no substantial evidence to suggest that this is possible. Advocates have claimed that high levels of ""excess acid"" in the body contribute to a range of health conditions including arthritis, osteoporosis, kidney and liver disorders, and even cancer. They suggest eating ""alkaline foods"", primarily fruit and vegetables, to correct this. But, according to Cancer Research UK, while eating more fruit and vegetables may help you lose weight, the pH of your food will not impact the pH of your blood. Mrs Porter said: ""So if it works to lose weight, it's because you're cutting down on calories.""  The NHS says that the alkaline diet lacks evidence, and advises against cutting out whole food groups, as some versions of the diet suggest.  Katie Price has released a range of hydration, breakfast and meal replacement shakes.  According to the website, the drinks support muscle tone and maintenance as well as decreasing snacking and cravings.  Mrs Porter said: ""The problem is people need to reintroduce food so you want something you can stick to."" While rapid weight loss can be motivating, the BDA said it is unsustainable and that appetite suppressors are not a healthy or advisable way of losing weight. Sarah Coe from the BNF said: ""Meal replacement products can be useful for people that have a lot of weight to lose, but should always be used under supervision from a health professional."" Katie Price Nutrition did not respond to a BBC request for comment.  The Pioppi diet claims to promote the principles of the Mediterranean diet to promote weight loss and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The authors, Dr Aseem Malhotra and Donal O'Neill, recommend a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet with fruit and vegetables, fish, olive oil, alcohol in moderation and exercise.  They suggest intermittent fasting and discourage eating red meat, starchy carbs, and sweetened treats. The BDA accused the pair of ""hijacking"" the Mediterranean diet with their agenda, saying it was ""ridiculous"" to include coconut oil or cauliflower for a pizza base as one of their suggestions.  Mrs Porter said: ""We all know now that a Mediterranean-style diet is one of the most healthy diets to follow. But it's not low carb."" The British Nutrition Foundation agrees, saying that a traditional Mediterranean diet typically includes pasta and rice at every meal.  Mrs Porter added that the argument to eat a high level of saturated fat was based on evidence that had been ""cherry-picked rather than looking at it in its entirety"". She said: ""Why it might help you lose weight is because it's making healthier choices and you'd be having overall less calories.""  But Dr Malhotra, a cardiologist and adviser at the National Obesity Forum, said: ""The Pioppi Diet is an independent evaluation that marries the secrets of one of the world's healthiest villages with the latest medical, nutrition and exercise research to bust many myths prevalent in today's weight loss and health industries. ""It has received endorsements from a number of eminent international doctors, dieticians, Cochrane researchers and sports scientists. ""One has to question the financial links and influence of various food companies on the BDA. In my view, they cannot be trusted as an independent source of dietary advice.""  In response to this, a BDA spokesperson said: ""The analysis we release is always based on evidence and is unaffected by the important relationships we have with the nation's food producers.  ""Our spokespeople, like all dieticians, are required to adhere to evidence-based practice as part of their registration with the Health and Care Professions Council.""  A huge number of celebrities have been linked with this diet including Kim Kardashian, Kobe Bryant and Alec Baldwin. The premise is to eat a very low carb, high fat, moderate protein diet, with carbohydrates coming from non-starchy vegetables, nuts and seeds.  The aim is to push the body into a state of ""ketosis"". Because it doesn't have the glucose from the carbohydrates, it instead breaks down fat to produce energy.  Ms Porter said: ""The sinister thing here is people saying it can cure cancer and things like that - it absolutely cannot!"" She said by not eating carbohydrates, you avoid eating the calorie-laden things that generally accompany them: ""If you're cutting out carbs, such as pasta, you're cutting out creamy sauce. If you're cutting out bread, you're cutting out butter. If you're cutting out biscuits, you're cutting out sugar.""  The danger, she said, is that you can lose a lot of fibre from your diet which is important for gut health. Also, by removing whole grains from your diet you're depriving your body of many vitamins and minerals.  The BNF advises that it can be effective for losing weight in the short-term but this weight loss can be hard to sustain.  The BDA has a fact sheet recommending some of the best ways to lose weight.

risk appetite,Not just any retail recession...,2024-09-15,2020-05-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52741496,"Never miss the opportunity of a big crisis, goes the advice. Marks & Spencer starts with a big advantage - it's already very used to being in crisis. With its annual results, its boss has seized on the opportunity to push further and faster than he was already doing. It's a ploy you can expect other business leaders to adopt, so it may be of interest to see how Steve Rowe is going about it.  The striking thing about this one-time flagship of British retail is that it has survived being in crisis for so long.  That's partly because the M&S food business has done at least OK in navigating changes to the grocery market. It has invested, for instance, in smaller outlets at locations with a big ""food-to-go"" footfall - notably at railway stations. That's causing it some pain at the moment, with so few rail travellers. Food has helped support it through a perpetual state of crisis with its clothing and home ranges. Criticised for being too frumpy, it has chopped and changed its design teams, its store design, its buying strategy, its marketing... and even when it got things right, it didn't order enough stock. Chief executive Steve Rowe says the turnaround strategy was on track. A 2% drop in revenue in the year to March isn't bad by M&S standards, even though pre-tax profits are down 21%. But clearly, the garment trade is now in a horrible mess, holding stock for summer that it can't sell, with an appetite for online sales sharply down, and no clarity about when it can get back to normal business. The Scottish Retail Consortium figures for April are out, and they make predictably dire reading. Inflation is down to only 0.8%, and at risk of heading into deflation, which would be a bigger nightmare for retailers. If consumers have an expectation that prices will keep falling, then they hold off purchases. Mr Rowe's message to investors and staff is to take ""£1bn of actions"" for the short term, including £100m less late summer stock on order, £50m down on marketing, £40m saved by freezing recruitment and pay, £40m less on technology, £60m through ordering less stock £50m saved by furloughing staff, and £140m less capital spend. Some £400m of stock is not seasonal, so it stays on the shelves. £200m of spring stock will be put in warehouses for next year.  Extra costs for changes in stocking: £145m. Note that a lot of that is bad news for the supply chain, in this country and for overseas garment workers. It's better news if you're renting warehouse space. Beyond the short term, M&S has a new mantra: ""never the same again"". Steve Rowe says it is learning lessons: of a smaller, nimbler top team, delegated decisions, with working groups and committees disbanded. Staff have improvised and learned to multi-task, in-store and in support roles. Microsoft Teams software is a key relationship. Buying policy is focussed on stocking ""more of less from fewer core suppliers"". It seems all that is going to remain in place. That saves cost, and costs mean jobs: ""central support costs and headcount will be examined at all levels"". Transformation plans get accelerated, and that means changes to supply chains: decisions are made closer to the supplier, which is often overseas, while more will be 'near-sourced' for online seasonal products that need quick turnaround. M&S wants to vacate older, underperforming store locations, and is joining other retailers in a hard-bargaining drive to lower rent levels. Commercial landlords won't be at all surprised. Intu, a shopping mall giant which owns Braehead shopping centre in south-west Glasgow, told its creditors this week to brace for their lending conditions to be broken, as rents simply aren't paid. The implicit message: if you collapse this business, good luck finding another one that can work the asset any better! Says Steve Rowe at M&S: ""Whilst some customer habits will return to normal others have changed forever, the trend towards digital has been accelerated and changes to the shape of the high street brought forward. ""Most importantly, working habits have been transformed and we have discovered we can work in a faster, leaner, more effective way. I am determined to act now to capture this and deliver a renewed, more agile business in a world that will never be the same again."" Talking of business strategy, one of the most awkward decisions facing company directors and auditors in the next few months is going to be signing off on accounts. The ""going concern"" statement is meant to reassure creditors and investors that the business will still be around in 12 months. Without a ""going concern"" signature, the red light starts flashing at your bank branch, so it's definitely preferable to have one. In current circumstances, and for many companies, getting from here to this time next year is not at all certain. So the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland is today offering updated guidelines. You might hope it would offer some reassurance.  Instead, its chief executive, Bruce Cartwright, says directors should ""consider the specific facts and circumstances of their company in determining the extent of the procedures to be undertaken when forming the going concern assessment, whilst being cognisant of wider macroeconomic conditions"". Reassured by that? No, me neither. What does it mean? Well, with no specialist qualification in such matters, my interpretation is ""Ca' canny, don't just hope for the best, and this is no time to bend the rules"". Mr Cartwright, a veteran insolvency practitioner, emphasises the need for such statements to be clear and transparent about the evidence available, as well as uncertainty. He adds that companies need to think about permanent changes in the markets where they operate, whether their business model remains sustainable, and whether they need to diversify."
risk appetite,Toshiba delivers long-awaited earnings,2024-09-15,2017-08-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40873088,"Toshiba has met a deadline to report its long-awaited earnings results, reducing the risk that the firm will be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The embattled electronics firm posted a loss of $8.8bn (£6.7bn) for the last fiscal year.  Auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata gave a ""qualified opinion"" on the financial statements, meaning it broadly endorsed the results. Toshiba has struggled to recover from a 2015 accounting scandal.  The firm's troubles started in 2015 when it was found to have inflated the previous seven years' profits by $1.2bn.  The accounting scandal led to the resignation of several members of the firm's senior management, including the chief executive.  In late 2016, billions of dollars in losses at its US nuclear unit Westinghouse were first revealed. Toshiba, looking to diversify away from consumer electronics, had bought the business in 2006.  Its financial troubles deepened after delays and costs overruns at two US reactors, and as global appetite for nuclear energy waned following the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Westinghouse was put into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which protects it from creditors while it undergoes restructuring. Toshiba had delayed the release of its financial results for months, as it struggled to secure sign-off from its auditors.  PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata on Thursday delivered a ""qualified opinion"" on the earnings for the year to March, as well as the April-June quarter.  That means it broadly vouched for its accounting despite finding minor problems. The auditor's sign-off reduces the immediate threat of Toshiba being delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The company was demoted from the first tier of the exchange in June after confirming its liabilities outweighed its assets. If Toshiba reports negative net worth - liabilities exceeding assets - for a second consecutive year it would likely prompt a delisting.  It's up to the Tokyo Stock Exchange to decide whether it can remain on the bourse.  Toshiba has narrowly escaped de-listing - for now at least. But the troubled firm's problems are far from over.  While auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata have broadly endorsed the results, there are reports that PwC also issued an ""adverse opinion"" on Toshiba saying the company didn't do enough to alert investors about the losses at its US Westinghouse unit soon enough. Toshiba says that it reported the losses as soon as it could.  But the risk hasn't gone away. Another deadline still looms - the company has until March 2018 to resolve its debt issues.  Analysts say it's hard to see how the beleaguered electronics giant won't face delisting soon - simply because trust in the firm's ability to resurrect itself is at an all time-low and the company hasn't done much to infuse investors with confidence. The company needs to sell its prized chip business to cover its hefty US losses. But the sale has hit hurdles.  Toshiba is trying to offload the unit to a consortium of US, South Korean and Japanese investors. The sale has been challenged by Toshiba's partner and rival bidder, Western Digital, in court.  Toshiba is the world's second-largest chip manufacturer. Its products are used in data centres and consumer goods worldwide, including iPhones and iPads. "
risk appetite,Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia,2024-09-15,2022-03-03,By Michael Race & Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60571133,"Thirty years ago when communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, Western firms stepped up their presence in Russia.  The arrival of big Western companies symbolised the start of a new era with Russians becoming eager consumers of brands ranging from fast-food chain McDonalds to Levi jeans and luxury goods.  Now, in the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of firms have suspended activities in Russia. So which firms, in which sectors, are exiting and why have others held back?  McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken are the latest companies to announce they are halting business in Russia after mounting pressure to act. McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut. The firms were initially remained tight lipped over the conflict, but took action because shareholders ""wouldn't stand"" for the continued generation of profits from Russia, says Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors. ""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she told the BBC. Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia, but the company, which employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products. Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. British American Tobacco has announced it plans to sell its business in Russia due to it being ""no longer sustainable in the current environment"". The world's biggest cosmetics firm L'Oreal and rival Estee Lauder are both closing shops  and ceasing online sales. Estee Lauder, whose brands include Michael Kors, DKNY, Clinique and Bobbi Brown, has had a presence in the country for about 30 years and Russia was where it had some of its strongest sales. In fact, Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at £337.2bn. So some brands may not want to burn their bridges, if there's a chance of returning at a later date. That is why many firms, including other luxury retailers like Burberry and Chanel, simply say they are ""suspending"" sales and temporarily shutting stores rather than withdrawing altogether, says Chris Weafer, chief executive of consulting firm Macro-advisory Limited.  With sanctions limiting forms of payment and huge uncertainty over future prices and consumer appetite, the business climate is ""extremely challenging"" he adds, making the decision to hit pause easier.  The world's biggest fashion retailers H&M and Zara-owner Inditex, which has 502 stores in the country, for example have already suspended sales in Russia, citing ""tragic developments"" in Ukraine. Other brands like Nike have simply said they can't currently guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia. More brands are likely to follow suit, according to Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData. Boohoo, Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo which initially kept its 49 Russian stores open, saying clothes were a ""necessity of life"", are some of the other names to have now cut ties.  Even Levi's, the jeans brand that became a symbol of post-Soviet business in Russia, has closed its shops. The all-American jeans firm said about 4% of its total net sales came from Eastern Europe and Russia last year, but ""any business considerations are clearly secondary to the human suffering experienced by so many"". Samsung, the leading supplier of smartphones in Russia, has said it will suspend shipments to the country but has not said whether its shops will close. Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles, and Sony suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"". Apple has also halted all of its product sales in Russia, and limited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its shops have closed too. For a firm like Apple selling imported items, that's a relatively straightforward decision to take, suggests Macro-advisory's Chris Weafer.  ""Companies do not want to be associated with the Russian regime and what's happening in Ukraine,"" he says. Their Russian business may be profitable, but ""the rest of the world is more important"" when it comes to reputational risk. Some tech companies, flooded by misinformation, are also restricting Kremlin-linked media outlets posting on their platforms. Facebook was blocked in Russia after it said it had refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned news organisations.  Meanwhile, TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia and suspended live streaming, although it is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services. Large consultancy and law firms were some of the first to set up a presence in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union but they mostly operate out of the spotlight.  All of the Big Four accounting groups - Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - have said they will no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Top-tier law firm Freshfields says it will no longer work with any clients linked to the Russian state either. Others say they are reviewing their client base and Russian links.  A senior executive for consultancy firm McKinsey, for example, wrote online that the company would ""no longer serve"" any government or state-owned entities in Russia. According to McKinsey's website, it serves 21 of the 30 biggest Russian companies. When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure. And that is set to intensify now the UK, US and UK have announced bans or curbs on Russian oil and gas. BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting it had announced the operation would be hived off.  That was closely followed by pledges from Shell, ExxonMobil and Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public. Firms want to be seen to be doing the ""right thing"", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Meanwhile, Total Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it won't fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments. It is still far from clear what will happen to those investments - whether they can eventually be sold, recouping some of their value, or if they will simply be written off at great cost. Film fans in Russia wanting to go and see Warner Bros' new blockbuster The Batman won't be able to after the company suspended new film releases in the country. The US movie-maker was joined by Disney and Sony, with premieres of animation Turning Red and Marvel adaptation Morbius also being withdrawn. Disney has also paused its TV channels. Netflix, a fairly new entrant in Russia, has suspended its service in the country and put all ""future projects"" on pause. All companies said their decisions were based on the ""humanitarian crisis"" in Ukraine, rather than as a result of sanctions that have been imposed. All three of the world's major record labels - Sony, Warner and Universal - have closed their offices in Russia, and Spotify has announced it is cancelling its subscription service, although the free, ad-funded version will still work. Payment giants Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal are pulling out of the Russian market in protest. Russian banks have, however, already downplayed the impact of the announcements on their clients.  Sberbank, for example, said that Visa and Mastercard-branded cards would continue to work on Russian territory because all payments in Russia are made through a national system.   However, domestically issued cards won't work abroad, and foreign-issued ones won't work inside the country. US investment bank Goldman Sachs was the first Wall Street bank to say it was winding down its Russian business. The bank, soon followed by JPMorgan, said it was doing so in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements.  German lender Deutsche Bank, which had faced criticism for defending plans not to withdraw, has also said it was taking steps to exit, pledging ""there won't be any new business in Russia"". Jaguar Land Rover, General Motors, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce are among the car-makers that have halted deliveries of vehicles to Russia due to the conflict, while construction equipment manufacturer JCB has paused all operations. Cars are the biggest UK export to Russia, but still only 1% of UK cars went to Russia last year.  So any decision to stop exporting won't be particularly costly, and will have been made easier by nagging concerns over whether or not payments will arrive, says investment analyst Russ Mould. Transporting cars to Russia could prove difficult anyway, with the world's two largest cargo shipping companies, MSC and Maersk, suspending routes to and from Russia, except for food, medical and humanitarian supply deliveries. While the flood of announcements from companies stepping back goes on, there are calls for more to join them. Attention has turned to big food firms like Burger King who have condemned Russia's actions and have pledged support for Ukraine, but are yet to pull out. Some firms will also find it much harder to extricate themselves, even if pressure mounts in the coming days and weeks. In retaliation against sanctions introduced by Western countries, Moscow has banned the sale of Russian assets. So firms that, in recent years, have been encouraged to establish a presence in Russia are ""locked in"" with local businesses, staff and supply chains. Marks & Spencer, for example, has 48 shops in Russia but they are operated by a Turkish franchise company called FiBA. M&S has said it is suspending shipments of its goods to FiBA's Russian business, but the shops in the country remain open. Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchisees  with which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change. Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was suspending operations in the Russian KFC restaurants it owns, and finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. Mr Weafer predicts it is likely that some large consumer brands may express concerns over the military conflict, but try to ""ride it out""."
risk appetite,Kenyan MPs' bid to evict UK farmers,2024-09-15,2014-05-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27416769,"Campaigners say that the Meru region cannot be used to grow other crops A group of Kenyan MPs have said they will table a motion in parliament for British farmers to be ejected from the khat-growing Meru region.  They are angry about moves by the British government to ban the use of the leafy substance from this July. Last year, the UK government decided - against some expert advice - to treat khat as a class C drug to ""protect vulnerable members of our communities"".  It is traditionally used by Ethiopian, Kenyan, Somali and Yemeni communities. The mildly narcotic leaf - a herbal stimulant - is already banned in most of Europe and in a number of other countries, including the US and Canada. The MPs say that the British move will force almost two million people out of jobs in Meru, which is one of Kenya's 47 counties and lies to the north-east of Mt Kenya. Campaigners say that khat is culturally significant in Kenya Khat has to be taken to the market quickly so that it is sold fresh It is not clear how many British nationals own farms in Meru. But the MPs say they have about a quarter of the farmland in Meru, including wheat and barley farms.  Florence Kajuju, one of the MPs behind the motion, said the government had the right to compulsorily buy property for later public use. The arable land in Meru owned by UK farmers should be made available to locals as areas used to grow khat could not be used for other crops, she said. ""If they cannot allow us to access their market then they should also then be willing to let go of tracts of land that could be occupied by the Meru people,"" Ms Kajuju told the BBC. She said Kenyans were used to fighting for their rights as they had had to do so to gain independence from Britain. Correspondents say even if the motion was passed by MPs it is unlikely the government would implement it given its policy of accommodating foreign investors.

It suppresses the appetite Heavy use can lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, heart problems and impotence Longer-term risk of developing mouth cancers Can create feelings of anxiety and aggression, and cause paranoid and psychotic reactions Can make pre-existing mental health problems worse Source: www.talktofrank.com Ms Kajuju travelled to the UK last year to appeal for the ban not to be enforced, saying it was important that the British government was not duped by a misinformation campaign. Khat was not only of economic importance but of cultural significance to many Africans, she said. Last year, the UK's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said there was ""insufficient evidence"" that khat caused health problems although regular users suffered withdrawal symptoms. It also said that there was also ""no evidence"" that khat, made from leaves and shoots of a shrub cultivated in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, was directly linked with serious or organised crime. But the UK's Home Office minister warned that failing to ban the drug could lead to the UK becoming a khat trafficking hub.  Kenyan farmers fear UK khat ban City Somalis angry over khat ban.

risk appetite,Would you buy shares in Uber?,2024-09-15,2019-05-10,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48228812,"For sale: shares in a company that has already burned through $27bn (£20.7bn; €24bn) in cash, will burn through tens of billions more of its new shareholders' money, has never made a profit and won't for many years - if ever.  Sounds too bad to be true, but that is precisely what is on offer when Uber shares start trading today. It seems impossible to imagine why anyone would want to buy them, and yet market watchers expect there to be no shortage of people queuing up to buy a slice of a company whose name has become a recognised noun in dozens of languages around the world.   Uber is selling shares to finance one of the most ambitious business plans in history. To revolutionise and then dominate global transportation.  This company is about much more than getting a car home after the pub when you don't fancy public transport. Uber wants to dominate food delivery, electric bikes, international freight and more.  That makes Uber a different animal from Lyft, its ride-hailing rival which has seen its shares fall 25% since it first sold shares publicly.  The most important part of Uber's business plan is scale. Spend whatever it takes, for as long as it takes to smash the competition. This was Amazon's plan. Amazon didn't make a profit until six years after it first sold shares. It spent every dollar of revenue - and more - in expanding its business. It worked. Amazon's market share of e-commerce in the US is now double the next biggest nine companies combined. As astonishing as that is, Uber has the potential to have an even greater impact.  It is the poster child of what is known as the gig economy. It provides a platform to match individual service providers/contractors (Uber drivers) with customers - taking a hefty slice (currently 25% in the UK) for matchmaking.  Some fear that if Uber succeeds in making its platform the dominant mode of transport around the globe, then it will have become the digital equivalent of a feudal landlord.  It owns the land on which the workers toil like peasants for low wages, while the economic spoils go to the landowner - dramatically skewing the returns of economic activity towards capital rather than labour.  And if and when driverless cars come along, that will eliminate the return to labour completely.   Who would you rather be, landlord or peasant? If landlord, then buy a share of the freehold on offer today.  But buyer beware: this may be the most ambitious and risky plan since Icarus wanted a better look at the sun.  In many countries, there is already something of a ""peasants' revolt"" under way. Drivers in cities across the US and UK have recently gone on strike to complain about pay and conditions.  It should probably be called a protest rather than a strike, because Uber insists the drivers work for themselves. That status is absolutely key to Uber's business plan and is under legal challenge in courts around the world.  But perhaps the greatest risk to Uber is that it succeeds in its plan for world domination, only to be broken up one day. There is a growing number of voices in Europe and the US calling for an end to what they see as the suffocating domination of tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. It seems unlikely that governments, regulators and citizens around the world will be comfortable with one or even a couple of companies dominating and monitoring the movement of all people and goods around the world.  My own hunch (neck uncomfortably out) is that there will be plenty of appetite for today's sale. Blockbuster market debuts like this don't come along very often: the last big one in the US was Facebook.  Fomo (Fear of missing out) is a powerful emotion which may overwhelm the uncertainty as to whether Uber will ever make a profit.   "
risk appetite,"Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan",2024-09-15,2019-11-21,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/50502062,"This is a radical attempt to change Britain's business model, involving not just huge amounts of public spending and investment, but also an attempt to rewire the way the economy works.  Labour's answer to ""can we afford this?"" is ""we can't afford not to"" - arguing that only a very active government can reshape the economy to change the fate of the country, in particular to meet the green challenge. Labour is part of a now-shared consensus across every single party, the IMF and finance ministries across the world, that currently low interest rates charged on government borrowing should be used to fund substantial investments.  Labour has used this opportunity to push the radicalism of its 2017 manifesto much further with about £140bn extra in spending a year, versus for example £80bn a year from the LibDems, and tens of billions from the Conservatives.  It leaves all the major parties promising voters hundreds of billions over the Parliament. At around £600bn more in spending promises over the five years Labour has put clear blue water between themselves and the extra spending of the other major parties. Is this affordable? It is more risky than more-modest spending plans.  It is true that there is an appetite for cheap borrowing by governments, and that could stretch to 2-3% of GDP on investment spending implied by Labour's plans.  But with a backdrop of concern from international investors on their stakes in utilities being nationalised, and new and much higher taxes on wealth, share trades, and the rich, the Labour plans risk pushing up the cheap borrowing rates they are relying on.  Labour's answer:  It is an even bigger risk not to borrow to invest in the transformation of the economy. The day-to-day spending plans are bigger than in 2017, at £83bn a year by the end of the Parliament, providing funding for schools, sure start, scrapping tuition fees, health and social care, and public sector pay.  That is matched by tax rises on the wealthy and companies.  These are huge sums which indirectly will surely be felt well beyond the super-rich and wealthy business owners. Stepping corporation tax back up to 26% is the biggest single measure, but applying income tax rates to capital gains (taxing your shares and assets) is a huge measure - raising £14bn, and catches more than just the richest 5% in its net. Labour's planned corporation tax revenues would be the highest in the developed world. The size of the state in terms of spending would be the highest outside of a crisis since the 1970s, although that also would mean it would be about the same size as Germany.  So a big change for Britain, a transformation of the business model that we're used to here, but not wildly out of kilter with other developed economies that have retained a strong state."
risk appetite,Will the fashion industry have to 'rethink its values'?,2024-09-15,2020-04-29,By Steven McIntosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52394504,"Normally, at this time of year, many of us would be curating our perfect summer wardrobe as we prepare for sunny weather and foreign holidays.  Instead, clothing sales plummeted by 34% in March as much of the world's population is currently unable to travel abroad or even socialise amid lockdown restrictions. ""No-one wants to buy clothes to sit at home in,"" as Next's chief executive Simon Wolfson put it last month. The fashion industry has been negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak on every imaginable level; production has ceased, retailers have closed, demand has plummeted.  ""It has led to a real existential crisis for the fashion industry,"" says Imran Amed, the founder and CEO of The Business of Fashion, a leading industry website which has produced a report about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. ""This is an industry which is still almost entirely dependent oh physical retail. More than 80% of transactions in the fashion industry still happen in physical stores. ""Added to that, many consumers simply aren't interested in buying clothes right now. There's so much focus on purchasing essential items to survive during the lockdown and I think everyone's minds have naturally been focused on that. So fashion just becomes an after-thought, or no thought at all in that kind of context."" With sales so low, there are questions about what will happen to the existing stock of clothes building up in stores and warehouses. ""Unlike food or some medicines, [fashion] products do not go off. But many go out of style,"" noted The Economist. ""Sometimes, as with seasonal apparel collections, rather quickly."" In an effort to maintain some income, many high street retailers are selling anything they're able to at significantly discounted prices online.  Gap and H&M, for example, have been offering mid-season sales, while Uniqlo is promoting discounted comfort-wear items people are likely to need at home, such as jogging bottoms and leggings. (Browns in London has reported a 70% increase in sales of loungewear.) It's likely more brands and retailers will offer discounts as time goes on, Amed notes, which will damage profit margins, but he is hopeful that the fashion calendar being out of sync won't be as big an issue as many fear.  ""We always have to remember there are two hemispheres in the world, so when it's summer in one place it's winter in another,"" he says. ""And I think there are creative ways we could think of to redistribute those collections. ""But as for clothing going out of style, there are just so many different kinds of trends and aesthetics now that I think the idea of things being in or out of style is less marked now than it was maybe 10 or 15 years ago.  ""I've actually heard of some designers who are saying, 'the collection I showed for spring/summer 2020, we're just going to sell that in spring/summer 2021'. That won't be a solution that works for every brand, but I think getting through this situation is going to require some real lateral thinking and creativity."" With sales currently low, many brands have suspended advertising - although some continue to use social media influencers to promote products. Emily Canham, who has more than 700,000 Instagram followers, regularly promotes services and products including health foods, make-up, streaming services, holidays and clothes. ""For me right now it's really about listening to my followers about what feels appropriate,"" Canham tells BBC News. Some of her recent posts have been reflective of her current lifestyle under lockdown - not always necessarily promoting something. She adds: ""My followers generally wear what makes them feel great and powerful rather than adhering to traditional seasonal trends. It's about how you wear it, not what season it's worn in."" As things stand, it's not clear whether September's Fashion Weeks will go ahead in London, Paris, New York and Milan, and if so what form they may take - designers could potentially broadcast fashion shows online if social distancing measures are still in place, for example. May's Met Gala, an annual highlight of the fashion calendar, has already effectively moved online, with Billy Porter encouraging people to recreate their favourite red carpet looks at home. But even once the coronavirus pandemic has settled somewhat, however long that may take, there are questions about what the fashion industry will look like. ""I feel very strongly that when we come out at the other end, people's values are really going to have shifted,"" Vogue editor Dame Anna Wintour said last week. ""I think it's an opportunity for all of us to look at our industry and to look at our lives, and to rethink our values, and to really think about the waste, and the amount of money, and consumption, and excess that we have all indulged in and how we really need to rethink what this industry stands for."" The fashion industry is hugely polluting, producing about 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon emissions per year - and for some time has been under huge pressure to become more sustainable.  Much has been made of the damaging effect of so-called ""fast fashion"" in particular, where consumers buy something cheap, hardly wear it and then throw it out. It was the subject of a BBC Three documentary last year. Dame Anna said the industry will need to ""slow down"" so that people can ""enjoy it much more"" without always looking for the next new thing. ""The conversation about sustainability and the fashion industry has been going on for a long time now, so this is not a new conversation, but I do think this situation is a great accelerator,"" Amed says. ""It's going to accelerate the fashion industry's engagement with digital technology, and its desire to rethink the fashion calendar, but it will also accelerate the approach to sustainability and building responsible businesses. That means using supply chains that are creating clothing in a circular way and take into account the impact on the planet and the people who make our clothes."" With regards to the current build-up of inventory, he adds: ""There was a time when certain companies and brands would destroy products but that's become a practice which is frowned upon now."" Dame Vivienne Westwood has been a particular champion of sustainability, teaming up with green organisations and making her business more environmentally efficient.  At a time when sustainability and financial restraints are at the forefront of people's minds, the launch of the latest series of The Great British Sewing Bee on BBC One could hardly have been more appropriate. Like The Repair Shop, it provides practical tips and encourages creativity and craft at home - an antidote to a culture of binning something and buying a new one. ""Last year, home-made clothes seemed as old-fashioned as steam trains and oil lamps,"" said The Daily Mail's Christopher Stevens in his review of the show. ""But if lockdown goes on much longer, we'll all be at it."" The fashion industry, which was generating $2.5 trillion (£2.02 trillion) in global annual revenues before the pandemic hit, will be hoping consumers' appetite for designer clothes returns when lockdown restrictions ease. But that could be some way off yet. ""We're going to see a wave of insolvencies and bankruptcies as the year continues,"" Amed says. ""This is the largest crisis that the modern industry has ever faced."""
risk appetite,Leaders in final push for votes ahead of election,2024-09-15,2019-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50734814,"The UK's party leaders are touring the country on a frenetic final day of campaigning, focusing on key messages ahead of Thursday's general election.  Boris Johnson has insisted only the Tories will ""get Brexit done"" and move the country forward while Jeremy Corbyn has vowed Labour will end austerity and give ""hope to the next generation"". Jo Swinson has said a strong Lib Dem showing can stop the UK leaving the EU. Nicola Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP in Scotland could stop a Tory victory. With voting set to begin at 07:00 GMT on Thursday, the parties are stressing the scale of the choice facing people and the impact it will have on the direction of the country.  The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said voters were being offered hugely divergent choices when it came to the UK's relationship with Europe, with the Conservatives promising to leave the European Union next month while Labour and others were backing a further referendum.  And the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam said both the Tories and Labour were proposing fundamental changes to how the UK's economy and trade have worked over the past 30 years.  In terms of the opinion polls, the Conservatives retain a solid lead over Labour, according to the BBC's opinion poll tracker. A poll produced by YouGov released on Tuesday evening suggests the Conservatives are on course for a small majority of around 28 - but the pollster points out that the margin of error means neither another hung Parliament nor a larger Tory majority can be ruled out. Labour is hoping for a late swing in its favour, as happened in the 2017 general election, while the Tories are warning about the possibility of a hung Parliament, amid concerns about voter complacency. Both Conservative and Labour party leaders will be hoping to put a rocky few days behind them, as they embark on the traditional election-eve tour of target seats. Mr Johnson began Wednesday by doing a milk round in West Yorkshire, saying the election campaign ""could not be tighter"" and that there is a ""real risk again of a hung Parliament"". He said: ""The critical risk is very real. We cannot have more drift, more dither, more delay, more paralysis for this country."" He is using events throughout the day, including a visit to a bakery in Derbyshire, to stress key Tory pledges on investing in the NHS, raising the number of police officers and bringing in a new immigration system.  But his main message will be on Brexit, saying ""unless we get out of this quicksand... our future as a country remains uncertain"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today that only a clear Conservative victory would lift the UK out of the ""rut"" it had fallen into over Brexit and enable the country to ""move on"" to dealing with other challenges, like social care and the environment. Mr Corbyn started the day in Scotland, telling a rally in Glasgow that a Labour government would ""eliminate child poverty, give hope to the next generation and invest properly in education all across the UK"".  At a rally in Middlesbrough, he repeated pledges on funding for the NHS, expanding free childcare and lowering transport fares, and also addressed Brexit, saying Labour would get it sorted by securing a ""good deal for working people"" and giving the public the ""final say"".  He told activists: ""Remember it is our choice, our chance tomorrow, to elect a government that will be for the many, not the few. A government you can trust. ""And it will not be motivated solely by more billionaires... it will be motivated by improving the life chances of every single child all across this country, and bringing justice."" Party chairman Ian Lavery said Mr Corbyn had a ""real live chance"" of being prime minister by Friday, telling the BBC's Politics Live that while Brexit was a tough issue in many seats, what voters were really concerned about was the future of the NHS, schools and the cost of living.  However, a group of 15 former Labour MPs, including several who quit the party over the past year, have urged voters to back other parties, saying Mr Corbyn is unfit to be prime minister due to his record on anti-Semitism and national security.  Responding, Mr Corbyn said: ""People who have left the Labour Party and decided to join up with the party that has imposed austerity, poverty and injustice on the poorest people in this country should look themselves in the mirror and decide what they are doing."" Meanwhile, Ms Swinson said the last few hours were ""absolutely critical"" with thousands of voters yet to make up their minds. On a visit to Esher in Surrey, where the Lib Dems hope to oust Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, she said tactical voting could determine the outcome of Tory-Lib Dem marginal seats and Labour voters in such areas could hold the result ""in their hands"".  She also visited a volunteer hub in London to thank activists, adding: ""Our country can be better than what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are trying to say is the only way forward.""  Back on the road again today for the leaders' last push. There feels like there's been a real mismatch between the nature and conduct of the campaign and the scale of the choice. It's a huge moment for the country, but we've heard so many times voters saying they don't like ""either of them"". People's thinking is really dominated by the two big characters in the campaign and no-one is making it to No 10 on a surge of anything like enthusiasm. People seem fed up of politicians telling them how divided they are - most people have been quite rightly getting on with their lives while Westminster has torn itself apart. The frustration Tories hoped to capitalise on is real, but there are doubts all over the place about whether Boris Johnson is the answer to that. However, beyond his strong core support there seems to be less appetite for Jeremy Corbyn to take it on. There is a massive generational split though. Smaller parties haven't punched through as some predicted, although they will still have a huge impact, and there are a vast number of local factors at play, of course, too. Anyway, enough musing for now. Suffice to say this is an incredibly tight contest in lots of places. In 48 hours we might be waiting in a freezing Downing Street for Mr Johnson to return with a majority, or about to enter a frenzy of hung Parliament talks which could propel Mr Corbyn into power. The SNP is taking a similar tack in its appeal to Labour voters in Scotland, calling on them to back the party to ""lock Boris Johnson out of No 10"".  Describing the PM's Get Brexit Done slogan as the ""biggest con"" of the election, Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was a vote to stop further cuts to public services and to ""stop Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will"".  Green Party co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley urged voters to make it a moment of political reckoning on the climate, saying their party would make sure proper action was taken to meet carbon emission targets. Speaking in Doncaster, Nigel Farage said the Brexit Party was challenging Labour in many of its Yorkshire heartlands, and he appealed to Leave supporters to back his candidates in areas where the Conservatives could not win.  Plaid Cymru's leader, Adam Price, told the BBC that Wales was the ""forgotten nation"" in the UK and had been ""neglected"" for decades by successive Conservative and Labour governments. He said his party would press whoever formed the next UK government for more resources to tackle child poverty, while also making the case to remain in the EU and ultimately for Wales to govern itself.

risk appetite,Joy sticks: The 'golden age' of gaming magazines,2024-09-15,2019-09-04,By Simon Armstrong,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-47896612,"Retro gaming is enjoying a surge in popularity with Nintendo, Sega and Sony all releasing mini versions of classic 1990s machines. The decade also spawned a boom for console magazines desperate to win the publishing war for pocket-money pounds. Sonic, Street Fighter II and Super Mario World. Between them, they would define a generation of gaming. As standard-bearers for Sega and Nintendo's competing machines, the titles provided thrilling leaps into colourful new worlds and cemented home gaming as a multimillion-pound industry. With the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo becoming must-haves for children up and down the land, it is an era still fondly recalled by many. Indeed, Sega will be the latest firm to cash in on nostalgia for the period with the imminent release of the Mega Drive Mini following compact versions of Nintendo's NES and SNES, and Sony's PlayStation. Vying for players' attention first time around would be a proliferation of equally enchanting magazines - all keen to satisfy the voracious appetite for news and reviews and, crucially, secure a lucrative foothold in the quickly expanding market.  For the small teams of journalists working late into the night to meet punishing publishing deadlines, it would be a ""golden age"" as wondrous as a high-speed spin though Sonic's Green Hill Zone or dodging dinosaurs in Mario's Donut Plains. ""We absolutely loved video games,"" recalls Julian ""Jaz"" Rignall, editor of Mean Machines - an irreverent magazine from London-based Emap that stole a march on the opposition and quickly became a big seller. ""The technology was facilitating new and exciting games, and every month we seemed to have something incredible turn up. I remember when the Super Nintendo was delivered for the first time, taking it out of the box and playing Super Mario World. The whole office would stop, we'd go into the games room and crowd round the screen. There was a high level of excitement and that came across in the magazine."" Beginning life as a section within Computer & Video Games (CVG) in 1987, it had focused on emerging platforms such as the PC Engine, Game Boy and Atari Lynx. The first magazine under the Mean Machines banner would hit the shelves dated October 1990 and coincide with the UK release of the Mega Drive - two years after its Japanese debut. ""The office was a mess,"" laughs Rignall. ""There were games and bits of hardware and old computers everywhere. We would occasionally have tidy-ups, although for the most part it was an absolute dump.  ""But, you know, it was the perfect environment for us and that allowed us to produce a really great magazine."" With an initial print run in the region of 30,000 copies, monthly sales would soon go on to top 150,000. So what made Mean Machines such a huge success? Humour and personality were undoubtedly key ingredients. While striking features acclaimed the merits of Street Fighter II, readers were mercilessly mocked by Rignall's ""Mean Yob"" letters page persona and Insult Corner saw near-the-knuckle put-downs hurled around with glee. ""It was very much part of the remit not to talk down to the readers,"" he says. ""We really wanted to be inclusive. It had a very juvenile and anarchic humour - double entendres, being rude but not quite being rude. We wouldn't swear, but we would allude to swearing. The personalities of the staff really came through, and the tone and style was very different to most other magazines out there. ""Most important of all, we were very, very enthusiastic about video games."" As the likes of Streets of Rage, Super Mario Kart and Star Fox drove sales of Sega and Nintendo's machines in a battle that came to be dubbed ""the console war"", advances in desktop publishing meant magazines could be put together more quickly and cheaply than ever before. Circulation revenues were boosted by booming advertising profits as games companies, big-name retailers and small independent shops snapped up space. It was low risk, high reward for Emap and rivals such as Bath-based Future. GamesMaster, Mega, Total! and Edge would all be launched between 1991 and 1993, while Rignall's title would split to become Mean Machines Sega and Nintendo Magazine System to capitalise on winning the official Nintendo console publication licence. Easily the most eye-catching, though, would be Future's Super Play. Its intricate Japanese-style art and focus on anime (the term for Japanese animation) immediately set it apart when its debut issue launched with a cover date of November 1992. Columns explored the idiosyncrasies of Far East cartoons and comics, while dazzling images adorned each cover courtesy of illustrator Wil Overton. ""The technology was just good enough where a small team of four or five people could make quite a nice magazine and there was an audience of many, many tens of thousands that would lap it up,"" says its first editor, Matt Bielby. ""There were all these competing games platforms and any market where there's competition tends to be quite vibrant because people choose one side or the other. ""It's like Blur v Oasis, or whatever it might be. If there's a little fight going on - even if it's not serious - it makes things more exciting."" Having also been offered the editor's chair at Sega-focused Mega, he chose Super Play as a means of indulging his ""obsession"" with Japan. ""The whole look and feel was massively important. I went to Japan at one point and picked up lots of magazines, and we went to places like the Japan Centre in London and would buy imported magazines on any subject - cars, fashion, anything. Because the team were big fans of the subject matter, elements of our lives blended into each other.  ""We didn't have a life outside of Super Play very much, but that was fine. We quite liked it like that. Two of them married each other so that kind of worked."" By late 1993, it would be selling 50,000 copies a month. But how conscious were the writers of the influence they wielded? ""You were very aware these games were not cheap,"" Bielby admits. ""Often it would be 50 quid or something of that order, which was a hell of a lot when you consider how much a pint of milk or beer was back then. If anyone bought a game they were investing quite a lot of money into it and they deserved something that would last them and they'd really enjoy. ""In retrospect, it was clearly a very special period of time where you had lots of very young, inexperienced people let loose with magazines that got big audiences. We were in a little golden age through the 90s."" As the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation usurped their predecessors, another wave of titles inevitably hit the shelves. Steve Jarratt, launch editor of Future's Edge, Total! and Official UK PlayStation Magazine, describes it as a ""licence to print money"" for the publishing companies.  ""We felt invincible. I rode the glory days. We'd make about £1 profit on a £2.99 magazine, printing 13 times a year. The PlayStation magazine's sales peaked at about 350,000 and that's at five or six pounds for each copy with a demo disc on the cover. It was generating a huge amount of wealth. Future made an enormous amount of money."" Change would come though. In a painful irony mirroring the finite lifespan of the machines they covered, games magazines would be rendered outdated by technology's relentless march. As the new millennium rolled around, it was ""game over"" for print. Free to read and unconstrained by monthly deadlines, websites allowed the instant publication of information while games could be viewed more easily than via the VHS cassettes magazines had offered as promotional gifts. Circulations plummeted. ""On a bad month [in the 1990s] we might lose 20,000 sales. Now most people would think 20,000 sales [in total] would be brilliant,"" Jarratt says. ""We knew the internet was coming, but didn't appreciate the full impact. I don't think anyone did. ""At first it was slow to load and visuals were clunky so it didn't feel like much of a threat. Then came a dawning all the stuff we were doing could appear online and over time we started to see people covering video games."" No longer as profitable, publishers closed title after title. While a small number remain today, circulation figures are dwarfed by those that went before. ""Instead of investing in the product, at Future it always felt like lots of cost-cutting to keep the [profit] margins up,"" says Jarratt, who left the company in 2011 and now works on a freelance basis contributing to the likes of Bitmap Books' series on retro gaming. ""You end up under so much pressure. No matter what you do sales go down, revenue falls off. You put your fingers in the holes in the boat to keep the water out. The internet is a double-edged sword. It's amazing for communication, but at the same time it's absolutely slaughtered certain markets. The High Street is dying, newspapers and magazines are struggling."" So has anything been lost with the disappearance of the printed page or are gamers simply better off? ""There was something about the physicality of magazines,"" says Rignall, who has worked in the games industry in the United States since 1994. ""But ultimately things have evolved. ""These days you can read about whatever you want and you're not limited by having to wait for a magazine to turn up. I think it's cool."" Photography by Caroline Briggs"
risk appetite,What's going on with Mourinho at Man Utd?,2024-09-15,2018-07-31,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45017413,"Manchester United finished 19 points behind champions Manchester City last season A month ago, when England were looking forward to a World Cup semi-final and as pre-season training for Europe's major clubs was just getting started, Manchester United's final US tour match against Real Madrid had a major question mark over it. Gareth Bale would be involved. But for whom? Fast forward four weeks and, though England did not find their utopia, Bale is happy enough, laughing and joking with his Real team-mates in Miami, his short-term future at the Bernabeu assured by new coach Julen Lopetegui. But as they prepare for Wednesday's game, the question mark over United remains. If anything, it is bigger than before. Manager Jose Mourinho's comments in the labyrinth of rooms at the Michigan Stadium on Saturday after a 4-1 loss to Liverpool saw to that. So, it is time to ask the question. What is going on with Mourinho and Manchester United? Mourinho voices transfer concerns in tetchy news conference Man Utd beaten 4-1 by Liverpool in pre-season If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here, external to vote. In front of the cameras, Mourinho has not been a jovial character for some time. Something - probably the scars of dealing with the Madrid media during his time as Real boss - happened between his first stint at Chelsea and his second. Whatever it was, it has taken away the public geniality of the self-proclaimed 'Special One'. Nevertheless, the breadth of the targets he fired at during his tetchy 10-minute post-match news conference after the loss to Liverpool was jaw-dropping. He lamented the absence of senior players, decried the standard of some of the younger ones who are here, wistfully reflected on a transfer target he will not get, highlighted inactivity on one he still expects to, expressed frustration at injuries, invited senior players to return to training early, and questioned why supporters would pay to watch his team. In a less well-publicised part of his news conference, he thanked defender Eric Bailly for stepping in to replace another senior player - Chris Smalling - at the weekend, then immediately rejected the Ivorian as a leader. Speaking to United's TV station, he accused new captain Antonio Valencia of returning from his summer break out of shape. In addition, he ridiculed the standard of a referee who gave two penalties against his team. Wide-ranging is a good description. The key point is this: does Mourinho harbour a growing sense of genuine unhappiness at all these supposed sources of irritation, is he trying to make points, or is he attempting to deflect attention from a heavy defeat at the hands of a major rival? If it is the last of those, it is a long-established managerial tactic. The middle one could go either way. But if it is the former, then a stereotypical full-blown third-year explosion - the type Mourinho is always so quick to reject when asked about - is on the way. This video can not be played Mourinho wants two signings, but only expects one There are two reactions to what Mourinho did on Saturday. One is to raise an eyebrow, say it is typical of him, express sympathy with his situation and move on.  This is exactly what a number of influential people within the club are doing. After all, the Portuguese signed a new contract in January that not only improved his terms, but extended his tenure to 2020. The relationship between Mourinho and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has repeatedly been described as strong by both men, so, presumably, potential conflict areas within summer transfer dealings would have been covered within the negotiations. It is also probable a vision for the short-term future would have been agreed. Why would that suddenly change because one transfer target was missed - which is only what has happened in the previous two summers? An alternative view, and there are other long-standing United figures who are leaning towards this, is Mourinho wants out, and this is the start of his exit strategy. One thing that is certain is that, for the first time in his illustrious managerial career, Mourinho will not have Rui Faria by his side this season. The pair have been inseparable since Mourinho appointed Faria - a man he describes as ""a brother"" - assistant at Uniao Leiria in 2001. However, last season, Faria - feeling he wasn't getting to see enough of his family and exhausted by the pressures of day-to-day involvement at the very top of the game - decided to take a break. Mourinho has opted not to bring in a direct replacement. In Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna, he has added both a club stalwart who has huge knowledge of the game and an appetite to learn, and someone whose reputation at both United and previous club Tottenham is enormous. Given United finished last season 19 points behind arch-rivals Manchester City - whose manager Pep Guardiola vies with Mourinho for the title of greatest manager of their generation - and have not done much to suggest the gap can be closed, Saturday's comments are being interpreted by those who have adopted the exit-strategy theory as the start of a long goodbye. United's only significant signing so far this summer has been Brazil midfielder Fred. Another central defender is expected, although who that is remains uncertain. Nevertheless, both men will be among the top six most expensive players United have ever bought. Of the other four, only Argentina forward Angel di Maria is no longer at the club. In midfielder Paul Pogba and forward Anthony Martial, two remain who have not come close to performing at their top level on a consistent basis. Mourinho was not responsible for Martial's arrival from Monaco. His view is the Frenchman goes missing at key times, hence his keenness to sign Croatia's Ivan Perisic, both last summer and this, from Inter Milan. The 55-year-old was responsible for Bailly, fellow defender Victor Lindelof and forward Alexis Sanchez - for a combined fee of just under £100m. They are yet to make a significant impact at Old Trafford. At the same time, there is an element of the unknown about all United's major rivals. Manchester City's only summer signing is Riyad Mahrez, an attacking player the champions arguably do not need. Tottenham have signed no-one yet. Arsenal's most expensive addition of the brief Unai Emery era so far is Uruguay midfielder Lucas Torreira who, at £26m, cost just over half the £47m United have spent on Fred. Chelsea did not even appoint their new manager, Maurizio Sarri, until after pre-season training had started. Of all the major clubs, Liverpool are the ones who appear to have significant forward momentum. Yet three of their four major signings - midfielders Naby Keita and Fabinho, and goalkeeper Alisson - have never played in the Premier League before. So, while it is easy to feel United are going backwards, it can be argued that if Mourinho gets more from the players he has already invested so much in, they won't be far away from the major prizes. As with all clubs, results can quickly change perceptions. The Red Devils open the Premier League as a whole when they entertain Leicester on 10 August. Mourinho has already highlighted how much easier the build-up to the new campaign has been for Foxes boss Claude Puel, given so few of his players were at the World Cup in Russia. This is true. But Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire were away with England until the semi-final stage, and Mahrez has been sold. Will they cause an upset on the opening day? Perhaps not; it is so long since Leicester won at Old Trafford the match-winner, in 1998, was Tony Cottee. The Foxes may have won the Premier League more recently than United, yet nothing that has happened since suggests they are close to the level Mourinho's side are capable of reaching on home soil. After that, United have trips to Brighton and Burnley, who could be going into the game on the back of a sixth successive Thursday night appearance in the Europa League. Between those two away fixtures is a Monday night date with Tottenham on 27 August. As well as not making a signing so far this summer, Spurs had eight players involved on the last weekend of the World Cup, compared to United's seven. So of all the big clubs expected to be challenging for major honours, Spurs are arguably in an even worse situation than United when it comes to their preparation for what lies ahead. As Arsenal have matches against Manchester City and Chelsea over the first two weekends, it leaves Liverpool as the only 'big-six' club who do not meet a rival before the first international break. So, while Mourinho has legitimate grounds to grumble at the difficult build-up he is having to work around, most of his managerial adversaries are in a similar position. By the time that Burnley trip is done and the top-flight season halts for its first international break, much more will be known about where United - and everybody else for that matter - actually are. From there, Mourinho's pronouncements will have much more meaning. BBC Manchester News & Sport BBC Sport Premier League BBC RM United Podcast Manchester United official site"
risk appetite,Keogh & Kerrigan spin Northants to win over Kent,2024-09-15,2022-07-14,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/62163680,"Rob Keogh has career-best bowling figures of 9-52 LV= County Championship Division One, Spitfire Ground, St Lawrence (day four) Northamptonshire 303 & 396-8 dec: Rickelton 133, Neesham 91; Linde 3-43 Kent 335 & 161: Crawley 35; Keogh 5-31, Kerrigan 5-43 Northants (22 pts) beat Kent (6 pts) by 203 runs Match scorecard Northamptonshire beat Kent by 203 runs on the final day of their crucial relegation showdown in the County Championship after a tense afternoon at Canterbury. Rob Keogh took the final wicket with just 10 minutes to spare before the 18:03 BST cut-off, giving Northamptonshire 22 points to Kent's six and moving them above the hosts in the Division One standings. It is Northamptonshire's first Division One win since 2004. Spinners Keogh and Simon Kerrigan saw Northamptonshire to a sensational win, taking 5-31 and 5-43 respectively, after they had declared on 396-8, setting Kent a target of 365 from 74 overs. Ryan Rickelton was their top scorer with 133, while George Linde took 3-43. The draw had looked the most likely result at the start of play, but the hosts collapsed from 64-0 midway through the afternoon session to 161 all out. The visitors began day four with a lead of 252, when the most realistic hope of a meaningful contest seemed to hinge on Kent taking early wickets with the new ball. Yet although Lewis McManus added just a single to his overnight score of four when he was strangled down the leg side by Matt Milnes and caught by Sam Billings in the third over, Rickelton and Luke Procter responded with a 72-run stand. The partnership was initially cautious, but once the lead was over 300 the visitors started to swing. When Rickelton was eventually stumped after charging down the wicket to Linde, Kerrigan came in and reverse swept Jack Leaning for six. His 10-ball cameo ended when he skied Linde to Daniel Bell-Drummond at deep-midwicket and was caught for 22. The word on the vine on Wednesday night was that Northamptonshire were unlikely to risk a declaration against a direct relegation rival, but after 100 overs they came off, sending a frisson of excitement around the St Lawrence that there might be a game on after all. If the target was gettable in theory, Zak Crawley and Ben Compton batted cautiously for the seven overs through to lunch and showed little appetite for the chase after it. Crawley lasted for just over an hour after the restart, but when he was caught behind off Kerrigan, wickets began to tumble. Kerrigan removed Bell-Drummond for one, caught at first slip by Jimmy Neesham, and the visitors' hopes soared when the same bowler had Compton caught by Emilio Gay at short leg for 34. Keogh then trapped Joe Denly lbw for five, at which point Kent had lost four for 24 and still had another 41 overs to survive. It was 96-4 at tea and although Jordan Cox and Leaning put together a useful stand of 49, Kerrigan bowled the former for 31 Leaning and Billings looked to be taking Kent towards safety when Kerrigan took two wickets in four balls. Leaning played on to Keogh and was bowled for 26 and Linde went in the same over, lasting only three balls before he tried to sweep Keogh and was caught by Neesham for a duck, leaving Kent in deep trouble on 144-7 with 16 overs remaining. In his next over Keogh bowled Grant Stewart for a duck and Kerrigan then had Milnes caught, by Josh Cobb in the slips, also without scoring. That left last man Matt Quinn at least 11.5 overs to survive with Billings. They survived to that landmark, but with Northamptonshire rattling through the overs, there was still another 10 minutes in hand and, having successfully deadbatted 37 deliveries, Quinn was finally caught at short leg by the subsitute fielder James Sales.

risk appetite,Hepatitis A cases spread beyond cluster,2024-09-15,2019-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-48676818,"An outbreak of Hepatitis A in the Vale of Glamorgan has now spread to seven confirmed cases. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the viral infection has spread beyond a cluster of five cases at two primary schools in May. But it said the patients were all linked to one another and ""there is no evidence of a wider public health risk at this time."" The infection is described as unpleasant but is not usually serious. Some pupils at Victoria Primary School in Penarth and Palmerston Primary School in Barry were offered jabs ""as a precaution"" last month. The two new cases do not involve children at these schools although both have direct links to the original five cases. Dr Rhianwen Stiff, PHW consultant in communicable disease control, said: ""Hepatitis A is a viral infection that may cause flu-like illness or gastrointestinal upset.  ""Hepatitis A can be unpleasant, but it's not usually serious and most people make a full recovery within a couple of months. Children often only have a very mild illness or do not have symptoms at all."""
risk appetite,Schools to get guidance on supporting trans pupils,2024-09-15,2023-04-21,By Bethan Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65336915,"National guidance for schools in Wales on how to support transgender pupils will be published during the next academic year. The Welsh government said it required ""extensive consultation"" and would provide ""clear and well-informed advice"". One charity said teachers often lacked confidence in talking about issues relating to gender. School of Hard Knocks said the topic came up ""more and more"" in schools. The charity uses sports like rugby to help at-risk children re-engage with school and avoid permanent exclusion, but found there was an appetite from teachers for help in how to support transgender, non-binary and gender-exploring young people.  Sian Edwards said it ran focus groups to find out the key issues faced by teachers and pupils. ""More and more students are exploring their gender and being open with how they identify and using pronouns that differ to the ones they were given at birth,"" she said. ""That's something teachers are seeing more and more and it's not something that they're necessarily familiar with or comfortable with."" The Inc Project, led by School of Hard Knocks, now offers training to schools and other organisations. ""A key message from the training is - have the conversation. Students just want to know that you're trying to help - that is the biggest thing that will make a difference,"" added Dr Edwards. Alison Carney, a consultant who helps deliver the training, acknowledged it could be a sensitive area and teachers feared getting it wrong. ""We talked to the kids and the teachers about what are the problems they're having in school and this isn't about necessarily getting down to the [detail] of policy,"" she said. ""It's simply about what could make their day to day better."" The Welsh government committed to issuing guidance in summer 2023 as part of its LGBTQ+ Action Plan, but said it had been delayed to ensure a full consultation avoiding exam time and the school summer holidays. ""This is a complex area of policy which requires extensive consultation with experts, practitioners and the public, as well as children and young people themselves,"" the Welsh government said. It said the guidance was needed to help teachers make sure transgender children and young people ""feel safe and adequately supported in education"". Dan Hayes, 23, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said more guidance could have helped him while he was at school.  ""It started when I was maybe eight or nine. It was mainly me thinking 'these aren't the clothes I'm meant to wear'. As I went through puberty... 'I shouldn't look like this',"" he said.  ""I actually found the words to describe myself a lot later when I was 16 or 17. But even then it took a lot to identify with those words 'I am transgender'."" Dan said he found having to wear girls' uniform difficult. ""I always felt very uncomfortable going to school looking like that. I tried my best to fit in growing my hair long, wearing make-up but it just never worked,"" he said.  Dan said being transgender or non-binary was rarely mentioned in school, apart from as ""a joke"" and he said more guidance for teachers might help. ""I didn't want to talk to any of my teachers about it because I didn't think they'd understand. ""I think it's important for trans kids to know there are people like them out there."" The Welsh Conservatives said it was a ""delicate subject"" and ""vital"" to get right. The party's education spokesperson, Laura Anne Jones, said: ""The guidance should allow teachers to focus on teaching and not pander to identity politics and culture wars."" Any guidance ""should not come at the expense of women and girls' rights"", she added. The Children's Commissioner for Wales, Rocio Cifuentes, said it was important that adults were ""well equipped and confident in giving advice and help"". ""I expect the Welsh government's upcoming national trans guidance for schools to act as a comprehensive and practical tool to help schools to confidently respond to pupils' needs,"" she added. The UK government has promised guidance for schools in England during the summer term after an education union said members were having to navigate ""a minefield"". Some parents have previously sought to challenge the approach taken by schools and local authorities."
risk appetite,Cameron warned over 'stupid' Brexit vote,2024-09-15,2019-01-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46951942,"European Council President Donald Tusk told David Cameron to ""get real"" over his ""stupid referendum"" before the 2016 Brexit vote, a BBC documentary reveals. Mr Tusk tells the three-part show that he warned the then prime minister there was no ""appetite for revolution in Europe"" and he ""could lose everything"". He claims that Mr Cameron, who did not take part in the programme, felt ""there was no risk of a referendum"" happening. But Craig Oliver, Mr Cameron's former communications director, denies this. ""David Cameron spent the whole of the 2015 election campaign making clear he would not lead any form of government that didn't have a referendum,"" he said on Twitter. In BBC Two's ""Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil"", which starts next Monday, Mr Tusk said Mr Cameron thought a referendum would not happen because of the coalition government with the Lib Dems. ""[He told me] he felt really safe, because he thought at the same time that there's no risk of a referendum, because his coalition partner, the Liberals, would block this idea of a referendum,"" Mr Tusk said. ""But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner. So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory."" Mr Tusk said he was ""really amazed and even shocked"" to learn from Mr Cameron that he decided to hold the referendum because of his own party. Mr Cameron decided to resign as prime minister when the Leave campaign won the referendum. The programme's producers said he did not take part in the programme because he has signed an exclusive deal for his memoirs.  Mr Tusk warned Mr Cameron that other European prime ministers would not be inclined to help him in the referendum, and says: ""For the first time I saw something close to fear in his eyes. He finally realised what a challenge he was facing."" And after hearing Mr Cameron's decision to quit, Mr Tusk says he told him: ""Yes David, it would be very difficult even to imagine that a prime minister who was the leader of Remain's campaign would be just two days later a prime minister negotiating Brexit. ""It was like his day of reckoning was coming, reckoning for his biggest mistake in his life."" The first episode of the three-part series features interviews with former chancellor George Osborne, ex-foreign secretary William Hague, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and former French presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. Nick Clegg, the UK's then EU ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers and Mr Oliver are also included. In the programme, Mr Sarkozy reveals how he warned Mr Cameron about his attempt at strong-arm tactics with EU leaders over concessions on migrant rules and integration, telling him: ""If you try to break our arm, you'll get nothing."" And Mr Hollande says that during a visit to Chequers in 2015 he tried to talk the Tory leader out of holding the referendum. ""Nothing obliged him to hold the referendum when he did,"" he tells the documentary. ""This would not be the first time that a commitment made at an election had not been kept afterwards, but he wanted to show he could negotiate successfully with Europeans."" Theresa May, who is criticised in the programme by Mr Osborne - who she sacked as chancellor, also declined to take part in the programme Describing a meeting held by Mr Cameron to get ministers' views on whether to back a referendum, Mr Osborne said: ""Theresa May didn't say very much, which was par for the course in those meetings."" The first episode of Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, 'We Quit', is on BBC Two on Monday, 28 January at 21:00 GMT and available on iPlayer afterwards."
risk appetite,No plans for new nuclear reactors in Scotland,2024-09-15,2022-04-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61013732,"No new nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland as part of the UK government's plans to boost energy independence, it has been confirmed. UK ministers want to install eight new reactors at existing sites to help reduce reliance on oil and gas. But the Scottish government is opposed to nuclear energy, and could block any new developments via planning powers. Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said there were ""no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland"" in future. His Scottish counterpart Michael Matheson said the focus should instead be on accelerating the decarbonisation of the network and ramping up investment in energy efficiency. The UK government plans will also see a new licensing round for oil and gas projects in the North Sea - something the Scottish government has also dismissed as not a short-term solution to energy concerns. The UK government is setting out a new energy strategy, which includes plans to increase wind, hydrogen and solar power production. It also aims to accelerate the use of nuclear power, with up to eight more nuclear reactors across England and Wales. Ministers hope up to 24GW will come from this source by 2050 - representing about 25% of the UK's projected electricity demand.  A new government body, Great British Nuclear, will be set up to bring forward new projects and a £120m Future Nuclear Enabling Fund will be set up this month.  However, none of the reactors will be built in Scotland, which now only has one operational nuclear station - at Torness in East Lothian, which is due to close in 2028. Mr Kwarteng told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the only way to decarbonise the UK's energy ""baseload"" was through use of nuclear energy, saying there was ""huge appetite"" for new projects in England and Wales. He added: ""We have no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland. It's a devolved affair, it's up to people in Edinburgh to decide what their nuclear policy is."" Mr Matheson told BBC Scotland the backbone of future energy supply should be offshore renewables, in particular wind farms. And he dismissed nuclear power as being risky and expensive, saying it would need to be subsidised heavily by taxpayers. He said: ""Not only is there environmental risk associated with that, there is also the issue that this is likely to drive up the cost of household bills - whereas renewables such as wind and marine tidal in the future would actually reduce the cost of electricity.  ""I think the UK government might have allowed themselves to be wrapped up in the nuclear lobby here."" The GMB Scotland union has backed nuclear energy, with senior organiser Drew Duffy saying it was was ""an absolute pipe dream that we could provide Scotland's energy needs on wind alone"". He said: ""Yes there has to be renewables, wind is going to be part of an energy mix, but there are days when the wind doesn't blow. You could have a million wind farms, but if there's no wind they don't generate enough electricity to keep the lights on. ""Nuclear is green, it's safe, and it's continuous - you can have that as the baseline to make sure that the lights in Scotland stay on."" Nuclear power is licensed by the UK government, so there could only be new plants in Scotland with Westminster's approval. What Kwasi Kwarteng has also made clear is that Holyrood's say-so would also be required. Not only has the business secretary said he has no plans to ""impose"" new reactors, he's gone further by describing nuclear policy as a ""devolved affair"". That approach may frustrate those in the UK government who wanted the energy security strategy to challenge the Scottish government's long-standing opposition to new nuclear. The UK energy minister Greg Hands recently tried an alternative approach - appealing for a rethink in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, he seemed to accept that because planning powers are devolved it would be very difficult to proceed without Scottish government consent. At Holyrood, the SNP, Greens and Liberal Democrats are against new nuclear, while the Conservatives and Labour are, like the GMB union, in favour. Without new plants Scotland will have no nuclear power by 2028 except that which is drawn from England on the shared electricity grid on days when the wind is not blowing strongly. Scottish and UK ministers are also at odds over the future of domestic oil and gas supplies, with the energy strategy calling for fresh licensing in the North Sea. Mr Matheson said any new development of reserves in the North Sea would need to be compatible with climate change goals - and would not come quickly or cheaply. He added: ""Even fossil fuels that come from Scottish waters are open to the vagaries of international markets. Oil and gas is an internationally-traded commodity, so if the prices go up internationally we can't insulate ourselves from that. ""That's why the objective is to move much more quickly towards renewables and energy efficiency."" The UK government said its commitment to more North Sea projects recognised ""the importance of these fuels to the transition and to energy security"", adding that producing gas in the UK had a lower carbon footprint than that imported from abroad. However, last month the government's climate advisers said UK-produced gas would be sold internationally and would barely reduce the consumer price. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the plans would ""turbocharge energy production"" and the key to that would be accelerating the use of green technologies.  He added: ""We will also maximise oil and gas production in the North Sea, making the most of our existing assets and expertise. This will bolster domestic energy security while at the same time supporting Scottish jobs.  ""Scotland will play a key role in achieving our ambitious energy security strategy, and we will work with the Scottish government to maximise our domestic energy supply."" Although most aspects of energy policy are reserved to the UK parliament, planning is a devolved matter and therefore the Scottish ministers have the power to approve or reject new projects north of the border.  Deirdre Michie, chief executive of industry trade body Offshore Energies UK, said ""energy security is now national security"". She added: ""Many companies involved in UK oil and gas are already expanding into offshore wind, creating the infrastructure for mass hydrogen production, and building carbon capture and storage systems. They have the expertise not just in engineering but also in financing and managing these huge projects."" For offshore wind, the government said its new target would be to generate up to 50GW by 2030, more than enough to power every home in the UK.   For onshore wind, the strategy only commits to consulting on developing partnerships with ""a limited number of supportive communities"" who wish to host wind turbines in return for lower energy bills.  Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said: ""Supercharging ambition on green energy security is to be welcomed - we have the projects and are ready to build them.  ""It takes five times longer to get a project through the UK's planning system than to build it - that's got to change if we're to stand any chance of weaning our energy system off global gas and making a green future a reality."" Targets for hydrogen production are also being doubled, with an ambition of increasing capacity to up to 10GW by 2030.  Under the new plans, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030."
risk appetite,Apathy or anxiety - why are fewer England fans going to Russia?,2024-09-15,2018-04-18,Mantej Mann,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43688549,"England begin their 2018 World Cup campaign against Tunisia in Volgograd Still interested in going to the World Cup in Russia this summer? The latest ticket sales phase opened on Wednesday and figures so far show the appetite among England fans is not what it was four years ago. With 30,711 tickets allocated so far, England fans are only the 11th most numerous of those making the trip from other countries. During the second sales window which closed on 3 April, there were more tickets taken up by fans from China and India, neither represented at the finals, than from England. By February 2014, 51,222 tickets had already been allocated to England fans heading to Brazil, making them sixth on the list of countries. Tickets are allocated by Fifa according to demand. So why the relative lack of interest? Apathy about the football or worries about politics or crowd violence? And are fans' fears misplaced?  England's record at the past six World Cups First and foremost, football fans want to see their team win. In 2014, England were among, external the most heavily supported teams, despite a relative lack of success in international football in recent times.  The national team have reached the quarter-finals of a World Cup just twice in their past six attempts, and they have not won a knockout game at a major tournament in 12 years.  So are fans simply losing interest?  Garford Beck, the team manager of England Fans FC, thinks so, claiming that a lot of England fans ""reached the end of the road after Brazil, because it was such a poor showing"". And CJ Joiner, a Coventry City fan and member of the FA travel club for the past five years, says that ""boring football doesn't help"" encourage fans to travel. He has spent just over £1,000 to buy tickets for each potential England game - seven in total - but can return them and receive a refund should England fail to progress past a certain stage. ""England fans will have to spend a lot of money to follow the side in Russia, but under Gareth Southgate the side lack creativity,"" he told BBC Sport. Also at the forefront of fans' minds is the possibility of being caught up in violence between rival supporters. England and Russia fans clashed on the streets of Marseille two years ago, before and after the Euro 2016 meeting between the two nations. There were also incidents inside the stadium on the evening of the game. The Russian contingent in the port city were smaller in number but arrived prepared for conflict. Indeed, some England fans in a BBC documentary described the onslaught as a ""military operation"".  In the programme - Russia's Hooligan Army - a group of Russian ultras taunted their English counterparts and warned of violence at this summer's World Cup on home soil.  However, Anwar Uddin, diversity and campaigns manager for the Football Supporters' Foundation, told BBC Sport he expects the hooligans to be on their ""best behaviour"". ""I was in Marseille and the way the Russians went about their business was methodical - they were there to make their mark,"" he said. Clashes broke out at the end of the match between England and Russia in Marseilles two years ago ""Seeing what is reported about some aspects of Russian society, people are going to build up an idea in their heads about what the country is like. It does make you think. ""But I would like to think the Russian fans will be on their best behaviour with the world watching on."" The nerve agent attack on former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on UK soil in March, led many to point the finger at Moscow. The events in Salisbury have severely strained diplomatic relations between the UK and Russia but Beck, of England Fans FC, believes ""anti-British sentiment from Russia is nothing new"". And although the last tournament was on another continent, he suggests more fans travelled to Brazil for the South American climate, and because the country ""has a better image and is friendlier to England"". While most England fans acknowledge the threat of violence from their Russian counterparts, Beck raises concerns about the local police.  ""I like Eastern Europe but when we go over there we do seem to get some poor treatment from the authorities."" Those claims of Russian police being heavy-handed are echoed by Coventry fan Joiner. He said: ""I actually think England fans will be OK in terms of opposing fans, but it's the police I would be worried about."" Official guidelines for travelling supporters from the foreign office, external state: ""Due to heightened political tensions between the UK and Russia, you should be aware of the possibility of anti-British sentiment or harassment at this time.  ""If you're currently in Russia or due to travel in the coming weeks, you're advised to remain vigilant, avoid any protests or demonstrations and avoid commenting publicly on political developments."" Arsenal's Europa League game at CSKA Moscow attracted a large number of Russian Gunners fans But the recent experiences of Arsenal fans who travelled to watch their side against CSKA Moscow earlier this month for a Europa League quarter-final tie have been positive. Danny, from Guildford, told BBC Sport: ""I feel you're safer going to a sporting event than doing anything else. ""People have been so friendly. The stereotypes you have, so far they've been completely the opposite. Everyone's been chatty and friendly. ""I don't know if you can equate club and country - this is not as high profile. I'm not going to the World Cup but it's been a really positive experience. ""Quite a few of us go in large groups to games and when I suggested this trip they said 'don't be silly', because they didn't want to take the risk."" Sam, from north London, added: ""A lot of people told us we were foolish for coming out here but it has been friendly, the city is beautiful, and it's one of the best trips we've been on. ""We've had a good reception from the locals. We were out until the early hours and there was no hostility. ""I was in Marseille when England played Russia and didn't have any problems - it's about where you position yourself. If you keep yourself away from the minority that cause trouble you'll be fine."" The supporters we spoke to said one of their biggest issues was paying £185 for a visa at late notice, although the cost of a visa for an England fan should be cheaper because they buy them earlier. Last year, European football's anti-discrimination group Fare warned gay fans going to Russia not to show affection in public if they wanted to stay safe. In January, Spartak Moscow were sanctioned after posting a tweet referring to their black players as ""chocolates"". Russian politicians have been criticised for a 2013 law banning gay 'propaganda' - a law the European Court of Human Rights last year ruled was ""discriminatory"". But former Chelsea and Russia midfielder Alexei Smertin urged gay and ethnic minority England supporters in March not to be deterred from travelling by fears of racist or homophobic abuse. Smertin, who is now anti-discrimination chief for the finals, told BBC World Service fans' ""minds would be changed completely"" about Russia as a country. Alexei Smertin (right, with Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o) has played down reports of racism in Russia Alexei Sorokin, chief of Russia's World Cup organising committee, has also played down safety concerns for UK visitors. ""We will ensure security in equal measures to all, from dignitaries to fans,"" Sorokin told TASS, the government-owned Russian news agency. ""To us, there is no difference which country people come from or what our diplomatic relations with them are. It is a shame that the games will be played in such circumstances."" However, the Football Supporters' Foundation's Uddin said the threat of racism was ""one of the negatives"" when weighing up whether to go to the World Cup. ""If you're going to spend a ridiculous amount of money following England you have to weigh up all the pros and cons,"" said Uddin, who is intending to go to Russia later in the tournament. ""There are a lot of negatives when thinking about Russia and the element of violence and racism is on the list. People have to be realistic and safety has to be a concern."" Some England fans lay part of the blame with the Football Association.  To buy tickets through the FA for any away fixture or major tournament, England fans must be members of the travel club. But Sky Blues supporter Joiner says membership has significantly declined in recent years.  ""There were 19,000 official members before the World Cup in Brazil four years ago, but there are only 11-12,000 now,"" he said. Joiner also says the FA are not ""enticing fans"" to become members of the travel club and that there is a feeling among some that the organisation is focused on filling Wembley for home games. ""That's all the FA are bothered about because they generate more revenue from home fixtures,"" Joiner said. In response, an FA spokesperson said: ""We are always grateful for the travelling support that England receive and acknowledge that there are a number of factors that determine attendance at tournaments."" England fans trouble 'a worrying trend' More than 100 England fans arrested"
risk appetite,Typhoid vaccine set to have 'huge impact',2024-09-15,2017-10-24,By James Gallagher,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-41724996,"A new vaccine that could prevent up to nine-in-10 cases of typhoid fever has been recommended by the World Health Organization. Experts say it could have a ""huge impact"" on the 22 million cases, and 220,000 deaths, from typhoid each year. Crucially it works in children, who are at high-risk of the infection, unlike other typhoid vaccines. It is hoped the vaccine could eventually help countries eliminate typhoid.  Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella Typhi bacteria and patients have: The bacteria are highly contagious and spread through contaminated food or water.  The infection is most common in countries with poor sanitation and a lack of clean water, particularly in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Two typhoid vaccines already approved to help reduce the number of cases, but none are licensed for children under the age of two.  The decision to recommend the new conjugate typhoid vaccine was made by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (Sage). Prof Alejandro Cravioto, the chairman of Sage, said: ""For the first time I think we do have a very effective vaccine."" Sage recommended the vaccine should be given to children aged six-months old and said catch-up campaigns focusing on children up to 15 years old should also take place.  Prof Cravioto said the vaccine was vital as the world was ""reaching the limit"" of current treatments due to the ""crazy amount"" of antibiotic resistance the typhoid bacterium had acquired. Data from a clinical trial of the vaccine, carried out by the University of Oxford, was published just last month in the Lancet medical journal. The ""challenge study"" gave the vaccine to 112 people and then deliberately infected (challenged) them with typhoid-causing bacteria.  Such an approach gives a clear picture of a vaccine's effectiveness without having to immunise thousands of people. It showed the vaccine was up to 87% effective. Prof Andrew Pollard, who ran those trials, told the BBC News website: ""It could have a huge impact. ""If it can be rolled out in all communities, it must be possible to prevent the majority of cases and if it also interrupts transmission, which hasn't been shown yet, then it could be eliminated from those regions.""  Gavi, the global body that pays for vaccines in 68 low and middle-income countries, is now considering whether to add the typhoid vaccine. Dr Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, said: ""Not only could this vaccine save lives, it could also prove to be a valuable weapon in the fight against antimicrobial resistance."" Before antibiotics, typhoid killed one-in-five people infected. Now there is growing levels of typhoid that is resistant to drugs.     Follow James on Twitter."
risk appetite,What's happening with foreign travel?,2024-09-15,2021-06-08,By Caroline Davies & Simon Browning,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57394810,"International travel for non-essential reasons like going on holiday has been legal since 17 May, but with so few countries on the green list, the destinations where travellers can go without quarantining are few in number.  While the government has always said that international travel would be limited, the travel industry had not foreseen that the list would be as limited as it is, particularly now that Portugal has been moved to the amber list. So what could get travel going again and what are the roadblocks? While the government is concerned about importing new cases into the UK, the biggest concern is that tourists could bring in a vaccine-resistant variant that would render vaccination efforts useless and endanger public health.  The difficulty is working out when a variant - or in Portugal's case - a mutation, is significant enough to change a country's traffic light status. Is it when it is classified as being ""of concern"", ""of interest"" or just when it's identified in the first place? ""The move from variant of interest, to variant of concern, has never been properly identified as the parameters to look at,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter's Medical School tells the BBC. ""They mostly all start off as variants of interest and become variants of concern when displaying activities and properties of being more infectious, severe disease causing and bypassing the current vaccines."" But where that line is drawn is important, particularly if the identification of a variant or mutation is enough to move a country from one level to another.  Some in the industry think the government is becoming too risk-averse. ""There's talk of a new variant and everything shuts down,"" says budget airline Jet2's boss Steve Heapy. ""Is that how it's going to be going forward?"" ""If it is, then they're trying to defeat mother nature - virus do have variants all the time."" Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the sector isn't calling a reopening of travel everywhere. ""But if the government is going to have this kind of risk appetite...then it's going to be really difficult to see how we can have a summer season,"" he says.  A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""We have always been clear that protecting public health is our priority and that if decisive action was needed, it would be swiftly taken."" The industry had hoped that while mainland Greece and Spain might not yet be on the green list, at least some of the Spanish and Greek islands would be. The island policy was used last year and Transport secretary Grant Shapps said in April that it was something his department wanted to consider. But there are difficulties with looking at individual islands, partly because of their size. ""Healthcare facilities are limited and they can provide what they can and no more,"" says Dr Pankhania.  ""There could come a time when a British holidaymaker is told, wait - we have Spanish people here who are sick and they could take priority, leaving holidaymakers stuck."" There are also worries that while coronavirus testing is showing infection rates for island residents, it isn't including the test results for tourists, who might still spread it amongst one another. However, others argue that including smaller regions on the green list would helpful keep travel flowing where the risk is low. This is a sore point with the travel industry, which says it doesn't understand what tips a country between the different colours.  While the government has laid out criteria like vaccination rates, virus levels, variants and the quality of genomic sequencing offered by a country, it hasn't set out exactly what level of each leads to a move up or down the list.   ""We can't plan what we're doing,' says Mr Heapy. ""We've either got to assume all the destinations will be green, none of the destinations will be green or use a lottery machine and try to work it out in the absence of a structured methodology."" Ultimately, this isn't just a decision about other countries' data.  While ministers are given recommendations by the Joint Biosecurity Centre about other countries' positions, they also weigh up other issues too, like the UK's health situation, or the practicalities of putting a country on the red, amber or green list. This is still a political decision. There's nothing in the government's guidelines about international business travel, or taking what other nations are doing into account when deciding whether to put a country on the green list. Yesterday, transatlantic airline bosses came together to put pressure on UK and US politicians to reopen flights between the UK and USA for business and leisure travel.  They want to see US President Joe Biden and Boris Johnson commit to announcing a travel corridor at this weekend's G7 meeting in Cornwall. There is no doubt that time is of the essence for airlines, whose finances have been stripped by a year with minimal passengers.  Delta Airline boss Ed Bastion said it was rare to see all his aviation competitors come together, but that they were ""speaking in one voice"".  He warned that as Europe begins to open up to US travellers, the UK could be left behind, missing out on lucrative tourist income. The European Commission has announced that its EU Digital Covid-19 Passport will begin on 1 July, and may also be issued to non-European travellers, including visitors from the UK and the US. However, European nations are already beginning to welcome travellers. Spain, which is on the amber list, started allowing British travellers to enter without the need for a Covid test or vaccination certificate from Monday.  So you could visit Spain, but you'd still have to quarantine on your return.  ""It just beggars belief,"" Travel Trade Gazette editor Sophie Griffiths tells the BBC. ""Especially as countries are opening up and Britain is closing down. People are just confused and frustrated about why that's happening."" EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren agrees: ""This decision has cut Britain off from Europe and from the world for that matter - it's utterly confusing for the British people."" It is becoming a fine and delicate dance to find the equilibrium between the demands of travel bosses and governments.  ""I can see where [travel bosses] are coming from,"" says Dr Pankhania. ""But from an infection control point of view we are finely balanced now. We are nearly there - it would be better to be completely certain before opening the gates to all, [as] once opened, it is difficult to close them again."""
risk appetite,The south Indian films winning on Bollywood's turf,2024-09-15,2022-04-20,By Sharanya Hrishikesh and Meryl Sebastian,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61118482,"For decades, Bollywood, which makes Hindi films, was seen as synonymous with Indian films while other-language industries were termed ""regional"". But are the sands shifting a little now? Last week, KGF 2, a Kannada film which was also dubbed into other languages, released in 4,500 screens across India - a number usually reserved for Bollywood superstars such as Salman Khan. After a spectacular opening, the movie - the sequel to a flamboyant 2018 hit about a gangster who fights to take over a gold mine - looks set to become one of India's biggest box-office hits. KGF 2 came on the heels of Telugu-language blockbuster RRR, which is still drawing crowds in northern Indian theatres. A couple of months ago, another Telugu film, Pushpa, performed well with the Hindi audience before streaming online - since then, its dialogues and songs have sparked hundreds of Instagram reels. Over decades, many filmmakers have attempted to make ""pan-Indian"" films that appeal to audiences across the country - a major challenge considering the diversity of languages and cultures in India. Some, like Tamil directors Mani Ratnam and Shankar, succeeded once in a while with films that addressed larger, ""national"" anxieties, dramatic love stories or grand productions featuring big stars.     But these efforts were intermittent. Bollywood films had bigger budgets as they were aimed at a larger audience - Hindi is by far the most widely spoken language in India. In comparison, films in other languages didn't have that much appetite for risk. Now, the back-to-back success of KGF 2, RRR and Pushpa - seven years after Telugu blockbuster Baahubali opened the doors - has given new hope.  ""There couldn't be better news for Indian cinema,"" media specialist Vanita Kohli-Khandekar wrote recently about the rise of the pan-Indian movie.  ""It means more tickets sold and therefore more revenues."" Film critic Anupama Chopra agrees the change is welcome. ""The industries in the south are making absolutely fantastic films and it's wonderful that they are reaching new audiences. I think that this cross-pollination between industries is only going to help Indian cinema move ahead,"" she says, pointing to the quality and variety of smaller southern movies released on streaming platforms during the pandemic. In the meantime, Bollywood is seeing a shift in viewership patterns. In a bid to appeal to multiplex audiences and urbane viewers of streaming platforms, it has been making fewer mass entertainers that revolve around a larger-than-life hero. While the diversity in its stories and performers has improved, there is a large section of the traditional audience that feels underserved.  Bollywood's biggest hit so far this year is Kashmir Files, a controversial movie on the exodus of Hindus from Kashmir that was backed by right-wing politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  In the past decade, the industry has also shifted from an overt reliance on its big three superstars - Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan. Actresses such as Deepika Padukone and Alia Bhatt and industry outsiders like Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkumar Rao now regularly headline movies with strong scripts. Trade analyst Komal Nahta thinks Bollywood's audiences still love the big blockbuster. It's just that southern industries are making them with better scripts and slicker visuals. Salman Khan's last release, Radhe - delayed a year because of the pandemic -  was a flop, even though it included many of the tropes that worked for his earlier movies. Critics panned the film for its lacklustre scripting and generic storytelling. ""I think Hindi cinema got lazy in its rendition of the big, commercial film. They became too reliant on the stars. But the manna from heaven arrives only when you put a great star with a great script,"" Ms Chopra says. Mr Nahta insists, however, that Bollywood shouldn't worry. ""People like to say Bollywood is dead, cinema is dead but recent films such as Suryavanshi was a hit, Gangubai Kathiawadi did well and Kashmir Files was a blockbuster,"" he says. The current anxiety, he adds, is because Pushpa, RRR and KGF 2 released so close to each other. ""It seems to have shaken the confidence of Bollywood and, actually, trade people's confidence in Bollywood films."" The rise of the crossover film didn't happen overnight.  Film journalist Aseem Chhabra points out that dubbed versions of big Hollywood films such as Spiderman and Batman have worked with audiences across India.  ""They showed there is an audience for dubbed films,"" he says.  Satellite TV channels, which began airing Telugu films dubbed in Hindi around a decade ago, made several actors from the industry recognisable to the northern Indian audience. The Telugu industry - which, starting with Baahubali in 2015, has produced most of the pan-Indian successes - also began changing around this time. While Telugu viewers prefer star-driven movies with plenty of traditional ""masala"" elements, mixing romance, action, melodrama and comedy, newer filmmakers have blended these with good story-telling, says journalist Sangeetha Devi Dundoo, who tracks the industry. ""SS Rajamouli [who directed Baahubali] changed the game with Magadheera and Eega, where the emotional undercurrent of the story and the characters drove the action sequences,"" she says. The industry also managed to expand the scale of its productions - dubbed films worked well in neighbouring Tamil Nadu, increasing profits and hence budgets. ""The Telugu and Tamil population abroad is also a sizable market. I think all this has contributed to films being produced with bigger budgets,"" Ms Dundoo says.  She points out, however, that not all ambitious crossover films can work, as the recent failure of Prabhas-starrer Radhe Shyam shows. Though their budgets are usually smaller, the Tamil and Malayalam film industries also have a new crop of promising filmmakers, indicating that viewers, especially those with access to streaming platforms, will continue to be spoilt for choice.  But it's hard to predict what the future will be like - for instance, whether only star-driven spectacles can be pan-Indian theatrical successes. As Ms Chopra points out, there is no certainty right now if viewers will pay to watch even smaller Hindi films in theatres, let alone smaller dubbed films.  ""Conventional wisdom right now is that people will come into theatres for an event movie, but they will not come for smaller films,"" she says, adding, however, that the success of Kashmir Files - which had no big stars - complicates this belief. Bollywood remakes of southern hits - which have paid off well for actors such as Salman and Shahid Kapoor - are also likely to be fewer in number. ""If a Hindi viewer can access the dubbed version, they don't need to watch a Bollywood star doing the same movie again,"" Mr Chhabra says.     As a critic and viewer, Ms Chopra says she is happy to see other film industries in the spotlight. ""Bollywood has monopolised it for much too long,"" she says."
risk appetite,MasterChef winner opens his restaurant,2024-09-15,2021-09-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-58522982,"A MasterChef: The Professionals winner has now opened a restaurant, after plans were put on hold during the pandemic.  Stu Deeley, from Birmingham, planned to launch last summer in the city, after his success in the competition in 2019, but an investor pulled out. Hampton Manor in Solihull stepped in this year and his new restaurant, Smoke, is set within its grounds. It was ""an amazing feeling"" to be able to open, Mr Deeley said.  ""I think as I've got older and as if I've kind of been cooking for longer, I really just like food that's slightly simpler. ""I'm not so interested in foams and gels and whatever any more. I just want a really nice cooked piece of meat and some really nice veg to go on the side."" Asked about the investor pulling out, Mr Deeley said obviously financially because of Covid, it ""limited a lot of new businesses"". He added: ""I'm just fortunate that we didn't open and then had to close. ""I'm a big believer in fate and I think if you dwell on the fact that something didn't happen, then you're gonna spend your life regretting missed opportunities that you could go for instead."" Mr Deeley said he did ""some bits on the side, whether it was at home, boxes, or further down the line when we were allowed cooking in open spaces"". Hampton Manor owner Fjona Hill said: ""It's certainly been a financial risk this year. I mean we've opened a bakery, we've (opened) a second restaurant, we're just about to open our third restaurant. ""It's not typically the time you open new things, but I think there is a massive appetite at the moment to get out."" Mr Deeley stated: ""Obviously Masterchef was what feels like a lifetime ago now, so I'm more than ready for a new challenge.""  Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

risk appetite,Mortgage lending rules eased by Bank of England,2024-09-15,2022-07-31,By Simon Read,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62353114,"Mortgage borrowing rules have been eased after the Bank of England scrapped an affordability test. The ""stress test"" forced lenders to calculate whether potential borrowers would be able to cope if interest rates climbed by up to 3%. Removing the test may help some potential borrowers get loans, such as the self-employed or freelance workers. But other rules such as strict loan-to-income limits will not make it easier for most people to get a mortgage. The withdrawal of the affordability test was announced in June but has come into effect on Monday. ""Scrapping the affordability test is not as reckless as it may sound,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. ""The loan-to-income framework remains so there will still be some restrictions in place; it is not turning into a free-for-all on the lending front.  ""Lenders will also still use some form of testing but to their own choosing according to their risk appetite."" In other words there will not be an immediate impact for borrowers as lenders will not need to change the way they assess loans. However, some may well change their own rules in the future. Mark Yallop, chairman of the Financial Markets Standards Board, said although the change would make it ""slightly easier"" for some borrowers to get a mortgage, he did not think with would have a significant impact.  ""The biggest constraint on new mortgages is the ability of borrowers to afford a deposit,"" he added.  The mortgage affordability test was introduced in 2014 as part of a widescale tightening up of the mortgage market to ensure there were no repeats of the mis-selling scandal that partially contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. The rule was put in place to ensure that borrowers did not become a threat to the financial stability of lenders by taking on debt they subsequently might not be able to repay.  Lenders had to not only work out if borrowers could afford a mortgage at the rate they were being offered, but also work out how they would be affected if interest rates soared by 3%. Borrowers who could not prove they could cope with such an eventuality might have been turned down for a loan on that basis, even if they could easily afford a mortgage at the existing rate. For that reason the test was seen by some as a barrier for some borrowers. ""The rule change could have a positive effect on borrowers who have been disadvantaged when it comes to getting on the property ladder,"" said Mr Harris.  For example, some potential first-time buyers who have been comfortably affording rents far higher than potential mortgage payments have failed affordability assessments. There are some key protections in place to help ensure that borrowers don't take on loans they may not be able to afford. The main one is a loan-to-income ""flow limit"" which limits the number of mortgages that lenders can grant to borrowers at ratios at or greater than 4.5 the borrowers' salary.  In short, it is very rare that a lender will consider a higher loan-to-income ratio because of the restriction. After a review of the rules in 2021 the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee judged that ""the LTI flow limit is likely to play a stronger role than the affordability test in guarding against an increase in aggregate household indebtedness and the number of highly indebted households in a scenario of rapidly rising house prices"". ""The change in the affordability rules may not be as significant as it sounds as the loan-to-income 'flow limit' will not be withdrawn, which has much greater impact on people's ability to borrow,"" said Gemma Harle, managing director at Quilter Financial Planning. The FCA's Mortgage Conduct of Business responsible lending rules also require a wide assessment of affordability."
risk appetite,'Sweeping' new powers for head teachers,2024-09-15,2017-06-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40275330,"The Scottish government has set out ""sweeping new powers"" for schools as part of a shake-up of education. Education Secretary John Swinney said his reforms were aimed at ""freeing our teachers to teach"". The reforms will see head teachers take responsibility for closing the attainment gap, choosing school staff and deciding curriculum content. They also aim to give schools more direct control over funding, with a consultation on fair funding launched. There was a mixed response from opposition parties, who welcomed parts of the plan, but said others did not go far enough. And local government organisation Cosla said the plan ""erodes local democratic accountability"". The government has been consulting on a review of the education system, amid concerns over an attainment gap between pupils from different backgrounds and declining performance in international rankings. Mr Swinney said the ""simple plan"" at the heart of his reforms was to ""free our teachers to teach"" and ""put new powers in the hands of head teachers"". These new powers will be set out in a statutory charter for head teachers, and will include: However, Mr Swinney said he was ""acutely conscious that schools also need support frameworks to function well"", insisting councils would still have a ""vital"" role in education. The reforms will establish ""regional improvement collaboratives"" to ""pool and strengthen resources to support learning and teaching in schools"". These will be led by a regional director, who will report to the chief inspector of education. The plans will also see a ""significant change"" to Education Scotland, which will have a ""renewed focus on professional learning and leadership"" along with ""strengthened inspection and improvement functions"". Schools will also have access to a ""home to school link worker"" to support parents and families. The education secretary said: ""Improving the education and life chances of our children and young people is the defining mission of this government. While there are many strengths in Scottish education, recent Pisa and literacy scores underline that we can, and we must, achieve more. ""We will reform the system so that the key decisions in a child's education are taken by schools. ""Schools will have the freedom to make their own decisions to improve learning and teaching. Everyone else within the education system will have a collective and shared responsibility to support schools. ""We will free teachers to teach. We will put new powers in the hands of head teachers. And we will all - government, councils and public bodies - support our schools."" Cosla, an umbrella group representing local authorities, said the government had ""endeavoured to pull off a conjuring trick by pretending councils still have a role in the delivery of education"". A spokesman said: ""We will embrace change which promotes better outcomes, but we will resist any change which does not. ""We are clear that what has been announced today erodes local democratic accountability and most certainly will not close the attainment gap."" Responding, Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith welcomed the steps to empower head teachers, but said Mr Swinney's reforms did not go far enough. She said they were ""half-baked and only pay lip service to real devolution"", calling them ""not enough to deal with the root cause of the problems faced"". Labour's Iain Gray meanwhile said the first reform needed was to have more teachers, properly supported and resourced. He welcomed the fact Mr Swinney had decided against having a centralised national funding solution, but questioned whether the regional organisation board plans would just add another layer of bureaucracy. Mr Swinney said a formal procurement process for new routes into teaching would begin shortly, although he stressed that any new route would need to meet General Teaching Council for Scotland tests ""to maintain credibility and academic rigour"". GTCS Chief Executive Kenneth Muir welcomed the announcement, saying the body was ""committed to offering new, flexible routes into teaching"" while maintaining that it was ""imperative that new teachers are properly qualified and registered"". Green MSP Ross Greer said the ""huge changes simply aren't what teachers, pupils and parents have been asking for"", criticising the regional organisational bodies in particular. He said: ""The government's own analysis of the consultation even says there was a 'lack of appetite' for these unaccountable regional bodies."" And Lib Dem Tavish Scott singled out the fact the government was not separating the inspection and curriculum functions of Education Scotland. He said: ""Pupils are let down when the Scottish government is allowed to mark its own homework in this way. Combined with regional boards that shift control towards ministers in Edinburgh, these proposals risk continuing the failed, top down solutions of the past."" The largest teachers' union, the EIS, said in its response to the government's review that the main challenges facing schools were related to funding, resources and staffing. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""While it is early in the process, this Review provides an opportunity for a more constructive and consensual approach to education to be re-established which would be a positive step for schools, teachers and pupils.  ""It is by schools, local authorities and politicians of all parties, at local and national level, working constructively together, that we can deliver enhancements to our comprehensive education system to ensure it continues to meet the needs of Scotland's young people long into the future."""
risk appetite,Could referendums resolve 'red line' issues?,2024-09-15,2018-05-31,By Mark Devenport,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44320267,"When Jeremy Corbyn visited Queen's University in Belfast I asked him whether Downing Street would be neutral on a future border poll if he was Prime Minister.  Mr Corbyn replied in the affirmative, declaring that a Labour government would implement the Good Friday agreement ""to the letter"". Subsequently, on Twitter, some people took me to task, claiming my question was misinformed. They cited the section of the Good Friday Agreement which commits the British and Irish governments to hold concurrent referendums (or should that be referenda?) stating that ""it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination"". This raises the question of what constitutes an ""external impediment""? Does it mean the UK government must take no part in any Border Poll campaign, in contrast to David Cameron's  previous active role in the Scottish independence referendum?  Or does it simply require a UK government not to stand in the way of facilitating a united Ireland should a border poll endorse that outcome? Could government ministers campaign, but only in their capacity as party representatives? I suspect this could be the stuff of future court cases should a border poll ever become a reality. For now, there is a contrast between Jeremy Corbyn's declared neutrality and the last Conservative manifesto, which pledged the party to ""never be neutral in expressing our support for the Union.""  For her part, the Secretary of State Karen Bradley insists the conditions do not exist for a border poll"". So we may have to wait some time to test out the 'no external impediment' argument. But what about referendums on other topics? The resounding victory for Repeal The 8th campaigners in the Irish Republic has led some to argue Northern Ireland should follow suit. The preferred option for local Pro-Choice groups is that Westminster politicians should act in the absence of a Stormont assembly. They believe they enjoy the sympathy of many Conservative and Labour MPs.  Perhaps the swiftest option for action would be an amendment to a forthcoming Domestic Abuse Bill, which is being proposed by Labour's Stella Creasy. However it's possible the Commons Speaker could rule such an amendment out of order because it departs so radically from the basic purpose of the bill.  Another route would be a Private Member's Bill, but the precedent of Conor McGinn's bill on same sex marriage isn't promising as it appears destined to fall foul of the parliamentary system. In that case some MPs, like the Health Committee chair Sarah Wollaston suggested a referendum on the abortion law in Northern Ireland may be the best way forward. This would depart from UK tradition in which referendums have been used for constitutional rather than policy matters. However, given Northern Ireland is being run by unelected officials with severely constrained decision making powers, you could argue that we departed from the good governance textbook rather a long time ago. Given the obvious need to placate their pro life parliamentary allies in the DUP, it's hard to imagine the current government rushing to call an abortion referendum. If they did, others might ask why just abortion? Why not same-sex marriage, the Irish language act or even a border poll? Back in January  three Unionist veterans themselves suggested a three pronged referendum on abortion, same-sex marriage and the Irish language could clear away some of Stormont's most contentious red lines. That sounds rather radical for a Northern Ireland Office with a track record of doing the bare minimum. But in the unlikely event that the Secretary of State is mulling over the pros and cons of an abortion referendum, she might also consider that answer Jeremy Corbyn gave me at Queen's University.  The DUP would, no doubt, be angered by any decision which challenges their long established anti-abortion policy. But would that anger really stretch to any parliamentary response, which might risk making the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn taking up residence in Downing Street any more of a likelihood? "
risk appetite,What will Trump do about Afghanistan?,2024-09-15,2017-01-25,Justin Rowlatt,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38730061,"There are still 13,000 Nato military personnel in Afghanistan, mostly American As Donald Trump settles into his new home in the White House, one of the most pressing issues in his in-tray is Afghanistan. America's longest war isn't something that he has said much about, and - as with so many issues - what he has said is contradictory. In the past, he has described America's involvement in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"", and has talked about pulling out US troops.   But when he spoke to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on 2 December, he reportedly told him that America would not waver in its commitment to Afghanistan. Then, however, he failed to invite Mr Ghani to his inauguration, deepening worries in Afghanistan that it simply was not a priority for the new president. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani praised the US for its commitment to Afghanistan, during his first official visit to Washington in 2015 The Taliban pitched in earlier this week, calling on President Trump to withdraw American forces from what they described as the ""quagmire"" of Afghanistan.  ""Nothing has been achieved,"" said the insurgent group, ""except the staining of innocent Afghans in their blood, and the destruction of villages and gardens."" The official American assessment of progress is not much more upbeat.   Mr Trump's challenge was summarised with shocking clarity earlier this month by the US watchdog overseeing the reconstruction process in Afghanistan, external, the special inspector general for Afghanistan, John F Sopko. Mr Sopko says the US has spent more in real terms in Afghanistan than America spent on the reconstruction of Europe after World War Two, yet only 63% of the country is currently controlled by the Afghan government, opium production is at record highs and corruption is still rife.  ""After 15 years,"" he says, ""Afghanistan still cannot support itself financially or functionally.  ""Long-term financial assistance is required if the country is to survive."" Just how vulnerable parts of the country are became very apparent when an Afghan colleague was given rare access to the battle against the Taliban in Helmand a few weeks ago. Aziz Ahmad Shafee flew into the provincial capital, Lashkargah, with soldiers from the Afghan National Army's 215th Corps.  A convoy of Humvees drove the troops a few kilometres to the outskirts of the city: that is where the front line is now. Afghan soldiers told the BBC they lacked even the most basic supplies The Taliban now control more than 80% of Helmand.  A province, let us not forget, where most of the 456 British military personnel killed in the Afghan conflict lost their lives.  And - despite a complete restructuring of the command of the 215th Corps overseen by American forces - it seems it still is not combat effective.   Afghan troops complain they lack even the most basic supplies.  ""For a month we've been saying we are running out of ammunition but we don't get any new supplies,"" Sgt class 1 Hyatullah told the BBC.  ""Our enemy is firing at us, but we don't have enough bullets to take them on."" His commander urged America's new president not to falter in his commitment to the Afghan government.   ""As a soldier of Afghanistan, I ask his excellency Donald Trump to continue the fight here"", said Brig Gen Mohammad Wali Ahmadzai, the commander of the 215th Corps in Helmand.   ""If he can give us more support, we can wipe the terrorists out.""   Most of the foreign troops in Afghanistan were withdrawn at the end of 2014, but when I visited the headquarters of Resolute Support, the Nato mission in Afghanistan, it was busy, with helicopters flying in and out every few minutes.   There are still 13,000 Nato military personnel in Afghanistan, mostly American. Most US military personnel have left Afghanistan - there is little appetite for more losses among the US public Brig Gen Charlie Cleveland, the spokesman for the Resolute Support mission, believes America still has a clear strategic interest in Afghanistan.  He says the US troops now have two tasks:  training and assisting the Afghan army targeting terrorist organisations Resolute Support's work with the Afghan army has, says the brigadier general, been instrumental in ensuring it has managed to hold the ground it does.  ""In the winter of 2015-16, the government of Afghanistan changed their strategy,"" Brig Gen Cleveland tells me.  ""They realised they couldn't defend everywhere, and so what they really started focusing their efforts on was the major population centres.  ""As we look at the security situation right now, the government controls - secures - really about two-thirds of the population.  ""About 10% of the population is controlled by the Taliban, and the remaining difference is really what's contested."" He says while this situation is not ideal, the Afghan army has managed to reverse what was a deteriorating situation in 2015 and establish an ""equilibrium"" in favour of the government. Nevertheless, there is much work to be done.  Some 5,000 Afghan military personnel were killed last year, losses both the Afghan government and Resolute Support agree are unsustainable in the long term. Afghan security forces have launched operations against both Taliban and IS militants And, amid the uncertainty about American policy, other powers have been flexing their muscles in Afghanistan.  Last month, Russia hosted a meeting in Moscow about the country's future, with senior officials from China and Pakistan, and it makes no secret of the fact it has been talking to the Taliban. So the big question is what will President Trump do? Two of his key cabinet picks may provide a clue.   President Trump's Defence Secretary, Gen James Mattis, is a former commander of forces here.  He has spoken in the past about the need to urge Pakistan to take further action against the Taliban and the Sunni Islamist militant Haqqani network. Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in 1988, but Russia is talking to the Taliban The new president's national security adviser, Lt Gen Michael Flynn, has also talked about the need for Pakistan to take tougher action against Taliban fighters who shelter there. And President Trump has been very consistent about his desire to take a tougher line against the so-called Islamic State group.  Pulling out of Afghanistan would make that more difficult, given the toe-hold it has established in eastern Afghanistan over the past couple of years.   So it seems unlikely that - in his effort to extricate America from foreign entanglements - President Trump will simply declare that it has no strategic interest in Afghanistan and withdraw his troops.    He and his advisers will certainly not want to be responsible for America's longest war ending in what many people would regard as a clear defeat.

risk appetite,Hepatitis A outbreak school vaccinates pupils,2024-09-15,2019-07-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-49017472,"Pupils and staff at a North Yorkshire school at the centre of a hepatitis A outbreak have been vaccinated after the virus spread to another pupil. Public Health England (PHE) said 30 cases were confirmed in Ripon, with 20 of those at Outwood Academy school and a further 10 in the wider community. In a letter, the school said it had seen ""transmission from pupil to pupil spread within the school"". PHE said hepatitis A cases were likely to rise as investigations continued. But the number of new illnesses connected to Outwood Academy ""continue to slow down"" and risk to the wider community ""remains low"", a PHE spokeswoman said. The school said it took measures ahead of the school holiday to prevent the infection from spreading ""throughout the summer"". Dr Mike Gent, deputy director of health protection at PHE Yorkshire and the Humber, said: ""Parents of pupils at Outwood Academy, and staff, have been asked to remain alert to the signs and symptoms of hepatitis A infection.  ""In particular, jaundice - a condition which causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow - could indicate infection with Hepatitis A. ""Anyone developing symptoms should contact their GP or NHS 111 for advice. People are urged not to contact GPs if they remain well."" He said the source of illness and ""any potential common links between these cases remains under investigation"". A food handler at So! Bar and Eats was among the confirmed cases and precautionary advice was given to anyone who ate at the Ripon pub between 8 and 23 June to be aware of the symptoms. But no further cases linked to the restaurant had been found, PHE said. Source: NHS England Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

risk appetite,Weight loss drug semaglutide approved for NHS use,2024-09-15,2023-03-08,By Annabel Rackham,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-64874243,"A weight loss jab that has gained popularity in the US has been approved for use by the NHS in England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded semaglutide, marketed as Wegovy, is safe, effective and affordable. Delivered via an injection into the skin, the drug makes people feel fuller and more satisfied, so they eat less. Famous personalities such as Elon Musk claim to have used it - with a ""craze"" allegedly developing in Hollywood. Based on evidence from clinical trials, NICE says semaglutide could help people reduce their weight by over 10%, if implemented alongside nutrition and lifestyle changes. It will be recommended for use by people with at least one weight-related health condition, as well as those who have a body mass index (BMI) which puts them near the top of the obese range. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres. Those who are lower on the obese BMI range - a BMI between 30 and 34.9kg/m2 - could also be offered the drug if they have a weight-related health condition. NICE lists these as someone who is pre-diabetic, has type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or obstructive sleep apnoea.  Once-weekly injections of Wegovy will have to be prescribed by a specialist, and an individual will only be able to take the drug for a maximum of two years. Semaglutide is also found in the diabetes medicine Ozempic, but, unlike Ozempic - which is intended for those with type 2 diabetes - Wegovy is recommended specifically for weight loss.  The drug works as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone called Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). This intestinal hormone is released after eating and typically makes people feel fuller, so should help reduce overall calorie intake.  An article published last year in Variety suggested the diabetes medicine Ozempic, which contains semaglutide, is being used by some professionals in the film and entertainment industry to lose weight quickly.  It has become so popular that there are currently widespread shortages in the US and concerns for those people who rely on the drug for medical reasons.  Insurance companies in the US are refusing to cover its use among people who are not diabetic and not taking it as a prescribed medicine.  Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which makes both Ozempic and Wegovy, says the products should only be used as recommended by a doctor. Like all medication, semaglutide comes with side-effects and risks - including nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea.  In addition, rapid weight loss can also lead to the skin losing collagen and elastin, causing what Vogue Magazine has dubbed the gaunt ""Ozempic face"".  Kailey Wood, 36, has been taking Ozempic for seven months, after being prescribed the drug by her doctor in New York.  She tells the BBC that she has lost just under 30kg - going from obese to healthy in the BMI range. ""I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and insulin resistance, but honestly I didn't really struggle with my weight until I hit my 30s - after I had my kids,"" she says. ""I was rapidly gaining weight. I had a personal trainer and was on every diet known to man - keto, low carbohydrate, intermittent fasting and nothing seemed to work,"". When Kailey went for tests with her doctor, she was told she had high blood pressure and high cholesterol and, due to the risks associated with PCOS, she was at risk of developing type 2 diabetes too. ""The long-term effects [of being obese] freaked me out having two daughters,"" she says. ""I just wanted to get to my best self - to show them what a healthy mum looks like; to get outside and play with them."" Kailey, who works for a tech start-up and runs her own TikTok page, says that people who want to use semaglutide need to know the drug does have side-effects. ""When you start taking this medication, your body almost goes into shock - you get headaches, nausea, tiredness,"" she explains. ""But your body starts to get used to it. You have to be mindful and listen to your body."" Kailey says those elements of the US media who promoting the drug as a ""get skinny quick product"" leave ""a bad taste"". She believes it sends the wrong message. ""What it's really doing is changing people's lives - treating the patient before they have the disease,"" she says. ""Diet and exercise"" has been the weight loss medical mantra for decades.  And on the whole it's failed - more than half the planet is projected to be overweight or obese by 2035, driving up cases of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. It's against that backdrop that semaglutide - and other drugs on the horizon - promise to do something different.  The impact on weight while taking semaglutide is undeniable, at least for the short term.  However, the drug is being offered only for two years and only in specialist services - raising issues of fairness.  Not everyone who may be eligible will be able to access it. And the evidence shows the weight goes back on when people come off the drug, with people regaining around two-thirds of their lost weight within two years.  There are also questions about the collision between these drugs (which are also available privately) with ideas of beauty and celebrity culture - particularly on those with eating disorders.  And more deeply, whether we're still ignoring the societal reasons that lead to obesity.  BBC Sounds: Inside Health on weight-loss drugs  Just over a quarter of adults in England are obese and around a third are overweight, according to official figures.  In the UK, obesity is thought to cost the NHS £6.1bn per year, government estimates show.  The drug semaglutide is currently under consultation in Scotland, with Wales expected to follow the NICE guidelines issued in England.  Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said: ""For some people losing weight is a real challenge, which is why a medicine like semaglutide is a welcome option. ""It won't be available to everyone. Our committee has made specific recommendations to ensure it remains value for money for the taxpayer."" Dr Duane Mellor, registered dietitian and senior lecturer at Aston Medical School, Aston University, said: ""It is important to remember that living with a higher body weight or obesity is not a lifestyle choice, and people wanting to improve their health should be supported to do that. ""It is also clear that semaglutide is not intended to be a lifestyle weight-loss product in the UK. It is to be used for the purpose of improving health."" Anyone who is offered semaglutide on the NHS will be supported by specialist weight management services, including support from a dietitian."
risk appetite,HMRC wins Rangers 'big tax case' ruling,2024-09-15,2017-07-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40501361,"The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in its fight with Rangers over the club's use of Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs).  More than £47m was paid to players, managers and directors between 2001 and 2010 in tax-free loans. However, HMRC argued the payments were earnings and should be taxable. The court's decision is not expected to have any material or financial impact on Rangers now as the club is owned by a different company. Rangers' use of EBTs and the subsequent appeals by HMRC became known as the ""big tax case"". Two tribunals in 2012 and 2014 had previously found in Rangers' favour, but the Court of Session found in favour of HMRC after an appeal in 2015. Liquidators BDO were then allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court in London as the ruling has implications for future cases. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed RFC's appeal and ruled in favour of HMRC. There will undoubtedly be calls for the football authorities to act following this judgement.  A Scottish Premier League investigation headed by Lord Nimmo Smith found Rangers guilty of not registering players properly and the company was fined in 2013.  Nimmo Smith's judgement was made at a time when the EBT scheme was deemed acceptable by a tax tribunal and he resisted calls for the club to be stripped of honours won during the years the scheme was in operation, saying ""Rangers FC did not gain any unfair competitive advantage from the contraventions of the SPL Rules."" It's unlikely the football authorities will have much appetite to sanction another investigation but that won't stop some calling for just that. A spokesman said the Scottish Premier Football League will ""take time to examine the ‎judgement in detail and to consider any implications."" The result is a major victory for HMRC in its attempts to recoup tax from thousands of other companies which ran EBTs and similar schemes, which were the subject of a crackdown in legislation enacted in December 2010. HMRC could now issue ""follower notices"", which would demand payment from companies who ran similar schemes.  A number of football clubs in England fall into this category. A settlement opportunity in light of the 2010 legislation ran out in July 2015 and other firms could now be liable for major sums. In a written judgment, the judges said: ""The sums paid to the trustee of the Principal Trust for a footballer constituted the footballer's earnings. The risk that the trustee might not set up a sub-trust or give a loan of the sub-trust funds to the footballer does not alter the nature of the payments made to the trustee of the Principal Trust. ""The discretionary bonuses made available to RFC's employees through the same trust mechanisms also fall within the tax charge as these were given in respect of the employee's work. ""Payment to the Principal Trust should have been subject to deduction of income tax under the PAYE regulations."" The EBT scheme was administered by the Murray Group, then majority shareholder of the Glasgow club, from 2001 to 2009.  In February 2012, Rangers, which was then run by Craig Whyte, went into administration over a separate tax debt and the tax authority rejected a creditors agreement in June of that year. The supreme court decision is in relation to Murray Group companies, including the liquidated company RFC 2012, and not the current owners at Ibrox. The result will mean the creditors of RFC 2012 will receive less money from the pot collected by liquidators BDO, as HMRC will now be owed more money. Former Rangers chairman Sir David Murray said he was ""hugely disappointed"" with the verdict, which he said ran counter to the legal advice which was consistently provided to Rangers Football Club. He said: ""It should be emphasised that there have been no allegations made by HMRC or any of the courts that the club was involved in tax evasion, which is a criminal offence. ""The decision will be greeted with dismay by the ordinary creditors of the club, many of which are small businesses, who will now receive a much lower distribution in the liquidation of the club, which occurred during the ownership of Craig Whyte, than may otherwise have been the case."" In a statement, HMRC said: ""This decision has wide-ranging implications for other avoidance cases and we encourage anyone who has tried to avoid tax on their earnings to now agree with us the tax owed. ""HMRC will always challenge contrived arrangements that try to deliver tax advantages never intended by parliament."" Rangers liquidators BDO said it believed taking the case to the Supreme Court had been the correct course of action ""given the significance of the matter"". It said: ""We will now engage with HMRC on adjudicating its claim.  ""Further advice and guidance will be provided to creditors in due course."" The Scottish FA said that, after examining the judgement, it would take no further disciplinary action. It said it had been advised it was unlikely the Scottish FA would be successful pursuing a complaint about whether disciplinary rules could have been breached. It added that, even if successful, any sanctions available to a judicial panel would be limited in their scope. Meanwhile, Celtic said they were sure that the football authorities would review their findings that Rangers gained no sporting advantage from the tax-avoidance scheme. A  league commission fined Rangers in 2013 but did not strip the club of any titles they had won during the years the scheme was in operation.  Celtic disagreed with that ruling at the time, and said the Supreme Court judgement ""re-affirms that view."""
risk appetite,Becca Cosmetics: Why Covid is bad news for make-up,2024-09-15,2021-03-01,By Annabel Rackham,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-56215557,"Are your make-up brushes laying unused in a corner? Is your favourite eye shadow palette gathering dust in a drawer? There's certainly not much appetite for going full glam at the moment - and it's having a major effect on the beauty industry.  We've already seen what the pandemic has done to fashion retail - with several shops disappearing from our high streets forever.  Now Becca Cosmetics has become the first major beauty casualty of the pandemic, with the Australian company announcing it is shutting down after 20 years. A statement on its website said: ""At Becca, an accumulation of challenges, together with the global impact of Covid-19, has sadly been more than our business can withstand, and we have had to make the heartbreaking decision to close down the Becca brand at the end of September 2021."" Founded by make-up artist Rebecca Morrice Williams in Perth, since 2001 it has been a huge name in luxury beauty with thousands of counters across the world. It's owned by huge beauty conglomerate Estee Lauder, which owns other companies including Bobbi Brown, MAC and Jo Malone. Over the years, it's collaborated with the likes of Chrissy Teigen, Khloe Kardashian and YouTuber Jaclyn Hill. ""I was so gutted for the brand and everyone that works there,"" says beauty influencer Amelia Liana. ""I really didn't think that Becca would be one of the brands affected, they have such a loyal following, they're huge on Instagram and they're in all the major retailers,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Polly Marchant, a make-up artist and beauty brand owner, says she was ""shocked and sad"". ""Not only are the small businesses having to close, but these huge global brands,"" she says. ""I just assumed where they're so big and have so many amazing brand ambassadors, they'd be fine and maybe their sales wouldn't have been as great, but nowhere near bad enough to have to close."" Amelia and Polly have over a million Instagram followers between them and have noticed a big change in what content their fans are now interested in. ""All my audience want to see me doing is my skincare routine - like Sunday pamper routines and what face masks I'm using,"" Amelia says. ""Everyone is taking time to look after themselves a bit more and skincare is quite meditative - my audience feel the same. ""Brands have been readjusting their plans - Charlotte Tilbury for example brought her skincare launches forward a couple of months and postponed her beauty launches until August because she saw how much people were interested in skincare."" ""Skincare has become the new make-up,"" Polly adds. ""People really have time to invest in their skincare regimes now and everyone is looking after their skin that little bit more - luxury make-up is just not in the priority list of things to buy anymore."" Not only are we staying in more at the moment, but when we are going out we're having to wear masks a lot of the time - which also reduces the need for make-up in everyday situations. ""You're not going to be whacking on a couple of layers of foundations and loads of skin make-up to then put a mask on - it will all come off and then there's the risk of breaking out,"" Polly says. ""I've gotten so used to wearing minimal make-up,"" Amelia adds, saying that she used to wear a full smoky eye every day, but now goes for a more natural look. ""I think that look will probably hang around for a little bit longer, especially with masks. ""Getting your make-up all over a mask and lines all over your foundation - it's very annoying!"" Lipstick has always been seen as recession proof - it's fairly cheap to buy a lipstick even from a luxury brand and has historically still sold in the hardest of circumstances. Amelia, who is a brand ambassador for Dior make-up, says the success of a new lipstick they launched in January was ""unexpected"". ""It shows there is definitely still a want and a need for make-up products,"" she says. Polly isn't so sure - and says sales of her own brand has reduced so much that she can't currently afford to release a new collection. ""Last March, I would do a swipe-up link or suggest a new product and people would go mental - they were so interested in buying new products,"" she says. ""Since then it's really slowed down and I can see it in my own sales - people don't have the funds to be splashing out on make-up."" ""But hopefully once things go back to normal I can bring out some more products, but in the meantime I genuinely don't have the money to invest,"" Polly adds.  And with coronavirus restrictions set to ease off, Amelia is hopeful people will learn to fall in love with make-up again. ""I think they'll definitely be a shift in priorities that will be taken forward into summer as we've got much more used to wearing minimal make-up. ""But, we'll hopefully have our summer and enjoy looking glam again.""  Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

risk appetite,The shadowy business empire funding Myanmar's military,2024-09-15,2021-03-09,By Joshua Cheetham,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56133766,"Myanmar's military - the leaders of its recent coup - are funded by a huge chunk of the national budget. But the armed forces also draw a vast and secretive income from sprawling business interests:  At Yangon's popular Indoor Skydiving Centre, visitors can experience the thrill of jumping out of a plane from the safety of a vertical wind tunnel.  But few people spiralling through this high-flying attraction may realise that it is part of a huge, military-run business empire - one completely woven into the fabric of national life.  Critics argue that this lucrative network has made Myanmar's coup possible and put the military's accountability into free fall.  Civilian businesses talk of an environment like ""Sicily under the Mafia"", while activists say that democratic reforms can only be possible only when ""the military [is] back to barracks"".  Myanmar's military - the Tatmadaw - began its involvement in business after the socialist coup of Ne Win in 1962.  For years, military battalions were required to be self-sufficient and encouraged to develop stakes in local enterprises to fund their operations. While this practice has been phased out, two military-run conglomerates were established in the 1990s as the government began privatising state industries. Both organisations - Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) - have since become a key source of wealth for the Tatmadaw, with stakes in everything from banking and mining to tobacco and tourism. MEHL also operates the military's pension fund.  Several military leaders and their families hold extensive business interests as well, and have been subject to sanctions in the past.  Aung Pyae Sone - the son of coup leader Gen Min Aung Hliang - owns several companies, including a beach resort, and has a majority stake in national telecoms carrier Mytel.  The full extent of these business interests is hard to quantify. But experts say that the military's business clout remains significant, despite recent democratic reforms, and the coup could partly be an attempt to protect these financial interests.  The little we do know about the military's financial reach has only come to light in recent years.  A UN report in 2019, spurred by Myanmar's crackdown on Rohingya communities, concluded that business revenues enhanced the military's ability to carry out human rights abuses with impunity. Through a network of conglomerate-owned businesses and affiliates, the UN said the Tatmadaw had been able to ""insulate itself from accountability and oversight"".  Details about MEHL's structure and finances were also revealed in two internal reports - one filed by the conglomerate in January 2020, the other leaked by activist groups Justice for Burma and Amnesty International. They showed that the conglomerate is run by the military's top brass, including several leaders of the ongoing coup. Around a third of all shareholders are military units, while the rest are owned by former and current Tatmadaw personnel.  The leaked report said that, between 1990 and 2011, MEHL paid its shareholders 108bn kyats in dividends - worth $16.6bn, according to official exchange rates at the time.  It also suggested that the military uses MEHL shares to reward loyalty and punish bad behaviour. One table lists 35 people who were stripped of their dividends for reasons like desertion and imprisonment.  The MEHL has not commented publicly on the leaked report.  In the wake of the coup, advocacy groups have issued further calls for targeted sanctions against the military and its access to the global financial system.  Many activists want to see the conglomerates dismantled as well.  In a statement to the BBC, Justice for Myanmar accused the military of being in ""an unlawful conflict of interest"".  ""The wealth stolen by the military and their businesses belongs to the people of Myanmar and must be returned to them,"" they added.  The US has added both conglomerates to a trade blacklist, and rolled out fresh sanctions against military and government figures, along with three mining companies. Canada, New Zealand and the UK have also introduced their own targeted measures, though none of them has focused on the conglomerates directly.  Campaigners argue that historically weak sanctions have emboldened the Tatmadaw to carry out the coup and to continue alleged human rights abuses.  But experts have told the BBC there is a strong appetite to ramp up sanctions - at the right time.  ""The world is still waiting to see how this plays out,"" says George McLeod, managing director of Access Asia, a risk management firm specialising in the region. ""From what I've heard from people on the inside, Norway is trying to form some kind of groundwork to bring about a negotiated solution.""  In the meantime, there is increasing resentment among some local business figures about the conglomerates' power.  ""They almost describe it in the same way that a business owner operating in Sicily would talk about the Mafia,"" Mr McLeod told the BBC. ""You have to deal with them if you cross their radar. But you don't want to.""  The Tatmadaw are already starting to feel the pressure from foreign investors.  Japanese beverage firm Kirin has ended two lucrative deals with MEHL that have helped it to dominate Myanmar's beer market. Singaporean businessman Lim Kaling has also cut his investment in a tobacco firm linked to the conglomerate.   Local protesters, meanwhile, have been boycotting companies with ties to the new government - including jewellery shops and cigarette brands.  Calls for international sanctions aren't universal, however. China and Russia have rebuffed efforts by other members of the UN Security Council to condemn the Tatmadaw.   Experts agree that while sanctions are an important piece of the puzzle, they must work in tandem with legal and diplomatic pressure, and arms embargoes.  The Tatmadaw's deputy chief, Soe Win, has told the UN that they are ready to face international pressure if necessary. Without multilateral action, Myanmar could become a pariah state once more, says Peter Kucik, a former sanctions advisor at the US Treasury.  ""This group of generals in power right now is more or less the same group that was in power under the SPDC regime (a military junta which ruled Myanmar from 1997-2011), and they've shown that they're perfectly comfortable living in an isolated country,"" he told the BBC.  But while the country could lean back on trade from partners like China, local business figures are wary of this prospect, adds Mr Kucik.  ""They want to deal with top-tier Japanese companies, they want to deal with Western companies, and they want to be a player on the international stage in the same way as Thailand,"" says Mr Kucik.  Whatever happens next, advocacy groups say that pulling on the military's purse strings, and reforming their conglomerates, will be essential to democratic reform.  ""That's what the people of Burma want,"" says Anna Roberts, director of Burma Campaign UK. ""They want the military back to barracks, and they want a civilian economy and a civilian federal government that respects their wishes."" "
risk appetite,Leaders in final push for votes ahead of election,2024-09-15,2019-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50734814,"The UK's party leaders are touring the country on a frenetic final day of campaigning, focusing on key messages ahead of Thursday's general election.  Boris Johnson has insisted only the Tories will ""get Brexit done"" and move the country forward while Jeremy Corbyn has vowed Labour will end austerity and give ""hope to the next generation"". Jo Swinson has said a strong Lib Dem showing can stop the UK leaving the EU. Nicola Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP in Scotland could stop a Tory victory. With voting set to begin at 07:00 GMT on Thursday, the parties are stressing the scale of the choice facing people and the impact it will have on the direction of the country.  The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said voters were being offered hugely divergent choices when it came to the UK's relationship with Europe, with the Conservatives promising to leave the European Union next month while Labour and others were backing a further referendum.  And the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam said both the Tories and Labour were proposing fundamental changes to how the UK's economy and trade have worked over the past 30 years.  In terms of the opinion polls, the Conservatives retain a solid lead over Labour, according to the BBC's opinion poll tracker. A poll produced by YouGov released on Tuesday evening suggests the Conservatives are on course for a small majority of around 28 - but the pollster points out that the margin of error means neither another hung Parliament nor a larger Tory majority can be ruled out. Labour is hoping for a late swing in its favour, as happened in the 2017 general election, while the Tories are warning about the possibility of a hung Parliament, amid concerns about voter complacency. Both Conservative and Labour party leaders will be hoping to put a rocky few days behind them, as they embark on the traditional election-eve tour of target seats. Mr Johnson began Wednesday by doing a milk round in West Yorkshire, saying the election campaign ""could not be tighter"" and that there is a ""real risk again of a hung Parliament"". He said: ""The critical risk is very real. We cannot have more drift, more dither, more delay, more paralysis for this country."" He is using events throughout the day, including a visit to a bakery in Derbyshire, to stress key Tory pledges on investing in the NHS, raising the number of police officers and bringing in a new immigration system.  But his main message will be on Brexit, saying ""unless we get out of this quicksand... our future as a country remains uncertain"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today that only a clear Conservative victory would lift the UK out of the ""rut"" it had fallen into over Brexit and enable the country to ""move on"" to dealing with other challenges, like social care and the environment. Mr Corbyn started the day in Scotland, telling a rally in Glasgow that a Labour government would ""eliminate child poverty, give hope to the next generation and invest properly in education all across the UK"".  At a rally in Middlesbrough, he repeated pledges on funding for the NHS, expanding free childcare and lowering transport fares, and also addressed Brexit, saying Labour would get it sorted by securing a ""good deal for working people"" and giving the public the ""final say"".  He told activists: ""Remember it is our choice, our chance tomorrow, to elect a government that will be for the many, not the few. A government you can trust. ""And it will not be motivated solely by more billionaires... it will be motivated by improving the life chances of every single child all across this country, and bringing justice."" Party chairman Ian Lavery said Mr Corbyn had a ""real live chance"" of being prime minister by Friday, telling the BBC's Politics Live that while Brexit was a tough issue in many seats, what voters were really concerned about was the future of the NHS, schools and the cost of living.  However, a group of 15 former Labour MPs, including several who quit the party over the past year, have urged voters to back other parties, saying Mr Corbyn is unfit to be prime minister due to his record on anti-Semitism and national security.  Responding, Mr Corbyn said: ""People who have left the Labour Party and decided to join up with the party that has imposed austerity, poverty and injustice on the poorest people in this country should look themselves in the mirror and decide what they are doing."" Meanwhile, Ms Swinson said the last few hours were ""absolutely critical"" with thousands of voters yet to make up their minds. On a visit to Esher in Surrey, where the Lib Dems hope to oust Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, she said tactical voting could determine the outcome of Tory-Lib Dem marginal seats and Labour voters in such areas could hold the result ""in their hands"".  She also visited a volunteer hub in London to thank activists, adding: ""Our country can be better than what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are trying to say is the only way forward.""  Back on the road again today for the leaders' last push. There feels like there's been a real mismatch between the nature and conduct of the campaign and the scale of the choice. It's a huge moment for the country, but we've heard so many times voters saying they don't like ""either of them"". People's thinking is really dominated by the two big characters in the campaign and no-one is making it to No 10 on a surge of anything like enthusiasm. People seem fed up of politicians telling them how divided they are - most people have been quite rightly getting on with their lives while Westminster has torn itself apart. The frustration Tories hoped to capitalise on is real, but there are doubts all over the place about whether Boris Johnson is the answer to that. However, beyond his strong core support there seems to be less appetite for Jeremy Corbyn to take it on. There is a massive generational split though. Smaller parties haven't punched through as some predicted, although they will still have a huge impact, and there are a vast number of local factors at play, of course, too. Anyway, enough musing for now. Suffice to say this is an incredibly tight contest in lots of places. In 48 hours we might be waiting in a freezing Downing Street for Mr Johnson to return with a majority, or about to enter a frenzy of hung Parliament talks which could propel Mr Corbyn into power. The SNP is taking a similar tack in its appeal to Labour voters in Scotland, calling on them to back the party to ""lock Boris Johnson out of No 10"".  Describing the PM's Get Brexit Done slogan as the ""biggest con"" of the election, Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was a vote to stop further cuts to public services and to ""stop Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will"".  Green Party co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley urged voters to make it a moment of political reckoning on the climate, saying their party would make sure proper action was taken to meet carbon emission targets. Speaking in Doncaster, Nigel Farage said the Brexit Party was challenging Labour in many of its Yorkshire heartlands, and he appealed to Leave supporters to back his candidates in areas where the Conservatives could not win.  Plaid Cymru's leader, Adam Price, told the BBC that Wales was the ""forgotten nation"" in the UK and had been ""neglected"" for decades by successive Conservative and Labour governments. He said his party would press whoever formed the next UK government for more resources to tackle child poverty, while also making the case to remain in the EU and ultimately for Wales to govern itself.

risk appetite,Gloria Estefan’s show ‘not a jukebox musical’,2024-09-15,2019-07-04,By Steven McIntosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48784893,"Appropriately, Gloria Estefan spends very little time sitting down at the West End premiere of On Your Feet. The opening night of the musical based on her life sees the singer mingling with the crowd in the stalls, signing autographs and dancing with children in the audience. Later in the night, as the show reaches its climax, she takes to the stage at London's Coliseum for a duet with Christie Prades, the actress who is portraying her. On Your Feet has already been successful on Broadway, where it opened in 2015, and Estefan confirms a big-screen adaptation is already in the works. It will follow recent music-based biopics like Bohemain Rhapsody and Rocketman (about Queen and Elton John respectively).  ""I think that right now music is in a moment where it's really difficult to build a career of that length, to be able to have decades in the business, so Broadway and the West End and everyone else is focusing on the careers of big acts,"" Estefan says backstage. ""Queen had a show here in the West End, We Will Rock You, before anything ever happened [in film], so it makes for a great story because it's things that have actually happened, they're actual people. And I think it's expanded into film because people are interested in seeing how these careers happened."" Despite its unpopularity with critics, Bohemian Rhapsody won four Oscars earlier this year, including best actor for its star Rami Malek. When it came to scripting On Your Feet, Estefan enlisted another Oscar winner - Birdman writer Alexander Dinelaris (although he began work on the musical before his recognition from the Academy). ""The trick is getting it right, because to me this isn't a jukebox musical,"" Estefan says. ""Alex Dinelaris, our book writer, did a fantastic job of telling our story, so for us it's just an expanded way to do what we did through music but also now through dancing and a theatrical production."" But bringing On Your Feet to London isn't without risk. Estefan may have sold more than 120 million records worldwide across her 40-year career, but in the UK she doesn't have quite as many huge hits to her name as Queen, Abba or Michael Jackson - all of whom have had musicals staged in the West End.  ""Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine may be massive stars in much of the Spanish-speaking world and in the US, but their UK appeal is rather more niche,"" wrote John Lewis in The Guardian. But, he added: ""Fortunately, the show is carried by a superb performance from the Miami-born Cuban-American Christie Prades as Gloria... For all the show's flaws, the rhythm really does get you."" It's certainly fair to say Estefan has had a long and distinguished career. Her family escaped from Cuba to Miami after the revolution. Her father joined the US military and fought in the Vietnam War, but was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis - all of which is reflected in the stage retelling of Estefan's life. In 1975, Gloria met Emilio Estefan, and she began singing with his band, Miami Sound Machine. Her vocals helped propel the group to global success, and she became a star in her own right. But her tour bus was involved in a crash which almost killed her in 1990, severely injuring her spine and requiring her to take a year out for intensive physical therapy. She made a full recovery and continued to have chart success, and in 2014, she was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama. Much of this makes it into On Your Feet, although Sarah Carson of the i paper. said that having such a rich story to tell poses challenges. ""There is almost so much to pack in that the storytelling has no choice but to rush,"" she wrote.  The show received just two stars from Dominic Maxwell in The Times. ""Rhythm Is Gonna Get You? Not everyone, it's not. The megamix finale got the crowd on its feet, but I remained in my seat,"" he said. ""While On Your Feet is not without its pleasures for fans of Estefan's music, it's more like an all-singing, all-dancing Wikipedia entry than something to stir the Este-neutral."" The production's debut in London is the start of its UK tour, which continues into April 2020. As a result, Estefan says a couple of minor tweaks were made to the script to ensure British audiences could understand it. ""Q-tips changed to cotton buds, because a British audience wouldn't know what Q-tips are,"" she explains. ""And the Ford Cortina was a station wagon before, they wouldn't know what this was, so it was just things so they would get the joke. I just wanted to make sure they understood what they were trying to say."" The last few years have seen Latin American-inspired music go through something of a chart revival. Some of the biggest hits of the last couple of years have had a distinctly Latin flavour, such as Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's Despacito, J Balvin's Mi Gente and Havana by Camila Cabello. Added to the artists like Jennifer Lopez and Shakira who have had sustained success in recent years, singing in both Spanish and English, it's clear audience appetite for the genre is high.  Asked what's behind the continued appeal, Estefan says: ""It's rich, it's rhythmic, it's fun.  ""When I wrote Rhythm Is Gonna Get You, the idea came from the fact that our first communication - I studied psychology and communications in college, by the way - the first communication in the world was drums, this is how we talked across distance, so to me, percussion and rhythm has always been what unified our audiences worldwide.  ""It didn't matter where you were from, they understood it, so I think that is always going to reach people. You don't have to understand it, you feel it."" On Your Feet is currently playing at London's Coliseum for 12 weeks before touring the UK until April 2020."
risk appetite,'Thrill of investing' leads young to take risks,2024-09-15,2021-03-23,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56496206,"Young people are investing in high-risk products for the ""challenge, competition and novelty"" it involves, the City regulator has said. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned they were getting involved in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, but could be taking on big risks. It said they were often more likely to be women, aged under 40 and from a diverse ethnic background. They were attracted by the ""thrill"", rather than saving for the future. The FCA commissioned research looking into ""self-directed"" investors - those who trade themselves rather than seeking financial advice. The study found many investors were willing to ""have a go"", had been tempted by using investment apps, and went with options because they had been ""hyped"" and assumed big name brands were ""safe"". The FCA has launched a campaign to prevent investment harm, using online advertising, advising people to ask: Sheldon Mills, executive director, consumer and competition at the FCA, said: ""Much of the consumer investments market meets consumers' needs. ""But we are worried that some investors are being tempted, often through online adverts or high-pressure sales tactics, into buying higher-risk products that are very unlikely to be suitable for them. ""This research has helped us better understand what drives and motivates consumers so we can tell them about the risks involved in these investments through our investment harm campaign. ""We want to make sure that we encourage the ability to save and invest for lifetime events, particularly for younger generations, but it is imperative that consumers do so with savings and investment products that have a suitable level of risk for their needs. ""Investors need to be mindful of their overall risk appetite, diversifying their investments and only investing money they can afford to lose in high risk products."" Becky O'Connor, from investment platform Interactive Investor, said: ""We want young people to invest - in their pensions and for their families' futures. But we want them to think long and hard about it, do their research and take the time and effort to understand things like risk from different types of asset classes. ""Most young people don't have money to burn - so potentially throwing it away on high risk investments is a big waste when there are so many life challenges down the road for them that they might need that cash for."""
risk appetite,Euro press sees populist advance 'halted',2024-09-15,2019-05-27,By BBC Monitoring,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48423991,"The press and news sites across Europe agree that populist groups made gains in the EU parliamentary elections, but failed to overwhelm mainstream parties of the centre-right and centre-left. They largely attribute this to higher voter turnout, especially among young people, and awareness of climate issues, rather than enthusiasm for the European Union's institutions. The vote in Britain could not compete for attention with the results in each given country, but a few papers did consider its impact. For Italy's centre-left La Stampa, Nigel Farage is the ""big winner"" in what its correspondent Francesco Guerrera dubs the ""milkshake election"".  The main impact, in his view, is that the result has ""completely shaken up British politics"". Germany's Handelsblatt business daily was unusual in thinking Brexit was significant in stalling the populist wave elsewhere in Europe. ""Brexit... led citizens to understand the importance of the EU and the dangers of leaving it. Europe's political and economic elites were much more consistent in and committed to promoting the EU ahead of the elections than in the past. For the first time, the pro-European forces have mobilised en masse against nationalism - and it has paid off,"" the paper says. ""A populist front from Paris to Warsaw, but its advance has been halted,"" says La Stampa, voicing the consensus media view. Germany's centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, in common with many other papers, sees climate concerns as having boosted the Greens in all countries. The Greens are ""singing victory songs after their success... both the spectre of a shift to the right and the major climate issue ensured a significant leap in turnout,"" it says. The Czech centre-right daily Lidove Noviny thinks the ""migration crisis most likely boosted turnout"" in central Europe, but not enough to benefit the populists, noting that centre-right parties still beat the Czech right-wing ANO movement. Belgium's liberal daily Le Soir is more cautious, saying the gains are ""far from trivial for the European populist radical right"", which will ""move in the next few days to form alliances"".  Some papers warn that the populist tide was halted not by enthusiasm for the European Union, but rather by voters demanding change. In Italy's centre-left La Repubblica, columnist Andrea Bonanni says European citizens ""sent a clear request for a fresh start... when they pushed back the dark shadows that appeared on the continent"".  He says the result is thanks mainly to young people - ""if today Europe is saved, the credit first and foremost goes to them"".  Romania's centre-right Adevarul agrees that ""young people have found their electoral appetite, understand that their vote is important, and the significant increase in the vote... is due mainly to them.  But the conservative Polish daily Rzeczpospolita sees challenges for the EU in the higher voter turnout, as it was motivated ""not by large integration projects, like the euro, the EU expansion to the east and the development of the Schengen area"", as before, but by the ""voice of protest against the current principles the Union is following"". Spain's conservative La Razon sees this as reason for the mainstream parties of centre-right and centre-left to reach out to liberal parties and the Greens, in order to ""restrain the Europhobic boom"". Hungary's Magyar Hirlap daily, which supports the country's populist government, says the increase in the populist vote could frustrate the hopes of the leading candidates to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the EU Commission. ""The Commission leadership process appears to have broken down because the traditional party blocs have haemorrhaged support, meaning Manfred Weber, the top candidate of the centre-right European People's Party, and Frans Timmermans of the Socialists, can wave goodbye to their ambitions,"" it says.  Italy's centre-right Il Foglio sees the main centre-right and centre-left blocs uniting around the Danish Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to succeed Mr Juncker. ""She starts in pole position... after the voters decided to mobilise en masse and back the most pro-European parties, and the feared populist wave never materialised,"" it says. Germany's centre-left Sueddeutsche Zeitung sees this as a promising boost for democratic debate.  ""Finding a majority in the European Parliament will be more difficult, but also more exciting - there will be more arguments in Strasbourg and Brussels,"" it says. At the national level, the French press thinks President Emmanuel Macron could gather some comfort from an election that saw his La Republique en Marche! party beaten by Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally. The main centre-right daily Le Figaro see a ""symbolic victory"" that ""wipes out Marine Le Pen's humiliating defeat by Emmanuel Macron two years ago"" in the presidential election.  Nonetheless, La Republique en Marche!'s result is ""proof of the strength and political coherence of the president's electoral base"" only two years after it was formed, the paper says.   ""Even coming in second, even beaten, it is not an accident of history, but still one of the two parties that set the national agenda,"" the left-wing Liberation daily agrees. In Germany, Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the poor showing of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and the slide in support for her Social Democrat coalition partners are ""in line with the European trend"", attributing this to their ""losing touch with many younger voters"". The right-wing tabloid Bild sees the Social Democrats' ""debacle making Merkel's grand coalition stumble"", and wonders ""how much longer the government can hold on"".

risk appetite,Blood scandal victims want more money,2024-09-15,2018-04-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-43898899,"Welsh victims of the infected blood scandal should get the same support payments as those in Scotland, the charity Haemophilia Wales has said. Chairwoman Lynne Kelly wants Welsh ministers to raise the annual payments for 60 people who contracted hepatitis C and HIV by thousands of pounds. The support payments in Scotland are as high as £37,000 a year in some cases. The Welsh Government said it would continue to work closely with Haemophilia Wales on the matter. At least 2,400 people died in the UK after they were given blood products from overseas infected with hepatitis C and HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. Much of the blood came from donors such as prison inmates in the United States, who had sold their blood. About 70 of those who died were Welsh. Jennifer Hutchinson contracted Hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood and plasma following an operation in the late 1970s. For more than 20 years she was unaware she had the virus until falling ill while on holiday in 2005 with her husband Norman. Since then, her husband has been her full time carer.  Mr Hutchinson said: ""The toll on Jennifer has been horrendous. And the plans that we had for our retirement have had to fall by the wayside.  ""Jennifer depends on me not just practically but also financially - and she wouldn't be able to live without me.  ""We have been lucky in the sense that we are retired - there are people out there who cannot get a mortgage or even holiday insurance. ""People who are seriously ill through no fault of their own are having to scrape by on what essentially is sick pay. Being seriously ill is hard enough - without having financial worries on top of that. ""These are not scroungers, they are victims of a scandal."" Haemophilia Wales calculates the total annual cost would be under £1m for the Welsh Government to match the Scottish Governments' payments in 2018-19. Lynne Kelly said the situation in Wales needed to change. ""In Wales we feel that we are now at a disadvantage for the people who are living with both HIV and hepatitis C,"" she said. ""For co-infected hepatitis C people we are asking for their payments to go up, if they are at stage 2 which means that they have already got cirrhosis of the liver, their payment needs to go up from £17,500 a year to £27,000 in line with Scotland."" Haemophilia Wales is also asking Welsh ministers to increase payments to people with HIV and hepatitis C from £21,500 or £34,500, depending on their condition, to £37,000 as is paid in Scotland. Those calls have also been echoed by victims of contaminated blood and their families. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We are aware of arrangements in other countries and will continue to work closely with Haemophilia Wales and others to develop our support for those affected in Wales.""

risk appetite,What might happen next in the South China Sea?,2024-09-15,2020-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53344449,"Despite all the other issues demanding China's attention this year - the virus, its trade war with the US, Hong Kong's national security law, and a host of economic woes - the South China Sea has been revived in recent months as an arena for serious tensions. With US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo now - for the first time - calling China's territorial claims in the South China Sea unlawful, Alexander Neill examines China's plans to extend its reach in the region. The South China Sea, home to vital shipping lanes, has been a flashpoint for years, with several countries claiming ownership of its small islands and reefs and with it, access to resources. In recent years, China has been increasingly assertive over what it claims are its centuries-old claims to the contested region, and has been rapidly building up its military presence to back up those claims.  Former Commander of US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris once referred to this as the ""Great Wall of Sand"" - a ""nine-dash line"" creating a protective ring and supply network around Chinese territory at sea, as the wall did on land. But while China and the US have traded increasingly barbed comments over the South China Sea, broadly speaking, they had managed such differences. Despite their trade conflict, the US had avoided taking sides in China's territorial disputes with other countries - other than to demand freedom of movement for its vessels.  Then, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Criticism of China's early handling of the outbreak, led by the US, has enraged China.  Many Western leaders appear to be persuaded by Mr Pompeo's argument that China was exploiting the pandemic to double-down on its coercive behaviour in general. And those rising tensions have been playing out in the South China Sea. In early April, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel close to the Paracel Islands, which China and Vietnam claim as theirs.  Then, a Malaysian oil exploration project also found its operations disrupted off the coast of Borneo by a Chinese marine survey vessel, the Haiyang Dizhi 8, backed by China's Navy and Coast Guard.  Consequently, the USS America, a US Navy amphibious assault ship, joined by an Australian frigate, was deployed to waters nearby. The escalation continued with the deployment of two US Navy guided missile destroyers, USS Bunker Hill and USS Barry to the Paracel and Spratly Islands (known as the Xisha and Nansha in Chinese) respectively.  The warships conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) aimed at challenging what the US views as a pattern of China's unlawful claims in international waters. Most recently, China closed off a swathe of sea space to conduct naval exercises in the waters surrounding the Paracel Islands. The US angrily said this violated Chinese commitments to avoid activities exacerbating disputes.  Meanwhile, the US Navy deployed not one but two aircraft carrier strike groups - the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan - for joint operations in the region.  In addition to the US Navy fighters conducting carrier operations and the P8-Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft criss-crossing the sea, the US Air Force sent a B-52 strategic bomber for good measure. China's state media reacted with predictable vitriol.  The US Navy's surge into the South China Sea increases the risk of an incident between the two rival powers and a rapid escalation in hostility. The situation is particularly dangerous in light of a recent pattern of increasing assertiveness by China over its ""core concerns"". Its recent use of lethal force on its disputed border with India, and the imposition of the National Security Law on Hong Kong, have prompted many to ask how restrained China is likely to be in its response to these challenges. Beijing views the South China Sea as a crucial part of its maritime territory, not only serving as a bastion for its seaborne nuclear deterrent based on Hainan island but also as a gateway for the Maritime Silk Road, part of China's Belt and Road Initiative.  The South China Sea is critical, for example, for the future success of China's Greater Bay Area economic development plan, into which Hong Kong is incorporated.     China's plan for populating the South China Sea was launched in 2012 when ""Sansha City"", the administrative centre for all Chinese-claimed features in the South China Sea on Woody Island in the Paracels, was upgraded from county to prefecture-level status. The government re-settled the small fishing community there into modern dwellings, built a primary school, a bank and a hospital and installed mobile communications. Tourists have been visiting on regularly scheduled cruises to the islands. The second phase of the plan was initiated in April this year, when China created two further county level administrative districts subordinate to Sansha City, including the establishment of Nansha District People's government, headquartered on Fiery Cross Reef and administering all the Chinese claimed features of the Spratly Islands.  In the six years since China began reclamation of several reefs and atolls in the Spratlys, satellite and air surveillance has revealed one of the world's greatest feats in maritime engineering and military construction.   In addition to the military facilities on the islands - including 3,000m runways, naval berths, hangars, reinforced ammunition bunkers, missile silos and radar sites - images show neatly arranged accommodation blocks, administrative buildings roofed with blue ceramic tiles, hospitals, and even sports complexes on the reclaimed islands, which have become visibly greener. Subi reef is now home to a farm - including a six-acre fruit and vegetable plot pollinated by bees imported from the mainland, a herd of pigs, flocks of poultry and fish ponds.  Meanwhile, the China Academy of Sciences established an Oceanographic Research Centre on Mischief Reef in January 2019. China's top hydrologists have announced that the water table on Fiery Cross - once little more than a rock in the sea - has been expanding rapidly and will allow water self-sufficiency within 15 years (link in Chinese). The residents of the island already enjoy 5G mobile data access and availability of fresh fruit and vegetables shipped in refrigerated containers. Imagery also shows large fishing fleets moored in the larger lagoons on Subi and Mischief reef.  Perhaps before too long, fishing families could be permanently housed on China's southernmost islands, their children schooled alongside those of party and government officials. The most symbolic evidence of China's push into the South China Sea is quite literally set in stone - transplanted from mainland China.  In April 2018, 200-tonne commemorative megaliths, erected on each of the three biggest island bases in the Spratly Islands were unveiled amid some secrecy. Quarried from Taishan stone and shipped to the Spratly islands, the monuments resonate with President Xi Jinping's China Dream of national rejuvenation.  Mount Taishan is viewed as the most sacred of China's mountains, a symbol of unbroken Chinese civilisation for thousands of years. All of this shows China has moved into a second phase of a calculated plan to make this great strategic waterway of South East Asia an irreversibly Chinese one. The recent US Navy exercises in the South China Sea were aimed at demonstrating US resolve to protect the ""freedom of the seas"": for the US Navy to operate in and ultimately protect the seaspace across these international waters. Alongside the US Naval manoeuvres, Mr Pompeo's announcement formally stating that China's claims across the region are ""completely unlawful"" begs the question of what the US is prepared to do next.  At a minimum, Mr Pompeo wants to build a diplomatic coalition to demonstrate China's self-isolation, not just with some of the other claimants but also along with bigger powers. The US could very rapidly reduce China's new Nansha district to concrete and coral rubble - but this would entail a war for which neither the US nor China has an appetite.

risk appetite,Joy sticks: The 'golden age' of gaming magazines,2024-09-15,2019-09-04,By Simon Armstrong,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-47896612,"Retro gaming is enjoying a surge in popularity with Nintendo, Sega and Sony all releasing mini versions of classic 1990s machines. The decade also spawned a boom for console magazines desperate to win the publishing war for pocket-money pounds. Sonic, Street Fighter II and Super Mario World. Between them, they would define a generation of gaming. As standard-bearers for Sega and Nintendo's competing machines, the titles provided thrilling leaps into colourful new worlds and cemented home gaming as a multimillion-pound industry. With the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo becoming must-haves for children up and down the land, it is an era still fondly recalled by many. Indeed, Sega will be the latest firm to cash in on nostalgia for the period with the imminent release of the Mega Drive Mini following compact versions of Nintendo's NES and SNES, and Sony's PlayStation. Vying for players' attention first time around would be a proliferation of equally enchanting magazines - all keen to satisfy the voracious appetite for news and reviews and, crucially, secure a lucrative foothold in the quickly expanding market.  For the small teams of journalists working late into the night to meet punishing publishing deadlines, it would be a ""golden age"" as wondrous as a high-speed spin though Sonic's Green Hill Zone or dodging dinosaurs in Mario's Donut Plains. ""We absolutely loved video games,"" recalls Julian ""Jaz"" Rignall, editor of Mean Machines - an irreverent magazine from London-based Emap that stole a march on the opposition and quickly became a big seller. ""The technology was facilitating new and exciting games, and every month we seemed to have something incredible turn up. I remember when the Super Nintendo was delivered for the first time, taking it out of the box and playing Super Mario World. The whole office would stop, we'd go into the games room and crowd round the screen. There was a high level of excitement and that came across in the magazine."" Beginning life as a section within Computer & Video Games (CVG) in 1987, it had focused on emerging platforms such as the PC Engine, Game Boy and Atari Lynx. The first magazine under the Mean Machines banner would hit the shelves dated October 1990 and coincide with the UK release of the Mega Drive - two years after its Japanese debut. ""The office was a mess,"" laughs Rignall. ""There were games and bits of hardware and old computers everywhere. We would occasionally have tidy-ups, although for the most part it was an absolute dump.  ""But, you know, it was the perfect environment for us and that allowed us to produce a really great magazine."" With an initial print run in the region of 30,000 copies, monthly sales would soon go on to top 150,000. So what made Mean Machines such a huge success? Humour and personality were undoubtedly key ingredients. While striking features acclaimed the merits of Street Fighter II, readers were mercilessly mocked by Rignall's ""Mean Yob"" letters page persona and Insult Corner saw near-the-knuckle put-downs hurled around with glee. ""It was very much part of the remit not to talk down to the readers,"" he says. ""We really wanted to be inclusive. It had a very juvenile and anarchic humour - double entendres, being rude but not quite being rude. We wouldn't swear, but we would allude to swearing. The personalities of the staff really came through, and the tone and style was very different to most other magazines out there. ""Most important of all, we were very, very enthusiastic about video games."" As the likes of Streets of Rage, Super Mario Kart and Star Fox drove sales of Sega and Nintendo's machines in a battle that came to be dubbed ""the console war"", advances in desktop publishing meant magazines could be put together more quickly and cheaply than ever before. Circulation revenues were boosted by booming advertising profits as games companies, big-name retailers and small independent shops snapped up space. It was low risk, high reward for Emap and rivals such as Bath-based Future. GamesMaster, Mega, Total! and Edge would all be launched between 1991 and 1993, while Rignall's title would split to become Mean Machines Sega and Nintendo Magazine System to capitalise on winning the official Nintendo console publication licence. Easily the most eye-catching, though, would be Future's Super Play. Its intricate Japanese-style art and focus on anime (the term for Japanese animation) immediately set it apart when its debut issue launched with a cover date of November 1992. Columns explored the idiosyncrasies of Far East cartoons and comics, while dazzling images adorned each cover courtesy of illustrator Wil Overton. ""The technology was just good enough where a small team of four or five people could make quite a nice magazine and there was an audience of many, many tens of thousands that would lap it up,"" says its first editor, Matt Bielby. ""There were all these competing games platforms and any market where there's competition tends to be quite vibrant because people choose one side or the other. ""It's like Blur v Oasis, or whatever it might be. If there's a little fight going on - even if it's not serious - it makes things more exciting."" Having also been offered the editor's chair at Sega-focused Mega, he chose Super Play as a means of indulging his ""obsession"" with Japan. ""The whole look and feel was massively important. I went to Japan at one point and picked up lots of magazines, and we went to places like the Japan Centre in London and would buy imported magazines on any subject - cars, fashion, anything. Because the team were big fans of the subject matter, elements of our lives blended into each other.  ""We didn't have a life outside of Super Play very much, but that was fine. We quite liked it like that. Two of them married each other so that kind of worked."" By late 1993, it would be selling 50,000 copies a month. But how conscious were the writers of the influence they wielded? ""You were very aware these games were not cheap,"" Bielby admits. ""Often it would be 50 quid or something of that order, which was a hell of a lot when you consider how much a pint of milk or beer was back then. If anyone bought a game they were investing quite a lot of money into it and they deserved something that would last them and they'd really enjoy. ""In retrospect, it was clearly a very special period of time where you had lots of very young, inexperienced people let loose with magazines that got big audiences. We were in a little golden age through the 90s."" As the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation usurped their predecessors, another wave of titles inevitably hit the shelves. Steve Jarratt, launch editor of Future's Edge, Total! and Official UK PlayStation Magazine, describes it as a ""licence to print money"" for the publishing companies.  ""We felt invincible. I rode the glory days. We'd make about £1 profit on a £2.99 magazine, printing 13 times a year. The PlayStation magazine's sales peaked at about 350,000 and that's at five or six pounds for each copy with a demo disc on the cover. It was generating a huge amount of wealth. Future made an enormous amount of money."" Change would come though. In a painful irony mirroring the finite lifespan of the machines they covered, games magazines would be rendered outdated by technology's relentless march. As the new millennium rolled around, it was ""game over"" for print. Free to read and unconstrained by monthly deadlines, websites allowed the instant publication of information while games could be viewed more easily than via the VHS cassettes magazines had offered as promotional gifts. Circulations plummeted. ""On a bad month [in the 1990s] we might lose 20,000 sales. Now most people would think 20,000 sales [in total] would be brilliant,"" Jarratt says. ""We knew the internet was coming, but didn't appreciate the full impact. I don't think anyone did. ""At first it was slow to load and visuals were clunky so it didn't feel like much of a threat. Then came a dawning all the stuff we were doing could appear online and over time we started to see people covering video games."" No longer as profitable, publishers closed title after title. While a small number remain today, circulation figures are dwarfed by those that went before. ""Instead of investing in the product, at Future it always felt like lots of cost-cutting to keep the [profit] margins up,"" says Jarratt, who left the company in 2011 and now works on a freelance basis contributing to the likes of Bitmap Books' series on retro gaming. ""You end up under so much pressure. No matter what you do sales go down, revenue falls off. You put your fingers in the holes in the boat to keep the water out. The internet is a double-edged sword. It's amazing for communication, but at the same time it's absolutely slaughtered certain markets. The High Street is dying, newspapers and magazines are struggling."" So has anything been lost with the disappearance of the printed page or are gamers simply better off? ""There was something about the physicality of magazines,"" says Rignall, who has worked in the games industry in the United States since 1994. ""But ultimately things have evolved. ""These days you can read about whatever you want and you're not limited by having to wait for a magazine to turn up. I think it's cool."" Photography by Caroline Briggs"
risk appetite,Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil?,2024-09-15,2021-04-14,By Nathalia Passarinho and Luis Barrucho,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56696907,"More than a year into the pandemic, deaths in Brazil are now at their peak. But despite the overwhelming evidence that Covid-19 rarely kills young children, in Brazil 1,300 babies have died from the virus. One doctor refused to test Jessika Ricarte's one-year-old son for Covid, saying his symptoms did not fit the profile of the virus. Two months later he died of complications from the disease. After two years of trying, and failed fertility treatments, teacher Jessika Ricarte had all but given up on having a family. Then she fell pregnant with Lucas. ""His name comes from luminous. And he was a light in our life. He showed that happiness was much more than we imagined,"" she says.  She first suspected something was wrong when Lucas, always a good eater, lost his appetite.  At first Jessika wondered if he was teething. Lucas's godmother, a nurse, suggested that he might just have a sore throat. But after he developed a fever, then fatigue and slightly laboured breathing, Jessika took him to hospital, and asked for him to be tested for Covid. ""The doctor put on the oximeter. Lucas's levels were 86%. Now I know that is not normal,"" says Jessika.   But he was not feverish, so the doctor said: ""My dear, don't worry. There's no need for a Covid test. It's probably just a minor sore throat."" He told Jessika that Covid-19 was rare in children, gave her some antibiotics and sent her home. Despite her misgivings, there was no option to have Lucas tested privately at the time.  Jessika says that some of his symptoms dissipated at the end of his 10-day antibiotics course, but the tiredness remained - as did her concerns about coronavirus.  ""I sent several videos to his godmother, my parents, my mother-in-law, and everyone said that I was exaggerating, that I should stop watching the news, that it was making me paranoid. But I knew that my son was not himself, that he was not breathing normally."" This was May 2020, and the coronavirus epidemic was growing. Two people had already died in her town, Tamboril in Ceará, north-east Brazil. ""Everyone knows each other here. The town was in shock.""  Jessika's husband Israel was worried that another hospital visit would increase the risk that she and Lucas would become infected with the virus.  But the weeks went by, and Lucas became sleepier and sleepier. Finally on 3 June, Lucas vomited over and over again after eating lunch, and Jessika knew she had to act.   They returned to their local hospital, where the doctor tested Lucas for Covid, to rule it out.  Lucas's godmother, who worked there, broke the news to the couple that his test result was positive.  ""At the time, the hospital did not even have a resuscitator,"" says Jessika.  Lucas was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit in Sobral, over two hours away, where he was diagnosed with a condition called multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS).  This is an extreme immune response to the virus, which can cause inflammation of vital organs.  Experts say the syndrome, which affects children up to six weeks after they are infected with coronavirus, is rare, but leading epidemiologist Dr Fatima Marinho from the University of São Paolo, says that, during the pandemic, she is seeing more cases of MIS than ever before. Although it doesn't account for all deaths.  When Lucas was intubated, Jessika wasn't allowed to stay in the same room. She rang her sister-in-law to try and distract herself.  ""We could still hear the sound of the machine, the beep, until the machine stopped and there was that constant beep. And we know that happens when the person dies. After a few minutes, the machine started working again and I started to cry."" The doctor told her Lucas had suffered a cardiac arrest but they had managed to revive him. Dr Manuela Monte, the paediatric doctor who treated Lucas for over a month in the ICU in Sobral, said she was surprised that Lucas's condition was so serious, because he did not have any risk factors.  Most children affected by Covid have comorbidities - existing conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - or are overweight, according to Lohanna Tavares, a paediatric infectologist at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital in Fortaleza, the state capital.  But that wasn't the case with Lucas.  During the 33 days Lucas was in the ICU, Jessika was only allowed to see him three times. Lucas needed immunoglobulin  - a very expensive medication - to deflate his heart, but luckily an adult patient who had bought his own had donated one leftover ampoule to the hospital. Lucas was so ill that he went on to receive a second dose of immunoglobulin. He developed a rash on his body and was running a persistent fever. He needed support to breathe.  Then Lucas began to improve and the doctors decided to take out his oxygen tube. They video-called Jessika and Israel so that he wouldn't feel alone as he regained consciousness.  ""When he heard our voices he started to cry,"" says Jessika.   It was the last time they were to see their boy react. During the next video call ""he had a paralysed look"". The hospital requested a CT scan and discovered Lucas had had a stroke. Still, the couple were told Lucas would make a good recovery with the right care and would soon be moved out of ICU and into a general ward. When Jessika and Israel went to visit him, the doctor was just as hopeful as they were, she says.  ""That night, I put my cell phone on silent. I dreamed Lucas came up to me and kissed my nose. And the dream was a great feeling of love, gratitude and I woke up very happy. Then I saw my cell phone and saw the 10 calls that the doctor had made.""  The doctor told Jessika that Lucas's heart rate and oxygen levels had dropped suddenly, and he had died early that morning.  She feels sure that if Lucas had been given a Covid test when she had requested it back in early May he would have survived.   ""It is important that doctors, even if they believe it is not Covid, do the test to eliminate the possibility,"" she says.  ""A baby does not say what he is feeling, so we depend on tests."" Jessika believes that the delay in proper treatment made his condition more serious. ""Lucas had several inflammations, 70% of the lung was compromised, the heart increased by 40%. It was a situation that could have been avoided."" Dr Monte, who treated Lucas, agrees. She says that although MIS cannot be prevented, treatment is much more successful if the condition is diagnosed and treated early.  ""The earlier he would have received specialised care, the better,"" she says. ""He arrived at the hospital already critically ill. I believe he could have had a different outcome if we could have treated him earlier."" Jessika now wants to share Lucas's story to help others who may miss critical symptoms. ""Every child I know was saved by some warning and the mother says: 'I saw your posts, I took my son to the hospital and he is now at home.' It's as if it were a little bit of Lucas,"" she says.  ""I have been doing for these people what I wish they had done for me. If I had had information, I would have been even more cautious."" There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid, says Dr Fatima Marinho, who is also a senior adviser to the international health NGO Vital Strategies. Marinho's research has found that a shockingly high number of children and babies have been affected by the virus.  Between February 2020 and 15 March 2021, Covid-19 killed at least 852 of Brazil's children up to the age of nine, including 518 babies under one year old, according to figures from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. But Dr Marinho estimates that more than twice this number of children died of Covid. A serious problem of underreporting due to lack of Covid testing is bringing the numbers down, she says.  Dr Marinho calculated the excess of deaths by unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic, and found that there were 10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years. By adding these numbers, she estimates that the virus in fact killed 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies. Experts say the sheer number of Covid cases in the country - the second-highest number in the world  - have increased the likelihood that Brazil's babies and young children are affected. ""Of course, the more cases we have and, as a result, the more hospitalisations, the greater the number of deaths in all age groups, including children. But if the pandemic were controlled, this scenario could evidently be minimised,"" says Renato Kfouri, president of the Scientific Department of Immunisations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. Such a high infection rate has overwhelmed Brazil's entire health care system. Across the country, oxygen supplies are dwindling, there is a shortage of basic medicines and in many ICUs across the country there are simply no more beds. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose lockdowns and the infection rate is being driven by a variant called P.1 which emerged in Manaus, in northern Brazil, last year, and is thought to be much more contagious. Twice the number of people died last month than in any other month of the pandemic, and the upward trend is continuing.  Another problem driving the high rates in children is a lack of testing.    Marinho says that for children often the Covid diagnosis comes too late, when they are already seriously ill. ""We have a serious problem detecting cases. We don't have enough tests for the general population, even fewer for children. Because there is a delay in the diagnosis, there is a delay in care for the child,"" she says.  This is not just because there is little testing capacity, but also because it is easier to miss, or misdiagnose, the symptoms of children suffering from Covid-19, as the disease tends to present differently in younger people.  ""A child has a lot more diarrhoea, a lot more abdominal pain, and chest pain, than the classic Covid picture. Because there is a delay in diagnosis, when the child arrives at the hospital they are in a serious condition and can end up complicating - and dying,"" she says.   But it's also about poverty and access to health care.  An observational study of 5,857 Covid-19 patients under the age of 20, carried out by Brazilian paediatricians led by Braian Sousa from the São Paolo school of medicine, identified both comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for the worst outcome of Covid-19 in children. Marinho agrees this is an important factor. ""Most vulnerable are black children, and those from very poor families, as they have the most difficulty accessing help. These are the children most at risk of death."" She says this is because crowded housing conditions make it impossible to socially distance when infected, and because poorer communities do not have access to a local ICU.   These children are also at risk of malnutrition, which is ""terrible for the immune response"", Marinho says. When Covid payments stopped, millions were plunged back into poverty. ""We went from 7 million to 21 million people below the poverty line in one year. So people are also going hungry. All of this is impacting mortality.""  Sousa says his study identifies certain risk groups among children that should be prioritised for vaccination. Currently, there are no vaccines available for children under 16 years of age.  Visits by relatives to children in ICU have been restricted since the beginning of the pandemic, for fear of infection.  Dr Cinara Carneiro, an ICU doctor at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital, says this has been immensely challenging, not just because parents are a comfort to their children, but because they can also help in a clinical sense - they can tell when their child is in pain or in psychological distress and when they need soothing rather than medicating. And she says the parents' absence intensifies their own trauma when they hear their child's condition has deteriorated and they haven't been there to witness it.  ""It hurts to see a child dying without seeing their parents,"" says Dr Carneiro. In an attempt to improve the communication between parents and their children, staff at Albert Sabin hospital clubbed together to buy phones and tablets to facilitate video calls.  Dr Carneiro says this has helped immensely. ""We have made over 100 video calls between family members and patients. This contact has greatly reduced the stress."" Scientists stress the risk of death in this age group is still ""very low"" - the current figures suggest only 0.58% of Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths to date have been of 0-9 year olds - but that is more than 2,000 children.  ""The numbers are really scary,"" says Dr Carneiro. While coronavirus is infectious to children, it is rarely serious. If your child is unwell it is likely to be a non-coronavirus illness, rather than coronavirus itself. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health advises parents seek URGENT help (call 111 or go to A&E)  if their child is:"
risk appetite,The politics driving China's hellish lockdowns,2024-09-15,2022-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63310524,"The world has largely moved on from Covid - except for China, where towns and cities are still shut down overnight.   And that's unlikely to change soon, judging by President Xi Jinping's opening speech at the Communist Party Congress on Sunday. China - and even the world - was hoping for a hint of relaxation. But Mr Xi, who is set to be handed a historic third term to lead the Party, said that the government would not ""waver"" in its commitment to record zero cases.  Driven by Mr Xi's approval, China's lockdowns have been incessant, unpredictable and hellish by most accounts. They have sparked food shortages, crippled healthcare access, hit the economy hard and even spurred rare signs of protest. But Beijing has clung to zero-Covid, which has come to define Mr Xi's rule and the authoritarian bureaucracy at his disposal like almost no other policy.  The BBC found that since March, China has partially or fully locked down 152 prefecture-level cities, affecting a population of more than 280 million. But 114 of those have been locked down just since August, as the Party Congress approached.  Beijing is the only major city to have avoided a full lockdown so far. Residents half-jokingly observe that the capital has managed this by locking down the rest of the country when needed. However on Thursday some housing estates and shopping centres in Beijing were being locked down after a steep rise in cases. BBC gathered data starting in March because that's when China's fourth phase of Covid control measures kicked off - comparing lockdowns across phases is harder because official language changes, skewing definitions and therefore, the corresponding data.     And China's bureaucrats have certainly found inventive new ways to describe lockdowns. The measures had become so controversial and dreaded that confusing official-speak was one way to make them more palatable.   So they used phrases like ""stasis management"", ""at-home stillness"" or to be clearer, ""stillness throughout the whole region"" or ""stop all unnecessary movement"".  Then came ""temporary societal control"", which authorities said was not a ""lockdown"" but reduced movement that somehow would not affect the  ""normal order of production and life"".  And yet ""the public was asked not to go out unless necessary"". ""Enclosed management"" was another new phrase invented in the southern province of Guangdong. It means that the village, district or residential compound is enclosed, with checkpoints at entrances and exits. People and vehicles are allowed to enter and leave with passes. People who do not live or work in the enclosed area are not allowed to enter. But, residents were told, it's not a lockdown.  When track-and-trace methods started to grate, eager officials came up with an alternative: ""temporal and spatial overlapper"". The sci-fi-inspired phrase refers to someone whose location, tracked by their phone, has overlapped in time and space with someone else who is Covid-positive.  Rather than tell people not to visit their hometowns during this year's Spring Festival, the governor in Dancheng County in central Henan province warned them that ""those who come home with malicious intent will first be quarantined, then be detained"".  Now China is in what Beijing calls the ""scientific and precise dynamic zero"" phase, whose meaning no-one seems to be sure about. It's meant to be one step up from the earlier ""dynamic zero"" policy.  Dynamic because the idea is that it's not just about locking down entire cities and towns but about responding more dynamically depending on what the situation requires. But on the ground, it just looks and feels like a series of endless lockdowns.  The year began with the tourist hub of Xi'an, home to 13 million, being shut down for a month. Then in March, a lockdown was announced in Shanghai. It was meant to last less than a week, but its 25 million residents stayed home for two months. In September, residents in locked down Chengdu found themselves trapped in their apartments during an earthquake. Elsewhere, rescue workers were required to do a Covid test before they could save anyone. That same month, hundreds of thousands of people in two cities in Shanxi faced a lockdown without a single case being reported: officials said it was to ""contain the risk from outside"". A local party leader vowed to protect the area ""to welcome the 20th Party Congress with excellent results"".  Beijing has repeatedly insisted that ""dynamic zero"" means local authorities must not resort to a ""one size fits all"" approach of full lockdowns and mass testing.  But there appears to be a discrepancy between that diktat and what's actually happening in towns and cities across China. Several lockdowns announced by local officials were, in fact, missing from Beijing's daily announcements in March and April - including one in Shenzhen which confined 17 million to their homes for a week.    It's possible central government officials did not want to encourage total lockdowns by drawing attention to them, while local officials preferred to use them to control outbreaks swiftly.  Experts also say China's bureaucracy is far more centralised under Mr Xi - it's a reversal of the decentralisation that began after China introduced economic reforms. What that means now is that bureaucrats enforce Mr Xi's signature policies with zeal. ""Xi's appetite for adaptive governance and his relationship with local authorities varies by issue areas,"" says Yuen Yuen Ang, a political science associate professor at the University of Michigan.  ""On his signature policies, those he declared as having no room for 'wavering', there is little or no leeway for local governments to make adjustments. Indeed, to survive and get ahead, they must over-implement Xi's personal edicts with gusto, even if the net result is damaging."" From April onwards, the lockdown tallies in Beijing's announcements matched those in local notices - around the same time Mr Xi reaffirmed his support for sticking to a zero-Covid approach. As the year wore on, more cities stopped meticulous track-and-trace and entered full lockdowns even if only a handful of cases were reported.   Local officials are driven by both fear of punishment and an urge to display loyalty to Mr Xi, says Wu Guoguang, a senior China scholar at Stanford University. He was once a member of the Chinese Communist Party's policy group on political reform.  When it comes to proving their loyalty, Mr Wu adds: ""There is an undeclared competition among local leaders, which provides a huge momentum to their seemingly unreasonable measures."" And, experts say, it's no coincidence that the lockdowns started to spread as the congress approached.  ""Covid is political in China,"" says William Hurst, professor of Chinese development at Cambridge University.  The carefully scripted once-in-five-years party congress carries special import this year - if it goes according to Mr Xi's plan, he becomes the first leader since the first Communist-era leader Mao Zedong to serve as party boss for a third term. And nothing can ruin the party quite like a Covid outbreak - especially since Mr Xi and his bureaucrats insist ""dynamic zero"" is a success that has been saving lives.  It has indeed prevented a major outbreak like the one in Shanghai earlier this year, says Benjamin Cowling, chair of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.  ""What is less certain is whether the cost is justified, and whether this approach is going to be sustainable given its enormous economic costs,"" he adds.  Locking down millions of people may be helping keep national case counts low, but the decision to do so even as the rest of the world opens up also shows how poorly prepared China is for a post-Covid world.  Public health experts argue that if zero-Covid was indeed about saving lives, Beijing would have implemented a more vigorous vaccine policy like other countries. But China has refused to import vaccines despite evidence that its homemade jabs haven't proved as effective. And unvaccinated elderly people, who Beijing says it's trying to protect with zero-Covid, have died from the virus.    But what zero-Covid has done, experts say, is project a veneer of control and stability as the year's biggest political event unfolds.  Prof Hurst expects the intermittent lockdowns to last at least until March next year, when China's equivalent of parliament convenes to choose Mr Xi as president for a third time.  ""Lockdowns prevent Covid outbreaks from spreading,"" Prof Hurst adds. ""But they also exert incredibly strict social control.""  "
risk appetite,Is football's racism battle being lost?,2024-09-15,2021-02-01,Dan Roan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55887106,"Manchester United and Sheffield United players kneeling before their recent Premier League game at Old Trafford - Manchester United pair Axel Tuanzebe and Antony Martial received racist abuse following the match When it comes to online racist abuse, football appears to have had enough. Again.  Last week's series of incidents provoked a wave of condemnation from across the game and beyond.  And yet, this comes almost two years after top stars took part in a campaign called '#Enough', a 24-hour social media boycott in protest at a similar spate of abuse. Now the same demands for tech platforms to do more are being made. So is the battle being lost? Why is it proving so difficult to tackle this issue? And where is this crisis heading? Duke of Cambridge calls for racist abuse of footballers to stop Chelsea 'disgusted' after Reece James racially abused on social media Arrest over racist abuse of West Brom player Sawyers Racist abuse sent to Manchester United pair Tuanzebe and Martial The pressure on the social media platforms is intensifying. The appetite for more regulation is growing.  Last week the Premier League said the tech companies ""need to do more"", calling for ""swifter removal of offensive messages and improved identification and banning of offenders"". Manchester United, with three of their squad subject to vile messages, urged the creation of verifiable and identifiable accounts so offenders could be caught, saying they and the players were ""sick of it"", making the point that no one should face such hate-filled abuse in their place of work. The Duke of Cambridge, who is also the president of the Football Association, wants social media companies to take more responsibility The Duke of Cambridge, who is also the president of the Football Association, has praised those who have spoken out and called for an end to the ""despicable"" abuse. Writing on Twitter, Prince William also cited the need for social media companies to raise their game. ""We all have a responsibility to create an environment where such abuse is not tolerated, and those who choose to spread hate and division are held accountable for their actions. That responsibility extends to the platforms where so much of this activity now takes place,"" he said. The Professional Footballers' Association, which represents players, has asked the tech giants to prevent users from being able to send explicitly racist terms and emojis. ""While racist abuse is allowed to continue on each platform, we can only conclude that this is a choice by the companies running the social networks,"" it said. Putting such criticism to the platforms is no easy task. We asked for an interview with Twitter on this subject back in 2019. We are still waiting for one. Our request last week for an interview with Facebook - the owner of Instagram - was met with a short statement saying: ""There is no place for racism on Instagram and we are committed to removing it when we find it. We know there is more to do and we will continue to work closely with clubs, players and football authorities to investigate instances of discrimination and collectively tackle this issue."" Twitter too issued a statement: ""Racist behaviour has no place on our service and when we identify accounts that violate any of the Twitter Rules, we take enforcement action. ""We have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our valued partners in football to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour - both online and offline."" This video can not be played 'Social media companies not vigilant enough' - Wright and Jenas react after Rashford is subject of racist abuse The government meanwhile has vowed to press on with plans for ""groundbreaking"" new online harms legislation later this year to make tech companies legally responsible for the online safety of their users, and make them accountable to a regulator - Ofcom, external - over abusive content. Racist messages would need to be removed ""without delay"". The proposals include the threat of massive fines of up to 10% of global turnover if the companies fail to meet their obligations, and there could even be criminal sanctions for senior executives.  Behind the scenes, I am told that while football authorities were encouraged by the recent meeting that Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden hosted with players to discuss online abuse, there is concern at how long it is taking to introduce new laws considered long overdue, and fears they may be watered down if the hugely powerful, US-based tech companies have their way and threaten to invest elsewhere.   But according to Kick It Out, external chief executive Sanjay Bhandari, the legislation - along with the promise of more regulation in the US from President Joe Biden - are grounds for optimism.  ""The cavalry is on the way,"" the head of the anti-discrimination body told the BBC. ""That's the hope on the horizon, but that may not come quickly enough so there's things we need social media to do right now. The behavioural, cultural problems will take longer to solve. It's the technology problem we can do more quickly and all of the answers sit with Twitter and Facebook. Technology has been massively unregulated for 25 years and its time we closed that loophole."" Marcus Rashford played in Manchester United's 0-0 draw at Arsenal on Saturday Some at the Premier League - which launched a dedicated, 'rapid-response' reporting system for players last year - say the social media platforms have improved in recent years, but not enough. There has been success with the removal of posts but officials want more effort to assist the authorities to find perpetrators so they can be banned by clubs (if they are a fan) or even prosecuted. While there have been some successful prosecutions - an Irish teenager is due to be sentenced on Wednesday for sending racist abuse to former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright - these are few and far between when the sheer scale of the abuse is considered.  One insider said league officials felt hampered by what they called impregnable and unresponsive tech companies using privacy, freedom of speech and the sheer weight of traffic as reasons for not handing over information that would help identify offenders. The fear is that the police - without the resources to pursue every possible crime - only intervene in the most serious cases, and abusers know they face little risk of sanctions. Court orders need to be obtained to force the platform to co-operate, evidence has to be gathered, and often offenders are overseas in different jurisdictions.  Another challenge is persuading players to take legal action, which can often seem a daunting prospect. A man was arrested following alleged racial abuse of West Bromwich Albion midfielder Romaine Sawyers While admitting there is ""more to do"", Facebook does point to the fact that it is working with Kick It Out on a fans' education and reporting initiative, and has built tools designed to prevent unwanted contact on Instagram. It has also tripled the size of its safety team to 35,000 people, claiming it proactively took action on tens of million of pieces of hate speech last year. But considering the vast wealth of these companies, many believe more should be invested. The tech companies argue that tackling this problem is not as straightforward as many assume. They have other areas of concern that must also be monitored across their vast, unregulated platforms; from suspected terrorism and paedophilia to the spread of misinformation.  Simply blocking certain discriminatory words or emojis from being used in the first place is problematic, because these can also be used in a non-offensive context, and across global platforms can have different meanings in different communities or territories. The companies can block devices for repeat offenders, but that person can then just use a different device. Many are now calling for an end to the anonymity that provides a shield to many abusers with a mandatory verification process that means users must give passport details for instance before opening an account. Given the mistrust over social media platforms' use of personal data however, there are fears that this could pose a threat to activists, whistleblowers and persecuted minorities who need to protect their identity online. Many also point out that in recent years, racially offensive comments have been published on social media by fully verified accounts.  Axel Tuanzebe (left) and Anthony Martial (centre) received racist abuse after featuring in a Manchester United defeat There are also those who believe that the time has come for football's authorities and clubs to invest more, and take the burden of reporting away from the players.  ""The problem is that the systems that they've got in place require a player to receive and then report the abuse themselves, and by that point the damage has already been done,"" according to Jonathan Hirshler, the CEO of Signify, a data science company that uses artificial intelligence to uncover the identities of abusers. ""The technology is there, using AI and open source data, to unmask vile and prolific abusers.  ""It's also important that football moves from reactive to proactive, to pick up abuse before the players have to, and package evidence in a way that the social platforms and authorities have little choice but to act on. So we need a new approach, working constructively with the platforms, to ensure that abusers have nowhere to hide."" There is no time to waste. During just the final six weeks of last season, a joint PFA and Signify study identified more than 3,000 explicitly abusive messages aimed at Premier League players, 56% of which were racist. Of the players surveyed, 43% said they had experienced targeted racist abuse.  Football has become a lightning-rod for a wider, societal issue. The scale of the challenge facing the sport is significant, and seems to be getting worse. Finding a solution however, is proving far from simple."
risk appetite,What happens to Debenhams now?,2024-09-15,2019-04-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47868020,"Debenhams' much anticipated slide into administration has finally come to pass. The chain is now in the hands of its lenders. Not for long though - those lenders, Barclays and Bank of Ireland, as well as hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree, will now try to sell the business as soon as possible.  So what do we know about these lenders and who might be lining up to buy Debenhams? Barclays and Bank of Ireland are familiar names in the UK and need little introduction. But Silver Point Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management are less well known.  GoldenTree was set up in 2000 and has offices in New York, London, Singapore and Sydney.  It specialises in high-risk, high-reward investments. Last November, it bought Johnston Press, after the owner of the i newspaper and the Scotsman went into administration. GoldenTree was the firm's biggest lender.  Silver Point Capital is of a similar ilk.  It is a newer business than GoldenTree, and was formed by two former Goldman Sachs partners.  It also focuses on the type of special situations investments favoured by its fellow Debenhams-backer. Mike Ashley has made clear his interest in buying the store chain all along, despite being repeatedly rebuffed by Debenhams' board. He isn't giving up.  Sports Direct has formally registered its interest with the chain's interim owners, deputy chief financial officer Chris Wootton told the BBC. However, Mr Wootton doesn't expect them to succeed at this stage either. ""The way this has all been set up suggests to us [the owners] already have a plan in place to sell it to a third party, not us."" Mr Wootton suggests ""various retailers"" would be interested in buying Debenhams, including another big name from the UK High Street, Topshop-owner, Sir Philip Green.  A BBC source says Sir Philip is not interested in buying the chain, however. Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, suggests Philip Day, owner and chief executive of Edinburgh Woollen Mills as a potential bidder. Mr Day owns a number of other well-known brands, including Peacocks and Jaeger, and earlier this month he put in a bid for struggling fashion chain Bonmarché.  ""Philip Day is developing a department store concept, so he might want to take some of their stores,"" says Ms Hinton. However she says the whole chain might prove too big for Mr Day. That's the problem, agrees Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at retail intelligence experts Springboard. It's a tall order expecting anyone to take on a chain the size of Debenhams at a time when bricks and mortar retail is struggling.  ""Potentially Amazon? They're putting their toe in the water,"" says Ms Wehrle.  But Amazon takes a ""pragmatic"" approach, she says, and might not have the appetite for a large network of stores. Instead some stores, in particular the smaller ones, could be sold off piecemeal to retailers who want to expand, such as Primark, Aldi or Lidl, she suggests. Mike Ashley is one of the UK's most talented and successful retailers. He turned a single store and £10,000 into a billion pound empire. He has put his hand in those deep pockets to offer a last chance to a series of High Street retailers who seemingly had nowhere else to turn. In recent years he has often been ""around the hoop"" (a basketball metaphor often used by merger and acquisition bankers) when well-known consumer brands and chains have been up for sale. He bought House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Flannels and others outright and amassed a nearly 30% stake in Debenhams, before seeing the £150m he spent on it go up in smoke when the lenders took control on Tuesday. But his claim that the Debenhams administration is ""nothing short of a national scandal"" has raised eyebrows and reasonable questions about the Sports Direct tycoon's right to be considered a thwarted saviour of yet another High Street victim. Read Simon's blog here. Mr Wootton says that if Sports Direct took over the chain, they would keep more than 90% of stores open. ""We'd obviously look to invest in the stores, because they look very tired,"" he said. He suggests thousands of jobs could be saved. The chain has 166 stores, which initially at least will all continue to trade. But it also has £621m of debt. The current plan is to renegotiate the rents on some of its stores, while around 50 have already been earmarked for closure starting next year. Ms Wehrle says any purchaser would be looking at slimming down the ""huge number of stores"" in the chain. GlobalData's Maureen Hinton agrees that even Mike Ashley would thin store numbers, and argues Debenhams would need significant investment if it wants to compete with John Lewis. ""Merging it with House of Fraser could be a benefit [thanks to] the economies of scale... [offering] greater bargaining power with suppliers and landlords,"" she suggests."
risk appetite,"British man, 35, killed in Sydney shark attack",2024-09-15,2022-02-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-60398033,"A 35-year-old British man has been named as the victim of Sydney's first fatal shark attack in nearly 60 years. A friend confirmed Simon Nellist died in the attack on Wednesday.  Police have not yet formally identified the victim and his family have not commented. Australian authorities are still searching for the great white shark, with swimmers banned from the water and most city beaches shut after Wednesday's attack. Mr Nellist - who was a diving instructor - was mauled by a great white shark just off Little Bay in east Sydney. He was a member of the city's Scuba Diving Social Club and a regular swimmer at the beach, BBC Sydney correspondent Shaimaa Khalil reports.  A UK foreign office spokesperson said consular staff were in touch with New South Wales Police. ""We are supporting the family of a British man and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time,"" the spokesperson said.  Shark attacks in Sydney are uncommon because the city has long had nets and other deterrents in its waters. On Thursday, surf lifesavers on jet skis patrolled a 25km (15.5 mile) stretch of water from Bondi in the city's east to Cronulla in the south to find the shark. Authorities are also using helicopters and drones. The state government said its shark experts had estimated the predator to be a great white shark ""at least three metres"" in length based on footage of the incident taken by a member of the public. Several passers-by who witnessed the scene have described a vicious and frenzied attack. ""[The person] was swimming and a shark came and attacked [them] vertically,"" Kris Linto told Nine News. ""We heard a yell and turned around, it looked like a car had landed in the water, a big splash then the shark."" One man recounted how he had been fishing on the rocks when he saw the swimmer get dragged under. ""It was terrible. I am shaking. I keep vomiting. It's very, very upsetting,"" he told ABC News.  Authorities managed to retrieve body parts from the water two hours after the attack. The area's state MP Michael Daley said locals were shaken by the ""horrific"" incident. The victim had been a regular visitor. ""[He] came here and swam nearly every day,"" he told the ABC. ""It's a beautiful day at one of Sydney's most beautiful beaches, but there's a real dark pall hanging over our community today,"" he said. By Frances Mao, BBC News Wednesday's incident is a horrible tragedy, and in days to come there will be questions about how the shark slipped through the protections set up. Right now we don't have any of those details. The New South Wales state government already runs a shark mitigation programme believed the largest and most sophisticated in the world.  Sydney beaches have been guarded by nets for nearly a century. On summer weekends, drones and helicopters hover, scanning for sharks. (It's not uncommon to be lazing around on the sand when suddenly a siren blares and lifeguards are ordering people out of the water.) Authorities also run an extensive shark-tagging programme where the most concerning shark species - tiger, bull and great white sharks - have trackers attached to their fins. When they're picked up in the nets, they're tagged and relocated about a kilometre away. On Thursday, authorities spooled out sensor drumlines - baited strings - to try to find the white shark. Authorities do find the predator most of the time, usually within days. In the past that's led to culls. Officials haven't yet said what they'll do. But there's little community appetite for killing sharks these days. Instead shark safety is about strengthening protections; educating beachgoers.  Don't swim at dawn or dusk. Stay close to shore. Swim between the marked flags. Avoid fishing areas. Sharks are just a part of beach culture. And many Australians accept that entering the water will always contain some risk. Contact between a human and a shark is rare, given there are thousands of sharks in the water at any time. Attacks usually occur in the warmer summer months (December - February) in Australia because more people are in the water. Australia typically records about 20 shark attacks each year, with most in New South Wales and Western Australia. There have been four shark attacks so far this year, according to the Australian Shark Attack File. There were two fatal shark attacks in 2021, and seven in 2020. Historically, dying from a shark bite is not common. In over a century of records, Australia's shark attack mortality rate is 0.9 - less than one person per year."
risk appetite,Is it possible to regulate artificial intelligence?,2024-09-15,2023-09-20,By Michael Dempsey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66853057,"Can artificial intelligence be kept under control? Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, says that believing it can be is akin to ""magical thinking"". ""In many cases politicians and their aides have a weak understanding of how the internet works, and what it is possible to achieve,"" says Mr Wales, who has spent many hours explaining both technology and its role in free speech to politicians around the globe.  ""The question of a body like the United Nations regulating AI is like suggesting the UN regulate [image editing app] Photoshop."" His point is that he thinks it would be pointless.  The issue of whether AI should be regulated, and to what extent, heated up this summer when UN Secretary General António Guterres convened the first ever UN Security Council meeting to specifically discuss its potential dangers. Speaking in regard to everything from AI-powered cyber attacks, to the risk of malfunctioning AI, how AI can spread misinformation, and even the interaction between AI and nuclear weapons, Mr Guterres said: ""Without action to address these risks, we are derelict in our responsibilities to present and future generations."" Mr Guterres has since moved forward with the establishment of a UN panel to investigate what global regulation might be needed. Called the High-Level Advisory Body for Artificial Intelligence, this will comprise ""present and former government experts, as well as experts from industry, civil society, and academia"". It is due to publish its initial findings before the end of this year. Meanwhile, last week US tech bosses such as Elon Musk and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg held talks with US lawmakers in Washington to discuss AI and potential future rules. However, some AI insiders are sceptical that global regulation can be successful. One such person is Pierre Haren, who has been researching AI for 45 years.  His experience includes seven years at computer giant IBM, where he led the team that installed Watson super computer technology for customers. Debuted in 2010, Watson can answer a user's questions, and was one of the pioneers of AI. Despite Mr Haren's background, he says he was ""flabbergasted"" by the emergence and capability of ChatGPT and other so-called ""generative AI"" programs over the past year. Generative AI is, put simply, AI that can quickly create new content, be it words, images, music or videos. And it can take an idea from one example, and apply it to an entirely different situation. Mr Haren says that such an ability is human-like. ""This thing is not like a parrot, repeating what we feed into it,"" he says. ""It's making high-level analogies.""  So how can we create a set of rules to stop this AI getting out of control? We can't, says Mr Haren, because he says some countries won't sign up to them. ""We live in a world with non-cooperative nations like North Korea and Iran,"" he says. ""They won't recognise regulations around AI. ""The regulation of non-cooperative actors is pie in the sky! Can you imagine Iran looking for a way to destroy Israel and caring about AI regulations?"" Physicist Reinhard Scholl is the founder of the UN's ""AI For Good"" programme. This aims to find and implement practical AI solutions to help achieve the UN's sustainable development goals.  These include everything from ending poverty, to eradicating hunger and giving everyone access to clean water. AI for Good began life in 2017 as an annual event, and has blossomed into a regular schedule of online seminars that address every facet of AI.  With over 20,000 subscribers, AI for Good has hit a nerve, but the appetite for positive AI doesn't mean Mr Scholl is optimistic. ""Should AI be regulated? It's a no-brainer, yes!"" he declares, comparing the situation to how car or toymakers have to comply with safety regulations. His big worry is that AI makes it relatively easy for bad actors to employ the technology as a springboard to acquire dangerous capabilities.  ""A physicist knows how to build a nuclear bomb in theory, but to do it in practice would be very difficult,"" he says. ""But if someone uses AI to design a biological weapon they don't need to know so much. ""And if it becomes too easy for people to do major damage using AI then someone will do it."" But what form should a future UN regulatory body on AI take? One suggestion is that it mirrors the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which regulates global air travel and its safety. This has 193 member nations. Read additional stories on artificial intelligence Robert Opp is one AI expert who backs the formation of a body similar to the ICAO. Mr Opp is chief digital officer for the UN Development Programme. The agency is tasked with helping countries drive economic growth and end poverty. His job sees him try to find ways to make technology boost the organisation's impact. This includes the use of AI to quickly check satellite images of farmland in impoverished areas. Mr Opp says he doesn't want to impede that kind of capability, or restrain the potential of generative AI to assist the poor in building up a business.  But he also accepts the potential downside of AI. ""There is a sense of urgency in figuring out AI governance."" Urgent or not, Wikipedia's Mr Wales thinks the UN is utterly misguided.  He believes the international bodies are making a big error in overestimating the role of tech giants like Google in the avalanche of AI products. Mr Wales adds that no amount of good intentions can hold back individual software developers and their use of AI. He says that beyond the boundaries of the tech giants countless programmers are using freely available AI software, where baseline code is available across the internet. ""There are tens of thousands of individual developers who are building on these innovations. Regulation of them is never going to happen."" "
risk appetite,City's recycling fines 'may hit £21m',2024-09-15,2017-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-41124476,"Cardiff faces £21m of fines unless it recycles more than 90,000 extra tonnes of waste in the next three years, a report has warned.  It estimates an additional 32,000 tonnes of waste a year needs to be recycled in the city to hit 2020 targets, due to population growth.  The council is looking into opening a regional plant to sort glass, paper and plastic from across south Wales.  The report said there was not a ""do nothing option"" for the Welsh capital.  The Welsh Government - which set the first statutory recycling targets in the UK - has yet to fine any authority for missing them.  The target for 2016-17 was 58%, rising to 64% by 2019-20, and then 70% by 2024-25.  Any authority missing the targets faces a £200 per-tonne penalty. Last year, three authorities failed to hit the target - Newport and Torfaen both fell just short at 57% each, while Blaenau Gwent's performance was the lowest at 49% - however, none were penalised. This year, provisional figures showed Newport council had exceeded the target, at 61% for 2016-17, Torfaen had risen to 64%, and Blaenau Gwent had also improved at 57%. A report by Cardiff's environmental scrutiny committee, to be considered on Tuesday, said the majority of initiatives to meet targets have been delivered but ""constant thought is needed to ensure that the council achieves future targets"". ""This in effect means that after taking into consideration waste and population growth we have to recycle approximately 32,000 tonnes of additional waste in Cardiff each year,"" the report states. ""The financial risk of failing targets can be massive. For example, failing by 4,000 tonnes could equate to a fiscal penalty of over £800,000.  ""The 'do nothing option' has not been an option for Cardiff; if no further changes are made to the delivery of council recycling services, then the fines between now and 2020 could equate to over £21m."" A Cardiff council spokesman said: ""The council works with five local authorities to treat non-recyclable waste to create green energy through an Energy Recovery Facility.  ""This partnership gives significant benefits, as by working together through economies of scale, the price for each of the partners to treat this waste is lower than if they worked individually. ""Using the same logic, Cardiff is currently proposing to carry out a feasibility study to explore the possibility of a partnership for dry recyclables but no decision has been made."""
risk appetite,National League pushes for more promotion spots,2024-09-15,2023-05-15,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65596135,"Notts County's promotion saw them reclaim their mantle as the 'world's oldest football league club' National League general manager Mark Ives says introducing 'three up, three down' promotion to the English Football League is the ""fairest"" way forward. Notts County were three minutes away from failing to secure promotion to League Two despite reaching 107 points and scoring 117 goals this season. Notts eventually went up after beating Chesterfield in a penalty shootout at the end of their promotion final. ""How can we not have three up?"" Ives told BBC Sport. ""It's simply the fairest thing to do. At the moment there is only two but there are four going up from League Two into League One."" How Notts County regained their 'badge of honour' Wrexham can compete in League Two - Parkinson It took a late equaliser, another fightback in extra time and a penalty-shootout triumph in front of 38,138 at Wembley to ensure Notts returned to the EFL after a four-year absence. However, Ives feels the play-off final underlined the flaw in the promotion system that can only be solved by the EFL - whose chief executive Trevor Birch was at Saturday's thrilling game - agreeing to increase the number of promotion places. ""I think it will happen,"" Ives said of a potential change to the number of promotion spots. ""There is an appetite for it across the game, including within the EFL. ""We want to make it happen. Everyone would think it is fair that the two teams with more than 100 points went up. We were at risk of that not happening. The issue for me is when and how it works."" After the game Chesterfield's Paul Cook said it was ""insane"" that Notts had not already gone up and also called for more promotion spots to be made available. ""This is a very competitive, good league, with a lot of good managers, coaches and teams in it,"" he said.  ""How it's only been allowed to have one team go up automatically is just insane. It's an absolute sporting disgrace."" Over the past six seasons only Macclesfield, who suffered major financial problems and eventually went bust, and Hartlepool this term, have been relegated back to the National League from the 12 clubs promoted. However, Ives feels instead of a three-up, three-down system being akin to turkeys voting for Christmas, an expanded promotion and relegation system would offer more opportunities for those dropping down from the EFL. ""If clubs fall out of the EFL, it is hard to get back because of the standard of football in the National League,"" he said.  ""To have three opportunities as opposed to two has to be a benefit."" The compelling, star-studded Wrexham story, plus their promotion battle with Notts County, means there has been more attention on the National League than ever before. Maintaining the same level of interest will be virtually impossible. In addition, issues at other clubs such as Southend and Yeovil, the latter relegated to National League South nine years after being a Championship club, have highlighted the perilous financial state some have found themselves in. ""If you look back over the last 13 or 14 years, the clubs who have got themselves into financial difficulty haven't been traditional National League clubs,"" said Ives.  ""We have our own financial regulations (FRI) which keeps an eye on the clubs. In terms of trying to identify problems as they arise rather than when it is too late and clubs have got themselves into trouble, I think they are sound and robust. ""You don't always see the checks, nor should you necessarily. Occasionally, we end up having clubs under player embargoes and subject to other safeguards you are not aware of.  ""It is not about playing out problems in the public eye, it is about protecting the sustainability of the clubs and the future of clubs who have been around for years. I absolutely support that."" Following promptings by Wrexham, amongst others, the National League has now adopted a streaming service which has raised the thorny issue of whether the traditional 3pm TV blackout should be scrapped. Saturday's play-off final was shown on BT Sport despite being a 15:30 BST kick-off. As with Manchester City's Premier League win against Leeds the week before, that was only possible because the EFL had no matches at that time and almost all non-league campaigns have been completed. Ives accepts there is a delicate balance to be struck, although he says no substantive talks have taken place within the National League clubs about a united way forward. ""We have not debated it in great detail but my personal opinion is that we do need to protect clubs and those who turn up to watch games,"" he said.  ""But I wouldn't link that too much to the streaming. Streaming is meant to give an opportunity for people to watch who wouldn't normally go to grounds because they live too far away or for other reasons they can't go to the match.  ""You can never replace actually going to a game. Yes, you can see the goals going in and the times they were scored but to experience the atmosphere, you need to be in the ground. ""I don't think streaming will replace people going to the ground and the statistics don't show that is the case either.""

risk appetite,Hull City appoint Slutsky as head coach,2024-09-15,2017-06-09,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40220882,"Leonid Slutsky left CSKA Moscow in December 2016 Championship club Hull City have appointed former Russia boss Leonid Slutsky as their new head coach. Previous Tigers boss Marco Silva left to take over at Watford after Hull were relegated from the Premier League in May. Slutsky won three Russian titles with CSKA Moscow and managed the national side at Euro 2016. He recently told BBC World Service he had been learning English for the past five months. Slutsky, who is friends with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, will arrive in East Yorkshire next week and is Hull City's fourth boss in less than a year. The 46-year-old told the club website:, external ""I am delighted to become the head coach of Hull City and I am very much looking forward to the challenge of guiding the club back to the Premier League. ""I already know that this is an important club with a big and loyal fanbase, I've had a good feeling about it ever since meeting the Allam family and I can't wait to get started."" Hull vice-chairman Ehab Allam said Slutsky's ""attention to detail, thoughts on playing style and his ambition made him the stand-out candidate"" for the role. BBC Radio Humberside sport editor Matt Dean This looks a real coup for Hull City and the mood in the city around his appointment is one of excitement. The buzz stems from Slutsky's pedigree, having most recently managed Russia and CSKA Moscow, where he won three titles and managed in the Champions League. It is a bold move by the club's owners but it is seen as less of a risk given that the Allams have demonstrated fairly sound judgement with their previous appointments. Slutsky has never managed outside his homeland and English football has never before had a Russian boss, but his admission of having studied English football from the Premier League to League One demonstrates his desire to succeed in England. On the surface he appears a very different character to Marco Silva, but his appetite for success looks comparable. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is a close personal friend and that link could open up some intriguing avenues for recruiting players as the club looks to mount a serious challenge to get back to the Premier League at the first attempt.

risk appetite,'I survived coronavirus but am living a nightmare',2024-09-15,2020-08-07,By Ali Gordon,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53611139,"When Jennifer Duddy was admitted to hospital with coronavirus, she said goodbye to her young family wondering if she would ever see them again. The 32-year-old accountant, who has asthma, first experienced symptoms of the virus in March, but says she was refused tests on several occasions.  Initially, most people with symptoms were told to stay at home and self-isolate. Her husband, Jamie, also had symptoms, but while his symptoms slowly started to lessen, Jennifer's got worse and eventually she was admitted to Belfast's Mater Hospital with breathing difficulties. She spent seven days there being treated for coronavirus. When she was discharged, she knew it would take time to recover fully, but was optimistic and excited to again cuddle her eight-year-old daughter, Chloe, and one-year-old son Ryan. ""A lot of tears were shed in those first two months,"" Jennifer told BBC News NI. ""I was on so much medication when I was in hospital that you start to feel a lot better but whenever you get out, you obviously can't have that level of medication home with you, so you just crash back down."" Months later, she is still experiencing heart palpitations, breathlessness, brain fog, dizziness and extreme fatigue. ""You're not living a life, you're just existing,"" she said. ""It goes from one day to another and nothing happens, you just want to go to bed."" Thankfully, Jamie's mother had moved in to help but Jennifer says that it is ""awful, knowing that you are potentially putting someone else's life at risk"". ""I went two months without even holding Chloe or Ryan and it broke my heart, but then I didn't even have the energy to talk to them.  ""I was so sick I couldn't even listen to them, I was just exhausted. ""We were one of those families who rarely had a free Saturday and now I don't even have the energy for a conversation."" Aside from her other symptoms, Jennifer has continued to lose weight due to regular waves of sickness and loss of appetite. Doctors suspect she has developed ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, as a result of the virus. ""It has been an actual living nightmare,"" said Jennifer. She has joined online support groups and met many people who are experiencing similar after effects. ""Our lives are completely on hold - we can't do anything.  ""If I'm able to go to the park with the children alone for 15 minutes then it's been an outstanding day. ""My husband has essentially become a single parent. He does everything. It's so much stress, mentally and physically."" As for the future, Jennifer admits that she is worried, especially if people refuse to wear face coverings to try to limit the spread of Covid-19. On Thursday, the NI Executive announced that face masks would become mandatory in shops and other enclosed spaces from August 10. She said: ""We can't afford to get coronavirus again.  ""It has already caused so much upset to our family, but if people aren't going to wear masks then we can't go out. ""I'm asthmatic and my breathing is still not great and I can wear a mask - so for the majority of people, they can too. ""I wish people would see that coronavirus is still out there. Everyone can't just forget about it and relax. ""If you have the side effects that I have had, your life will be completely on hold."" Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, told the BBC that while little is known at this stage about long-term effects of the virus, stories like Jennifer's are becoming increasingly common. He said that ""a lot of people have reported feeling terrible even months later, so it is going to be a big problem for policy makers and the health service going forward"". ""There is evidence emerging that there are lots of longer side effects,"" said Dr Head. ""It can pretty much affect every organ in the body, it is a nasty virus and there is still a lot to learn about it."" In a bid to limit the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health encouraged people to download its new contact tracing app. Last week, Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to launch an app for tracking and tracing coronavirus."
risk appetite,Delay or decision?,2024-09-15,2018-11-12,By Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46188799,"What was ""a vital 48 hours to get this done"" has now morphed (again) into one of those days where it is not completely clear yet if Theresa May will actually try to get her Cabinet to decide anything on Tuesday, or delay a conclusion (again). As we reported, after last week's meeting, there were plenty of her allies insistent that something had to be signed off this week in order to get the hoped-for November deal, so that scary-sounding necessary no-deal plans don't have to be triggered. For once, the Cabinet seemed to have agreed on something, that a deal this month had to be the priority. Plainly therefore, if Number 10 felt they could get something signed off this week, then they would. One Cabinet source told me this morning ""this really does have to be the crunch time"" and suggested that the PM would have a carefully-orchestrated plan for tomorrow's meeting and ""won't leave anything to chance"". But as the day has worn on, the idea of there being an agreement on Tuesday has slipped away. The negotiators were locked in talks until nearly 3am but didn't get to a final version of that troublesome Irish backstop that the government seems to have felt ready to present. So the talks go on. And every day that there is discussion rather than decision the prospect of a November deal fades. As we discussed here last week that doesn't mean that all is lost, that we are staggering towards leaving without an agreement. A deal could still be done in December. In fact, the government has a hard deadline in law of the end of January. That's not desirable at all. But it is not impossible. For Number 10 therefore the plan is to keep going, to keep trying, to carry on trying to find a form of words that works, that would be more politically palatable. There is huge frustration in parts of the Tory Party and in Cabinet about this whole approach. Why does Number 10 believe there could suddenly be a better answer to the same set of problems? As one former minister said, ""two plus two is not suddenly going to equal five"". And at the top table there seems to be growing appetite for a change of approach. Three different members of the Cabinet have told the BBC that the PM has to ditch her plan. Carrying on like this, they suggest, is simply banging their collective heads against the same brick wall, because it will never get through Parliament. Some of them are even suggesting that the prime minister should consider walking away from the talks. One of them told me: ""The raw truth is there is a gap between what we can accept and what the EU is offering. ""She needs to change the dynamic and only the prime minister can do that. That might mean walking away, or saying this is our best and final offer."" Another said: ""She needs to say that there won't be a deal in order for them to move - she needs to play hardball."" Another senior minister said there is ""no political logic"" in carrying on with something that has a ""cat's chance in hell"" of getting through Parliament, calling for her to ""pivot"". Is it realistic to imagine that she might change tack? Well, certainly it's not straightforward after more than two years of deliberations. Is it likely? Theresa May is not the kind of politician who does much on impulse. And a senior member of the government told me recently it was crazy to think the prime minister could change tack at this late stage. But with a deal, or without a deal, there is risk whatever she decides - whenever, and however, she makes that final call."
risk appetite,Lily Allen talks about using drugs to lose weight,2024-09-15,2021-01-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55679233,"Lily Allen has given more detail about how she became addicted to the prescription drug Adderall in 2014. In a new interview, the 35-year-old said she had taken the drug in an effort to lose weight before supporting Miley Cyrus on tour. ""I was like 14 stone and just did not feel like a pop star at all,"" she told DJ Fat Tony on The Recovery podcast. ""So I started taking this drug called Adderall, which is like speed, to lose the weight. ""And I got addicted to this drug because it made me invincible and I could work really long hours and be all the people I was required to be."" It is not the first time Allen has discussed taking the drug, which is a prescription-only stimulant typically used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In her 2018 memoir My Thoughts Exactly, the singer wrote: ""I flirted with Adderall (which is really just a type of speed) as a way of getting or staying thin."" In the new interview, Allen recalled supporting Cyrus on her Bangerz tour, a job she took to help bolster her finances. She had given birth twice in the three years prior to the tour. Six months after her youngest child was born, Allen says she and then husband Sam Cooper had ""run out of money and I had to go out on the road again"". Allen, who was promoting Sheezus, her first album in six years, was conscious of her appearance ahead of the tour. ""It was when [Cyrus] was doing Wrecking Ball and the Bangerz tour and it was a highly sexualised tour. I had just spent the last three years pushing babies out. It couldn't have been less what I felt like,"" Allen said. ""I had never supported anyone so I was re-entering this phase of being a pop star again but not doing it on my terms any more. I was supporting this girl who was much younger and more attractive than I felt, and I just started acting out in all manner of ways."" She continued: ""I started cheating on my husband and I had always really drunk alcohol to take the edge off of the drugs, and then I realised I was getting up in the morning and downing those mini bottles of vodka or whisky or whatever was left, without the drugs any more."" She later considered taking heroin but stopped herself after ""seeing what happens to people"" who used the Class A drug. She decided instead to begin recovery. Allen has previously discussed her relationship with drugs openly and has written her experiences into her music. Her 2009 song Everyone's At It explores the widespread use of drugs in society, and includes the lyrics: ""How can we start to tackle the problem / If you don't put our hands up / And admit that you're on them?"" Adderall is a stimulant which is only available by prescription in the US. It is prescribed to treat ADHD, a neurobehavioral condition which is characterised by hyperactivity, trouble concentrating and impulsivity. Its use has increased in the last two decades as Adderall has been prescribed to more school-age children, along with another stimulant, Ritalin, which has similar effects. However, if taken by a person who does not suffer from ADHD, the effect is an increase in energy levels, concentration and performance. This has caused it become more popular among adults.  A 2004 episode of Desperate Housewives featured a storyline in which an exhausted Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) started taking Ritalin prescribed to her son, to help her cope with the demands of motherhood. A Netflix documentary released in 2018, Take Your Pills, explored the drug's popularity among groups such as students, who use it to improve grades. Decreased appetite and weight loss are possible side effects of Adderall use, and it can also cause anxiety, insomnia and tremors. Ritalin and Adderall can be addictive and both have a high potential for abuse. There is a long-term risk of psychological and physical dependence for users who feel they cannot fully function without it. Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

risk appetite,Kim to cross border for Korea talks,2024-09-15,2018-04-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43903155,"Kim Jong-un is set to become the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korean territory since the end of the Korean War in 1953, as final details are put in place for the summit. South Korea said President Moon Jae-in would personally meet Mr Kim at the border at 09:30 (00:30 GMT) on Friday. The historic summit will focus on the North's recent indications it could be willing to give up its nuclear weapons. Talks are also proposed between Mr Kim and US President Trump by early June.  Mr Kim is set to cross the military demarcation line - a clearly defined marker of the official land border between the territories. He will, however, remain within the Demilitarised Zone. Seoul has warned reaching an agreement aimed at ridding Pyongyang of its nuclear weapons will be ""difficult"", because North Korea's nuclear and missile technology has advanced so much since the sides' leaders last met more than a decade ago.  ""The difficult part is at what level the two leaders will be able to reach an agreement regarding willingness to denuclearise,"" South Korean presidential spokesperson Im Jong-seok said. The meeting - the third of its kind following summits in 2000 and 2007 - is the result of months of improving relations between the two Koreas, and paves the way for a planned meeting between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump.  President Trump cast some doubt on that meeting on Thursday, saying in an interview with Fox News, ""maybe the meeting doesn't even take place"". He also said he was considering three or four dates as well as five possible locations, if it does go ahead. Mr Kim announced last week that he would suspend nuclear tests for the time being. The move was welcomed by the US and South Korea as a positive step, although Chinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusable after a rock collapse following its last test in September. As well as addressing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the leaders are expected to discuss a path to peace on the peninsula to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, and a series of economic and social issues.  South Korea and the US say they are suspending annual military drills for a day while the summit takes place.  Every detail of the summit has been precisely planned - from the timetable to the dinner menu. Mr Moon will meet Mr Kim and his delegation of nine officials at the concrete blocks which mark the demarcation line on the border, Mr Im told reporters on Thursday. South Korean honour guards will then escort the leaders to a welcome ceremony at a plaza in Panmunjom, a military compound in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two countries.  Official talks between Mr Moon and Mr Kim will begin at 10:30 local time (01:30 GMT) at the Peace House in Panmunjom.  The pair will break after the first session and will have lunch separately - with the delegation from the North crossing back to their side of the border.  At an afternoon ceremony, Mr Moon and Mr Kim will plant a pine tree using soil and water from both countries, to symbolise ""peace and prosperity"".  Following the tree planting, they will walk together before starting the next round of talks. The summit will conclude with the leaders signing an agreement and delivering a joint statement before dinner. The banquet will be held on the South side - and a carefully planned menu has already been announced. Kim Jong-un will be served the Swiss potato dish rösti - a nod to his time studying in Switzerland - along with the North's signature dish of cold noodles, and a North Korean liquor. One detail, however, may have been overlooked - or may have been a deliberate move.   Japan objected to the choice of dessert because of the inclusion on the mango mousse being served of disputed islands on a map of the Korean peninsula. Japan, North Korea and South Korea all claim the islands.  After dinner, the delegations will watch a video called ""Spring of One"", before Mr Kim returns home.   Mr Kim will be accompanied by nine officials, including his sister, Kim Yo-jong, who led the North's delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier this year. Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's nominal head of state, will also attend.   In a rare move - one not seen at previous inter-Korean summits - the delegation will also feature top military officials and diplomats.  South Korean presidential spokesperson Mr Im said he was encouraged by this shift.  ""I feel North Korea is sending their key military officials to the summit as they too, believe denuclearisation and peace are important,"" he said.  ""North Korea appears to take into account not only the inter-Korean summit but also the subsequent North-US summit and efforts for international co-operation.""  South Korea will send seven officials along with President Moon, including the ministers for defence, foreign affairs and unification. The chairman of South Korea's joint chiefs of staff was a late addition to his entourage. The summit is the high point after months of improving relations between the two countries, which few would have predicted following years of rising tension.  The rapprochement began in January when Mr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Mr Kim's new appetite for diplomacy led to a meeting with senior South Korean officials in March - the first time officials from Seoul had met the young leader since he came to power in 2011 - to map out details for a meeting with Mr Moon.  Ahead of the summit, North Korean media praised Mr Kim for his work in the talks.  ""It is a historic event for national history made possible by our brisk efforts for dialogue and peace,"" The Rodong Sinmun, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party, said in an editorial.  ""Improving North-South relations is a necessary requirement for the achievement of homeland unification,"" it said."
risk appetite,Coronavirus fear hits London's Chinatown,2024-09-15,2020-02-03,By Victoria Lindrea & Francesca Gillett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51348593,"It's Sunday lunchtime in London's Chinatown, the streets are strewn with paper lanterns in traditionally lucky red, but the restaurants - normally clattering with diners - are unusually quiet. ""It's a hard time,"" says Martin Ma, general manager at the Jinli restaurant in Newport Place. Last weekend's celebrations for Chinese New Year are long gone and there appears to be little appetite for food or festivities. The confirmation of the first cases of the new coronavirus in the UK on Friday brought ""immediate cancellations"", Mr Ma tells BBC News - with diners citing the virus as the reason.  Bookings at the restaurant's four branches - two in Chinatown, one in Uxbridge and a fourth, in Birmingham - have fallen by 50%, according to Mr Ma, who estimates the flagship restaurant alone has lost £15,000 across the weekend. ""Normally, you have to book ahead - we have long queues going out of the door,"" says Mr Ma - and there are pictures to prove it. Now, at peak lunchtime, it's clear you could walk in off the street. Indeed, Mr Ma said one Chinese tourist did just that on Saturday, choosing Jinli because it was ""empty"" and the lack of diners ""made him feel safe"".  In Jinli, staff returning from China are kept home for at least 14 days, sanitiser gel is ubiquitous - but it's not enough to allay the rising panic over the new coronavirus. A fellow restaurant manager, down the road in Gerrard Street - who preferred to remain anonymous -  agrees that his restaurant is very quiet. ""People are scared, they are staying away,"" he says, sadly, gesturing towards Chinatown's main thoroughfare, with its slow trickle of hapless tourists taking pictures of the enclave's ornamental gate.  He says although he has not personally experienced any hostility, he knows many who have. People getting up and moving seats on the Tube; children being told to keep back from ""foreigners"". In New Loon Fung Restaurant, manager Cathy is more upbeat. ""Most of our diners are locals, regulars,"" says Cathy. ""No problem here,"" she insists. But Mr Ma believes it will take at least a month before business returns to anything like normal.  There is no evidence or health warning that eating Chinese food is a risk for catching the virus, with the World Health Organization saying the virus mainly spreads through contact with an infected person. It says preliminary information suggests the virus may survive a few hours on surfaces. Any prejudice against takeaways is ""completely unacceptable and misinformed"", says Ibrahim Dogus, chairman of the British Takeaway Campaign. Prejudice surrounding coronavirus has not just affected business owners; British Chinese people living in the UK also report being the target of racist abuse linked to the outbreak. PhD student at Royal Holloway University Angela Chan, 46, says she was racially abused at Clapham Junction station in London by a man who rapped a rhyme at her which mentioned coronavirus, ""slitty eyes"" and ""Chinese lies"". ""You will find Chinese people do experience racism and British people think we don't,"" she says. ""It tends to be a bit different, it's either casual or 'funny', and you're expected to brush it off."" Ms Chan, from Brentford, west London, says the outbreak ""brings to the surface all the casual racism about people being dirty, or the things people eat"", with ""blame"" being placed on Chinese culture for the new virus. ""I think it's tied in with deep-seated racism and fear of a community but it's also to do with China's rise in power. What we perceive to be a secretive culture,"" she adds. Paediatric nurse Lucy Li, 35, from Wanstead in east London, says her 11-year-old daughter ""reported last week that children are telling each other to 'stay away from all Chinese people because they are ill due to the virus'"". Ms Li, whose parents came to the UK from China in the 1960s, adds: ""Even when I went to the doctors, when I coughed I could see people moving away from me. ""I can't walk down the street without unwanted attention. It's degrading and enough is enough."" She adds: ""As a healthcare professional and working directly in the frontline of the NHS, I do sympathise with the public's growing concerns.  ""However, there is much misleading information in the media, which has now resulted in racial prejudice towards Chinese people who reside in the UK."" Meanwhile, the Chinese Community Centre in Birmingham said: ""Sadly, we're hearing that abuse against Chinese people in the UK has increased since coronavirus has spread."" Freelance journalist and Manchester University masters student Sam Phan says the recent outbreak of coronavirus has ""put a spotlight on"" racism against east Asians. In an article published in the Guardian, the 23-year-old outlined overhearing several conversations which exposed the ""stereotyping of all east Asians as a coronavirus risk"". He tells the BBC the coronavirus has been viewed ""as a Chinese virus"" which has ""then created this fear of east Asian and Chinese people"". ""As an east Asian British person it is not nice as people are treating you as if you're disgusting,"" he says. When his article went live, he says he received racist comments suggesting he should ""stop eating dog"". ""First of all, no British Chinese people eat dog - we eat fish and chips and what everyone else is eating."" Mr Phan said: ""The Asian experience of racism has often been overlooked. There aren't as many voices out there calling it out."" He was ""extremely happy"" to finally see headlines talking about racism against Chinese people, he added.

risk appetite,'Feeding wild ponies could be killing them',2024-09-15,2021-05-06,By Chris Dearden,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-57016518,"TV farmer Gareth Wyn Jones has warned people not to feed wild ponies as it ""could be killing them"". A group which looks after the animals say piles of carrots have been found left for them in the Sychnant Pass, near Conwy.   Experts believe the ponies' digestive systems aren't able to cope with food such as carrots or apples and risk developing horse colic.    Symptoms include excessive sweating, lying down often and a poor appetite.  A mare and her foal had recently to be taken off the mountains this week because the foal was unwell. Vets are still trying to work out if the illness was caused by something the pair had eaten.   ""Carrots have been found in piles around the Sychnant Pass twice now,"" said Mr Jones, who is secretary of Carneddau Pony Society, a group of farmers who ""manages"" them. ""But the ponies' digestion system will not break them down. It's not what these animals are supposed to eat."" Mr Jones said the ponies normally eat the grass on the mountains. ""When people take food for them, they don't realise the damage they could be doing,"" Mr Jones said. ""Please, please don't feed these ponies - it's not helping them, it could be killing them."" The ponies have roamed over the Carneddau mountains for centuries, and live in an area of 13,500 acres between Bethesda, Llanfairfechan, Capel Curig and Conwy. Mr Jones said: ""These ponies have been born and bred up here since the Celtic times - their stomachs are used to eating the coarse vegetation.  ""People look at them this time of year, and maybe they think they look a little bit thin because they're just coming out of the winter and they've got foals.  ""We haven't had the information back about this young foal yet, but it was quite weak.    ""It's all happening in the same area, that's what's starting to ring alarm bells that people are going out and feeding them."""
risk appetite,"Labour must unequivocally back Remain, says deputy",2024-09-15,2019-09-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49657006,"Labour should ""unequivocally back Remain"" in a fresh Brexit referendum and only then pursue power in a general election, its deputy has said. Tom Watson said there was ""no such thing as a good Brexit deal"" and the 2016 Leave vote had been ""invalidated"".  Jeremy Corbyn said he did ""not accept or agree with"" his deputy's view. ""Our priority is to get a general election in order to give the people a chance to elect a government that cares for them,"" he said.  The Labour leader wants to hold another referendum once Labour has won power, in which voters would have the choice to remain in the EU alongside a ""credible"" Leave proposal.  However, he has said he would only choose a side once the shape of any revised Brexit deal negotiated by a Labour government became clear.   The BBC's political correspondent, Chris Mason, said Mr Watson was directly elected as deputy leader by party members, not appointed by Mr Corbyn, and so has a right to roam on policy other shadow cabinet ministers might not get away with it.  In a speech in London, Mr Watson said while an autumn general election seemed inevitable ""that does not make it desirable"". ""Elections should never be single issue campaigns,"" he argued, suggesting vital issues such as the future of the NHS, economic inequality and crime would be ""drowned out"" by the prime minister's ""do or die"" Brexit message. ""The only way to break the Brexit deadlock once and for all is a public vote in a referendum,"" he said. ""A general election might well fail to solve this Brexit chaos."" In the event of another general election in the coming months, Mr Watson said Labour must be ""crystal clear"" about where it stands on Brexit if it wants to get a hearing for the rest of its domestic policy agenda. ""There is no such thing as a good Brexit deal, which is why I believe we should advocate for Remain. That is what the overwhelming majority of Labour Party members, MPs and trade unions believe."" Mr Watson will said that, though ""very difficult"", he and many others ""respected the result of the 2016 referendum for a long time"". But, he added: ""There eventually comes a point when circumstances are so changed, when so much new information has emerged that we didn't have in 2016, when so many people feel differently to how they felt then, that you have to say, no... the only proper way to proceed in such circumstances is to consult the people again."" The Liberal Democrats, who pushed Labour into third place in May's European elections with a strident anti-Brexit message, are pushing for Brexit to be stopped in its tracks by revoking Article 50 - the legal process for the UK's departure.  While stopping short of calling for that himself, Mr Watson said it was not too late for Labour to ""win back"" Remain voters. ""My experience on the doorstep tells me most of those who've deserted us over our Brexit policy did so with deep regret and would greatly prefer to come back,"" he added. ""They just want us to take an unequivocal position that whatever happens we'll fight to remain, and to sound like we mean it."" Former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith said Mr Watson was speaking for ""the majority of Labour members and Labour voters"", and that the party ""should be clearing the Brexit issue off the table before we get to an election"". But another Labour MP, Gareth Snell - one of a group of MPs in the party wanting to bring back an amended version of Theresa May's original withdrawal agreement - said the ""numbers simply don't exist"" in Parliament to approve a further referendum.   He told Today: ""The public have no appetite for a second referendum. The doors I knock every week… [voters] are not telling me they want to go back to the divisive referendum [but] they want a decision on this process to be taken as soon as possible.""  Just 24 hours after Jeremy Corbyn hammered out a deal with the Labour-supporting unions, his deputy, Tom Watson, shattered any fragile unity. Mr Watson and many Labour activists want a clearer commitment to campaign on a Remain platform - especially during a snap election. So, apart from his own scepticism towards an EU that he believes needs reform, what is the thinking behind Jeremy Corbyn's position? Well, it comes down to four things - psephology, party unity, politics and personal authority. Read more from Iain. Unite's Len McCluskey dismissed Mr Watson's intervention, accusing him of ""undermining"" the leadership and suggesting his views ""don't really matter"".  The two men, who used to be close friends, fell out spectacularly in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum during an uprising by Labour MPs against Mr Corbyn's leadership.  The union leader suggested Mr Watson was ""languishing on the fringes"" of the party, adding: ""It's sad. Now and again Tom pops up from where he has been hiding and comes up with something… which is normally to try and undermine his leader."" The Conservatives said Mr Watson had made it clear he wanted to ""cancel"" the 2016 Brexit referendum result. Labour has voted twice against Boris Johnson's plans for a poll on 15 October.  The party's leadership has insisted it is eager for an election after the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been ruled out. "
risk appetite,Early cancer vaccine for Tanzanian girls,2024-09-15,2018-04-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43716260,"More than 600,000 girls in Tanzania have started receiving vaccines to prevent cervical cancer. Girls aged between nine and 14 are being targeted to protect them from developing the illness at an early age. ""Prevention is better than cure, elongating lives and and reducing treatment costs,"" said Dr Daphrosa Lyimo, heading the government rollout.  Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in Tanzania and kills more women than any other form of the illness. Tanzania is the seventh African country to introduce the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine into its routine immunisation programme, after Uganda, Rwanda, Botswana, Mauritius, Seychelles and South Africa. The health minister says $15 (£11) will be spent treating each girl. Cervical cancer is a cancer that develops in a woman's cervix - the entrance to the womb from the vagina.  It is one of more than 100 types of human papilloma virus (HPV), of which at least 13 are cancer-causing. Cervical cancer is caused by sexually acquired infection with certain types of HPV. Risk factors include early first sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners and tobacco use, and immune suppression (such as in HIV-infected individuals). Symptoms can include: Screening for the virus is recommended to detect it at an earlier stage. HPV vaccines are another preventative measure. Treatment for patients with cervical cancer depends on far the cancer has spread, but can include surgery to remove some or all of the womb, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Source: World Health Organization Tanzania's government hopes the early-stage vaccines will help reduce the bill for cervical cancer treatment, which typically costs about $2,000 (£1,410) per patient.  Low-cost doses of the HPV vaccine are being supplied to Tanzania by the Vaccine Alliance, Gavi. Poor countries are disproportionately affected by cervical cancer. According to Gavi, the five worst-affected countries are in Africa - Malawi, Mozambique, Comoros, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Globally, more than 260,000 women die of of the illness each year, with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 85% of all deaths. ""The majority of these deaths are preventable, thanks to a safe and effective vaccine,"" says Gavi CEO Dr Seth Berkley.  ""That's why we are working hard to ensure girls across Africa, from Tanzania to Senegal, have access to this lifesaver."""
risk appetite,What future for England?,2024-09-15,2018-06-07,By Mark Easton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44357001,"The saccharine aroma of reminiscence pervades many an English front parlour. As mantel clocks tick, the faces of England stare regretfully through net curtains, yearning for yesterday. Nostalgia, the old joke goes, ain't what it used to be. But in England it appears to be making a comeback, with half the country saying things were better in the past.   The large survey commissioned by the BBC to answer ""The English Question"" suggests that only one person in six believes the country's best years lie ahead, a finding in contrast to the rest of the UK, where a higher proportion of people are optimistic for the future than wish to turn the clock back. As well as wistfulness for former glories, the English also feel impotent to respond. Seven in 10 people say they feel they have very little or no influence over the decisions that affect their neighbourhood. The sense of powerlessness applies to decisions local and national.   Relating survey findings to local demographics, towns like Great Yarmouth, Hartlepool, Hull and Basildon emerge as places likely to feel particularly disconnected from decision-making. The Brexit battle cry of ""taking back control"" would have resonated in many similar communities. The survey results pose important questions about how to bridge the treacherous divide between people and power.    Many in England look enviously at the authority devolved to the other UK nations, complaining that English local government has been emasculated, as central government has become more distant. Only 13% of people think politicians in Westminster reflect their real concerns.    Prioritising England's affairs, even if that threatens the United Kingdom, is a policy supported by a quarter of English residents, according to our survey, a figure that appears to rise to a third in counties like Lincolnshire and towns like Rotherham and Wakefield. One proposal is that England should have its own parliament, an idea included in the UKIP manifesto at the last election. Roughly four people in 10 support the creation of such a body, rising to half the population in parts of Essex, for example.   But the survey suggests greater enthusiasm for a form of devolution that also enjoys broader political support (even if it draws blank looks from many), introducing combined authorities. Few dinner tables echo joyously to fevered debate about a new tier of public administration for England, so it is remarkable that, after a brief explanation of their function, our poll finds almost half the population (48%) support having a combined authority in their area. If one removes those who said they didn't know enough to comment, support rises to three quarters (73%).  And the places that are apparently most enthusiastic about combined authorities are the places that already have one. Greater Manchester pioneered the approach. Ten local town halls joined together to take on powers for their area previously run from Whitehall.  As Chancellor, George Osborne gave the new body his blessing and significant new control over health and social care budgets, transport strategy, economic development and more. It appears that, whatever their politics, many Greater Mancunians support their region taking more control over its destiny.  In Stockport, for example, 72% are in favour of having a combined authority, a figure that rises to 87% when you exclude a dwindling number of ""don't knows"". There are currently nine combined authorities operating in England outside London, and plans for more. Their secret, it seems to me, is in being created from the ground up rather than designed by some committee of Whitehall bureaucrats who know too little of local allegiances and rivalries.  The prospect of real additional control over the region's development encourages sometimes fractious councils to come together. The arguments are fierce, and sometimes irreconcilable, but the rewards are tangible. Critically, there is flexibility on design - in England one size definitely does not fit all.  Up to now there has been scepticism as to whether the voting public would embrace what some have dismissed as another layer of politicians. Our survey suggests the debate has moved on. Given a choice as to whether central, local or combined authority government should be in charge of certain services, a combined authority was the most popular for NHS provision, building a new railway and how the police force is run.    Substantial numbers also thought combined authorities should control housing provision, the number of foreign workers an area allows and the level of unemployment benefit applied in a region. It is still early days for these new bodies and one must be careful not to assume the public has got beyond the swiping right stage.  A lot will depend on the performance of the metro mayors who are a government pre-requisite for substantial devolution.   The two mayor Andys - Burnham in Greater Manchester (Labour) and Street in the West Midlands (Conservative) - are vitally important in demonstrating that what is effectively the return of regional government in England works to bridge the democratic deficit. The clear appetite for greater control probably explains the apparent popularity of these embryonic institutions, but they must patently deliver or risk being mortally wounded by political infighting or strangled by public cynicism. England feels a discomforted place at the moment, riven over its relationship with the wider world, with its European neighbours and even the other nations in the Union.   Optimism is in short supply and a beguiling nostalgia threatens to turn into resentment or bitterness.  Instead of listening to the mantel clock ticking, reminiscing for a lost age, England needs to find a way to reconnect with its citizenry."
risk appetite,Weight-loss jab recommended on NHS,2024-09-15,2022-02-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-60300916,"Adults struggling with their weight could soon be offered a weekly injection to help shed unhealthy fat.  The treatment, semaglutide, branded Wegovy, makes people feel fuller, so they eat less, and not as hungry.  In trials, used alongside a healthy diet and exercise, it helped obese people lose a 10th of their body weight - about two stone (13kg) on average. And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is recommending it should be made available on the NHS.  NICE's draft guidelines for England and Wales, not yet fully approved, say it should be prescribed: People would inject themselves, using pre-filled pens.  Obese people should speak to their GP about losing weight safely.  Some manage it through diet and exercise alone.  Other available treatments include: Obesity affects about one in four adults in the UK and increases the risk of other serious health conditions.  In 2018-19, 11,117 hospital admissions in England were directly attributable to obesity. Helen Knight, from NICE, said: ""We know that management of overweight and obesity is one of the biggest challenges our health service is facing.  ""It is a lifelong condition that needs medical intervention, has psychological and physical effects, and can affect quality of life."""
risk appetite,Cyber-security chiefs warn of malicious app risk,2024-09-15,2022-05-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61323395,"A new report by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned of the threats posed by malicious apps. While most people will be familiar with apps downloaded on to smartphones, devices from smart TVs to smart speakers now also have them. The government is consulting on new guidelines on security and privacy for apps and app stores.  The NCSC's technical director, Ian Levy, said there was ""more for app stores to do"" on security. Mr Levy added that cyber-criminals were ""currently using weaknesses in app stores on all types of connected devices to cause harm"". Last year, the government noted, Android phone users downloaded apps which contained the Triada and Escobar malware from various third-party app stores. ""This resulted in cyber-criminals remotely taking control of people's phones and stealing their data and money by signing them up for premium subscription services,"" it said. The NCSC's report noted that apps ""can also be installed on laptops, computers, games consoles, wearable devices (such as smartwatches or fitness trackers), smart TVs, smart speakers (such as Alexa devices), and IoT (internet of things) devices"". It includes an example of a security company demonstrating how it could create a malicious app for a popular tracker from a fitness firm, that could be downloaded from a link using the company's web address to seem legitimate. The app contained ""spyware/stalkerware capable of stealing everything from location and personal body data"". The company moved to fix the problem after the security firm alerted it. The NCSC report noted that the appetite for apps had grown during the pandemic, with the UK app market now worth £18.6bn ($23.2bn). The cyber-security centre supports the government's proposals to ask app stores to commit to a new code of practice setting out minimum security and privacy requirements.  ""Developers and store operators making apps available to UK users would be covered. This includes Apple, Google, Amazon, Huawei, Microsoft and Samsung,"" the government said.  A proposed code of practice would require stores to set up processes so that security flaws can be found and fixed more quickly."

In a highly critical intervention, Adam Price said the party had resorted to ""predictable, plodding politics"". Mr Price - urged by his local party activists to mount a challenge - said a male/female co-leadership was needed if Plaid was to win the 2021 election. Ms Wood has said she will stand down if she does not become first minister at the next assembly election. Under Plaid rules a window to challenge for the leadership comes around every two years, with assembly members having until Wednesday to step forwards to fight for the role. Ms Wood has not faced a challenge since being elected leader in 2012, but in a damning article in the Western Mail on Monday, Mr Price slates the party's progress and strategy on independence, saying change is needed ""badly"" and ""fast"". But claims by Carmarthen East and Dinefwr AM Mr Price that Plaid Cymru has lost 1,000 members in eight months were denied by the party. Another possible contender, Ynys Mon AM Rhun ap Iorwerth, has said he is considering whether to stand. Mr Price says simply ousting Ms Wood would ""leave a toxic residue of bitterness and recrimination"" and instead sets out plans which would see Ms Wood stay in power, while sharing the role with a man. ""I have to say it's my view, and I believe that of many others in this great party, that we have generally failed to consistently articulate a comprehensive and compelling vision of the future,"" he writes. ""Our comfort zone has been a strange mixture of philosophical abstraction and the predictable, plodding politics of the parsimonious press release, the tired tweet and the formulaic Facebook status. ""Nowhere has this shallowness been more exposed than on the question of independence, our very raison d'être, where our failure to present a clear and persuasive exposition explains why we have lost more than a thousand of our eight thousand members in the last eight months. ""Pressing the reset button for our party has to start now; and it comes with the hard but vital work of developing a creative and credible body of ideas that will excite the interest and inspire the confidence of the people of Wales.""  Mr Price writes that having a man and a woman jointly leading the party would give Plaid a ""radical and powerful leadership that will avoid the traditional vulnerabilities of placing power in a single pair of hands"". ""In our own party, co-leadership would allow us to embrace all viewpoints, to harness all drive and commitment for the widest political progress possible,"" he adds. But Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said co-leadership had been tried before in Plaid and had been ""disastrous"". ""Either back Leanne to lead or challenge her. There's no easy route to the top,"" he tweeted. Alun Lenny, a Plaid councillor in Carmarthenshire who has urged Mr Price to mount a challenge, told BBC Radio Wales he could not see why the party could not harness ""the considerable talents we have"" by having two leaders. Speaking on Good Morning Wales, Mr Lenny said he voted for Ms Wood in the 2012 leadership contest, but added: ""At best we are flat-lining,"" The greatest risk is that today's intervention leaves many questions unanswered at a time when Plaid desperately needs stability. Does Adam Price really want to share the job with Leanne Wood? What if Ms Wood rejects the offer and Adam Price wins a leadership election only for party members to reject co-leadership?  None of this detail has been thought through. More from Aled Also writing in the Western Mail on Monday, Mr ap Iorwerth said: ""I'm on the record saying I'm considering my response to Leanne's invitation for a debate on the leadership.  ""What that means in reality is that I'm speaking to as many people as possible about how best to take Plaid Cymru forward. We're in this for Wales, not ourselves."" BBC Wales understands Mr Price would be willing to see MPs as well as AMs stand for election as co-leader, subject to a change in party rules. It is understood that Mr Price wants Ms Wood to commit to his proposal at an assembly group meeting on Tuesday. Plaid Cymru chief executive Gareth Clubb said the party did not recognise the membership figures quoted by Adam Price. ""Our membership is currently growing and we are confident that it will continue to do so,"" he said. The party said it had around 8,000 members in April - Mr Price suggested the figure was 1,000 fewer. A spokesman for Mr Price said he stood by his figures.   On the call for co-leadership, a spokesperson for Ms Wood said: ""All proposals will be considered and will follow the appropriate procedures.  ""I am sure all of us are determined to ensure that we continue to work in the most open and democratic manner possible."" There has been mounting appetite within the party for a leadership challenge, with former Plaid leader in Westminster Elfyn Llwyd calling for a change in direction for the party and local constituency parties calling on both Mr Price and Mr ap Iorwerth to stand. Three other Plaid AMs - Llyr Gruffydd, Sian Gwenllian and Elin Jones - have signed a letter calling for a competition. On Saturday 53 councillors from across Wales - who make up about a quarter of Plaid's councillors - pledged their support to Ms Wood to continue as leader. Ms Wood has previously said she would welcome a leadership challenge.  Sam Smethers, chief executive of women's rights charity the Fawcett Society, said: ""The under-representation of men in our politics is not the problem.  ""But we do support job-sharing of MP and leadership roles. It is good to see that Adam Price does too."""
risk appetite,The battle over a whale's brutal death,2024-09-15,2021-01-31,By Flora Drury,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55714815,"A video showing the final, brutal 20 minutes of a minke whale's life at the hands of Japanese fishermen sent a ripple of shock through international media. But activists says the footage of the whale being slowly drowned, after becoming trapped in their nets, has merely highlighted an entirely legal loophole which is used to kill dozens of whales each year. ""This is neither an exceptional nor unexpected occurrence,"" Mark Simmonds, senior marine scientist at Humane Society International (HSI), said in a release after the whale's death.  ""But what is exceptional is that this whole process was witnessed and filmed for the world to see."" Indeed, the young mammal's death once again has exposed the gaping chasm between Japan and the wider world when it comes to whale hunting: activists see a cruel and avoidable death, but the fishermen see a gift from the sea. Warning: Upsetting content Japan - like a number of other nations around the world - has a centuries-long tradition of whale hunting. After the Second World War, as the country struggled to feed its population, whale meat became a staple of the Japanese table.  But for those who support whale hunting, it goes further than simply food on the plate: it is a source of national pride. Yet for more than 30 years, fishermen were not allowed to hunt whales off the coast of Japan. The country had signed up to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) following a decades of overfishing which had pushed whale populations to the brink of extinction. In July 2019, the whaling boats set off once more, despite demand for the meat having dropped. Supporters spoke to the BBC at the time of their relief that ""the culture and way of life will be passed on to the next generation"". This time, there were strict quotas in place, allowing for responsible hunting. The first year, the quota allowed for some 52 minke, which are not endangered, as well as 150 Bryde's and 25 sei whales, to be caught over the course of the season - a total of 227. In 2020 and 2021, that total rose to 383.  The numbers are split between the official whalers, the government and a third category, known as ""by-catch"". This year, 37 whales can be butchered and sold by fisherman under this heading.  The minke whose death was caught on camera was one of the 37 considered ""by-catch"" - a whale which no one set out to catch, but which just happened to swim into the wrong place, at the wrong time. Ren Yabuki, the head of Japanese animal rights NGO Life Investigation Agency (LIA), first spotted the whale trapped in the permanent net off Taiji - the same town made famous for its annual dolphin hunt in The Cove - on 24 December. Initially, he hoped the fishermen would raise the nets and release the whale. He watched as ""one guy tried for 10 minutes"".  ""But they stopped trying,"" he recalls. He suspected the fishermen ""did not want to open the net because inside there were too many fish"".  Over the course of the next 20 days, he lobbied the association which owns the net to work to release the whale. He also began to upload the videos his drone filmed each day, allowing people around the world to watch as the whale became more desperate, at times attacking the net, at times just spinning in the confined space. The whale's plight began to make headlines in other parts of the world. More and more people became invested in the whale's release. But then, on 11 January, he watched helplessly as two boats manoeuvred the whale so it was trapped between them. He then watched as they caught and held the whale's thrashing tail, forcing its head underwater for 20 minutes, until it finally drowned.  By this time, the boat was already covered in the whale's blood, lost as it injured itself trying to get free. Days after the minke's death, undercover footage recorded neatly packaged whale meat, priced at 398 yen ($3.80; £2.77) per 100g, in the local supermarket. Of course, it may not have been the whale which died off Taiji. For supporters of whale hunting, there was nothing amiss with what the drone captured that day. ""A number of Japanese people feel sympathy to such [an] animal... trapped in a set net and wish it [to] be released, if possible,"" acknowledged Hideki Moronuki, director for fisheries negotiations at the Fisheries Agency, in an email to the BBC.  ""However, at the same time, there are many people who consider that such an animal is a bounty from the ocean and has to be fully used with a great gratitude."" For the fishermen, the whale getting trapped in the net was a bonus. Under usual circumstances, they don't have the right licence to catch and sell whales. But this, say activists, is where the quota system falls down, as it disincentives fishermen from releasing the mammals. Mr Simmonds, of the HSI, suggests it goes further than that even.  ""The term 'bycatch' relates to accidental or incidental capture of non-target animals in all fishing operations,"" he tells the BBC. ""The capture of whales in traps in Japan is not bycatch."" In fact, he argues that catches like this are both ""predictable and deliberate"".  But just because they end up in the net doesn't mean they will be killed.  In this net alone three whales have been caught in six weeks, including the minke. The first, another minke whale caught in late November, was released the next day. The third, a humpback whale, was found dead floating tangled in the nets the day after the second minke was killed.  Taiji Fisheries Association has argued that it was left with no choice but to kill the second whale. ""The tide is fast and it is difficult to let go of the whale,"" it said in a statement at the time. And Mr Moronuki, director for fisheries negotiations at the Fisheries Agency, adds in his email that there was no other way to kill the animal when they finally decided to act. ""When it was decided to kill the animal the sea condition was too harsh to take other killing method,"" he wrote in his email. ""I believe that, for those reasons, most of Japanese people considered that a sole realistic and pragmatic method had been chosen and did not take any emotional nor commotional action."" But for Mr Yabuki and Mr Simmonds, it is the brutality of the animals death which lingers on. ""My hand was shaking with upset - it was so, so sad. I had so much anger,"" Mr Yabuki told the BBC. ""I want to rescue the whale, to release. But I could not."" ""Forcing underwater the head of a mammal evolved to hold its breath for long periods, so that it slowly runs out of oxygen, is an acutely cruel killing method by any standards,"" Mr Simmonds added. Activists hope that videos like the one of the minke's death will inspire change in Japan. But there is little will from the government to roll back on a policy which has proved popular among Japan's fishing communities, meaning this video is unlikely to be the last one the world sees."
risk appetite,Is football's racism battle being lost?,2024-09-15,2021-02-01,Dan Roan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55887106,"Manchester United and Sheffield United players kneeling before their recent Premier League game at Old Trafford - Manchester United pair Axel Tuanzebe and Antony Martial received racist abuse following the match When it comes to online racist abuse, football appears to have had enough. Again.  Last week's series of incidents provoked a wave of condemnation from across the game and beyond.  And yet, this comes almost two years after top stars took part in a campaign called '#Enough', a 24-hour social media boycott in protest at a similar spate of abuse. Now the same demands for tech platforms to do more are being made. So is the battle being lost? Why is it proving so difficult to tackle this issue? And where is this crisis heading? Duke of Cambridge calls for racist abuse of footballers to stop Chelsea 'disgusted' after Reece James racially abused on social media Arrest over racist abuse of West Brom player Sawyers Racist abuse sent to Manchester United pair Tuanzebe and Martial The pressure on the social media platforms is intensifying. The appetite for more regulation is growing.  Last week the Premier League said the tech companies ""need to do more"", calling for ""swifter removal of offensive messages and improved identification and banning of offenders"". Manchester United, with three of their squad subject to vile messages, urged the creation of verifiable and identifiable accounts so offenders could be caught, saying they and the players were ""sick of it"", making the point that no one should face such hate-filled abuse in their place of work. The Duke of Cambridge, who is also the president of the Football Association, wants social media companies to take more responsibility The Duke of Cambridge, who is also the president of the Football Association, has praised those who have spoken out and called for an end to the ""despicable"" abuse. Writing on Twitter, Prince William also cited the need for social media companies to raise their game. ""We all have a responsibility to create an environment where such abuse is not tolerated, and those who choose to spread hate and division are held accountable for their actions. That responsibility extends to the platforms where so much of this activity now takes place,"" he said. The Professional Footballers' Association, which represents players, has asked the tech giants to prevent users from being able to send explicitly racist terms and emojis. ""While racist abuse is allowed to continue on each platform, we can only conclude that this is a choice by the companies running the social networks,"" it said. Putting such criticism to the platforms is no easy task. We asked for an interview with Twitter on this subject back in 2019. We are still waiting for one. Our request last week for an interview with Facebook - the owner of Instagram - was met with a short statement saying: ""There is no place for racism on Instagram and we are committed to removing it when we find it. We know there is more to do and we will continue to work closely with clubs, players and football authorities to investigate instances of discrimination and collectively tackle this issue."" Twitter too issued a statement: ""Racist behaviour has no place on our service and when we identify accounts that violate any of the Twitter Rules, we take enforcement action. ""We have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our valued partners in football to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour - both online and offline."" This video can not be played 'Social media companies not vigilant enough' - Wright and Jenas react after Rashford is subject of racist abuse The government meanwhile has vowed to press on with plans for ""groundbreaking"" new online harms legislation later this year to make tech companies legally responsible for the online safety of their users, and make them accountable to a regulator - Ofcom, external - over abusive content. Racist messages would need to be removed ""without delay"". The proposals include the threat of massive fines of up to 10% of global turnover if the companies fail to meet their obligations, and there could even be criminal sanctions for senior executives.  Behind the scenes, I am told that while football authorities were encouraged by the recent meeting that Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden hosted with players to discuss online abuse, there is concern at how long it is taking to introduce new laws considered long overdue, and fears they may be watered down if the hugely powerful, US-based tech companies have their way and threaten to invest elsewhere.   But according to Kick It Out, external chief executive Sanjay Bhandari, the legislation - along with the promise of more regulation in the US from President Joe Biden - are grounds for optimism.  ""The cavalry is on the way,"" the head of the anti-discrimination body told the BBC. ""That's the hope on the horizon, but that may not come quickly enough so there's things we need social media to do right now. The behavioural, cultural problems will take longer to solve. It's the technology problem we can do more quickly and all of the answers sit with Twitter and Facebook. Technology has been massively unregulated for 25 years and its time we closed that loophole."" Marcus Rashford played in Manchester United's 0-0 draw at Arsenal on Saturday Some at the Premier League - which launched a dedicated, 'rapid-response' reporting system for players last year - say the social media platforms have improved in recent years, but not enough. There has been success with the removal of posts but officials want more effort to assist the authorities to find perpetrators so they can be banned by clubs (if they are a fan) or even prosecuted. While there have been some successful prosecutions - an Irish teenager is due to be sentenced on Wednesday for sending racist abuse to former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright - these are few and far between when the sheer scale of the abuse is considered.  One insider said league officials felt hampered by what they called impregnable and unresponsive tech companies using privacy, freedom of speech and the sheer weight of traffic as reasons for not handing over information that would help identify offenders. The fear is that the police - without the resources to pursue every possible crime - only intervene in the most serious cases, and abusers know they face little risk of sanctions. Court orders need to be obtained to force the platform to co-operate, evidence has to be gathered, and often offenders are overseas in different jurisdictions.  Another challenge is persuading players to take legal action, which can often seem a daunting prospect. A man was arrested following alleged racial abuse of West Bromwich Albion midfielder Romaine Sawyers While admitting there is ""more to do"", Facebook does point to the fact that it is working with Kick It Out on a fans' education and reporting initiative, and has built tools designed to prevent unwanted contact on Instagram. It has also tripled the size of its safety team to 35,000 people, claiming it proactively took action on tens of million of pieces of hate speech last year. But considering the vast wealth of these companies, many believe more should be invested. The tech companies argue that tackling this problem is not as straightforward as many assume. They have other areas of concern that must also be monitored across their vast, unregulated platforms; from suspected terrorism and paedophilia to the spread of misinformation.  Simply blocking certain discriminatory words or emojis from being used in the first place is problematic, because these can also be used in a non-offensive context, and across global platforms can have different meanings in different communities or territories. The companies can block devices for repeat offenders, but that person can then just use a different device. Many are now calling for an end to the anonymity that provides a shield to many abusers with a mandatory verification process that means users must give passport details for instance before opening an account. Given the mistrust over social media platforms' use of personal data however, there are fears that this could pose a threat to activists, whistleblowers and persecuted minorities who need to protect their identity online. Many also point out that in recent years, racially offensive comments have been published on social media by fully verified accounts.  Axel Tuanzebe (left) and Anthony Martial (centre) received racist abuse after featuring in a Manchester United defeat There are also those who believe that the time has come for football's authorities and clubs to invest more, and take the burden of reporting away from the players.  ""The problem is that the systems that they've got in place require a player to receive and then report the abuse themselves, and by that point the damage has already been done,"" according to Jonathan Hirshler, the CEO of Signify, a data science company that uses artificial intelligence to uncover the identities of abusers. ""The technology is there, using AI and open source data, to unmask vile and prolific abusers.  ""It's also important that football moves from reactive to proactive, to pick up abuse before the players have to, and package evidence in a way that the social platforms and authorities have little choice but to act on. So we need a new approach, working constructively with the platforms, to ensure that abusers have nowhere to hide."" There is no time to waste. During just the final six weeks of last season, a joint PFA and Signify study identified more than 3,000 explicitly abusive messages aimed at Premier League players, 56% of which were racist. Of the players surveyed, 43% said they had experienced targeted racist abuse.  Football has become a lightning-rod for a wider, societal issue. The scale of the challenge facing the sport is significant, and seems to be getting worse. Finding a solution however, is proving far from simple."
risk appetite,'The souls of our daughters are still there',2024-09-15,2021-08-08,By Mira Galanova,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58076664,"Vianney Hernández remembers how powerless she felt on the day in December 2016 when a gang came to take away her 13-year-old daughter Ashly.  Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of injuries and strong language. Its leader, who was in a relationship with Ashly, threatened to kill the entire family if she did not let Ashly go live with him.  Ashly had met the boy at school in a poor neighbourhood of Guatemala City where they lived. ""He was handsome, a bit older than her,"" Ms Hernández recalls, adding that her daughter was rebellious and with an appetite for adventure.  Vianney was determined to wrest Ashly from the hands of the gang. She told the police, and after they found Ashly, Vianney sent her to a state-run home for at-risk children so she would be far away from the boy and his gang.  Ashly had been to the home once before and Vianney knew that the rosy picture officials painted of the Virgen de la Asunción home in San José Pinula was far from the truth.  Before Ashly's first stint in the home, Vianney had been told that her daughter would get food, clothes, an education and psychological care. Instead, ""supervisors would send older girls to beat Ashly up and when she resisted, they would punish her,"" Vianney recalls. The home was overcrowded and dirty, and the food was often spoiled. But with the gang unlikely to leave Ashly in peace, Vianney thought that sending her daughter back to the Virgen de la Asunción home would be the lesser of two evils.  Otherwise, ""one day I would find her dismembered body on my doorstep"", Vianney says of her fears at the time. Like Vianney, many families sent their children to the home with the best of intentions, unaware of the criticism it had come under from organisations in Guatemala and abroad, including the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Some parents suspected that something was amiss at the home but did not know the full extent of the abuse.  Sixteen-year-old Mirsa was one of the girls too frightened to speak out.  ""She never told me what went on there,"" her mother Roxana Tojil recalls. ""Once she said: 'I can't tell you anything, because they would beat me, lock me up in a dark room or leave me without food'."" Mirsa had been sent to the home by a judge after she escaped from the gang which had tried to forcibly recruited her. The judge reckoned she would be safer there than in the gang-controlled neighbourhoods of Guatemala City. Too afraid to tell their parents of the conditions in the home, Mirsa, Ashly and others hatched a plan. On 7 March 2017, they were among about a hundred children who escaped from the home.  But it did not take long for the police to track them down and return them to Virgen de la Asunción, where 56 of the girls were locked up in a classroom designed to hold 26 people. An investigation later revealed that the girls were not even allowed to leave the room to go to the toilet. If they wanted to relieve themselves, they had to do so in a corner. In the morning, they were given breakfast in the same filthy room. Desperate to get out, one of the girls lit a match. The flames quickly spread. The girls banged on the door in panic, but for nine minutes it remained locked.  ""Let those sluts burn, let's see if they can escape again,"" the police officer holding the key said according to the testimony given by her subordinate officers.   Forty-one girls died, 15 others suffered life-changing injuries. Roxana Tojil rushed to the hospital. ""All the girls looked alike: bandaged, their skin carbonized. One was without lips and nose. Another one screamed: 'Throw water on me!' I saw them closing their eyes and dying."" Eventually Roxana found Mirsa. She was in the morgue, dead. Ashly was also in the morgue but Vianney refused to view her daughter's burned body.  ""I wanted to keep her beautiful in my heart, not how the State had returned her to me,"" Vianney says.  At the funeral, Vianney hugged the coffin. ""I vowed that her death would not go unpunished,"" she recalls.  Twelve public officials are on trial, facing charges ranging from manslaughter to abuse of authority, but the victims' families say that the legal proceedings have been slow and frustrating.  Hearings were repeatedly suspended even before the Covid pandemic struck.  The judge in the case told the BBC that the reasons for the delays varied, including appeals being lodged by both parties, the temporary absence of a defence lawyer and a general work overload which meant that sometimes hearings for different cases were scheduled for the same time, resulting in the judge having to cancel one. Vianney says she is livid that only three of the defendants are in pretrial detention with the remaining nine able to enjoy the comforts of their own homes after having been placed under house arrest. Meanwhile, she is struggling to find a job flexible enough to allow her to attend court. The hearings have been painful for the mothers as the defence has tried to shift the blame for the deaths onto the girls, arguing that the students started the fire.  The mothers themselves have also been criticised, with some in Guatemala questioning why they would have sent their daughters to such a home in the first place.  Vianney wants to know what exactly went on at the home - not just in the run-up to the fire but in the years preceding it, after allegations of human trafficking surfaced.  She is also fighting for the evidence of the fire to be preserved. On 14 June she petitioned a judge to stop the classroom where the fire happened from re-opening, which would have compromised any evidence inside the room.  ""The souls of our daughters are still there, calling for justice,"" she says, her voice breaking."
risk appetite,Rugby League World Cup postponed until 2022,2024-09-15,2021-08-04,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/57630566,"Australia beat England in Brisbane to win the 2017 men's Rugby League World Cup This year's Rugby League World Cup in England has been postponed until 2022 after the withdrawal of champions Australia, and New Zealand. The two countries pulled out of the tournament citing ""player welfare and safety concerns"" related to Covid-19. The World Cup, featuring men's, women's and wheelchair events, was set to start in Newcastle on 23 October. ""It became unfeasible and irresponsible for us to carry on,"" said Jon Dutton, chief executive of the tournament. ""I think it will take some time for international rugby league to recover from this. I hope we can be a beacon of light.  ""Certainly we've prioritised player voice and player choice, we know the players want to play, we took our responsibilities very seriously, and we are determined to stage the biggest and best ever rugby league World Cup.  ""It's a real shame that it cannot be this year but leadership is about making tough decisions, it's about being responsible, and we've done this in the best interests of not just the tournament but of the sport of rugby league."" Listen: BBC Radio 5 Live Rugby League Podcast Australia and NZ World Cup withdrawal 'premature' Super League Show - watch and catch-up here Organisers were given only four minutes' notice that the antipodean neighbours intended to pull out on 22 July, with Rugby Football League (RFL) chairman Simon Johnson calling it a ""selfish, parochial and cowardly decision"". Dutton last week gave it a ""50-50"" chance of going ahead as scheduled this year after discussions with the board and numerous stakeholders, including players. ""There's been some really disappointing behaviour,"" added Dutton when asked about whether Australia, New Zealand and the NRL had called the shots. ""We can't end up in this position again and we'll make sure we don't."" Delaying the World Cup by a year could mean it clashes with the football equivalent in 2022, but Dutton said a window will be found to avoid such a scenario. ""I am disappointed that we've needed to take the decision to delay the Rugby League World Cup,"" said Sport Minister Nigel Huddleston. ""Despite working tirelessly to explore solutions that would allow us to go ahead as planned, circumstances beyond our control have meant that postponing the Rugby League World Cup until next year is the strongest option for staging a successful tournament."" The Rugby League Players Association (RLPA) said it acknowledged ""the extremely difficult decision"" to delay the World Cup and the ""tremendous effort of the RLWC board, Jon Dutton, and the entire team to maintain the tournament's viability up to this point"". ""We have worked exceptionally close with the RLWC team to date and want to thank them for engaging in such a collaborative process which has allowed the players to feel respected and valued throughout the RLWC planning,"" said RLPA chief executive officer Clint Newton. Fresh Covid outbreaks in Australia have forced most states to reimpose restrictions, while the majority of coronavirus restrictions in England have been lifted despite a rise in cases - although those numbers appear to be falling. There were concerns about players and staff having to quarantine for 14 days on their return to Australia, with the country's borders currently closed because of the pandemic. Rugby league officials estimate about 400-500 players, staff and team officials from Australia's National Rugby League - representing several different countries - would be impacted by any quarantine measures on their return to the country after the tournament. Those measures would mean players would only return to their NRL clubs two weeks before trial games for the 2022 season begin. The number of those who would be affected is significantly higher when the women's and wheelchair events are taken into consideration. Outbreaks emerge across Australia in 'new phase' of pandemic The postponement will be a major blow to English rugby league, a sport that has been hit hard by the financial fallout of the pandemic. The UK government has provided rugby league with more than £32m in loan support in the past year. Australia, as 11-time and defending men's champions, were favourites to win the tournament in England, while 2008 winners New Zealand were again poised to be contenders. The event, regarded as one of the most inclusive sports events ever hosted in Britain, was to be staged across 16 towns and cities across England. St James' Park, home of Premier League football side Newcastle United, was scheduled to host the opening game between England and Samoa. Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium was to host the men's and women's finals in a back-to-back spectacle on 27 November. BBC rugby league correspondent Dave Woods Australia's NRL clubs have got their way. The postponement seemed inevitable once they decided, through the voice piece of the Australian Rugby League Commission, that they didn't want to allow their players to compete in a World Cup in England this year. Covid is only the broad issue.  The risk of players being exposed to the virus in this country is a valid concern, despite the RLWC2021 organisers bending over backwards to ensure that protocols would have been in place to keep the tournament as safe as possible. But at the heart of this is that those NRL clubs have only self-interest. They want to protect their own domestic competition going into the 2022 season, rather than seeing the bigger picture of what a World Cup could do for the international profile of the game. It's to be hoped they will prove honourable when they say they will support a rearranged Rugby League World Cup.  With the number of Covid cases in Australia not yet reaching the numbers seen in other countries, and with their vaccine roll out programme a long way behind schedule, it's hard to gauge how badly the pandemic will hit that country in 2022. And indeed, whether a dramatic spike in cases over the next few months will again lessen their appetite to send players abroad. In the meantime, some more incredibly hard work begins for the Rugby League World Cup organisers. Stadiums will have to be rebooked. Cities and towns where the Men's, Women's and Wheelchair teams were going to be based will have to be re-primed in readiness for the delayed event. Broadcasters will have to reschedule. This year's tournament had been over four years in the planning up to this point. Now they have to do a lot of the work again, but this time with less than 14 months to go. Finances will be stretched because budgets were only due to run up to the end of November of this year and the government will be called upon to add to the £25m that it's already invested into the tournament. But in the circumstances of the last few weeks, and the stance of the NRL clubs, Jon Dutton, the RLWC2021 chief executive and his board of directors, had little option but to call a halt to their desperate hard work to get the tournament on as planned.

On Thursday, tournament chief executive Jon Dutton said there was a ""50-50"" chance it would be staged this year. Australia and New Zealand have pulled out of the event, citing ""player welfare and safety concerns"" related to Covid-19 - a stance backed by the NRL. A decision on whether the tournament will begin as planed on 23 October is expected in days. ""The 16 clubs are united that it is in best interests of player health, safety, wellbeing and the international game for the World Cup not to proceed in 2021,"" the NRL said in a statement. ""The support not to play is based on the high Covid-19 infection rate in the United Kingdom and onerous biosecurity and quarantine protocols that would be placed on all players having just completed a lengthy period away from home during the NRL Telstra Premiership. ""The 16 clubs support the World Cup being delayed until 2022 where it is expected there will be less risk to player health and safety and a stronger competition."" Melbourne Storm and Queensland prop forward Christian Welch, who is also a director of the Rugby League Players' Association, says players were not consulted before reigning champions Australia, the 11-time winners, and New Zealand, who lifted the trophy in 2008, withdrew last week. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Dutton says their withdrawal is ""irreversible"". Following an emergency meeting of the event's board on Wednesday, Dutton said it will explore what appetite there is to go ahead as planned with the contest, which is scheduled to start on 23 October. Dutton also told BBC Sport that ""time is no longer on our side"" and a final decision about the staging of the tournament, which includes men's, women's and wheelchair competitions, will come ""in days, not weeks""."
risk appetite,What's changed as Super League returns?,2024-09-15,2020-08-01,Dave Woods,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/53607897,"Castleford were convincing winners over St Helens before the Super League season was suspended When the season was suspended because of coronavirus on 15 March, after Castleford's 28-14 win over St Helens, the Super League campaign was intriguingly poised. Saints, last year's champions but now under new coach Kristian Woolf, had lost half of their opening fixtures.  Leeds were smashed by Hull on the opening day of the new campaign, but then strung together four back-to-back wins to suggest they are back in the race for silverware after a couple of lean years.  Wigan and Castleford were showing good early form. And Huddersfield were probably causing the biggest stir, a heavy home defeat by Wigan their only blot on an otherwise eye-catching start with playmaker Aiden Sezer making an early bid for 'signing of the year'. Hull FC had also sacked two-times Challenge Cup-winning coach Lee Radford just days before lockdown. But the season had hardly settled into any telling or set patterns, and when it restarts there will be a real scramble to get off the new starting grid as quickly as possible.  The newly-structured competition means the race is on to make the top four at the end of the regular campaign to stand a chance of playing in November's Grand Final.  As it stands, there are only six points between joint-leaders Wigan, Castleford and Huddersfield and bottom club Hull Kingston Rovers. And, while Hull have played seven games, Leeds and Catalans have only played four and everyone else has played either five or six fixtures. So it is all up for grabs and it will be a few weeks before the obvious runners and riders become clear. Not even the presence of Sonny Bill Williams could prevent Toronto losing all six of their Super League games Toronto Wolfpack made big noises when they arrived in Super League at the start of the season, not least with the signing of world superstar Sonny Bill Williams. The first-ever transatlantic side in British sport was clearly set on making many more headlines. But they have been of the wrong kind. They lost their opening six Super League matches - all played in England - had begun to accumulate a worrying number of injuries and looked on course for a relegation battle.  Their possible salvation came from the fact that still had to enjoy home advantage back in Canada in front of promised big crowds. But Covid-19 has done for them - for this year, anyway. In pulling out of the 2020 campaign they have cited financial problems that no other Super League club has had to face.  Unable to furlough players, unable to access the £16m government loan given to the British game, unable to take a share of the central TV funding, and unable to draw much more from owner David Argyle's dwindling liquid assets, they decided they were unable to carry on for the time being and have been mothballed. Whether they come straight back into Super League next year, or are forced to drop down into the Championship or even League One, has still to be decided. But the noises from the club are that they will be back, in one form or another. There will be no scrums when Super League resumes on Sunday Oh yes, some significant rule changes. For the time being scrums have been axed. It is part of trying to make the playing environment as safe as possible and reduce the risk of any potential spread of the Covid-19 virus. But removing scrums will change the dynamic of the game. No longer will six players from each side congregate for a few seconds in close proximity and give rise to a different potential for attack for the side winning the ball. Instead, it will be a tap restart for the team that would have had the feed - although there will be a few seconds' delay, signified by in-stadium shot-clocks, before they are allowed to tap and go.  How that plays out remains to be seen. Will the sport look a little two dimensional as a result? And if it is judged to be a positive change, might it lead to the push for a demise of scrums altogether? The other significant change is the so-called 'six again' rule, which was introduced in Australia's National Rugby League when they started after lockdown mid-season as pressure grew to make the game more entertaining. Saints coach Woolf expects 'six again' to thrive Under the 'six again' rule, any offence in the tackle other than foul play - such as lying on in the tackle or interfering at the play-the-ball - would lead to the referee resetting the six tackle count back to zero, rather than giving a penalty. In Australia the rule has been widely acclaimed as a success, making the game quicker, helping tire out some of the bigger players and opening up more possibilities for dummy-half runners and game-breakers. Again it will be interesting to see how the rule plays out here. Will it lead to some big blow outs? Will teams with quick dummy-halves simply milk the advantage with some metronomic charges out from behind the ruck? Or will we see the skilful sixes and sevens given more chance to stamp their class on games with the ball moving wider earlier? There is a Covid-19 element to introducing the 'six again' rule because it theoretically leads to less contact time in the tackle. But it's the expectation of extra fun that it possibly brings to the game that is behind it being introduced so soon. London Broncos were relegated from Super League on the final night of last season after losing at Wakefield No-one will be relegated this year, and that could be a great relief to a clutch of clubs who may find themselves in danger of finishing bottom in a potentially tight table come the end of the season. The Super League clubs lobbied for relegation to be voided in 2020, given the disruption to the fixture list and the imbalance created by having to play at least some matches at neutral venues behind closed doors. The Rugby Football League agreed and, given that the Championship will not be returning in a recognisable form this year, has also said there will be no promotion either. So clubs can now play without any pressure. That might give coaches of clubs near the bottom the chance to blood a few younger players. With the tensions of livelihoods-at-stake being lifted we may see some more entertaining, free-flowing games. There will be those that will miss the cut and thrust of the annual relegation dog-fights. But I think we can forgive the owners, coaches and players for lacking the appetite to fight for survival, when a more existential fight for survival has been going on since March. It has been a long lay-off, a shorter than normal pre-season for players to prepare for the 'new' campaign and there will be a fear of an increased number of injuries as a result, especially given how crowded the fixture list begins to look by September and October. But, for the moment, there is just a game-wide relief that Super League is back.  Everyone will be hoping that the fans will be back as well before long."
risk appetite,Apathy or anxiety - why are fewer England fans going to Russia?,2024-09-15,2018-04-18,Mantej Mann,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43688549,"England begin their 2018 World Cup campaign against Tunisia in Volgograd Still interested in going to the World Cup in Russia this summer? The latest ticket sales phase opened on Wednesday and figures so far show the appetite among England fans is not what it was four years ago. With 30,711 tickets allocated so far, England fans are only the 11th most numerous of those making the trip from other countries. During the second sales window which closed on 3 April, there were more tickets taken up by fans from China and India, neither represented at the finals, than from England. By February 2014, 51,222 tickets had already been allocated to England fans heading to Brazil, making them sixth on the list of countries. Tickets are allocated by Fifa according to demand. So why the relative lack of interest? Apathy about the football or worries about politics or crowd violence? And are fans' fears misplaced?  England's record at the past six World Cups First and foremost, football fans want to see their team win. In 2014, England were among, external the most heavily supported teams, despite a relative lack of success in international football in recent times.  The national team have reached the quarter-finals of a World Cup just twice in their past six attempts, and they have not won a knockout game at a major tournament in 12 years.  So are fans simply losing interest?  Garford Beck, the team manager of England Fans FC, thinks so, claiming that a lot of England fans ""reached the end of the road after Brazil, because it was such a poor showing"". And CJ Joiner, a Coventry City fan and member of the FA travel club for the past five years, says that ""boring football doesn't help"" encourage fans to travel. He has spent just over £1,000 to buy tickets for each potential England game - seven in total - but can return them and receive a refund should England fail to progress past a certain stage. ""England fans will have to spend a lot of money to follow the side in Russia, but under Gareth Southgate the side lack creativity,"" he told BBC Sport. Also at the forefront of fans' minds is the possibility of being caught up in violence between rival supporters. England and Russia fans clashed on the streets of Marseille two years ago, before and after the Euro 2016 meeting between the two nations. There were also incidents inside the stadium on the evening of the game. The Russian contingent in the port city were smaller in number but arrived prepared for conflict. Indeed, some England fans in a BBC documentary described the onslaught as a ""military operation"".  In the programme - Russia's Hooligan Army - a group of Russian ultras taunted their English counterparts and warned of violence at this summer's World Cup on home soil.  However, Anwar Uddin, diversity and campaigns manager for the Football Supporters' Foundation, told BBC Sport he expects the hooligans to be on their ""best behaviour"". ""I was in Marseille and the way the Russians went about their business was methodical - they were there to make their mark,"" he said. Clashes broke out at the end of the match between England and Russia in Marseilles two years ago ""Seeing what is reported about some aspects of Russian society, people are going to build up an idea in their heads about what the country is like. It does make you think. ""But I would like to think the Russian fans will be on their best behaviour with the world watching on."" The nerve agent attack on former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on UK soil in March, led many to point the finger at Moscow. The events in Salisbury have severely strained diplomatic relations between the UK and Russia but Beck, of England Fans FC, believes ""anti-British sentiment from Russia is nothing new"". And although the last tournament was on another continent, he suggests more fans travelled to Brazil for the South American climate, and because the country ""has a better image and is friendlier to England"". While most England fans acknowledge the threat of violence from their Russian counterparts, Beck raises concerns about the local police.  ""I like Eastern Europe but when we go over there we do seem to get some poor treatment from the authorities."" Those claims of Russian police being heavy-handed are echoed by Coventry fan Joiner. He said: ""I actually think England fans will be OK in terms of opposing fans, but it's the police I would be worried about."" Official guidelines for travelling supporters from the foreign office, external state: ""Due to heightened political tensions between the UK and Russia, you should be aware of the possibility of anti-British sentiment or harassment at this time.  ""If you're currently in Russia or due to travel in the coming weeks, you're advised to remain vigilant, avoid any protests or demonstrations and avoid commenting publicly on political developments."" Arsenal's Europa League game at CSKA Moscow attracted a large number of Russian Gunners fans But the recent experiences of Arsenal fans who travelled to watch their side against CSKA Moscow earlier this month for a Europa League quarter-final tie have been positive. Danny, from Guildford, told BBC Sport: ""I feel you're safer going to a sporting event than doing anything else. ""People have been so friendly. The stereotypes you have, so far they've been completely the opposite. Everyone's been chatty and friendly. ""I don't know if you can equate club and country - this is not as high profile. I'm not going to the World Cup but it's been a really positive experience. ""Quite a few of us go in large groups to games and when I suggested this trip they said 'don't be silly', because they didn't want to take the risk."" Sam, from north London, added: ""A lot of people told us we were foolish for coming out here but it has been friendly, the city is beautiful, and it's one of the best trips we've been on. ""We've had a good reception from the locals. We were out until the early hours and there was no hostility. ""I was in Marseille when England played Russia and didn't have any problems - it's about where you position yourself. If you keep yourself away from the minority that cause trouble you'll be fine."" The supporters we spoke to said one of their biggest issues was paying £185 for a visa at late notice, although the cost of a visa for an England fan should be cheaper because they buy them earlier. Last year, European football's anti-discrimination group Fare warned gay fans going to Russia not to show affection in public if they wanted to stay safe. In January, Spartak Moscow were sanctioned after posting a tweet referring to their black players as ""chocolates"". Russian politicians have been criticised for a 2013 law banning gay 'propaganda' - a law the European Court of Human Rights last year ruled was ""discriminatory"". But former Chelsea and Russia midfielder Alexei Smertin urged gay and ethnic minority England supporters in March not to be deterred from travelling by fears of racist or homophobic abuse. Smertin, who is now anti-discrimination chief for the finals, told BBC World Service fans' ""minds would be changed completely"" about Russia as a country. Alexei Smertin (right, with Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o) has played down reports of racism in Russia Alexei Sorokin, chief of Russia's World Cup organising committee, has also played down safety concerns for UK visitors. ""We will ensure security in equal measures to all, from dignitaries to fans,"" Sorokin told TASS, the government-owned Russian news agency. ""To us, there is no difference which country people come from or what our diplomatic relations with them are. It is a shame that the games will be played in such circumstances."" However, the Football Supporters' Foundation's Uddin said the threat of racism was ""one of the negatives"" when weighing up whether to go to the World Cup. ""If you're going to spend a ridiculous amount of money following England you have to weigh up all the pros and cons,"" said Uddin, who is intending to go to Russia later in the tournament. ""There are a lot of negatives when thinking about Russia and the element of violence and racism is on the list. People have to be realistic and safety has to be a concern."" Some England fans lay part of the blame with the Football Association.  To buy tickets through the FA for any away fixture or major tournament, England fans must be members of the travel club. But Sky Blues supporter Joiner says membership has significantly declined in recent years.  ""There were 19,000 official members before the World Cup in Brazil four years ago, but there are only 11-12,000 now,"" he said. Joiner also says the FA are not ""enticing fans"" to become members of the travel club and that there is a feeling among some that the organisation is focused on filling Wembley for home games. ""That's all the FA are bothered about because they generate more revenue from home fixtures,"" Joiner said. In response, an FA spokesperson said: ""We are always grateful for the travelling support that England receive and acknowledge that there are a number of factors that determine attendance at tournaments."" England fans trouble 'a worrying trend' More than 100 England fans arrested"
risk appetite,Tranmere shock Watford to set up Man Utd tie,2024-09-15,2020-01-13,Phil Dawkes,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51092335,"This video can not be played FA Cup: Watch highlights as Tranmere stun Watford with an extra-time win League One Tranmere shocked Premier League Watford in an FA Cup third-round replay to set up a tie against 12-time winners Manchester United. In a game rescheduled from earlier in the month because of a waterlogged pitch, Rovers capitalised on a hugely under-strength Hornets and best navigated a dire, sand-covered Prenton Park surface to finally settle the tie in extra time. Substitute striker Paul Mullin, who came off the bench to score a late penalty at Vicarage Road and complete a remarkable Rovers comeback from 3-0 down to set up this replay, went one better with a headed winner 14 minutes into the extra 30. The Hornets had come back themselves in normal time, with Kaylen Hinds firing in through a mass of players to level after Manny Monthe had given the home side the lead. The silver lining for Nigel Pearson's side is that they will not have to play what would have been a fourth game in nine days in the fourth round on Sunday, and will instead be able to focus all their efforts on avoiding relegation from the top flight. Tranmere, though, get to do this all over again at the weekend, hosting Manchester United with an even greater shock in mind and on a pitch unlike any other the Red Devils will have played on this campaign.  This video can not be played Tranmere edge closer to a big cup upset as Mullin scores in extra time against Watford This FA Cup run has been something to savour in what has been an otherwise tough season back in League One for Tranmere. The club have been on an upward trajectory over the past two campaigns, returning to the Football League in 2018-19 after three seasons in the National League and then following that up with a second successive promotion to the third tier. But they have won just five of 25 league games since then and sit 21st in the League One table. However, both the original tie and this replay have showcased the battling spirit that Micky Mellon has instilled in his players. And on a sandy, rapidly deteriorating surface such as this, that appetite for battle was key. They won tackles, stuck a boot in where their opponents would not and remained alive to the opportunities that chaos can create in a minefield of a penalty area. Blackett-Taylor and 37-year-old veteran midfielder Neil Danns both went close before defender Monthe - also a scorer in the original tie - struck his opener in the first half, and they did not wilt when Watford levelled in the second. They could easily have won the tie in normal time, but Mullin hit the outside of the post from a tight angle and Danns fired just past the far post with seconds left. They were not to be denied, though, as Mullin timed his run to perfection to meet a flicked on cross from Liam Ridehalgh and head his side into the fourth round and the chance to show what they have got against a struggling Manchester United. ""I don't think it's an opportunity because of the form United are in. I know they have a threat. We have to make sure we are ready,"" said Mellon. ""We will give it everything we have got. There is no doubt we will be up against a good side. ""We have to go out there and understand that is what will come here. They are an unbelievable football club and we are a League One club, at the bottom end of League One, but we are going to give it everything we've got. ""We will try to represent the club again and the players will run their socks off again and who knows?"" Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side will not relish the prospect of facing Tranmere on this pitch. The FA Cup represents one of United's main potential avenues to silverware this season and you would therefore expect Solskjaer to field a stronger XI than Watford did for this game. But they will face the same, alien problems of inconsistent bounce and roll on a surface that is as much sand as grass. Plus, they come into the tie at arguably the lowest moment of Solskjaer's time at the club, having meekly lost their last two games - at fierce rivals Liverpool and then at home against Burnley. Clearly, Solskjaer has the superior players at his disposal but Tranmere will have the bit between their teeth and a leveller beneath their feet. Kaylen Hinds joined Watford in August 2019 following a spell in Germany with Wolfsburg Precariously placed in the Premier League and having just lost at relegation rivals Villa, this was a game Watford could have done without, and one they should have avoided in the first place. Leading 3-0 at half-time in the original fixture at Vicarage Road, their place in round four was essentially booked, before their second-half capitulation allowed Tranmere parity and a replay. When the elements then intervened and the game on 14 January was postponed, it left the Hornets facing a horror run of fixtures at a crucial juncture in their season. No wonder then that Pearson opted to make so many changes from the defeat at Villa, with Christian Kabasele, Jose Holebas and Andre Gray the most recognisable first-team figures in a team largely comprised of under-23 players. As an indication of how deeply the Watford boss dug into his squad, the average shirt number for the 18 named in the match-day squad was 38, with the highest on display the 72 sported by unused substitute Andi Janjeva. None of them particularly covered themselves in glory, never fully getting to grips with their opponents or environment. Teenage Brazilian forward Joao Pedro showed the briefest of flashes and drew a good save out of home keeper Scott Davies, who was also called into action to superbly palm away a curling Callum Whelan shot in extra time, while Holebas hit the post with an angled drive. But these were rare moments of attacking flair in an encounter that will be quickly forgotten if the returning first team can return to winning ways in the league in nine days' time. ""It was a tough game,"" said Pearson. ""We learned a lot about our young players tonight and I thought the senior players were excellent. ""Congratulations to Tranmere. For people who possibly thought we weren't too interested in it, we were but we couldn't risk too many first-team players."" Pearson also dismissed any notion that the pitch was to blame for the loss, adding; ""It is the same for everyone. They showed a lot of energy and desire. In the first half we were second-best in terms of desire."" Monthe scored the opener and then stood tall to help keep Watford at bay with four clearances Tranmere welcome Manchester United to Prenton Park for the fourth-round tie, kicking off at 15:00 GMT on Sunday. Watford get a short break from action to lick their wounds before hosting Everton in the Premier League on Saturday, 1 February. The FA Cup"
risk appetite,"Ethiopia PM eyes Red Sea port, inflaming tensions",2024-09-15,2023-11-08,By Alex de Waal,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67332811,"Ethiopia is abuzz with rumours of a new war - which would be Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's fourth in five years.  As well as importing weapons and mobilising his army, Mr Abiy - who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his rapprochement with Eritrea - has been saying that access to the sea is an existential question. Ethiopia's most obvious target is the Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab, which was part of Ethiopia until Eritrean independence more than 30 years ago.  Since the 1998 Ethiopian-Eritrean war and the closure of the border between the two countries, the Assab docks have been rusting away, while Ethiopia's trade has been channelled through neighbouring Djibouti.  The logistics and economics of Djibouti are perfectly workable, but it is not Ethiopian territory. Many Ethiopians - and their neighbours - read between the lines and think the prime minister is threatening to use force. But Mr Abiy publicly denies that he intends to invade Eritrea, telling soldiers recently on armed forces day: ""Ethiopia has never invaded any country and will not do so in the future."" He has also called for dialogue via an emergency summit of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (Igad), a bloc of eight north-east African states. Yet Ethiopia's aggressive posture and new arms race have consequences. In July, Mr Abiy publicly raised the question of Ethiopia's access to the sea.  He made the point that Ethiopia is the world's most-populous landlocked country - it has 125 million people - and that access to the sea was a top priority for Ethiopian emperors, notably Haile Selassie who ruled from 1930 until 1974.  Quoting a famous 19th Century general, Ras Alula, Mr Abiy said that the Red Sea was Ethiopia's natural boundary. He reportedly told a meeting of businessmen that ""we want to get a port by peaceful means. But if that fails we will use force"". Some saw this as a gambit to win political support at home.  It appealed to an influential elite from the Amhara ethnic group who advocate for a greater Ethiopia.  Mr Abiy alienated this group when he made peace with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in northern Ethiopia a year ago, following a bloody civil war. He further antagonised them by launching a military operation in April to disarm Amhara militia, who sided with him in the conflict in the Tigray region.  Many Ethiopians also believe, falsely, that international law entitles a large country to a seaport. Another interpretation is that Mr Abiy is obsessed with his legacy, and sees acquiring a port, by force if it cannot be done by negotiation, as his contribution to Ethiopia's greatness. For decades, Ethiopia's foreign policy was predictable. It wanted to stabilise the Horn of Africa under its own leadership.  Part of this was partnering with the United Nations and African Union on peace efforts in Sudan and Somalia. Ethiopia became Africa's biggest contributor to UN and African Union peacekeeping missions. Another part was ambitious cross-border infrastructure projects, including transport corridors and power lines.  The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile was designed to generate enough electricity that it could export to neighbouring countries. The idea was to bind the Horn of Africa together as a single economic bloc. Today, Mr Abiy has gained a reputation for unpredictability. That's the case for both domestic and foreign affairs. In a remarkable reversal, Eritrea, once widely shunned for destabilising the Horn of Africa, is positioning itself as the responsible, status quo power.  In response to Mr Abiy, its statements have been terse and acerbic, pointedly refusing to join the ""discourses"" of its former ally on a matter that had ""perplexed all concerned observers"".  Ethiopia's other neighbours have been rattled too, and Djibouti, the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, Somalia and Kenya are joining Eritrea in an informal bloc to contain Ethiopia - issuing statements echoing one another's concerns. Middle Eastern actors face dilemmas. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is Mr Abiy's principal patron - most conspicuously, it is financing his lavish palace, as well as providing drones.  Emirati aircraft have been observed unloading supplies in Ethiopian airbases in recent days.  Abu Dhabi also supports Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) group led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as ""Hemeti"", who controls much of Sudan including most of its capital, Khartoum, and may soon be able to form a government.  For the UAE, Mr Abiy's adventurism is both an opportunity and a risk: Ethiopia could become an important Red Sea power - and an Emirati client state; or a new war in the Horn could jeopardise their gains in Sudan. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is sponsoring ceasefire talks in Sudan jointly with the US and is reportedly disturbed by how Mr Abiy's Ethiopia is acting.  If Mr Abiy overreaches, Saudi Arabia may feel obliged to overcome its wariness over the Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki, and support him. If he is serious about a new war, Mr Abiy faces two major challenges. One is who will fight.  The Ethiopian army has been depleted by the last three wars. The first was against the Oromo Liberation Army, and is still unfinished.  The second war, against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), was fought in alliance with Eritrea, and ended with a cessation of hostilities a year ago. The Ethiopian army lost, by its own calculation, between 260,000 and 520,000 soldiers killed or missing in action, plus 374,000 wounded.   The third war, against Amhara militia, began in April and is bogging down a large proportion of the army in what increasingly looks like a quagmire - with reports that Eritrea is arming the Amhara militia, known as Fano. If Addis Ababa is to go to war, it will probably need the active involvement of Tigray, strategically positioned adjoining Eritrea. But Tigray's economy and services were destroyed in the two-year war that ended last year, and its people are exhausted.  Few have an appetite for new fighting. But there is deep and widespread anger at the atrocities committed by the Eritrean army.  Moreover, if the federal army were to start a war with Eritrea, Tigray would certainly be dragged in.  Some Tigrayans, fearing that a new war is inevitable, argue that Tigray should set out its conditions first, such as a return of western Tigray - seized by the neighbouring Amhara region three years ago - and control over some national military assets such as aircraft. A second challenge is paying for the war. The Ethiopian economy is in a tailspin, and desperately needs a bailout from western donors along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.  Mr Abiy may hope that the UAE will compensate for any lost funds, but while UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan may provide cash-in-hand for the prime minister, his money cannot compensate for the massive economic losses that a war would entail. Whether or not Ethiopia actually launches an invasion, Mr Abiy has made the war thinkable.  Beating the drums of war creates a dangerous atmosphere. The region's arms race is quickening. Ethiopia is buying more weapons. Eritrea and Djibouti will likely follow suit. Tigray's proposed demobilisation is frozen. The conflicts in Somalia may be exacerbated. Eritrea could pour arms to the Amhara militia to intensify that war. There is a danger that any small incident could get out of hand. The last thing that the Horn of Africa needs is a new war. But the risks are now alarmingly high. Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in the US."
risk appetite,The mega-dam crowdfunded by a judge,2024-09-15,2018-10-29,By Abid Hussain,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45968574,"Cash-poor Pakistan is crowdfunding a drive to collect almost $17bn from its citizens, officials, businesses and stars in order to build two massive dams to help counter a future water crisis.  One of the dams would be among the biggest in the world. But is the project for real or is it a monumental folly, as some are calling it? If it's ever built, the dam at Diamer-Bhasha in the north-west would have a generating capacity of 4,500MW and stand 272m (892ft) high, making it the world's sixth tallest dam. Located near the Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat, it would block off a huge valley system on the upper reaches of the Indus river. The dam has been talked about for more than a decade, but plans to begin construction were given fresh impetus this summer not by water experts or ministers - but by Pakistan's top judge, Chief Justice Saqib Nisar. Following a report predicting severe water shortages in the country by 2025, he set up a fund to raise $14bn to build the mega-dam in Diamerg, and $2.5bn to build an 800MW dam in Mohmand, about 120km (75 miles) to the south-west.  ""It is possible that we will get more money than the required amount,"" said the judge.  Justice Nisar became the first donor, contributing roughly $8,000 to the fund. Many others have since followed suit. These include various branches of the military, which have donated a whopping $7.3m. Businesses, officials, sports stars, school pupils and other ordinary people are among those who have also stumped up cash.  Almost every day there's a press release from the Supreme Court with news of different individuals and institutions meeting the chief justice and donating to the fund. Many have cases pending in court, which has raised suspicions they may be trying to influence the judiciary.  There are many donors who appear glad to have contributed, but not all agree. Marium Zia Khan, an Islamabad resident, told the BBC she would not contribute to the fund.  ""While I understand water scarcity merits urgent attention... crowdfunding mega infrastructure projects such as a dam is a flawed idea.""  Critics have been warned they may be tried for treason if they make fun of the fund.  But the pro-dam lobby is free to express its opinion - and there's an air of hysteria about the urgency to build more dams, with telethons and advertisements urging people to contribute as their patriotic duty. Last month Prime Minister Imran Khan joined in, delivering a special address in which he asked overseas Pakistanis to contribute $1,000 each to the dam fund. He also presided over a fundraising dinner in Karachi in September, where he managed to raise almost $6m.  ""I am the greatest fundraiser in the history of Pakistan,"" he said afterwards.  ""I assure you that we have to meet our target of 30bn rupees every year and we will meet more than our target as all Pakistanis have been mobilised today.""  But the reality has been rather different so far. Five months after the fund was established, contributions add up to just over $50m - a trickle compared with the vast sums it is estimated the two dams would cost.  This at a time when Pakistan is seeking loans from the IMF and other countries to stave off a balance of payments crisis and to service its debt. Danish Mustafa from King's College department of geography is not optimistic the dam will be built. ""I can't imagine this drive working. No country in the world has ever undertaken an infrastructure project which is almost 10% of its total GDP. You have to be semi-insane to want to do that,"" he said. In 2014, researchers at Oxford University published a study on 245 large dams built around the world from 1934-2007, and found mega-dams ""don't make economic sense"".  They singled out the Diamer-Bhasha Dam project as a case study for potential cost and construction overruns. If construction had started in 2010, the findings suggested, it wouldn't have been completed until 2027 - by which time the total cost could have ballooned to close to $30bn.  One of the authors of the report, Prof Bent Flyvbjerg, compared those seeking to build mega-dams to ""fools and reckless optimists"". He told The Ecologist journal in 2014 that such projects also ran the risk of the public being misled ""for private gain, fiscal or political, by painting overly positive prospects of an investment"".  Shams-ul-Mulk, former chairman of Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), firmly disagrees. ""Pakistan will face a drought-like situation if large dams are not constructed,"" he told the BBC. ""Those who oppose the construction of large dams are not aware of the looming water crisis in the country and don't want Pakistan to progress."" But this raises questions over whether Pakistan is actually a water-scarce country. A 2015 IMF report put total annual availability of water at 191 million acre feet (MAF), which it said would become insufficient by 2025 when demand is expected to rise to 274 MAF. Many say this is due to Pakistan's surge in population which has already tripled since 1970.  But experts point out that little or nothing has been done to ensure water is used more efficiently.  Hassan Abbas, a hydrology expert, says the solution for periodic shortages ""does not lie in another mega structure. It lies in improving our management practices."" This would require efficient irrigation - such as drip irrigation and paving of water-courses to reduce seepage - as well as steps to reduce water loss. Then there are the socio-economic and ecological costs of constructing mega structures on water courses, often with serious political implications. After signing a water treaty with India in 1960, Pakistan built two of the largest dams in the world, Tarbela and Mangla. The purpose was both to generate electricity and divert water for irrigation. While it improved the electricity situation in the country for some time, it gradually led to the desertification of millions of acres of land in the Indus Delta region of Sindh province.  Upriver, hundreds of villages were submerged and thousands were uprooted by the building of reservoirs. Compensation was promised and rehabilitation plans made, but locals are still waiting for a full and final settlement. Meanwhile, mudflows carried by the rivers created silt deposits at the dams, depleting their storage capacity. Other controversial dam projects have since been shelved, but many have gone ahead. None are on the scale of Diamer-Bhasha, which was floated as an idea in the early 2000s. But global financial institutes such as the World Bank have consistently refused to provide funding, citing the seismicity of the area and saying the dam would be controversial, since India claims ownership of Gilgit-Baltistan, its proposed location. Backers of the mega-dam argue it is not designed to divert water for irrigation and therefore there would have no negative impact on agriculture in Sindh.  But experts believe it will still hurt the Indus Delta region, where residents are already protesting against the building of the dam.  So why has Pakistan's top judge gone out of his way to promote this? The answer may lie in the huge appetite for irrigation water in Punjab, politically the country's most influential province and home to just under 60% of its population.  Pakistan has the world's largest canal irrigation system - and most of it ends up in Punjab, to the annoyance of other provinces. Or could it be there's an element of national pride that was piqued when international funding for the project was withheld. Either way, there are other ways of raising the huge sums of money required for dams. Simi Kamal, a geographer, says there is room for dams in Pakistan - but suggests water bonds as a ""more rational"" way of fundraising than charity donations. As an example she points to the $5bn Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which was funded in large part by this method. ""We should not be making speeches for or against dams, or make dams into idols or ideology,"" she told the BBC.  ""It is not that simple. The current clamour for dams and frenzied soundbites by (mostly) ill-informed people is quite immature and requires restraint until we have good science and a better knowledge base in place."""
risk appetite,Measles warning linked to island sports centre,2024-09-15,2024-02-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx9drg9ezp7o,"NHS Western Isles is warning some people who attended a sports centre in Lewis that they may have been exposed to the potential risk of measles. The health board said it was issuing ""warn and inform"" notices to a range of people in the Western Isles who may have come into to contact with a person likely to have the infection. NHS Western Isles said the situation affected mainly those who attended Stornoway's sports centre on Saturday 10 February between 09:00 and 18:00. They have been urged to ensure they have had two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The NHS says measles is an infection that spreads easily, and has unpleasant and sometimes serious complications. NHS Western Isles said anyone unsure if they had been vaccinated should contact their GP. Public health consultant Dr Keith Allan said: ""We are issuing warn and inform notices at present to individuals who may have come into contact with an individual likely to have measles.  ""These people in particular are strongly encouraged to make sure they are fully vaccinated.” NHS Western Isles said symptoms of measles included:"
risk appetite,Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil?,2024-09-15,2021-04-14,By Nathalia Passarinho and Luis Barrucho,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56696907,"More than a year into the pandemic, deaths in Brazil are now at their peak. But despite the overwhelming evidence that Covid-19 rarely kills young children, in Brazil 1,300 babies have died from the virus. One doctor refused to test Jessika Ricarte's one-year-old son for Covid, saying his symptoms did not fit the profile of the virus. Two months later he died of complications from the disease. After two years of trying, and failed fertility treatments, teacher Jessika Ricarte had all but given up on having a family. Then she fell pregnant with Lucas. ""His name comes from luminous. And he was a light in our life. He showed that happiness was much more than we imagined,"" she says.  She first suspected something was wrong when Lucas, always a good eater, lost his appetite.  At first Jessika wondered if he was teething. Lucas's godmother, a nurse, suggested that he might just have a sore throat. But after he developed a fever, then fatigue and slightly laboured breathing, Jessika took him to hospital, and asked for him to be tested for Covid. ""The doctor put on the oximeter. Lucas's levels were 86%. Now I know that is not normal,"" says Jessika.   But he was not feverish, so the doctor said: ""My dear, don't worry. There's no need for a Covid test. It's probably just a minor sore throat."" He told Jessika that Covid-19 was rare in children, gave her some antibiotics and sent her home. Despite her misgivings, there was no option to have Lucas tested privately at the time.  Jessika says that some of his symptoms dissipated at the end of his 10-day antibiotics course, but the tiredness remained - as did her concerns about coronavirus.  ""I sent several videos to his godmother, my parents, my mother-in-law, and everyone said that I was exaggerating, that I should stop watching the news, that it was making me paranoid. But I knew that my son was not himself, that he was not breathing normally."" This was May 2020, and the coronavirus epidemic was growing. Two people had already died in her town, Tamboril in Ceará, north-east Brazil. ""Everyone knows each other here. The town was in shock.""  Jessika's husband Israel was worried that another hospital visit would increase the risk that she and Lucas would become infected with the virus.  But the weeks went by, and Lucas became sleepier and sleepier. Finally on 3 June, Lucas vomited over and over again after eating lunch, and Jessika knew she had to act.   They returned to their local hospital, where the doctor tested Lucas for Covid, to rule it out.  Lucas's godmother, who worked there, broke the news to the couple that his test result was positive.  ""At the time, the hospital did not even have a resuscitator,"" says Jessika.  Lucas was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit in Sobral, over two hours away, where he was diagnosed with a condition called multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS).  This is an extreme immune response to the virus, which can cause inflammation of vital organs.  Experts say the syndrome, which affects children up to six weeks after they are infected with coronavirus, is rare, but leading epidemiologist Dr Fatima Marinho from the University of São Paolo, says that, during the pandemic, she is seeing more cases of MIS than ever before. Although it doesn't account for all deaths.  When Lucas was intubated, Jessika wasn't allowed to stay in the same room. She rang her sister-in-law to try and distract herself.  ""We could still hear the sound of the machine, the beep, until the machine stopped and there was that constant beep. And we know that happens when the person dies. After a few minutes, the machine started working again and I started to cry."" The doctor told her Lucas had suffered a cardiac arrest but they had managed to revive him. Dr Manuela Monte, the paediatric doctor who treated Lucas for over a month in the ICU in Sobral, said she was surprised that Lucas's condition was so serious, because he did not have any risk factors.  Most children affected by Covid have comorbidities - existing conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - or are overweight, according to Lohanna Tavares, a paediatric infectologist at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital in Fortaleza, the state capital.  But that wasn't the case with Lucas.  During the 33 days Lucas was in the ICU, Jessika was only allowed to see him three times. Lucas needed immunoglobulin  - a very expensive medication - to deflate his heart, but luckily an adult patient who had bought his own had donated one leftover ampoule to the hospital. Lucas was so ill that he went on to receive a second dose of immunoglobulin. He developed a rash on his body and was running a persistent fever. He needed support to breathe.  Then Lucas began to improve and the doctors decided to take out his oxygen tube. They video-called Jessika and Israel so that he wouldn't feel alone as he regained consciousness.  ""When he heard our voices he started to cry,"" says Jessika.   It was the last time they were to see their boy react. During the next video call ""he had a paralysed look"". The hospital requested a CT scan and discovered Lucas had had a stroke. Still, the couple were told Lucas would make a good recovery with the right care and would soon be moved out of ICU and into a general ward. When Jessika and Israel went to visit him, the doctor was just as hopeful as they were, she says.  ""That night, I put my cell phone on silent. I dreamed Lucas came up to me and kissed my nose. And the dream was a great feeling of love, gratitude and I woke up very happy. Then I saw my cell phone and saw the 10 calls that the doctor had made.""  The doctor told Jessika that Lucas's heart rate and oxygen levels had dropped suddenly, and he had died early that morning.  She feels sure that if Lucas had been given a Covid test when she had requested it back in early May he would have survived.   ""It is important that doctors, even if they believe it is not Covid, do the test to eliminate the possibility,"" she says.  ""A baby does not say what he is feeling, so we depend on tests."" Jessika believes that the delay in proper treatment made his condition more serious. ""Lucas had several inflammations, 70% of the lung was compromised, the heart increased by 40%. It was a situation that could have been avoided."" Dr Monte, who treated Lucas, agrees. She says that although MIS cannot be prevented, treatment is much more successful if the condition is diagnosed and treated early.  ""The earlier he would have received specialised care, the better,"" she says. ""He arrived at the hospital already critically ill. I believe he could have had a different outcome if we could have treated him earlier."" Jessika now wants to share Lucas's story to help others who may miss critical symptoms. ""Every child I know was saved by some warning and the mother says: 'I saw your posts, I took my son to the hospital and he is now at home.' It's as if it were a little bit of Lucas,"" she says.  ""I have been doing for these people what I wish they had done for me. If I had had information, I would have been even more cautious."" There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid, says Dr Fatima Marinho, who is also a senior adviser to the international health NGO Vital Strategies. Marinho's research has found that a shockingly high number of children and babies have been affected by the virus.  Between February 2020 and 15 March 2021, Covid-19 killed at least 852 of Brazil's children up to the age of nine, including 518 babies under one year old, according to figures from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. But Dr Marinho estimates that more than twice this number of children died of Covid. A serious problem of underreporting due to lack of Covid testing is bringing the numbers down, she says.  Dr Marinho calculated the excess of deaths by unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic, and found that there were 10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years. By adding these numbers, she estimates that the virus in fact killed 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies. Experts say the sheer number of Covid cases in the country - the second-highest number in the world  - have increased the likelihood that Brazil's babies and young children are affected. ""Of course, the more cases we have and, as a result, the more hospitalisations, the greater the number of deaths in all age groups, including children. But if the pandemic were controlled, this scenario could evidently be minimised,"" says Renato Kfouri, president of the Scientific Department of Immunisations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. Such a high infection rate has overwhelmed Brazil's entire health care system. Across the country, oxygen supplies are dwindling, there is a shortage of basic medicines and in many ICUs across the country there are simply no more beds. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose lockdowns and the infection rate is being driven by a variant called P.1 which emerged in Manaus, in northern Brazil, last year, and is thought to be much more contagious. Twice the number of people died last month than in any other month of the pandemic, and the upward trend is continuing.  Another problem driving the high rates in children is a lack of testing.    Marinho says that for children often the Covid diagnosis comes too late, when they are already seriously ill. ""We have a serious problem detecting cases. We don't have enough tests for the general population, even fewer for children. Because there is a delay in the diagnosis, there is a delay in care for the child,"" she says.  This is not just because there is little testing capacity, but also because it is easier to miss, or misdiagnose, the symptoms of children suffering from Covid-19, as the disease tends to present differently in younger people.  ""A child has a lot more diarrhoea, a lot more abdominal pain, and chest pain, than the classic Covid picture. Because there is a delay in diagnosis, when the child arrives at the hospital they are in a serious condition and can end up complicating - and dying,"" she says.   But it's also about poverty and access to health care.  An observational study of 5,857 Covid-19 patients under the age of 20, carried out by Brazilian paediatricians led by Braian Sousa from the São Paolo school of medicine, identified both comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for the worst outcome of Covid-19 in children. Marinho agrees this is an important factor. ""Most vulnerable are black children, and those from very poor families, as they have the most difficulty accessing help. These are the children most at risk of death."" She says this is because crowded housing conditions make it impossible to socially distance when infected, and because poorer communities do not have access to a local ICU.   These children are also at risk of malnutrition, which is ""terrible for the immune response"", Marinho says. When Covid payments stopped, millions were plunged back into poverty. ""We went from 7 million to 21 million people below the poverty line in one year. So people are also going hungry. All of this is impacting mortality.""  Sousa says his study identifies certain risk groups among children that should be prioritised for vaccination. Currently, there are no vaccines available for children under 16 years of age.  Visits by relatives to children in ICU have been restricted since the beginning of the pandemic, for fear of infection.  Dr Cinara Carneiro, an ICU doctor at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital, says this has been immensely challenging, not just because parents are a comfort to their children, but because they can also help in a clinical sense - they can tell when their child is in pain or in psychological distress and when they need soothing rather than medicating. And she says the parents' absence intensifies their own trauma when they hear their child's condition has deteriorated and they haven't been there to witness it.  ""It hurts to see a child dying without seeing their parents,"" says Dr Carneiro. In an attempt to improve the communication between parents and their children, staff at Albert Sabin hospital clubbed together to buy phones and tablets to facilitate video calls.  Dr Carneiro says this has helped immensely. ""We have made over 100 video calls between family members and patients. This contact has greatly reduced the stress."" Scientists stress the risk of death in this age group is still ""very low"" - the current figures suggest only 0.58% of Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths to date have been of 0-9 year olds - but that is more than 2,000 children.  ""The numbers are really scary,"" says Dr Carneiro. While coronavirus is infectious to children, it is rarely serious. If your child is unwell it is likely to be a non-coronavirus illness, rather than coronavirus itself. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health advises parents seek URGENT help (call 111 or go to A&E)  if their child is:"
risk appetite,'Devastated' by European exit but where now for Arsenal?,2024-09-15,2021-05-06,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57017649,"Arsenal hit the post twice on Thursday but were unable to find the goal they needed to reach the final ""We are devastated"". Mikel Arteta is not a man for big displays of emotion, but you could tell that this one hurt. Arsenal's failure to score against Villarreal at Emirates Stadium on Thursday - and the Europa League exit that resulted - has repercussions. Sat ninth in the Premier League, the Gunners' season is now effectively over with little to show for it, and their proud record of having competed in continental competition for the past 25 seasons is likely to end. There will be question marks over the future of many players, the manager's position and - judging by the fan protests that were once again staged outside the ground prior to kick-off - no end to the pressure on the club's owners. Here, BBC Sport gathers reaction from the manager, players, pundits and more to gauge the mood after a disastrous night for Arsenal and asks where the club goes from here. Thursday's Europa League semi-finals as they happened Arsenal's Europa League hopes ended by Villarreal Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast ""We tried everything until the last minute,"" Arteta told BT Sport in his post-match interview. ""We have to congratulate Villarreal. I think we deserved to win the game but the details define these ties. We had three big chances, they didn't have anything but they are through. ""We are devastated. Really disappointed."" Arsenal did indeed hit the post twice through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while Emile Smith Rowe and Nicolas Pepe curled shots wide, but such moments were too few in a display that was strangely passive for long periods. Arteta felt there were mitigating circumstances, not least of all a lack of match fitness in key players, including Aubameyang following his bout of Malaria and Kieran Tierney, who replaced Granit Xhaka at left-back after he was injured in the warm-up. Arteta, who admitted everybody's job is now under scrutiny, said: ""It's various things. The way we started in Villarreal wasn't good enough. We didn't arrive here in the best moment with everyone in their best condition. For 90% of them it was their first semi-final and we have to learn."" Goalkeeper Bernd Leno agreed that a weak first-leg display and poor finishing on home soil cost the Gunners. ""It's very hard for all of us,"" the German told BT Sport. ""Also for the fans. We are all sad. Hopefully we can make next season better than this season but this season isn't over and in our final four games we must fight for this club and show that we love this club."" The pundits were less forgiving. ""Over the two legs Arsenal have not done enough,"" the club's former defender Lee Dixon told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Arsenal have given up on these two games too easily. There has not been enough.  ""You are hoping as Arsenal fans things would change but in the back of the mind you don't trust this team. They have outdone themselves, they have gone out with a whimper. ""I hope they're in that changing room hurting, but I'm not sure if they are."" Another ex-Arsenal defender, Matthew Upson, was equally damning: ""We can talk about being Mikel Arteta being outsmarted by Unai Emery but I don't think Villarreal had to do a lot and this is the problem. ""The manager has a good idea of how he wants to coach and how he wants to play but none of that matters if you don't have the application, the characters, the commitment and responsibility on the pitch."" There were high hopes when Arteta's side beat Liverpool in August's Community Shield, after winning last season's FA Cup, but what has followed this season has been a model of inconsistency. Since taking over as boss, the 39-year-old has won 43 of his 82 matches in charge, but it is the 13 defeats he has suffered in the league this campaign that are taking centre stage, leaving the club at risk of their lowest Premier League finish since 1994-95. This will be their fifth season finishing outside the top four. The fans' frustration has been exacerbated by the actions of owner Stan Kroenke, especially his eagerness to sign the club up to the proposed European Super League, prompting protests. Dixon's former team-mate Martin Keown zeroed in on Arteta and the club hierarchy, suggesting that big changes are needed before the club can even think of challenging again. ""There is a crossroads,"" he told BT Sport. ""It is a real fall from grace. Will it mean new owners, a new manager? ""The manager comes under enormous pressure. Look at the wisdom of a young manager taking a massive job. His inexperience has cost him.  ""It seemed to me this was the rescue package but it didn't arrive. Is there an appetite to keep him? He is very much the owner's man, but he is going to be under huge pressure.  ""I don't know if it changes Kroenke, does this club really matter to him? Does he love football enough? We need someone who wants this club and loves this club.  ""It is going to take big investment and if he doesn't want it, step aside for someone who does."" Eric Yung: All this chat about Arteta out & Kroenke out (all valid) but be realistic - both won't happen this summer, nor, will we have a sizeable summer transfer budget. The board, Arteta, Edu owe it to the fans for assurances on next steps.  Act like a big club, show leadership. Olivier Garnier: Yet another [piece of] evidence Arteta is too inexperienced. All season he has kept making wrong choices (starters and substitutions). Lacklustre football and poor results. Strong decision needed not to waste another year in reconstruction. M: We used to be contenders for the league season after season. We used to be regulars at the UCL knockout round. People at the club (owners, manager, players) should be ashamed of how they have turned our club into a joke.  Wardy: Arsenal finished on a high last year beating Man City, Liverpool and winning the FA Cup. Where's all that optimism a year on? We're a shadow of the team we were a year ago. Arteta's doing. Arteta's team. Arteta must go. American Gooner: I have been a tolerant Arsenal fan for 15 years. But I am now losing patience. We have no ambition, no style, no identity, no pride. It's our past that still allows us to feel like a big club but in all fairness we have been a mid-table club now for 10 years. Peter in Oxford: Arsenal fan very torn here - on the one hand we were pathetic and deserved nothing and on that Arteta should go. On the other hand surely you give him a proper transfer window and pre-season given how the last one was with Covid and at least see if things look to be on the turn at the beginning of next season. Adam in Oxford: Arteta has to go, 0-0 should never be an acceptable scoreline in a must-win European semi-final where Arsenal only had to score. At least lose having committed all 11 players forward chasing it. Arteta has transformed Arsenal, for the worst. John G: Now is not the time for knee-jerk reactions. Getting rid of Mikel solves nothing. There needs to be change. Kroenke must go otherwise our downwards trajectory continues. My only solace is at least we are not now going to be battered by United in the final. Mark, Swindon: It's looking like the shortcomings in Arsenal's squad are going to cost them dearly. Investment needed big time. The Northern Bank Job: The biggest bank heist in British and Irish history is revisited Life Changing: What's it like to lose all your memories overnight?

risk appetite,How the grilled cheese sandwich went gourmet,2024-09-15,2017-12-01,By David Silverberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42164538,"For some people cheese can seem as addictive as chocolate, especially when it's melted. To meet these cravings for all things cheddar, brie and parmesan, a slew of restaurants have popped up recently that focus specifically on selling cheese-based dishes. But is it wise to run a company that relies so heavily on one type of food? And isn't all this cheese-eating bad for our health? When Nate Pollak decided to set up a business specialising in ""gourmet"" grilled cheese sandwiches, some people thought he was crazy.  The 34-year launched the Great American Grilled Cheese Kitchen with his partner, Heidi, at the height of the US recession in 2010.  Both had lost their office jobs and, in what many would consider a risky move, chose to put their life savings into the venture.  But seven years on the decision is paying off.  The pair have opened two outlets in San Francisco, and sales are increasing 7% every year at their flagship outlet, and 35% at the newer site. They serve around 16 varieties of grilled cheese sandwich, ranging from the classic recipe to ones with fancy cheeses and experimental fillings, such as hickory-smoked turkey, apricot-jalapeno relish and lavender-basil pesto.  Mr Pollak now plans to franchise his brand across the US. But isn't he worried that his somewhat limited product range might one day go out of fashion? ""The grilled cheese sandwich is timeless comfort food,"" he says confidently. ""It elicits memories of your childhood, and all that cheese is so deliciously gooey. ""I can still remember making my first when I was three, using the toaster oven in my house."" The Grilled Cheese Kitchen is one of growing crop of businesses to have emerged in recent years, catering for our love for all things melted cheese. While the best known specialise in toasted sandwiches, others offer macaroni and cheese, Canadian poutine, or fondue, with all tending to put their own spin on these classic dishes.   It's all part of the ""fast casual"" dining trend that has swept the world in recent years, says Josh Benn, global head of food and retail at Duff & Phelps, a corporate-finance consultancy,  This sees fast food dishes being made with higher quality ingredients and served in trendier venues targeting millennial consumers, he says. ""Most types of fast food have been given a fast casual touch and we've seen billion dollar brands spring up, such as Shake Shack for burgers and Chipotle for burritos,"" says Mr Benn.   ""Now we're seeing businesses focused on grilled cheese dishes expanding, and it's become a fashionable food trend in the US and beyond.""  A British firm embracing the trend is the Mac Factory, which specialises in macaroni and cheese, or ""mac n cheese"", the classic baked dish of cooked macaroni pasta in a cheese sauce. The London-based chain serves its own fresh takes on dish, adding chorizo sausage or caramelised onions for example.  Since it launched in 2014 the business has opened three outlets to meet demand, says owner Graham Bradbury.  ""Cheese is coming back into fashion. Everything is melted-cheese this or melted-cheese that. Lots of companies are starting up and it does feel quite competitive."" Mr Bradbury recognises a hot food trend when he sees one. According to research firm Horizons, macaroni and cheese was five and a half times more likely to appear on restaurant menus in the 12 months to February 2016 than in 2010. More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: Some of the cheese dishes in the spotlight have roots that go way back - and perhaps worryingly for those serving them, they have tended to go in and out of fashion over the years.  Take the Swiss dish fondue, a shared pot of melted cheese into which groups of diners dip vegetables, charcuterie and bread. It is thought to have first been made in 1699, and saw spells of popularity in the 20th century, including in the US in the 1960s where it was enjoyed at parties.  But it fell out of favour in the 1980s when it was deemed passé and health-conscious consumers began to shun calorific dishes. Recently though retailers have been offering cook-at-home fondue sets, newspapers have been publishing recipes, and more restaurants are offering the gooey dish. London's St Moritz, which has served fondue since 1974, claims to sell up to 20,000 servings of fondue every year.  Boss Armin Loetscherm doesn't seem concerned that it might fall out of fashion again.  ""I think it will always have fans because of its communal aspect, as people are sharing and interacting with each other all the time.""  It's a similar story with poutine, a French-Canadian dish invented in 1957, traditionally comprising French fries and fresh cheese curds, covered with gravy.  It was typically only found in Canada, where it is a national dish, but today restaurants from New York to London, and Paris to Melbourne serve it as well. While loved by fans, however, some varieties of poutine can contain as many as 1,500 calories - just 500 short of the recommended daily intake for the average adult female. And other cheese-focused dishes can be similarly unhealthy.   ""The fact that cheese is culturally part of the Western and European diet doesn't make it a healthy food,"" says Dr Neal Barnard, author of The Cheese Trap, a book highly critical of the food stuff. ""It's a leading source of saturated fats, and is associated with a higher risk of getting heart disease and even Alzheimer's."" He also points out that cheese can be addictive, thanks to its high concentration of casein, a protein that can ignite your brain's opioid receptors.  ""And when it's melted, cheese has a smell that can be even more tempting,"" says Dr Barnard. Mr Benn believes we could see a backlash against cheese dishes as younger people once again embrace healthier diets and clean eating.  More worrying, he feels, is the tendency for companies in this space to focus only on one type of specialist dish.  ""When you launch a one-menu item business, you have to be aware of cyclical trends,"" Mr Benn says. ""Some items can be streaky, like the lobster roll, or follow seasonal patterns."" For now, it doesn't look like the appetite for cheese is waning. Britons eat around 27 grams of cheese per person per day, and other European countries often consume twice that amount. Americans are big fans too.  For this reason, Mr Pollak believes businesses like the Great American Grilled Cheese Kitchen will keep growing. He points to the success of sandwich chains such as Tom + Chee and the Melt Shop which now span the US. ""I strongly believe that a grilled cheese concept could be as big as a Chipotle [which has more than 2,000 branches globally],"" he says.  ""The grilled cheese sandwich has withstood the test of time, and grilled cheese concepts that have launched over the past 5-10 years are living proof of the concept's longevity."""
risk appetite,'I'll vote for you if you save my life',2024-09-15,2020-11-03,By Daniel Rosney,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-54766741,"As I landed in New Orleans ahead of the US election, the thing I noticed first were the masks. Passengers at Louis Armstrong International Airport wore their politics on their faces.  Face coverings were emblazoned with slogans like 'MAGA 2020' - not a souvenir from an all-inclusive to Magaluf but Donald Trump's campaign message to ""make America great again"". Others had 'I Can't Breathe' written on them - a symbolic phrase used in the global black lives matter protests since the summer.  This state of Louisiana is almost certain to remain Republican red, supporting Donald Trump's pitch for another four years in the White House.  ""He's for us and our country,"" a black mother tells me at a gas station stop in Kentwood, worried the America she loves will be taken away if Joe Biden wins.  ""I hope he gets it again,"" a driver calls out of his window before driving off. I find it hard to find anyone here who wants Joe Biden as their leader.  Kentwood, which has a population of about 2000 people, is where Britney Spears grew up. Just up the road from the gas pump there's a museum dedicated to her career.  Its curator - a Republican voter called Miss Fay - says Kentwood is ""the type of town where we pray for each other"". She confirms the area's support for Donald Trump, saying America is stronger with him in charge. ""I think he's been good for the nation,"" she says, standing in front of a reconstruction of Britney's old bedroom - complete with a teddy bear wearing an N-Sync jersey.  ""I know a lot of people say he's a little rough and tumble but that doesn't bother me, he gets things done.""  Louisiana might be where Britney, Frank Ocean, Normani, Lil Wayne and DJ Khaled all began their careers, but the coronavirus pandemic has muted other musicians trying to make it big, especially in New Orleans - the state's biggest city and one that boasts it's ""the birthplace of jazz"".  For 27-year-old vocalist Christien Bold, the past eight months have been financially tough, with gigs cancelled as bars in the city closed their doors.  He says there have been times when he's not had money in his pockets and knows of other musicians who rely on tips to to pay their bills and have been ""left out to dry"". ""There are a lot of poor folks here,"" he says, standing on the empty Frenchmen Street, which he describes as ""the music Mecca of the city"". Christien is voting for the Democrat candidate Joe Biden, claiming ""we're screwed either way"" but ""Biden is a beacon of light"" who can help those struggling with employment.  It's something Pamela, a respiratory therapist from Texas who moved to New Orleans 18 months ago, agrees with.  ""Turn it blue,"" she yells at me in a bar, where she's sheltering from Hurricane Zeta's 110mph winds. She's hoping Louisiana will vote for Joe Biden.  ""I'm embarrassed by Trump,"" she says. ""All the people I meet from other countries, I apologise. I don't want people to think all Americans are buffoons."" Pamela announces, while ordering a vodka soda to buckle in for the hurricane, that Great British Bake Off host Paul Hollywood is her ""fantasy boyfriend because of his most gorgeous blue eyes"". She really is blue through and through.  Derek, celebrating his birthday three seats away, completely disagrees (about the politics, not Paul's allure) believing Donald Trump's message ""appeals to working people and that's what we have in America"". The power goes off and on in the bar as Zeta's strength rips through, but the flooding won't be that bad here, I'm told by Pamela. It's elsewhere in the state that'll get it worse. Emerson Boutte has been preparing for the worst for most of her life, as Louisiana bears the brunt of the United States hurricane season every year.  But this year it's different because for the first time, 18-year-old Emerson has a vote on who gets to lead her country in the fight against climate change. She doesn't know who to choose. ""If one of the candidates would directly address the climate change, coastal erosion and land loss happening in Louisiana, I think that would definitely sway my vote for them,"" she says, nervous about how many days - or weeks - she's going to be without power because of how strong Zeta was.  This state hasn't been a focus in this election campaign - it rarely is.  Both Biden and Trump's teams know it's almost certain to vote Republican like it has in every presidential vote since 2000, which means it's not featured on the rolling news channels as the two candidates don't organise huge rallies here.  It's for that reason many people in Louisiana feel they're not being heard when it comes to their daily battles for survival because politicians don't try as hard to get their vote as they do in other states. ""I want our elected officials to come out here. Come put a human face on this fight that we're battling,"" Shamara Lavigne tells me outside her home in an area nicknamed Cancer Alley.  “We are only fighting for fresh air,"" she says, her two dogs running around nearby - there's also an alligator nearby called Geoffrey. The air tastes notably different in St James Parish and it feels ""ironic"" to Shamara that people in this predominantly black community only started wearing masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, and not because of the toxic emissions. Everybody who lives around here knows someone who either has cancer or has died from it.  They're fighting to stop more industry coming to the area, fearing it could increase the risk of cancer - something the companies dispute. The tweets Donald Trump posts or the adverts Joe Biden pays for have no impact here.  For Shamara's mum Sharon, she has just one request to the two wannabe presidents: ""I want them to save our lives.""  Desperate words I didn't expect to hear covering this election. ""If they can help us with that, they've got my vote"". Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."
risk appetite,Eurostar secures £250m rescue package,2024-09-15,2021-05-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57157376,"Eurostar has managed to secure a £250m rescue package from banks and investors as it continues to battle a severe drop in demand due to the Covid-19 crisis. The funding will help keep it afloat in the medium term, a spokesperson said. The rail operator had warned in November that it was ""fighting for survival"", with its services scaled back dramatically amid the pandemic. Eurostar plans to gradually run more trains should coronavirus restrictions ease as hoped. It is currently only running one train per day between London St Pancras and Paris Gare du Nord, and one a day between Amsterdam and Brussels. The £250m in funding consists of £50m equity from shareholders, £150m in new loans from banks that are guaranteed by shareholders, and £50m from restructured existing bank loans. Eurostar chief executive Jacques Damas said the funding ""will allow us to continue to provide this important service for passengers"". ""The refinancing agreement is the key factor enabling us to increase our services as the situation with the pandemic starts to improve."" Mr Damas added that the coordinated action of governments in the UK and the EU was ""crucial to the restoring of demand and the financial recovery of our business"". The operator said that over the past year it ""has experienced a more severe decline in demand resulting from the global Covid-19 pandemic than any other European train operator or competitor airline."" Eurostar warned in November that it was ""fighting for its survival against a 95% drop in demand"". It called for more support from the UK government after airports were given up to £8m in grants equivalent to business rates. In January, it again called for UK government help, warning that there was ""a real risk"" to its survival. But in February, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that while the government was ""very keen for Eurostar to survive"", he said ""it's not our company"" and its difficulties were ""the shareholders' problem to resolve"". The UK government sold its stake in Eurostar in 2015. Eurostar's majority shareholder is the French state railway group SNCF. Other shareholders include pension funds Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (""CDPQ"") and Federated Hermes, and SNCB, the Belgian state train operator. Eurostar said that it would focus on restoring services on its core routes between London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and that it would maintain ""rigorous cost control"" to repay loans. It said there was a ""growing appetite"" for high-speed rail travel from passengers in light of increasing awareness of climate change and the impact of air travel on the environment. From 27 May, Eurostar will start running two daily return services on the London to Paris route, and three per day from the end of June ""with a view to gradually increasing the frequency over the summer period as travel restrictions are eased"". At present, travellers from the UK must have an ""essential reason"" for visiting France, and need to take Covid tests and self isolate for seven days on arrival. France is currently on the UK government's ""amber list"" for travel, meaning people from the UK need to quarantine for 10 days on their return."
risk appetite,Bank warns about risky business debt,2024-09-15,2018-10-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45797963,"The Bank of England is concerned about the rapid growth in lending to risky UK businesses. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC)  said there had been £31bn of loans this year to companies that already had a high level of debt. The loans are packaged up and sold in global financial markets in a process that has been compared with sub-prime lending before the financial crisis. The Bank also warned about risks to banks from a cliff-edge Brexit. The £31bn total of so-called ""leveraged loans"" to highly indebted businesses compares with £10bn of standard lending by UK banks to this type of company. UK banks are unwilling to make this kind of loan due to the risks involved. The leveraged loans are then ""typically sold to non-bank investors, whose ability to sustain losses without materially impacting financing conditions is uncertain"", the bank said. The FPC said there had been similar increases across Europe and in the US, showing an increased appetite among investors to take risks. The lending, which is mainly done by investment banks, will be reviewed to see if it poses any risk to financial stability and the ability of companies to service their other debts. The Bank of England also said the European Union (EU) should do more to protect cross-border financial services from the risks of a no-deal, or cliff-edge, Brexit, saying there needed to be action. With less than six months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU, the Bank said it saw risks that insurance, derivatives and the transfer of data could face disruption.  ""There has been considerable progress in the UK to address these risks, but only limited progress in the EU,"" the central bank's Financial Policy Committee said. ""In the limited time remaining, it is not possible for companies on their own to mitigate fully the risks of disruption to cross-border financial services. The need for authorities to complete mitigating actions is now pressing."" The Bank said EU or member state rules would restrict EU households and businesses from continuing to use some financial services provided by UK firms.  In some cases, particularly in insurance, UK financial companies were restructuring so they could continue to serve EU customers post-Brexit, it said, adding actions by firms alone could only be only ""partially effective"".   ""Timely action by EU authorities is needed to mitigate risks to financial stability, particularly those associated with derivative contracts and the transfer of personal data."" This is an unusual warning from the Bank's Financial Policy Committee and it highlights the level of worry about a little understood form of lending. What has spooked regulators is the way the leveraged loans are sold to investors around the world is so similar to the repackaging of toxic American mortgages a decade ago. Then there was a sub-prime sales bonanza, led by finance houses which didn't care about the risks, only about the commissions they were earning. Now the situation is different. The borrowers are highly indebted businesses, not households, and banks have much bigger reserves to help them tough out any shocks. But the Bank of England plans to assess the risks and stress-test the banks, to make sure any dangers can be contained."
risk appetite,After Wylfa: Where did it all go wrong?,2024-09-15,2019-01-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46921409,"The Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant this week became the latest high-profile project in Wales that could land on the scrap heap.  The news has raised questions about why projects are failing to materialise. Experts say it is largely due to bad luck, but add that Wales should learn lessons from projects that never saw the light of day.  ""There has to be an investigation into the products investors will take on,"" said Bangor University's Edward Jones. While Wylfa Newydd was by far the most expensive, other projects such as the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and the Severn Barrage were shelved amid concerns over cost and viability. ""Whether that project was in Wales or not was not the deciding factor,"" Chris Sutton of CBI Wales said of the Wylfa scheme. ""Each of these decisions is an investment decision, and the return on investment plays a big part."" He pointed out that the Wylfa nuclear project was ""absolutely phenomenal"" in terms of cost - 10 times the cost of the proposed M4 relief road, another scheme whose future hangs in the balance. ""With Wylfa, the risk is very high in the initial phase,"" Dr Jones, a lecturer in economics said. ""The appetite is there for established infrastructure that can show it is generating cash flow,"" he said. Some of the projects that have been chased in Wales would have taken a long time to get up and running.  ""Things have moved on in the financial world, and the pool of private investors here is very small,"" he added. But the simple fact of being ""on the fringes"" of Great Britain can also mean Wales misses out, Mr Sutton argued. Plans to electrify the Great Western Railway line between Cardiff and Swansea were scrapped in 2017.  That decision, Mr Sutton said, could be due to the fact other parts of the project - the route is being electrified from London to Cardiff - have come in over budget. Then there is the question of whether it will be worth the money. The proposed Circuit of Wales race track was effectively killed off in June 2017 when ministers rejected a request by the Heads of the Valleys Development Company - the firm behind the project - to guarantee almost half the funding.  The company claimed it would create up to 6,000 jobs in an unemployment black spot in Blaenau Gwent. It would have spent £433m building a racing circuit and a ""365-day leisure and business destination"". Investors will come in to Wales, but you need to generate the assets to invest in first, and that is often too high risk, Mr Sutton pointed out. Success stories While the headlines have focused on the bad news, there have also been success stories. The Celtic Manor, near Newport, has seen significant investment creating temporary jobs in construction and permanent jobs at its resort and hotel complex and forthcoming convention centre. There has also been significant investment into education - Swansea University's £450m Bay Campus - and health, such as the new £350m hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen. ""There is a willingness to do those schemes of £50m to £100m, but how do you procure projects starting at £1bn?"" Mr Sutton asked.  The new National Infrastructure Commission for Wales, which met for the first time in November, may produce some of the answers."
risk appetite,'I've gone months with no information on the future',2024-09-15,2020-10-15,By Philippa Goodrich,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54559888,"Kate Hughes is one of thousands of staff in the Edinburgh Woollen Mill group facing further uncertainty about her job, after the company declared its intention to appoint administrators a week ago. Kate, who was the manager of a Jaeger shop in Alloa, near Stirling, found out that the company was seeking help to save the business when she switched on the lunchtime news a week ago.  ""Both my husband and I just sat there and looked at each other and said, 'Really?'"" It wasn't until later that afternoon that an email arrived from the company, explaining its position, but, said Kate, it contained ""no information about going forward"". The Edinburgh Woollen Mill group (EWM), which owns the Peacocks and Jaeger clothing brands, as well as the Edinburgh Woollen Mill shops themselves, described current trading conditions as ""brutal"". It said it had made the move towards appointing administrators because, ""it gives us a short breathing space while we weigh up options for the group.""   Those options, it said, might include a sale of some or all of the businesses, as well as ""significant cost-cutting and closures"". Across its brands 21,000 jobs are now at risk while the talks continue to try to find a solution for the group, which is owned by billionaire Philip Day. The groups also owns fashion chain Bonmarche, but its future is not part of the current negotiations. Other EWM staff who have contacted the BBC say the first they or their colleagues heard of the potential closures was when the ""Closing Down"" posters were delivered to shops last Friday morning. ""Our area managers are telling us: 'Just behave like normal, and pretend nothing's happening'. They're not telling us anything"", said one employee, who didn't want to be named, and added that it's difficult to know what to tell the customers. ""We know as much as they do. I could just record myself on a daily loop saying: 'No, we don't know anything. No, we don't have a date.'"" Like many High Street retailers, the EWM group has suffered from the shift in buying habits from physical stores to online. This trend was accelerated by lockdown, when non-essential shops were forced to close. EWM took advantage of the help offered by the government, and like the majority of its employees, Kate Hughes was furloughed in March. When lockdown restrictions were eased in the summer she received an email to say that her store would re-open. But then the company changed its mind and she found herself going into the shop to pack it up.   It is now closed, and Kate doesn't know if she will be redeployed, or can expect a redundancy notice. At this stage she assumes it will be the latter.  ""I can't see it going any other way"", she says. ""I can appreciate the fact that times are difficult in the retail sector,"" she adds, ""but it's the lack of information and the lack of interest in the staff. There has been no emotional support whatsoever"". Another employee, whose store closed down three weeks ago, and who also asked to remain anonymous, echoed the complaint about the lack of information since the onset of the pandemic. ""The company have treated myself and my team in an appalling way"", she said. ""All through lockdown there was no communication, or mixed messages and it will not improve now. ""I have not received any notice of redundancy or consultation"", she added. EWM group says it is aware of its employees' feelings. A spokeswoman told the BBC that as soon as EWM group had filed its intention to appoint administrators, letting the staff know was its ""first priority"". Affected groups were informed immediately, before the news was shared with the media, she said. EWM has appointed business advisory company FRP to review its operations. That review is expected to last around two weeks, during which time the company is protected from its creditors. At the end of this process a decision will be taken as to whether there is a future for the business as a going concern, or whether the only option is for it to go into administration. ""We appreciate the current uncertainty over jobs is unsettling for employees. Management is working hard to save the business and preserve as many jobs as possible across our stores"", the spokeswoman said.  ""As soon as we can communicate which jobs have been saved we will be in touch directly with employees to inform them.""  But some employees have no appetite for waiting any longer. Kate Hughes is already looking for other jobs, and is ready to take whatever is available.   She summed up her situation like this: ""I've gone from being a manager, to interviewing for a part-time job in a coffee shop"", she said."
risk appetite,Extended pub opening times come into effect in NI,2024-09-15,2021-10-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58749070,"Pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland will be able to stay open longer after changes to liquor licensing laws came into effect on Friday. The changes mean pubs and clubs can apply to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00 BST. Drinking-up time will also be extended to one hour, meaning pubs and clubs can stay open to 03:00. Easter drinking restrictions have also been removed in the first changes to NI licensing laws in 25 years. Restrictions on late opening on Sundays have also been removed. The Department for Communities (DfC) said it will be some time before businesses can take advantage of the new laws as applications could take about three weeks to process. Some of the changes happening from today include: It is hoped the extended hours will see a boost for the hospitality sector in the lead up to the Christmas period. Micro breweries and gin distilleries must wait for the introduction of secondary legislation on 1 April before they can apply for licences to sell their own produce in tap rooms, off sales and online, according to the DfC. Alcohol licences for cinemas will also be available from 1 April 2022, bringing them into the same category as theatres, ballrooms and race tracks. Petra Wolsey, of the Beannchor Group which owns a number of hotels, bars, and restaurants, said it was a ""really positive step in the right direction""  ""I'm delighted to see it,"" she added. ""It's been a long time coming, there's been a lot of work behind the scenes to get us to this point."" She added: ""The timing is unfortunate [with the pandemic], but we'll make it work. ""By virtue that all of us are going to take a little bit of time to get through the process of acquiring the new licences, that's going to take a matter of weeks and I would be hopeful that by that stage we'll be out the other end of all the social distancing requirements and so forth."" Connaire McGreevy is the founder of Mourne Mountains Brewery and has had applied to build a tap room at his premises. ""Delighted that we are now seeing the modernisation of licensing in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""We are waiting until April of next year before the changes will impact us fully, but that is welcome too because it gives us time to prepare what those changes mean to us such as the tap room."" He added: ""We've turned people away, we've turned busloads of people away - American tourists in particular have turned up here over the past six years of operation and we've had to say 'sorry, no can do'. ""So April next year we'll get the licence, we're now going to push on and get this built so we're ready to go."" Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said the changes will give ""more flexibility"" to pub and hotel licence holders ""particularly in the lead up to Christmas and the New Year"". She added that the increased drinking-up time - the period which customers have to finish their final drinks and leave the pub - will support a ""more gradual dispersal of people from licensed premises"". The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster said the new rules will give a much needed boost to the industry. ""We are still in restrictions so it will limit use of the new laws maybe for the next few months but there's a real appetite for business,"" Colin Neill told BBC News NI. ""They see the opportunities here and indeed, coming out of a period where we've done nothing but gather debt, this will give us an opportunity to actually make businesses more viable and bring down debt."" However, Jerry Maguire, a bar worker and trade union representative, said the majority of his union's membership were opposed to extended opening hours. ""What we want to see is the premises' duty of care being extended to staff,"" he said. ""We're seeing back-up of taxis and a lot of pub-goers would be waiting on the streets for hours. ""We don't want to see our staff and workers being put at risk by having to wait longer to get transport home."" Gary McMichael of the alcohol and drug campaign group ASCERT said the move increased the need for pub and club owners to be responsible so that they were not ""selling drink hand over fist and ignoring the harms to the customers"". Changes to the Licensing and Registration of Clubs (Amendment) Bill brings many of Northern Ireland's rules around alcohol sales in line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. It marks a significant liberalisation of Northern Ireland's laws on alcohol that has been in the making for nine years. A previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Féin, who share power together at Stormont.

risk appetite,Is it safe to live on a former landfill site?,2024-09-15,2017-06-20,By Laura Harmes,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40308598,"With the need for more housing, developers are moving in to build on top of former landfill sites. But how safe are these places, and should people be concerned about living on top of them? The UK dumps nearly 50 million tonnes of industrial, commercial and domestic waste into landfill sites every year - enough rubbish to fill Wembley Stadium to the brim more than 50 times over. The process is tightly regulated. Meticulous records are kept of what we dump and where we dump it.  But landfill hasn't always been this well managed - and Britain's appetite in years gone by for filling huge holes in the ground with waste is beginning to haunt us. There are 20,000 former landfill sites across the UK - 1,200 of them are on England's coastline. File on 4 has had exclusive access to an unpublished report commissioned by the Environment Agency, looking at these sites and the impact of flooding and coastal erosion. Prof Kate Spencer from Queen Mary University of London led the investigation and has now raised serious concerns about the impact not only on the environment - but on public health. One example can be found on Clinker Beach in East Tilbury, along the foreshore of the River Thames in Essex, where a layer of old clothes and plastics hangs out of a muddy bank. The spot has become a popular spot for treasure hunters. ""You see people rummaging through it, picking up bits of material and taking them home. Certainly I wouldn't touch any of this without gloves,"" says Kate. ""Here on the floor you can see these little black cylinders - they're the cells from inside old batteries and we know that batteries used to contain lead and mercury. We've analysed the waste and it contains pretty much all the nasty chemicals that you can think of at concentrations that would be predicted to cause significant ecological harm."" She says it would cost billions of pounds to clean up all the sites so it is important to identify which pose the biggest threat. ""We need to come up with some suitable management scenarios. The ultimate responsibility either lies with the local authority or with the Environment Agency but I don't think they have the resources to deal with it.""  In 1990, the Environmental Protection Act set out a regime for regulating and licensing the disposal of controlled waste.  One site in Dunbar, on the east coast of Scotland, handles 5,000 tonnes of waste every week from Edinburgh, which is around 30 miles away.  ""Before we put any waste in, we put in a metre of engineered clay,"" explains site manager Barry Falgate. ""Then it's lined with a heavy duty plastic, then gravel on top, which catches the water which comes from the waste as it degrades. ""Then, when we've finished, we put plastic over the top and then we put soils on it. We have the aftercare of this site for at least 60 years, so we want to make sure that that waste is safe and we can control the waters and gases out of it. I was brought up around here so I care what we do."" The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs used to offer grants to local authorities to clean up contaminated land, via the Contaminated Land Capital Projects (CLCP) programme. This funding stream came to an end in March this year.   In Amber Valley in Derbyshire battle lines are being drawn, where a developer wants to build 200 homes on a former landfill site. ""My mum stopped growing vegetables because of what was under the ground here,"" says campaigner Kellie Judson. ""We used to get foul smells on my mum's garden when I was a little girl - a TCP smell and an eggy smell."" Amber Valley Rugby Club now occupies the former landfill site - but they've been offered brand new facilities by the developer if they move.  Underground testing has shown that remedial work could make the area safe, but Kellie and other residents are worried about an adjacent former landfill which contains known hazardous waste. ""We're concerned that contamination from the other site could potentially leach on to this one - that disturbing the ground in this area could pose a threat to people living locally,"" she says.  The development has twice been turned down by the planning board of Amber Valley Borough Council and it goes before the planning inspectorate next month.  Whether it goes ahead or not, little will be done to further risk assess the surrounding area unless something new emerges, because government guidelines don't demand it.  The deputy leader of the council, Trevor Ainsworth, supports the development plans.  ""There are things in the ground that, on the face of it, would be dangerous to human health. However I know it can be remediated and made safe. It is one of our policies that we regenerate land that has been used as tips - lots of houses now have been built safely on old tips,"" he says. A spokesman for Defra told the BBC: ""Our revised Statutory Guidance means more resource can be directed to those sites most in need and allows local authorities to take a more stringent, risk-based approach when identifying and cleaning up contaminated land."" The Local Government Association said: ""Councils take this issue very seriously and work closely with the Environment Agency, continuing to monitor sites long after they have closed.""

risk appetite,Giant lungs greet shoppers in new cancer campaign,2024-09-15,2023-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-67276875,"A giant pair of inflatable lungs will greet shoppers in Hull on Wednesday as part of a cancer awareness campaign. The unusual display at St Stephen's shopping centre kicks off a month-long nationwide tour during November. A recent survey of over 2,000 adults in England found just 41% consult a GP if they had a cough for three weeks or more, a possible sign of lung cancer. The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation said the event aimed to reach people who may not realise they were at risk. Chief executive Paula Chadwick said: ""It is staggering that half of those surveyed still do not know how prevalent lung cancer is.  ""We believe this stems from a reluctance to talk about lung cancer, and that is largely because of its links to smoking and associated stigma.   ""That's why these events are so important. They give us the opportunity to have one-on-one conversations with people who may not realise they are at risk, who may not recognise potential symptoms or may feel unable to act on them, or are too fearful to. ""If we can help one person in Hull get diagnosed earlier when lung cancer can often be treated with curative intent, then that is worth doing."" Dr Dan Cottingham, Cancer Research UK GP Lead for Humber and North Yorkshire Cancer Alliance, said: ""People diagnosed with lung cancer at the earliest stage are nearly 20 times more likely to survive for five years than those whose cancer is caught late. ""It is important to ensure people know what signs to look out for and to encourage anyone experiencing symptoms of lung cancer to contact their GP without delay."" The main symptoms of lung cancer include: Dr Cottingham said: ""A lung health check can help to identify lung cancer and other respiratory diseases early, often before symptoms have occurred and when treatment could be simpler and more successful. I would urge anyone invited to take up the opportunity of a free lung health check - even if you feel fine.""   The Let's Talk Lung Cancer roadshow will be at St Stephen's shopping centre in Hull from 10:00-16:00 GMT on Wednesday. The Hull event is the first of 10 around the country during November. Other locations include Middlesbrough, Warrington, Leicester, London, Bournemouth, Rochdale, Morecambe, Sheffield and Leeds.

risk appetite,How old brands become cool again,2024-09-15,2023-10-27,Hilary George-Parkin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231026-the-billion-dollar-brands-spending-big-to-go-from-stale-to-chic,"Iconic brands including Coors and Jello-O are revitalising themselves to win over new audiences as consumer tastes change. Throughout the past 150 years, Coors has been many things: beloved beer brand of the American West; survivor of Prohibition; aluminium can innovator; boycott target and, later, beneficiary; household name and on the receiving end of more than a few jokes. Today, the brand is changing shape again as it confronts a new reality in its home market: US consumers are drinking less beer. In a landscape replete with hard seltzers, spirits and all flavours of booze-free fizzy waters, more people are looking to alternative beverages. The shift has been underway for several years, and in 2022, US spirit sales surpassed beer sales for the first time ever. Molson Coors, the multinational company behind Coors, Miller, Blue Moon, Keystone Light and dozens of other popular beer brands, recorded a 5% or 2.2 million-barrel decline in US volume last year, according to data from the Boulder-based Brewers Association, first reported by Axios. Executives have acknowledged consumers' changing ""lifestyle choices"" and the ""softness in the beer industry"" on earnings calls. Yet they've also painted a characteristically optimistic picture of the road ahead. This is partly because the company has prepared for these transformations: its biggest brands are today on an upward trajectory in sales and market share, and it has steered its product line-up towards growing categories like whiskey and energy drinks in recent years. To keep up with the pace of culture, brands are in a constant state of reinvention, from changes as subtle as a tweaked typeface, to wholesale overhauls of their portfolios and positionings. Rebrands can help a cereal box stand out on a shelf, make an insurance company's logo look cleaner on a phone screen, draw attention to the star ingredient in a new shampoo or convey a tech conglomerate's expanded scope. ""If they're done right, they're barely perceptible to the audience,"" says Deb Gabor, the US-based founder and CEO of Sol Marketing and the author of several books on branding. ""Everyday consumers just feel more resonance and emotional connection and indispensability from the brand."" Appetite for evolution Coming out of the pandemic, Gabor says she is seeing a wave of companies eager to revitalise their brands to adapt to the seismic changes in consumers' lifestyles, habits and priorities. Coors, after all, is hardly the only brand that's facing a challenging market and fresh competition. Bankrupt businesses including retailers Bed, Bath & Beyond and JCPenney are getting expensive revamps under new ownership; toy company Mattel is blanketing pop culture in all things Barbie to give the decades-old doll a new lease on life; and companies including software provider Zoom and pharmaceutical company Pfizer have rolled out new logos to draw attention to their investments in accessibility and biopharma innovation, respectively. Rebrands tend to be expensive, years-long processes – especially for massive global organisations operating across numerous channels. But if they're executed well, they can take a declining business and turn it into a powerhouse, or make an old name feel relevant to a new generation.  A great brand can sell products, connect with customers, attract great employees and open investors' wallets. Copious research has shown consumers are willing to pay more for brands they trust – and this translates to huge, potential earnings for these companies. This hard-won value also makes reinvention a riskier proposition, however. Even when leaders recognise the need to evolve, they're often wary of major changes, says Rick Wise, CEO of Lippincott, a global creative consultancy that has spearheaded rebrands for companies including Starbucks, Samsung, Walmart and Southwest Airlines.  ""Typically in an organisation, you've got lots of fondness for the brand, and lots of trepidation about messing with the brand,"" he says, ""so you want to be really, really measured and adopt a stewardship approach."" The first step his team takes is to diagnose where a brand is losing relevance or falling behind its competition. Next, it assesses how much of that can be traced back to the company's messaging and presentation versus what it is offering customers. ""You could have the best brand in the world, but if you're selling a car that doesn't start, it's not going to matter what you do with the branding,"" he says. While a new logo or campaign may be a cue for consumers to reconsider a company, these visual elements must reflect real improvements to the product or experience, he says, or else people may walk away disillusioned. Surface-level changes can erode trust instead of building it. ""The best brands in the world, when they go through a rebranding, they start with strategy first, not with a desire to just have a creative update,"" says Gabor. ""Actions speak louder than marketing."" Risk and reward When Lippincott worked with Starbucks about a decade ago to modernise its brand, the company was gearing up for a new chapter of international growth and investments in categories beyond coffee. Looking back, then, it makes sense the brand would drop the words ""Starbucks Coffee"" from its logo, and focus all attention on its smiling siren icon – a symbol that's recognisable around the world without the aid of Google Translate.  Still, the decision was controversial at the time, with fans throwing virtual tomatoes at the design in Starbucks' Facebook comments, and critics mocking the dystopian future its minimalism seemed to signal. It didn't help that it was unveiled while two infamous rebranding failures were still fresh in the public's memory. Months prior, retailer Gap ditched its blue-boxed serif logo in favour of a Helvetica font appended with a small blue square – a change that lasted less than a week under the weight of online outcry. Before that, there was Tropicana's widely panned move from its signature straw-in-orange packaging to a design depicting a plain glass of orange juice. This, too, was quickly dropped, but not before costing the brand 20% of its sales on top of the $35m (£28.74m) paid out in marketing expenses.  Unlike these cases, however, Starbucks' 2011 rebrand has since been generally hailed among the design and marketing sectors as a success, with the brand's visual identity carrying through to new product launches, store remodels and packaging updates. Tapping into new markets Beyond setting the stage for business development, rebrands can act as overtures to new audiences. Jell-O, for example, unveiled a new look in August that has been lauded as a savvy invitation to young consumers. The redesigned packaging features brighter colours, a chubby sans-serif font and glossy renderings of jelly fruits and pudding swirls. ""The art on Jell-O's packaging feels fun and evokes the 'jiggle' and playfulness of the product,"" says Heather Johnson Dretsch, an assistant professor of marketing at North Carolina State University's Poole College of Management. For a heritage name like Jell-O, which was founded in 1845 and last rebranded in 2013, it makes sense to rejuvenate the design to appeal to the fun, exuberant branding Gen Z gravitates toward, she says. Coors, meanwhile, has taken a multipronged approach to winning over fresh markets. Its parent company has followed through on its plan to diversify beyond beer – which it signalled in 2019 with its name change from Molson Coors Brewing Company to Molson Coors Beverage Company. Today, Coors Spirits Co includes two brands developed in-house, Five Trail whiskey and Barmen 1873 bourbon, as well as the premium bourbon brand Blue Run Spirits, acquired in August. The company has also recently doubled down on its investment in Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's energy drink brand Zoa and its partnership with The Coca-Cola Company on Simply Spiked Lemonade and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. These categories are expected to account for a large portion of the company's growth in the coming years, but it's not letting its beer brands languish, either. It's leaning into Coors' history – until the early 1980s, the beer wasn't sold east of the Mississippi River, lending it a unique cultural cachet – with an anniversary campaign and partnership with the hit television series Yellowstone. Blue Moon is also getting fresh packaging and a new non-alcoholic line geared at the fast-growing share of consumers reaching for booze-free beer. Rebrands are never guaranteed to win over consumers – companies don't go through them unless they see they see their sales or market share shrinking, points out Gabor – but in its 150 years, Coors has overcome more urgent threats than consumers' wandering tastes. For nearly two decades under American Prohibition, it was forbidden to brew beer at all. From Gabor's perspective, the company is making thoughtful strides into the future. ""They're trying to preserve the parts of the brand itself that are still meaningful and resonant to people while they innovate in other directions,"" she says. ""In many ways, what they're doing today is making what was old new again."""
risk appetite,How can we make washing machines last?,2024-09-15,2021-03-03,By Maddy Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56167505,"When his family washing machine stopped working just a few months outside its warranty, Johan Rääf was less than impressed. ""It was really strange because it's not been used every day, or not even that much,"" says the 36-year-old from Stockholm. Like many Swedish parents, Mr Rääf deals with the constant stream of laundry generated by his two small children by using the larger communal washers available in his apartment block, alongside the machine in his own flat. ""So, it was a problem that needed to be fixed, but it wasn't like my life depended on it,"" he laughs. He paid a local repair firm 1,500 Swedish krona (£130; $180) to provide and fit a replacement part the following day; making use of a Swedish tax break which halves the cost of hiring people to repair white goods in your home. But fixing things that break down often isn't that easy, cost-effective or even desirable. Most of us tend to replace things that break instead of mending them. More Technology of Business According to iFixit, which campaigns for the right-to-repair, at least 30% of electric and electronic products are discarded when they are still in a repairable state. This kind of rubbish is becoming one of the world's fastest growing waste streams. Many customers don't repair household items simply because they have become more affordable to produce and buy new, in recent decades, says Thomas Opsomer, a spokesperson for iFixit. He estimates that the price of a new washing machine adjusted for inflation is between 10 and 20 times cheaper now than it would have been in the 1960s.  ""If a new appliance is very cheap, then already that makes the case for repair harder,"" he says. At Lund University in southern Sweden, sustainable business researcher Jessika Luth Richter says there's also been a big cultural shift in how we value things we own.  We live in an ""age of fast consumption"" where gadgets have become viewed as ""disposable"" and ""it's fashionable to upgrade our products to the latest models available"", she says.  Meanwhile, brands are in tough competition with one another, and seek to lure us in with special offers and speedy delivery options to encourage us to buy new products and enjoy the ""instant gratification or instant hit"". Washing machine makers might not agree with that. Britain's Ebac already designs its washing machines to last 10 years. Founder and chief executive John Elliott thinks most washing machines are ""quite well built"", but does have his doubts about the cheapest ones on the market. ""There's some cheap washing machines - they sell them at a price lower than we can buy the components. That tells you something, doesn't it?"" While Mr Rääf was able to find a company in his Stockholm neighbourhood to fix his washing machine, Ms Luth Richter says the number of local repair stores has fallen across Europe, as our appetite for this kind of fast consumption has grown. That means even customers who want to live more sustainably can find it hard to source the expertise to fix broken products at an affordable price. iFixit's research suggests people aren't willing to pay repair costs that amount to more than 30% of the price of a new product. ""What most of them are feeling is that they don't know what it will cost and they don't know when they can get it [repaired]. And that makes all the difference,"" agrees Måns Ljungmark, a manager at Swedish appliance brand Electrolux, which has its headquarters in Stockholm. The company's actively trying to encourage more customers to fix broken products as it tries to become a more sustainable business. It has increased its online and phone advice, to help enable customers to carry out simple repairs themselves. Plus, it is trialling a £150 (1,785kr) flat fee repairs service in parts of Sweden and in Denmark.  ""We are taking a risk because some repairs are more expensive and some repairs are less expensive, because we want to enable repairs,"" says Mr Ljungmark. The initiative could drive down profits from new sales, he accepts, but he hopes the business will still benefit in the long run, from ""building loyalty and trust"". So far the flat-fee service is proving popular, with a 20% increase in bookings during 2020. In Sweden, it's been enabled by the same tax break Johan Rääf used to fix his washing machine. White goods repairs have increased steadily since they were included in the scheme (known as ROT) in 2017, and jumped by 16% in 2020.  There's a lack of data on customer motivations, but the Swedish Tax Agency and manufacturers like Electrolux speculate that job losses and economic uncertainty brought on by the pandemic may be encouraging more people to repair rather than splash out on newer products. Sustainability campaigners want more countries to offer similar tax incentives or other ""economic levers"" to help promote repairs. But with public finances already squeezed during the pandemic, that could be a challenge even for governments with a strong environmental agenda.  Another method is punishing manufacturers that make it deliberately tricky to repair products. In the EU a new law has just come in, forcing firms to supply spare parts for machines for up to 10 years and to design products to make them longer-lasting. The rules apply to washing machines, dishwashers, fridges and lighting. Repairs should be possible with commonly-available tools and without damaging the product. Campaigners say it is a step in the right direction. But the law doesn't specify anything about the price of parts. Plus only professionals, not consumers, will be able carry out the repairs, a move backed by manufacturers who were worried about risk and liability. At iFixit, Mr Opsomer is also worried that as products in our homes become more high-tech and connected, this could ""introduce new possibilities for failure and make things harder to fix"". But manufacturers like Electrolux argue the opposite. Måns Ljungmark says that as our household products become smarter, this will actually help enable repairs and longevity. For example, if your dishwasher can suggest when you need to rinse a filter, this may prevent a future breakdown.  However this still leaves consumers with a dilemma: buy a shiny new smart product designed to enable sustainability, or repair something older with fewer functions. Sustainability specialists insist it is almost always both cheaper and more sustainable to stick with what you've got. If you throw away a product, you're both contributing to the two billion tonnes of rubbish the world generates each year, and adding to the planet's carbon footprint by buying a new item, often made from newly-mined materials.  But experts are split on whether profit-driven companies or fast-consuming customers will really be able to adjust their habits. ""As long as it is more profitable for a company to sell a new product than to repair that product, a company will be under very much pressure from their shareholders to do just that,"" argues Mr Opsomer.  Jessika Luth Richter is more optimistic that it will become both easier and trendier to fix stuff in future. ""The more people that are repairing and are choosing to buy repair services or more repairable products, the more we will see this becoming mainstream,"" she says.  ""And it used to be mainstream. So that's what makes me positive too, that. It is in some ways a return to what we used to be able as a society to do more of."""
risk appetite,Call for credit card freeze on porn sites,2024-09-15,2020-05-07,By Megha Mohan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52543508,"Major credit card companies should block payments to pornographic sites, according to a group of international campaigners and campaign groups who say they work to tackle sexual exploitation. A letter seen by the BBC, signed by more than 10 campaigners and campaign groups, says porn sites ""eroticise sexual violence, incest, and racism"" and stream content that features child sexual abuse and sex trafficking. One leading site, Pornhub, said ""the letter [was] not only factually wrong but also intentionally misleading."" Mastercard told the BBC they were investigating claims made in the letter on pornography sites and would ""terminate their connection to our network"" if illegal activity by a cardholder was confirmed. The letter was sent to 10 major credit card companies, including the ""Big Three"", Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The signatories from countries including the UK, US, India, Uganda and Australia have called for the immediate suspension of payments to pornographic sites. The signatories of the letter include the anti-pornography non-profit group the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) in the US, and other faith-led or women and child rights' advocacy groups.  The letter alleges it is impossible to ""judge or verify consent in any videos on their site, let alone live webcam videos"" which ""inherently makes pornography websites a target for sex traffickers, child abusers, and others sharing predatory nonconsensual videos"". ""We've been seeing an increasingly global outcry about the harms of pornography sharing websites in a number of ways in recent months,"" said Haley McNamara, the director of the UK-based International Centre on Sexual Exploitation, the international arm of the NCOSE and a signatory of the letter. ""We in the international child advocacy and anti-sexual exploitation community are demanding financial institutions to critically analyse their supportive role in the pornography industry, and to cut ties with them,"" she told the BBC. A report on the appetite for child abuse videos on pornography sites was published in April by India Child Protection Fund (ICPF). The organisation said there had been a steep increase in demand for child abuse searches on pornography sites in India, particularly since coronavirus lockdown. Pornhub, the most popular pornography streaming site, is named in the letter. In 2019, it registered more than 42 billion visits, the equivalent of 115 million a day. Pornhub was under scrutiny last year when one of its content providers - Girls Do Porn - became the subject of an FBI investigation.  The FBI charged four people working for the production company that created the channel of coaxing women into making pornographic films under false pretences. Pornhub removed the Girls Do Porn channel as soon as the charges were made. Commenting to the BBC in February regarding this case, Pornhub said its policy was to ""remove unauthorised content as soon as we are made aware of it, which is exactly what we did in this case"". In October last year a 30-year-old Florida man, Christopher Johnson, faced charges for sexually abusing a 15 year old. Videos of the alleged attack had been posted on Pornhub. In the same statement to the BBC in February, Pornhub said its policy was to ""remove unauthorised content as soon as we are made aware of it, which is exactly what we did in this case"". The Internet Watch Foundation, a UK organisation that specialises in monitoring online sexual abuse - particularly of children - confirmed to the BBC that they had found 118 instances of child sexual abuse and child rape videos on Pornhub between 2017 and 2019. The body works in partnership with global police and governments to flag illegal content. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Pornhub said they had ""a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting any and all illegal content, including non-consensual and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate."" ""Our content moderation system is at the forefront of the industry, utilising leading technologies and moderation techniques that create a comprehensive process to detect and rid the platform of any illegal content. Pornhub said the letter was sent by organisations ""who attempt to police people's sexual orientation and activity - are not only factually wrong but also intentionally misleading."" American Express has had a global policy in place since 2000 that says it prohibits transactions for adult digital content where the risk is deemed unusually high, with a total ban on online pornography.  In an interview with the Smartmoney website in 2011, a spokesperson for American Express at the time said this was due to high levels of disputes, and an additional safeguard in the fight against child pornography. Yet, the organisations also sent the letters to American Express, because they say American Express payment options have been offered on pornography sites - including one that specialises in teenage themed content.  A spokesperson for American Express told the BBC that while the global policy still stood, American Express had a pilot with one company that allowed for payment to certain pornography streaming websites if the payment was made within the US and on a US consumer credit card. Other major credit card companies, including Visa and MasterCard, do allow both credit and debit card holders to purchase online pornography.  In an email to the BBC, a spokesperson for Mastercard said they were ""currently investigating the claims referred to us in the letter. ""The way our network works is that a bank connects a merchant to our network to accept card payments.  ""If we confirm illegal activity or violations of our rules (by card holders), we will work with the merchant's bank to either bring them into compliance or to terminate their connection to our network.  ""This is consistent with how we have previously worked with law enforcement agencies and groups like National and International Centers for Missing and Exploited Children."" Some moves have been made by online payment companies to distance themselves from the pornography industry.  In November 2019, Paypal, the global online payment company, announced it would no longer be supporting payments to Pornhub as their policy forbids supporting ""certain sexually oriented materials or services"".  In a blog on their site, Pornhub said they were ""devastated"" by the decision and the move would leave thousands of Pornhub models and performers who relied on subscription from the premium services without payment.  A pornography performer who shares material on Pornhub, and who asked to remain anonymous, said a payment freeze would have devastating implications for her earnings. ""Honestly, it would be a body blow,"" she said. ""It would wipe out my entire income and I wouldn't know how to earn money, especially now in lockdown."" Following mounting pressure for more accountability from pornographic sites, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska sent a letter to the US Department of Justice in March asking Attorney General William Barr to investigate Pornhub for allegedly streaming acts of rape and exploitation. In the same month, nine Canadian multi-party parliamentarians wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling for an investigation into MindGeek, the parent company of Pornhub which has its headquarters in Montreal. Signatories of the letter: International Centre on Sexual Exploitation, UK,  National Center on Sexual Exploitation, US,  Collective Shout, Australia  European Network of Migrant Women, Belgium Word Made Flesh Bolivia, Bolivia Media Health for Children and Youth, Denmark FiLiA, England Apne Aap, India Survivor Advocate, Ireland African Network for the Prevention and Protection against Child Abuse and Neglect, Liberia The Reward Foundation, Scotland Talita, Sweden The Boys' Mentorship Programme, Uganda"
risk appetite,How US death penalty capital changed its mind,2024-09-15,2018-02-11,By James Jeffrey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42984170,"Texas remains the strictest applicant of the US death penalty but its increasing reluctance to put criminals to death reflects a national trend.  Kent Whitaker supported the death penalty until his son, who arranged for a gunman to kill Mr Whitaker and the rest of his family, landed on death row in Texas.  Now Mr Whitaker, the sole survivor of the attack, is desperately seeking clemency for Thomas Whitaker before his execution scheduled on 22 February.  ""The petition is based on a legal overstep that shouldn't have happened,"" says Mr Whitaker. ""The district attorney chose to pursue the death penalty despite every victim involved, myself, the relatives of my wife, begging him not to do it."" Shot in the upper chest in the 2003 attack, Mr Whitaker barely survived the ambush after hearing the sound of the bullets that killed his youngest, Kevin, a college sophomore, and his wife Tricia. Mr Whitaker has asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to recommend to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to commute his son's sentence to life in prison. ""I'm not asking them to forgive him as that's not their business,"" he says.  ""But I don't want on 22 February to have to relive what happened to Tricia and Kevin, and lose the last member of my direct family in the name of justice that I think is wrong.""   Despite Mr Whitaker's predicament, both executions and the awarding of death sentences are actually decreasing in Texas, reflecting a nationwide trend. ""The culture now is different,"" says Kristin Houlé, executive director of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (TCADP). ""There isn't the same appetite for it from either the public or elected officials.""  Since 1976 and the US Supreme Court upholding capital punishment, 1,468 people have been executed in the US - 548 in Texas.  Harris County became known as the execution capital of America when it was executing the highest number of people in all of Texas' counties. But for the last three years, it has not imposed any death sentences, while 2017 was the first year since 1985 it did not execute anyone.  Executions in Texas peaked in 2000 when there were 40. Last year there were seven, matching 2016 for the lowest number of executions in two decades, amid a national total of 23.  ""Whatever happens in Texas does have a ripple effect because it has been so notorious for its death penalty practices,"" says Ms Houlé. ""So any move away has a significant impact on the rest of the country.""   The shift in opinion - increasingly in conservative circles, too - follows decades of death penalty use during which it has proven exorbitantly expensive compared to putting someone in prison for life, ineffective in making society safer, while open to manipulation from ambitious prosecutors and old-fashioned human error, observers say.    ""More people know about the risks of innocent people being executed after TV programmes like 60 Minutes,"" says Heather Beaudoin, of Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty. ""They're thinking: 'Wow, this can happen - are we willing to risk it?'"" Other concerns include: drug shortages for lethal injections adding to the bureaucratic maelstrom and expense; increased mistrust of government; and botched executions leaving victims and relatives of the condemned and prison guards traumatised.  ""The death penalty wouldn't have survived in America if it weren't for evangelical Christians,"" notes Shane Claiborne, a prominent Christian activist and best-selling author.  ""Where evangelical Christians are most concentrated is where the death penalty survives.""  But, Mr Claiborne notes, younger evangelicals in states like Texas are increasingly embracing a pro-life interpretation that goes beyond the confines of the abortion debate to also include the likes of the Black Lives Matter movement, immigration and those on death row.   Meanwhile, the 2005 introduction in Texas courts of life without parole as a sentencing option in capital cases has helped decrease the number of death sentences and executions.  ""When you sit with a victim's family and say it could take 10 years for an execution or they can be done with it now [through a life sentence without parole], they say they want to move on with their lives,"" says Texas criminal defence lawyer Keith Hampton, who is representing the Whitaker clemency case.  Another change in the Texas criminal justice landscape that's had an impact is increasing scepticism about gauging the ""future dangerousness"" a felon poses to society, which plays a critical role in the awarding of death sentences in only Texas and Oregon. ""When it comes to so-called lethal prediction you might as well gaze into a crystal ball, the predictions are that unreliable,"" Mr Hampton says. ""Studies show, and prison staff report, that those serving life sentences are the best behaved.""  As a result, Mr Hampton explains, prosecutors know juries are less willing to tolerate the pursuit of a death sentence and the additional expense and time it involves.   Those who support the death penalty point out the decreasing trend also reflects a nationwide drop in murder rates, and that the death penalty continues playing an effective role, and retains public support, with the small percentage of eligible homicides.    ""Watching an execution is the most mentally draining experience, but it should be utilised for those who commit the most heinous, diabolical, despicable crimes known to man that cry out for the ultimate punishment,"" says Andy Kahan, a crime victim advocate for the City of Houston, who has accompanied victims to witness eight executions.  ""Everyone has a right to disagree. I wouldn't be surprised if the death penalty eventually goes. The law is subject to change. Everything comes in cycles.""   Both sides in the debate cite studies supporting respective claims about the death penalty achieving or not achieving deterrence - currently studies supporting the latter appear to have the upper hand.  ""Anyone who says it has been definitively proven that the death penalty has no deterrent effect either doesn't know what they are talking about or are lying,"" says Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which has supported death penalty cases throughout the country.  ""The debate over studies supporting its deterrent effect is whether they have sufficiently shown it."" Despite Texas' punitive reputation, Ms Houlé notes it was the first state to pass legislation giving defendants access to the courts if the science behind a conviction changed or was debunked, and had led the way nationally at compensating those wrongfully incarcerated. At the same time, however, trends such as racial bias in the Texas courts remain a concern. Source: Death Penalty Information Center Over the last five years, 70% of death sentences have been imposed on people of colour - more than half of these sentences were for African-American defendants, according to TCADP. Also, though less than 13% of Texas's population is African American, they constitute 43.8% of death row inmates, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.  Death penalty critics also highlight how arbitrarily it is applied based on factors such as a crime's location or the whim of a district attorney.  Mr Whitaker's petition noted how the gunman was given a life sentence after pleading guilty to murder, while the getaway driver agreed to a 15-year plea deal and testified against Whitaker. Comprising seven individuals who neither meet publicly nor have to physically confer with each other, the board can give its decision at any moment up to the day of execution. The execution of Thomas Whitaker would be the fourth this year in America - all carried out by Texas.  ""Texas claims to be a victims' rights state,"" My Whitaker says. ""What I am asking is that this means something even when the victim wants mercy and not vengeance.""  "
risk appetite,The country that does not play international football,2024-09-15,2023-11-23,Mark Lomas and Kelvin Kimathi,https://www.bbc.com/sport/africa/67474407,"Ten Eritrean players were granted asylum in Botswana in October 2015 after playing a 2018 World Cup qualifier in the country The distant dream Eritrea's footballers had of reaching the 2026 Fifa World Cup was extinguished before it had even begun. The East African country, who last played an international in January 2020, pulled out of qualifiers for the finals in Canada, Mexico and the United States just a week before they were due to play their first game against 2022 World Cup semi-finalists Morocco. Neither the Eritrean National Football Federation (ENFF) nor the country's government have commented on the decision, which has angered both players and supporters. ""I don't know why it has happened or who is in charge. It is clear that those at the top aren't taking football seriously enough,"" Eritrea midfielder Mohammed Saeid, who plays for a club in Sweden, the country of his birth, told BBC Sport Africa. ""I feel so frustrated because there are a lot of players coming through right now with Eritrean backgrounds, many playing around Europe.  ""We could compete if given a chance but when they see what is happening, will they really want to represent Eritrea in the future? ""I'm going to be able to tell my kids one day that I played for the Eritrea national team and it was one of the most amazing things I've experienced. But there are now so many players being denied this opportunity."" After also withdrawing from preliminaries for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, the latest decision poses questions over what future the country has in the game. The country currently has no world ranking despite being a member association of global governing body Fifa. ""The sudden absence of Eritrea on the global stage leaves a void that's deeply felt by fans,"" Canada-based fan Aklil Tecleab told BBC Tigrinya. ""Soccer is more than a game; it's a source of national pride and unity. It's disheartening to see our nation seemingly becoming the only one dampening the spirit of sports. ""The lack of communication with supporters and the absence of a clear reason only intensifies the disappointment."" President Isaias Afwerki has governed Eritrea since it became an independent country in 1993 and his People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDF) is the sole political party Eritrea were scheduled to play 10 matches over the course of the next two years after being drawn alongside Morocco, Zambia, Congo-Brazzaville, Tanzania and Niger in Group E of Africa's World Cup qualifiers. It is believed a major reason for the withdrawal is because the country fears domestic-based plays will abscond and defect once they travel aboard - a risk heightened by five away trips which would have begun in Morocco last week. Eritrea has been plagued by repression at home and tense relations with its neighbours since winning independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and the one-party state has a highly-militarised society. A United Nations report this year highlighted ""serious concern"" over human rights in the country, including forced conscription and arbitrary detentions, and said that the rule of law was ""non-existent"". There are multiple previous instances of Eritrean players absconding while on club and international duty. Botswana granted asylum to 10 members of the squad which played a 2018 World Cup qualifier in the country in October 2015 and the most recent incident involving the men's national team came when seven went missing during a regional championship in Uganda in December 2019. ""Defection of players is incorporated with the political situation in our country,"" said a former government official, speaking anonymously to BBC Sport Africa. ""The government says everyone must be conscripted. Everyone, whether it is a doctor, football player, a cyclist or an engineer, has to finish national service. But it doesn't end after 18 months. ""They don't have any future and they are not living a good life in Asmara (the country's capital city). So, if they get a chance the best decision will be to defect."" One Eritrea fan understands why players would make that choice as he says ""nothing has been done"" to promote football in the country. ""The national team has not been participating in the main competitions so when players get a chance to go abroad they do not want to go back,"" Million Abraha, who now lives in Kenya, told BBC Tigrinya. BBC Sport Africa contacted both the ENFF and Eritrea's government for comment but neither responded. The anonymous government official believes the ENFF are now aiming to gather a squad of players from the Eritrean diaspora to play in future qualifiers on the continent to prevent the possibility of domestic-based players defecting. Saeid, who plays for Trelleborg in Sweden, had hoped his international debut in 2019 would be the start of an exciting new chapter in his career.  However, he is yet to add to the sole cap he won against Namibia and the first Saeid heard about Eritrea's withdrawal from World Cup qualifiers came on social media. ""I thought the match would still go ahead - all of the players did,"" the 32-year-old said. ""We were speaking among each other last month and there was genuine hope that we might play again. ""We even hoped we might be able to squeeze in a friendly in the last international break so we could all get to know each other again as it had been so long.  ""I was telling my parents I'd be representing Eritrea again and was looking forward to it. Then I found out that there was no game."" Mohammed Saeid, a former trainee at West Brom in England, has played in the United States, Denmark and Sweden Saeid's trip to Namibia to make his debut for Eritrea four years ago gave him a glimpse into what he perceives as deficiencies of the ENFF. ""It was chaotic and disorganised,"" he smiles ruefully. ""The coach didn't even know who I was. I had to introduce myself and tell him I was one of the few players who was playing in Europe. ""Surely the head coach should know who his players are? ""There was just very little information - if you don't know when and where to fly to, for example, how are you expected to perform on the pitch? You need these basic resources to be right."" Yet despite what Saeid describes as ""highs and lows"" amid difficult preparations, he was thrilled to make his international bow. ""It was still one of my best trips,"" Saeid recalls. ""I played for the country of my parents and this was a feeling of unbelievable pride for me. ""For the first time in my life, I was around people who all spoke the same language as me and looked the same as me. That was special. ""Playing for Eritrea made me better understand the fans and understand that no matter the result, they will support the national team and find joy in football. It felt like it was an exciting time, that we were part of a team that could do something great."" Despite the setbacks, Saeid remains hopeful that positive change can come to Eritrean football - and insists the appetite is still there among those keen to play for their country. ""It needs someone to come in and shake things up,"" he said. ""It would be great to have a coach who can bring experience and instil some professionalism - someone who can improve things off the pitch and also actually coach the players and help them improve. ""Every time there is an international window we are waiting for news. There have been so many opportunities that have come and gone. ""We are tired of all the time that has been wasted and we want to play; the players will always be ready to play for Eritrea."" But others believe nothing will improve until the country's government revises its outlook. ""The political status in our country is not safe,"" the former Eritrean government official said. ""The geopolitics of our region harms the situation. The main solution is the peace and stability of the country has to be sustained first."""

Tottenham Hotspur have sought a judicial review of the decision to hand the stadium over to West Ham. IAAF president Lamine Diack said ruling members would be deterred by a lengthy legal dispute. ""If the legal problems are continuing you must convince my colleagues and many of them will say no,"" he said. ""If London are to win they have to come and say that they have the full support of the Government. ""They have that and I think they have a good bid.""  Diack said the stadium was a ""wonderful"" venue for athletics but also recalled that Britain had previously pulled out of hosting the 2005 World Championships in London. The IAAF rejected an offer by the then sports minister Richard Caborn to stage the event in Sheffield instead.  Diack told the Inside The Games website, external: ""Remember, we gave London the 2005 World Championships. Then we were asked by the minister if we would go to Sheffield and we said, 'No'.  ""We need to have the answer to the stadium. They have delivered a fantastic stadium. The problem is, are we going to have this continue in the future? ""That is the big problem.""

risk appetite,Reliving Calzaghe v Kessler a decade on,2024-09-15,2017-11-03,Michael Pearlman,https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/41820920,"This video can not be played 'The Kessler fight was a dream come true' Ten years may have passed, but Joe Calzaghe has no difficulty placing his fight with Mikkel Kessler in sharp context. ""It was my crowning moment. After all the years of struggle, of injury, to win the four belts and the Ring Magazine title, it was great,"" he says. It was 3 November 2007 when more than 50,000 fans roared Calzaghe on at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium in a unification fight with undefeated Dane Kessler - a night and a fight that finally secured Calzaghe's place among the greats of British boxing. It was fight number 44 in what would be an unbeaten 46-fight career. But even then the Welshman was the British fight game's best-kept secret, whose abilities split opinion. He was even derided by some, accused of ducking the difficult fights and the sport's biggest names. That changed on a euphoric night when he unified the super middleweight division with the performance of a lifetime against his toughest opponent. Mikkel Kessler and Joe Calzaghe became friends after their fight, so much so that Kessler featured in a movie on Calzaghe's career titled 'Mr Calzaghe' After nearly a decade as a world champion, Calzaghe had reached a career crossroads, desperately craving the occasions and the pay days that would define his legacy and secure his future. He was undefeated but considered unproven, a fighter whose enormous talent but lack of drawing power made him a dangerous risk, rather than enticing prospect, for the biggest names in the sport. Things had started to change after the utter destruction of American Jeff Lacy, with Calzaghe now considered enough of a name in the US to fight reality TV star Peter Manfredo at the Millennium Stadium.  LISTEN: Calzaghe v Kessler 10 years on That was an easy fight for Calzaghe, a good pay day and decent exposure, but it merely whetted his appetite for a defining night against Kessler. Calzaghe owned two super middleweight titles, the Dane the others. The duo had an unblemished collective record of 82-0 and for Joe, there was simply no other option. ""It is a fight I always wanted, I was frustrated in my career, in the politics of boxing, with the injuries I was getting,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I had fought five former world champions, but after they had lost their titles - that was the trend of my career. ""Jeff Lacy only took the fight because his manager Gary Shaw came over to watch me and thought I was shot; they thought it would be an easy fight, that I was easy pickings. Calzaghe outclassed Jeff Lacy when the pair met in March 2006 ""I knew it was time to shine. Kessler and I were head and shoulders above anything else in the division, we were 82-0 heading into the fight. ""You can't fight forever. I had started to think about retiring undefeated, but I wanted the Kessler fight badly. ""When my promoter Frank Warren said it was going to be a hard fight to make, I called his bluff and said I'd go to Denmark. ""I said I didn't want any other fight and thankfully Frank made it for Cardiff in that amazing stadium."" Calzaghe had been eyeing the Dane for many years, ever since he spotted him on the undercard of a routine title defence against Will McIntyre in 2001 in Copenhagen. ""I took notice of him and thought 'he can box'. So for years I knew we would fight, Mikkel seemed to have the full package and I had sort of studied him, especially when he picked up the titles,"" he said. ""I could tell Kessler was convinced he would win the fight - why wouldn't he have been? He was the young champion, I was the old man."" Joe Calzaghe's father Enzo was in his corner for every one of his professional fights Having finally secured his dream fight, the next and tougher obstacle for Calzaghe and his trainer Enzo - also his father - was masterminding a way to win it.  Dealing with the size of the crowd and the weight of expectation was only one factor in this. Calzaghe also had to battle the clock - with the fight staged in the early hours to satisfy US TV - and the booming rights and lefts from Kessler. ""It's massive, there was more of a football atmosphere, more of a football crowd and the roof keeps the noise, it really takes it in,"" he recalled. ""During the fourth round I knew I must be doing badly, because all I could hear was 'Denmark, Denmark' from the crowd! ""My crowd had gone quiet! But when things were going better, you could feel that roar; the crowd were incredible, you can feel it going through your body. ""I was fighting the wrong fight at the start, the atmosphere meant I was trying to do too much. ""He caught me and he buzzed me up a bit in the fourth and fifth rounds, then I got a few slaps in the corner from my dad that I could have done without! ""I caught Kessler with a body shot in the eighth round and hurt him and from then I started to use my boxing skills. ""I knew the fight was close, he hit hard, his punches were having an effect. Before that fight I'd been able to count the amount of rounds I thought I had lost in my entire career on my hands. ""When I started using the fundamental strengths of a southpaw. He's said to me since he couldn't handle my speed or power. ""I was cool, calm and collected, because I believed winning was my destiny, everything was geared to this fight. ""In the 12th round I knew he needed a knockout and I just tried to be professional and was saying to myself 'just box Joe'.  ""He caught me with some shots in the last round, he was coming on strong, he was still there. ""You can't be messing around, even though I'd dominated rounds 8, 9, 10 and 11.  ""People look at these big fights, but I used to box in leisure centres. When I boxed Evans Ashira, I couldn't fill Cardiff Ice Rink. I broke my hand, I was getting booed by my own fans.  ""That's why I had so much appreciation for fighting in the stadium. It's a long way from Splott Leisure Centre."" Mger Mkrtchian of Armenia was one of several opponents Joe Calzaghe faced at the 2,800-capacity Wales National Ice Rink, which was demolished in 2006 The unification fight with Kessler would be the last time Calzaghe punished his body and attempted to squeeze off enough weight to compete as a super middleweight. Instead he opted to step up to light heavy, where fights with American greats Bernard Hopkins, external and Roy Jones, external in Las Vegas and Madison Square Garden further confirmed his legacy.  A BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, external was another unexpected bonus, but Calzaghe admits he never again boxed with the same focus or intensity after Kessler. ""After the Kessler fight something in me died, in terms of motivation. I didn't want to be a boxer who gets hurt and retires. I wanted to retire first,"" he said. ""I am pretty happy with my last three fights, that's a great way to end. After fighting in all those little leisure centres, it really made me appreciate how I ended up. ""You don't get many happy endings in boxing, I didn't want to be another unhappy ending. My boys were begging me to quit, my youngest used to sob his eyes out. ""To finish in the UK in my home stadium, that was amazing.""

risk appetite,Do you dare cross China's glass bridges?,2024-09-15,2016-01-24,Heather Chen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-35166208,"Visitors have been flocking to China's central provinces to climb glass-bottomed suspension bridges, like this one at Shiniuzhai national park For some in China the sky does not need to be the limit, especially when you can build a glass-bottomed suspension bridge across it. Tourism sites in the central Henan and Hunan provinces, external have been constructing vertigo-inducing skywalks in a bid to attract visitors. And it seems to have worked, attracting thrill-seeking tourists and locals, all wanting a chance to experience a bird's eye view of the Chinese countryside.  One of them is student Li Shu Zhen, 19, from Hangzhou city. She shared with the BBC her experience of climbing the Brave Man's Bridge in Pingjiang county, Hunan province. ""You look down and feel a sense of fear, but you quickly recover from that and enjoy the scenery,"" she said. ""It was beautiful, almost as if one was walking on air."" Yoga has been one of the stranger activities performed on the Brave Man's Bridge An eating challenge was held on this bridge in Yueyang country - although you might lose your appetite if you look down The fully transparent bridge, which measures 300m long (984ft) and 180m high, first opened to the public in September. It is one of the more popular bridges, with events - like mass yoga displays - often being staged on it. Local officials say that glass panels were designed to withstand high winds and earthquakes,  as well as the ""weight of 800 visitors"". Glass bridge fever has also spread to neighbouring Taiwan, where a 179m-high bridge opened in Nantou county. Construction has already begun on a second glass bridge above Zhangjiajie valley in Hunan province Construction on the latest bridge, touted as the world's longest glass-bottomed walkway, is also nearing completion. Standing at 300m high and stretching 375m, the bridge will hang above the Zhangjiajie grand canyon, also in Hunan province. Gearing up for the bridge's 2016 opening, officials have even enlisted the public's help in naming it. One of its engineers, Yang Guohong, from state-owned China Railway Major Bridge Reconnaissance and Design Institute, said contractors had taken extra safety precautions. ""No matter how the tourists jump on the bridge, it will still be fine,"" he told the People's Daily newspaper, external. ""The steel structures beneath it are incredibly dense, so even if the glass breaks, visitors won't fall through."" Would you dare to walk across? But architects who spoke to the BBC said that such glass bridges were often ""primarily a novelty, built as visitor attractions rather than commuter bridges"".  Architect Keith Brownlie, who was involved in a glass bridge for The London Science Museum, said that the appeal was ""thrill"". ""It is the relationship between emotionally driven fear and the logical understanding of safety,"" he said. ""These structures tread the boundary between those two contrasting senses and people like to challenge their rational mind in relation to their irrational fear."" Others felt that the bridges symbolised extravagance, especially in China. ""In architecture, glass has always been associated with luxury and often as a display of wealth,"" said bridge designer Ezra Groskin. ""Glass floor panels, used in the creation of invisible architecture, are not a new phenomenon. However its use is often restricted due to cost and practicality."" A terrifying incident last October sent visitors fleeing in fear after a section of a glass bridge in Yuntai mountain, Henan province, cracked But how safe are China's glass bridges?  An incident in October sent terrified visitors fleeing in fear after part of a glass skywalk in Henan province's Yuntai Mountain Geological Park cracked, despite only being open for two weeks.  Park officials closed the walkway immediately, later saying there was ""no reason for worry"" and that the cracks had ""no impact on safety"". But experts questioned the use of glass in an exposed mountain environment. ""While a glass structure designed by a competent engineer and manufactured by a specialist contractor has no greater risk in terms of structural integrity than any other building material, glass can be prone to localised shocks,"" noted architect Adam Holicska.  ""The use of it in a mountain environment where there is a potential risk of rock impact can make it a questionable choice."" Architect Keith Brownlie added that the cleaning of glass panels and lack of slip resistance should also be considered in such an environment. ""One issue with glass decks is the problem of grip,"" he said. ""Glass is slippery and so anti-slip properties must be provided,""  The glass-bottomed Brave Man's Bridge in Hunan province connects two mountains ""Please, no more such bridges,"" commented a user on China's popular micro-blogging site Weibo. ""Judging from this incident, it is only a matter of time before more serious accidents and deaths occur."" But glass bridge enthusiasts remain undeterred. ""I still would not hesitate to visit other glass bridges soon,"" Ms Li admitted. Other netizens on the site also expressed similar opinions. ""I am confident that officials will step up additional measures after that happened,""  said one Weibo user.  ""Thankfully deaths were avoided but one bad incident should not put one off from conquering such a spectacular bridge."" Another compared it to other bridges of the world: ""If Sydney's Harbour Bridge experienced a crack, I doubt government officials would close it down. So we should not let such an episode affect our opinions about our unique Chinese structures."" China country profile"
risk appetite,Attack could strike Kabul within hours - minister,2024-09-15,2021-08-25,By Lauren Turner & Mary O'Connor,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58337632,"There could be an ""highly lethal"" terror attack at Kabul airport within hours, a minister has warned. Armed Forces minister James Heappey said there were ""very credible"" reports of a ""severe"" threat in the capital. The Foreign Office last night issued new guidance telling anyone near the airport to ""move away to a safe location and await further advice"".   It comes amid a race to airlift thousands from Afghanistan before foreign troops depart. The US has set a deadline of 31 August for the withdrawal of its troops, with President Joe Biden rejecting calls from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other allies for an extension. Mr Heappey did not give a date for the last UK evacuation flights, but said it was likely that UK and other foreign troops would have to leave before the last American airlifts. On Thursday, Mr Johnson said the ""overwhelming majority"" of eligible people had been evacuated from the country. He added that about 15,000 had been flown out by the UK so far. Kabul airport is currently being defended and run by the US, which has 5,800 troops on the ground - with the help of more than 1,000 UK troops. In the update issued on Wednesday evening, the FCDO also warned that travelling by road was ""extremely dangerous"" with people alleged to have been ""mistreated"" on their way to the airport. The US advised Americans in Afghanistan not to travel or gather at the airport ""because of security threats outside the gates"". Australia has also issued an alert, telling those outside the airport to leave immediately. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Mr Heappey said: ""There is now very, very credible reporting of an imminent attack and hence why the Foreign Office advice was changed last night."" He later told BBC Breakfast: ""The credibility of the reporting has now reached the stage where we believe that there is a very imminent, highly lethal attack possible within Kabul."" Asked by Sky News whether an attack could occur in the coming few hours, Mr Heappey replied: ""Yes."" Stressing the ""severe"" nature of the threat, he told the BBC that it had created an ""extraordinarily challenging situation, both on the ground and as a set of decisions to be taken in Whitehall"". ""People are desperate, people are fearing for their lives anyway, and so I think there's an appetite among many in the queue to take their chances,"" he said. He said UK troops were doing their best to provide security for those queuing, but the ""reality"" was that they were only holding ""defined bits of ground"" at the airport and at the hotel where people were being processed, and would therefore be ""relying"" on the Taliban for security beyond that. Col Richard Kemp, former head of British forces in Afghanistan, said the risk of a terror attack had been present from the start of evacuation efforts. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I have no doubt that our forces are fully aware of the threat and already, for days now, have been taking measures to try and mitigate it, to prevent something like that happening."" Meanwhile, Mr Heappey added that nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated on eight RAF flights in the past 24 hours, with 11 more flights scheduled on Thursday. Asked about the estimate that nearly 2,000 people eligible for the UK government's relocation programme - the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) - remained in Afghanistan, Mr Heappey said the actual number was ""potentially half"" of that. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told MPs that some Afghans wanting to flee to Britain may be better off trying to reach one of the country's borders and making their way to a third country. Speaking in an online meeting, Mr Wallace is reported to have signalled there were few places left on evacuation flights and said ""not everyone is going to get out"".  But former Tory defence minister Tobias Ellwood, one of the MPs at the meeting, has said any land corridors would have to be agreed with the Taliban if the UK was to avoid the risk of putting people in harm's way. Another Conservative MP, Julian Lewis, said he had raised the issue of 12 academics in Afghanistan who are at risk from the Taliban. Mr Wallace told the MPs that all cases raised with him of people who are in serious danger would be considered by the teams processing urgent requests for evacuation. By Secunder Kermani, BBC Pakistan and Afghanistan correspondent It's incredible and very distressing to see huge numbers of people still turning up to the airport.  Whole families, old women sitting in wheelbarrows because they are unable to walk, young children being carried by their parents.  Just an endless stream walking through the filth, the dust, the heat. At times, they're facing gunshots. A large number of them have no realistic chance of boarding the evacuation flights because they just don't have the right paperwork, making it even more difficult for the handful that do have the right paperwork or are foreign citizens to push their way through the crowd. I was speaking to one elderly woman yesterday, her son was a former interpreter for the US Army.  They had all been told to go to the airport but they'd spent six days and six nights living in awful conditions in a kind of make-shift camp. I asked her, given all of this, isn't it worth just sticking it out in Afghanistan and seeing how things go?  She said: ""We just don't have that option. The Americans should shoot us or they should let us through - but we are not staying here."" Any information about the threat from IS-K (a branch of the Islamic State group) or warnings about potential attacks from suicide bombers takes a long time to filter down to those people making their way to the airport - and they're so desperate that their priority is just to find some way out. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the latest government advice was a ""further blow to desperate families who have been struggling to get to the airport"". She said so many people who have worked with the UK government and military were now at grave risk. The BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet said many Afghans would remain unaware of the Foreign Office advice and would continue to make their way to Kabul airport. Since the Taliban takeover, more than 82,000 people have been airlifted out of Kabul airport, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.   Mr Blinken said the Taliban had promised to allow foreigners and Afghans to leave beyond the end of August, adding that the US and its allies had ""a responsibility to hold [the Taliban] to that commitment"".

risk appetite,Why adults should read children's books,2024-09-15,2023-07-12,Katherine Rundell,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230711-why-adults-should-read-childrens-books,"The best children's fiction ""helps us refind things we may not even know we have lost"", writes the author Katherine Rundell, with many books proving subversive, emboldening – and awe-inspiring. I've been writing children's fiction for more than 10 years now, and still I would hesitate to define it. But I do know, with more certainty than I usually feel about anything, what it is not: it's not exclusively for children. When I write, I write for two people: myself, age 12, and myself, now, and the book must satisfy two distinct but connected appetites. My 12-year-old self wanted autonomy, peril, justice, food, and above all a kind of density of atmosphere into which I could step and be engulfed. My adult self wants all those things, and also: acknowledgements of fear, love, failure; of the rat that lives within the human heart. So what I try for when I write – failing often, but trying – is to put down in as few words as I can the things that I most urgently and desperately want children to know and adults to remember. Those who write for children are trying to arm them for the life ahead with everything we can find that is true. And perhaps, also, secretly, to arm adults against those necessary compromises and necessary heartbreaks that life involves: to remind them that there are and always will be great, sustaining truths to which we can return. More like this: - The 100 greatest children's books of all time - Why Where the Wild Things Are is the greatest children's book - Why is the US banning children's books? There is, though, a sense among most adults that we should only read in one direction, because to do otherwise would be to regress or retreat: to de-mature. You pass Spot the Dog, battle past that two-headed monster Peter and Jane; through Narnia, on to The Catcher in the Rye or Patrick Ness, and from there to adult fiction, where you remain, triumphant, never glancing back, because to glance back would be to lose ground. But the human heart is not a linear train ride. That isn't how people actually read; at least, it's not how I've ever read. I learned to read fairly late, with much strain and agonising until, at last and quite suddenly, the hieroglyphs took shape and meaning: and then I read with the same omnivorous un-scrupulosity I showed at mealtimes. I read Matilda alongside Jane Austen, Narnia and Agatha Christie; I took Diana Wynne Jones's Howl's Moving Castle with me to university, clutched tight to my chest like a life raft. I still read Paddington when I need to believe, as Michael Bond does, that the world's miracles are more powerful than its chaos. For reading not to become something that we do for anxious self-optimisation – for it not to be akin to buying high-spec trainers and a gym membership each January – all texts must be open, to all people. The difficulties with the rule of readerly progression are many: one is that, if one follows the same pattern into adulthood, turning always to books of obvious increasing complexity, you're left ultimately with nothing but Finnegans Wake and the complete works of the French deconstructionist theorist Jacques Derrida to cheer your deathbed. The other difficulty with the rule is that it supposes that children's fiction can safely be discarded. I would say we do so at our peril, for we discard in adulthood a casket of wonders which, read with an adult eye, have a different kind of alchemy in them. WH Auden wrote ""There are good books which are only for adults, because their comprehension presupposes adult experiences, but there are no good books which are only for children."" I am absolutely not suggesting adults read only, or even primarily, children's fiction. Just that there are times in life when it might be the only thing that will do. What is it like to read as a child? Is there something in it – the headlong, hungry, immersive quality of it – that we can get back to? When I was young I read with a rage to understand. Adult memories of how we once read are often de-spiked by nostalgia, but my need for books as a child was sharp and urgent and furious if thwarted. My family was large, and reading offered privacy from the raucous, mildly unhinged panopticon that is living with three siblings: I could be sitting alongside them in the car, but, in fact, it was the only time when nobody in the world knew where I was. Crawling through dark tunnels in the company of hobbits, standing in front of oncoming trains waving a red flag torn from a petticoat: to read alone is to step into an infinite space where none can follow. How children's fiction came to be  The first children's books in English were instruction manuals for good behaviour. My favourite, and the sternest in tone, is The Babees' Book, which dates in manuscript from around 1475: ""O Babees young,"" writes the author, ""My Book only is made for your learning."" The text is a monumental list of instructions in verse form: ""Youre nose, your teethe, your naylles, from pykynge/Kepe at your mete, for so techis the wyse."" In 1715, Isaac Watts published his fantastically uncheerful Divine and Moral Songs for Children. I find this book fascinating because its author's preface shows that by the 18th Century, the idea that it was intellectually degrading to write for children was strong: Watts writes, ""I well know that some of my particular friends imagine my time is employed in too mean a service while I write for babes... But I content myself with this thought, that nothing is too mean for a servant of Christ to engage in, if he can thereby most effectually promote the kingdom of his blessed Master."" The book itself fits into the category, popular at the time, of ""upliftingly lugubrious""; it is largely made up of briskly invigorating rhymes about the inevitability of death: Then I'll not be proud of my youth or my beauty,  Since both of them wither and fade;  But gain a good name by well doing my duty:  This will scent like a rose when I'm dead.  In 1744 came what's often called the first work of published children's literature, John Newbery's A Little Pretty Pocket­-Book, Intended for the Instruction and Amusement of Little Master Tommy and Pretty Miss Polly. With Two Letters from Jack the Giant­ Killer; as also a Ball and Pincushion; The Use of which will infallibly make Tommy a good Boy, and. Newbery's text is actually wittier than it sounds, shot through with a vein of irony, but its ancestry was clear: it came from a history of pedagogical texts and situated itself among them. Newbery's text set a pattern: children's books would be instructive first and entertaining second. Subversive tales Alongside the morally uplifting accounts of Sunday schools and rigorously unpicked noses, though, there was another kind of story evolving, of a more unruly and subversive kind: the fairy tale. Fairy tales were never just for children. They are determinedly, pugnaciously, for everyone – old and young, men and women, of every nation. Esteemed fairy tale expert Marina Warner argues that fairy tales are the closest thing we have to a cultural Esperanto: whether German, Persian, American, we tell the same fairy tales, because the stories have migrated across borders as freely as birds. All fairy tales, by and large, have the same core ingredients: there will be the archetypal characters – stepmothers, powerful kings, talking animals. There will be injustice or conflict, often gory and extravagant, told in a matter-of-fact tone that does nothing to shield children or adults from its blunt bloodiness. But there will also usually be something – a fairy godmother, a spell, a magic tree – which brings the miracle of hope into the story. ""Fairy tales,"" Warner writes, ""evoke every kind of violence, injustice and mischance, but in order to declare it need not continue."" Fairy tales conjure fear in order to tell us that we need not be so afraid. Angela Carter saw the godmother as shorthand for what she calls ""heroic optimism"". Hope, in fairy tales, is sharper than teeth. That spirit of heroic optimism – optimism blood-covered and gasping, but still optimism – is the life principle writ large. It speaks to us all: because fairy tales were always designed to be a way of talking to everyone at once. They provide us with a model for how certain kinds of stories – by dealing in archetypes and bassnote human desires, and in metaphors with bite – can yoke together people of every age and background, luring us all, witch-like, into the same imaginative space. Fairy tales, myths, legends: these are the foundations of so much, and as adults we need to keep reading them and writing them, repossessing them as they possess us. It was in the middle of the 19th Century, as paper became more affordable and childhood literacy rates soared, that children's fiction began to take the actual desires of children into account. The subversive hunger of fairy tales, unleashed into the newly booming printing press, made its way into children's novels. Stories designed for children were unhitched from the schoolroom and the pulpit, and the First Golden Age of children's books was born. Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, JM Barrie and E Nesbit killed the parents, or abandoned them, or left them when they fell or flew to Wonderland or Neverland, and in so doing they released the child from the imperatives of the adult world. It must have felt like dynamite. Orphaned and unsupervised children roamed through Storyland, wreaking the chaos necessary for an adventure to take place. Larger and wilder experiences were on offer: stories which pushed back at the edges of what was possible. It was here that the idea that children were sweet or gentle or necessarily more simple or likeable than other kinds of humans was jettisoned, along with the idea that all logic must be adult logic. As a child, I had no illusions that children were sweet: children, I knew from my own furious heart, were frequently nasty, brutish and short. In casting aside that idea, children's books began to play by their own rules and, in so doing, became works of art distinct in themselves, in their own tradition, not watered-down versions of some other, adult thing. And that tradition has held. You could draw a family tree from Peter Pan, who first appeared in 1902 (""and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless""); to Mary Poppins in 1934, with her stern and impenetrable enchantments (""Mary Poppins never explains anything""); to the anarchic and surreal logic of Where the Wild Things Are (1963) and The Tiger Who Came to Tea (1968), who ""drank all the water in the tap"". (And on to Roald Dahl and Frank Cottrell-Boyce and Lissa Evans and to someone whose name we do not yet know, writing somewhere a story that will shake us in our collective shoes.) The family tree keeps growing. Children's fiction today is still shot through with exactly the same old furious thirst for justice that characterises fairy tales: the wicked stepmother is beheaded by a trunk, Mrs Coulter in Philip Pullman's The Amber Spyglass (2000) falls eternally through a hole in the tissue of the Universe. And, too, knitted closely into the need for justice, there is a related stance, the happier cousin of protective retribution: that of wonder. In a world which prizes a pose of exhausted knowingness, children's fiction allows itself the unsophisticated stance of awe. Eva Ibbotson escaped Vienna in 1934, after her mother's writing was banned by Hitler; her work is full of an unabashed astonishment at the sheer fact of existence. Journey to the River Sea (2001) has a kind of wonder that other kinds of fiction might be too self-conscious to allow themselves. So it's to children's fiction that you turn if you want to feel awe and hunger and longing for justice: to make the old warhorse heart stamp again in its stall. Children's books are specifically written to be read by a section of society without political or economic power. People who have no money, no vote, no control over capital or labour or the institutions of state; who navigate the world in their knowledge of their vulnerability. And, by the same measure, by people who are not yet preoccupied by the obligations of labour, not yet skilled in forcing their own prejudices on to other people and chewing at their own hearts. And because at so many times in life, despite what we tell ourselves, adults are powerless too, we as adults must hasten to children's books to be reminded of what we have left to us, whenever we need to start out all over again. Children's fiction does something else too: it offers to help us refind things we may not even know we have lost. Adult life is full of forgetting; I have forgotten most of the people I have ever met; I've forgotten most of the books I've read, even the ones that changed me forever; I've forgotten most of my epiphanies. And I've forgotten, at various times in my life, how to read: how to lay aside scepticism and fashion and trust myself to a book. At the risk of sounding like a mad optimist: children's fiction can reteach you how to read with an open heart. When you read children's books, you are given the space to read again as a child: to find your way back, back to the time when new discoveries came daily and when the world was colossal, before your imagination was trimmed and neatened, as if it were an optional extra. But imagination is not and never has been optional: it is at the heart of everything, the thing that allows us to experience the world from the perspectives of others: the condition precedent of love itself. It was Edmund Burke who first used the term moral imagination in 1790: the ability of ethical perception to step beyond the limits of the fleeting events of each moment and beyond the limits of private experience. For that we need books that are specifically written to feed the imagination, which give the heart and mind a galvanic kick: children's books. Children's books can teach us not just what we have forgotten, but what we have forgotten we have forgotten. One last thing: I vastly prefer adulthood to childhood – I love voting, and drinking, and working. But there are times in adult life – at least, in mine – when the world has seemed blank and flat and without truth. John Donne wrote about something like it: ""The general balm th'hydroptic earth hath drunk,/Whither, as to the bed's feet, life is shrunk,/Dead and interred."" It's in those moments that children's books, for me, do that which nothing else can. Children's books today do still have the ghost of their educative beginnings, but what they are trying to teach us has changed. Children's novels, to me, spoke, and still speak, of hope. They say: look, this is what bravery looks like. This is what generosity looks like. They tell me, through the medium of wizards and lions and talking spiders, that this world we live in is a world of people who tell jokes and work and endure. Children's books say: the world is huge. They say: hope counts for something. They say: bravery will matter, wit will matter, empathy will matter, love will matter. These things may or may not be true. I do not know. I hope they are. I think it is urgently necessary to hear them and to speak them. This is an extract taken from Why You Should Read Children's Books, Even Though You are so Old and Wise by Katherine Rundell.

risk appetite,Will the fashion industry have to 'rethink its values'?,2024-09-15,2020-04-29,By Steven McIntosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52394504,"Normally, at this time of year, many of us would be curating our perfect summer wardrobe as we prepare for sunny weather and foreign holidays.  Instead, clothing sales plummeted by 34% in March as much of the world's population is currently unable to travel abroad or even socialise amid lockdown restrictions. ""No-one wants to buy clothes to sit at home in,"" as Next's chief executive Simon Wolfson put it last month. The fashion industry has been negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak on every imaginable level; production has ceased, retailers have closed, demand has plummeted.  ""It has led to a real existential crisis for the fashion industry,"" says Imran Amed, the founder and CEO of The Business of Fashion, a leading industry website which has produced a report about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. ""This is an industry which is still almost entirely dependent oh physical retail. More than 80% of transactions in the fashion industry still happen in physical stores. ""Added to that, many consumers simply aren't interested in buying clothes right now. There's so much focus on purchasing essential items to survive during the lockdown and I think everyone's minds have naturally been focused on that. So fashion just becomes an after-thought, or no thought at all in that kind of context."" With sales so low, there are questions about what will happen to the existing stock of clothes building up in stores and warehouses. ""Unlike food or some medicines, [fashion] products do not go off. But many go out of style,"" noted The Economist. ""Sometimes, as with seasonal apparel collections, rather quickly."" In an effort to maintain some income, many high street retailers are selling anything they're able to at significantly discounted prices online.  Gap and H&M, for example, have been offering mid-season sales, while Uniqlo is promoting discounted comfort-wear items people are likely to need at home, such as jogging bottoms and leggings. (Browns in London has reported a 70% increase in sales of loungewear.) It's likely more brands and retailers will offer discounts as time goes on, Amed notes, which will damage profit margins, but he is hopeful that the fashion calendar being out of sync won't be as big an issue as many fear.  ""We always have to remember there are two hemispheres in the world, so when it's summer in one place it's winter in another,"" he says. ""And I think there are creative ways we could think of to redistribute those collections. ""But as for clothing going out of style, there are just so many different kinds of trends and aesthetics now that I think the idea of things being in or out of style is less marked now than it was maybe 10 or 15 years ago.  ""I've actually heard of some designers who are saying, 'the collection I showed for spring/summer 2020, we're just going to sell that in spring/summer 2021'. That won't be a solution that works for every brand, but I think getting through this situation is going to require some real lateral thinking and creativity."" With sales currently low, many brands have suspended advertising - although some continue to use social media influencers to promote products. Emily Canham, who has more than 700,000 Instagram followers, regularly promotes services and products including health foods, make-up, streaming services, holidays and clothes. ""For me right now it's really about listening to my followers about what feels appropriate,"" Canham tells BBC News. Some of her recent posts have been reflective of her current lifestyle under lockdown - not always necessarily promoting something. She adds: ""My followers generally wear what makes them feel great and powerful rather than adhering to traditional seasonal trends. It's about how you wear it, not what season it's worn in."" As things stand, it's not clear whether September's Fashion Weeks will go ahead in London, Paris, New York and Milan, and if so what form they may take - designers could potentially broadcast fashion shows online if social distancing measures are still in place, for example. May's Met Gala, an annual highlight of the fashion calendar, has already effectively moved online, with Billy Porter encouraging people to recreate their favourite red carpet looks at home. But even once the coronavirus pandemic has settled somewhat, however long that may take, there are questions about what the fashion industry will look like. ""I feel very strongly that when we come out at the other end, people's values are really going to have shifted,"" Vogue editor Dame Anna Wintour said last week. ""I think it's an opportunity for all of us to look at our industry and to look at our lives, and to rethink our values, and to really think about the waste, and the amount of money, and consumption, and excess that we have all indulged in and how we really need to rethink what this industry stands for."" The fashion industry is hugely polluting, producing about 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon emissions per year - and for some time has been under huge pressure to become more sustainable.  Much has been made of the damaging effect of so-called ""fast fashion"" in particular, where consumers buy something cheap, hardly wear it and then throw it out. It was the subject of a BBC Three documentary last year. Dame Anna said the industry will need to ""slow down"" so that people can ""enjoy it much more"" without always looking for the next new thing. ""The conversation about sustainability and the fashion industry has been going on for a long time now, so this is not a new conversation, but I do think this situation is a great accelerator,"" Amed says. ""It's going to accelerate the fashion industry's engagement with digital technology, and its desire to rethink the fashion calendar, but it will also accelerate the approach to sustainability and building responsible businesses. That means using supply chains that are creating clothing in a circular way and take into account the impact on the planet and the people who make our clothes."" With regards to the current build-up of inventory, he adds: ""There was a time when certain companies and brands would destroy products but that's become a practice which is frowned upon now."" Dame Vivienne Westwood has been a particular champion of sustainability, teaming up with green organisations and making her business more environmentally efficient.  At a time when sustainability and financial restraints are at the forefront of people's minds, the launch of the latest series of The Great British Sewing Bee on BBC One could hardly have been more appropriate. Like The Repair Shop, it provides practical tips and encourages creativity and craft at home - an antidote to a culture of binning something and buying a new one. ""Last year, home-made clothes seemed as old-fashioned as steam trains and oil lamps,"" said The Daily Mail's Christopher Stevens in his review of the show. ""But if lockdown goes on much longer, we'll all be at it."" The fashion industry, which was generating $2.5 trillion (£2.02 trillion) in global annual revenues before the pandemic hit, will be hoping consumers' appetite for designer clothes returns when lockdown restrictions ease. But that could be some way off yet. ""We're going to see a wave of insolvencies and bankruptcies as the year continues,"" Amed says. ""This is the largest crisis that the modern industry has ever faced."""
risk appetite,Unregulated weight-loss jabs pose 'health risk',2024-09-15,2023-05-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65559361,"There is a real risk to people's health if they buy weight-loss injections from unregulated sources, the Department of Health has warned. It said a number of the injection pens were in circulation across Northern Ireland.   The department added that there had been increased demand for the pens, including from online sellers. It said they may not be subject to normal safety controls on manufacture or prescribed by a doctor. Semaglutide is a medication that can be prescribed for weight loss. It is mainly approved for the management of diabetes and is available under different brand names.  The department said the potential risk to public health had been recently highlighted during an investigation by the department's medicines regulatory group (MRG), which found fake injectable weight loss pens in circulation..  Officials said the investigation was ongoing and a number of pens had been seized. Peter Moore, senior medicines enforcement officer at the department, said people might be breaking the law by advertising or unlawfully supplying prescription-only medicines outside the legitimate supply chain. ""I would urge people not to source their prescription medication from unregulated sources,"" he said, adding that it presented ""a real risk of adverse health effects"". Canice Ward, head of the MRG, said it was extremely important that people took prescription-only medicines after consultation with their GP or healthcare provider, who have access to patient health records and are aware of the risks and benefits of every medicine. The department said anyone who suspected a medicine had been falsified should tell a healthcare professional such as a pharmacist."
risk appetite,How the scramble for sand is destroying the Mekong,2024-09-15,2019-12-19,By Beth Timmins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50629100,"A crisis is engulfing the Mekong River, its banks are collapsing and half a million people are at risk of losing their homes. The entire ecosystem of this South East Asian river is under threat, all because of the world's insatiable demand for sand. Extracted from the bed of this giant river in Cambodia and Vietnam, sand is one of the Earth's most sought-after resources. Up to 50 billion tonnes are dredged globally every year - the largest extractive industry on the planet.  ""Extraction is happening at absolutely astronomical rates, we're having an industrial-scale transformation of the shape of the planet,"" says river scientist Prof Stephen Darby at Southampton University.  His studies on the lower Mekong show its bed has been lowered by several metres in just a few years, over many hundreds of kilometres, all in the quest for sand. From highways to hospitals, sand is the essential component for industries as varied as cosmetics, fertilisers and steel production - and particularly for cement. In the last two decades demand has increased threefold, says the UN, fuelled by the race to build new towns and cities. China consumed more sand between 2011 and 2013 than the US did in all of the 20th Century, as it urbanised its rural areas. Sand is also used to bulk up landmass - Singapore is 20% bigger now than it was at the time of independence in 1965. ""Every year we extract enough sand to build a wall 27m (89ft) high and 27m wide, all the way around the world,"" says Pascal Peduzzi of the United Nations Environment Programme. Not any old sand will do. Desert sand is too smooth and fine to make concrete. Nor is it the kind that is needed to make glass or be used in the electronic industry. So that is why sand is sought from ancient deposits in quarries - static extraction -  or through so-called dynamic extraction from the sea and rivers like the Mekong. Mr Peduzzi says dynamic extraction can be particularly damaging: ""The sand is part of the ecosystem and plays a vital role, which if lost effects biodiversity, erosion and increases salinisation.""  According to conservation charity WWF and the Mekong River Commission, the bed of the two main channels of Mekong Delta lost 1.4m in elevation in the 10 years to 2008, and between two and three metres have been lost in elevation since 1990. Research in Nature, published last month, says that the sand mining on one 20km (12.5 mile) stretch of the river is ""non-sustainable"" as it cannot be replaced fast enough by natural sediment from the river's upper reaches. It is not just a threat to the humans. The Mekong supports the world's largest inland fishery, providing a food source for the 60 million people living in the catchment area. The WWF reckons 800 species of fish and one of the largest remaining populations of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphin, live there. The Mekong is not the only place where the grab for sand is creating controversy.  In Kenya and India for example, there have been violent clashes over the resource, which is consumed at a rate of 18kg for every person on the planet each day.  So is the world running out of sand? Mark Russell, director of the UK Mineral Products Association, says it is not so much about running out, but reliance on harder to find sand. ""While this is a global issue it is playing out at a local scale, it is a resource no one really thinks about,"" he says.  One way to tackle the issue is by looking at ways to use the world's abundant desert sand. Scientists from Imperial College London have taken smooth desert sand and developed a building material which they have called ""Finite"". It has the same strength as residential concrete, with half the carbon footprint, and unlike concrete it is biodegradable.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: At the same time, limits to supply of river sand are being put in place. Vietnam and Cambodia officially banned sand exports from the Mekong River in 2009 and 2017, respectively. Yet on the internet, Mekong River sand is advertised in orders from 20,000 to 200,000 tonnes. And Rolf Aalto, a geography professor at Exeter University, has found that while Cambodia claims not to be exporting, Singapore continues to record imports from the country. The Cambodian Foreign Ministry for Mines and Energy did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. But the situation illustrates what Mr Russell describes as a global absence of transparency. ""If you don't actually know what you're consuming or where its coming from or going, it's incredibly difficult to take informed management decisions."" There is a lack of data, Prof Darby agrees. ""The major difficulty with sand mining is that the lack of governance tends to mean that there is not any systematic data on the extent and magnitude of the trade globally."" Mr Peduzzi says this is why a world monitoring centre is needed. ""At the moment all we have are general estimates and we need to centralise our efforts."" That is in addition to the resolution on mineral resource governance outlined by the UN in March, which stipulates how countries should reduce the impact of sand mining.  ""We just need to be much more clever in how we use it,"" says Mr Peduzzi. ""Sand has to be recognised as a strategic material, not just an endless supply."""
risk appetite,US pushes back on foreign takeovers,2024-09-15,2018-08-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45177254,"The US has passed a new law that strengthens the government's power to review - and potentially block - business deals involving foreign firms. US President Donald Trump signed the bill, which is part of a broader military spending measure, on Monday. The US worries Chinese firms use investments and acquisitions to gain access to new technology - a concern also behind the US-led trade war. China was critical of the US defence act. The law was supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, which approved the measure earlier this year. It comes as other countries, including the UK, consider ways to toughen their scrutiny of foreign deals with an eye to China. The new law expands the type of deals subject to potential review by the  Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), which vets foreign investments to see if they pose a risk to national security. For example, it directs the committee to consider how potential transactions might affect personal data and cyber-security and whether an investment gives foreigners access to ""material"" non-public information. It also strengthens export controls, allowing the US to review overseas deals, such as joint ventures.  The new law does not specifically name China. However, it directs CFIUS officials to consider whether the transaction involves a ""country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure"". China criticised the measures, saying it would comprehensively assess them. ""The US side should objectively and fairly treat Chinese investors, and avoid CFIUS becoming an obstacle to investment cooperation between Chinese and US firms,"" China's Commerce Ministry said, according to Reuters. The broader military spending legislation also says ""long-term strategic competition with China"" is a principal priority for the US. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he welcomed the new law. Even without the new law, rising US scrutiny of Chinese transactions appears to have dampened investor appetite. Chinese firms completed deals worth $1.8bn (£1.4bn) in the first half of 2018 - the lowest level in seven years and down more than 90% from the same period in 2017, according to the Rhodium Group, a US research firm. The decline followed tighter Chinese controls on overseas activity, which contributed to a global contraction in foreign investment last year. Rhodium found US regulators blocked about $2bn in Chinese deals in the first six months of 2018. Those included the sale of a US money transfer firm to Ant Financial, Alibaba's digital payments arm, and the acquisition of Skybridge Capital by HNA. Overall, foreign investment in the US fell 32% from 2016 to 2017, when it totalled about $260bn, according to the  US Commerce Department."
risk appetite,How has smoking ban changed the UK?,2024-09-15,2017-07-01,By Nick Triggle,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40444460,"It's 10 years since smoking was banned in enclosed workplaces in England, following similar moves in the rest of the UK. But how has the ""pub smoking ban"" changed the country? Do you remember the time when pubs were full of smoke? When you could light up after a meal at a restaurant? Or when smokers didn't have to congregate on the street outside offices? The law, which marked a fundamental shift in attitudes towards smoking, is now 10 years old.  It banned smoking in all enclosed public places and work places when it came into force in England on 1 July 2007. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales had already taken the plunge over the previous 18 months. Its backers justified it on the basis that smokers were putting others at risk by exposing them to second-hand smoke. But opponents suggested the risks from passive smoking did not justify the attack on smoking. At the time the move was controversial. The health lobby fought for decades to get it introduced and right up until the last minute ministers considered all sorts of exceptions - retaining smoking rooms or allowing certain premises to be exempt. But once introduced, the country soon fell into line. Councils were charged with policing it. In the first 18 months officers inspected nearly 600,000 premises. Few broke the rules. Public backing grew and grew - and remains strong today. A poll of more than 4,000 adults by YouGov released for the 10th anniversary found nearly three-quarters of people would oppose the ban being overturned, with just 12% wanting to get rid of it.  But other polling does show opinion is pretty split on whether the complete ban could be modified - such as by the introduction of designated smoking rooms in pubs and clubs. The number of pubs in the UK has been falling.  Between 2007 and 2015, the UK lost nearly 7,000 pubs.   Some publicans and other critics say the smoking ban played a large part in this. Simon Clark, of the smokers' rights lobby group Forest, says the impact has been ""devastating"". But there are other factors too. There has been a massive decline in the amount of beer people drink.  The British Beer and Pub Association cites the rise in the tax applied to drinks - and beer in particular. The beer duty escalator meant that between 2008 and 2013 the duty increased by 42% and this has come at a time when supermarkets have tried to entice shoppers in with discounts on booze. At the same time as the smoking ban came in, the economic crash was about to start. It had a massive impact on incomes in the UK. Average real-terms pay is still below where it was 10 years ago.  With all these factors happening at the same time, BBPA spokesman Neil Williams says it is ""pretty impossible"" to unpick exactly what the individual impact of the ban has been.  And of course, many pubs have thrived since the smoking ban, changing to focus more on high-quality food and trying to attract families - including those with young children - who would previously have avoided smoky atmospheres.  ""Pubs have had to adapt. We've seen those that can invest in food and they've made a very good job of it.  ""But some pubs - the traditional street-corner boozer - simply haven't had the space to do that. They are the ones that have suffered."" And there's a wider picture. People in the UK seem to be drinking less.  The Office for National Statistics says that between 2005 and 2016, the number of people saying they had had anything to drink in the previous week fell from 64% to 57%. The numbers drinking on five days or more a week nearly halved over that time.   Smoking rates are falling. Today fewer than 17% of people smoke. But as the graph below shows the downward trend goes back decades - and there was actually a slowing of the rate of decline immediately after the ban. Most experts agree that is understandable. As the numbers fall, what you are left with is a more hardcore group of smokers whom it is hard to persuade to give up. But how much of the fall is down to the ban - and how much is down to other factors? There are fewer young people taking up smoking. The numbers have halved since the introduction of the ban. But again it is difficult to work out quite how much of that is down to the 2007 legislation.  When you look at drinking rates, drug use or teenage pregnancy numbers, they tell a similar story.  There is a clear pattern - the young have changed the way they behave.  This consistent trend has not yet been properly explained. One of the few convincing theories centres on social media - the idea is that young people spend so much of their time online that it has replaced other vices.  The ban also encouraged some existing smokers to give up. Following its introduction there was a 23% increase in quit attempts made via NHS stop-smoking services. Research suggests the ban was particularly effective at raising awareness about the risks of second-hand smoke - people were motivated to protect those they smoked around, as well as looking after their own health. The YouGov poll also provides some evidence. It found 14% of ex-smokers had been influenced in their decision to quit by the ban, while 20% of current smokers say they smoke less because of it. But you can't ignore the influence of e-cigarettes either. Vaping has offered a healthier, more socially acceptable alternative to smoking. Momentum was just gathering in 2007, but figures from the Office for National Statistics show that today one in 20 people over 16 regularly uses e-cigarettes - a quarter of them are smokers or ex-smokers. But not every measure shows such positive results.  England still has a relatively large number of women who smoke during pregnancy - one in 10 at last count , although the figures are admittedly falling. Policymakers have been so worried about these numbers that they have tried offering financial incentives, such as shopping vouchers, to pregnant women who quit. There also remains a large discrepancy in the income levels between who smokes and who doesn't. Those with the lowest incomes are twice as likely to smoke as people who come from the highest income groups - a gap that refuses to budge even as smoking rates fall.  Tackling this discrepancy has been a major focus of health campaigners in recent years.  Smoking rates are a significant factor in the differences in life expectancy and health outcomes. Talking of health, how has the ban affected the rates of illness and disease? In the years after the ban there was a flurry of research looking at what impact it had had. The Department of Health commissioned an evidence review that was published in 2011.  It highlighted a fall in respiratory illness reported by bar workers immediately after the ban. The review also flagged up research that showed hospital admissions for heart attacks fell by 2.4% immediately following the change in the law. That was the equivalent of 1,200 heart attacks a year. Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar believes the impact on health will continue to be ""huge"" and that the ban should be viewed as one of the most important public health measures of recent history.  But truly assessing the impact on health will take some time. Overall hospital admissions and deaths attributable to smoking have been falling in recent years, but only slowly. The fact remains that it takes some time for the impact of lower smoking rates to influence health outcomes. Take lung cancer, for example. About 85% of cases are caused by smoking. But if you look at the number of cases being diagnosed, the figures for men and women were going in the opposite direction until 2012. The rising rates in women seen after 2007 are not, of course, because the ban had opposite effects on men and women. Instead it is to do with what was happening half a century ago, because of the long lag between smoking and cancer developing. It was not until the mid 1960s that the numbers of women smoking eventually peaked. For men that happened at the end of World War Two, hence lung cancer cases have been falling for over 20 years in men. But one thing we can see clearly 10 years on is how the global appetite for anti-smoking legislation has grown. While the UK took its time in introducing the ban, since then ministers have proved to be more decisive. When the legislation was introduced, England was following the herd. The Republic of Ireland was the first country to introduce a complete ban in 2004. A host of other countries from the US and Canada to Australia had taken their own steps too by 2007.  But others have quickly followed suit and now smoking bans - whether full or partial - are commonplace as this chart (which is by no means exhaustive) shows. Over the past decade there has been a flurry of new legislation - and the UK has often been at the forefront.  The age at which people can buy tobacco products has been raised from 16 to 18 and they are no longer stocked in vending machines.  Bans of tobacco displays in shops have also been introduced, while cigarettes now have to be sold in standardised packages and smoking is not allowed in cars carrying children.  Locally, a number of town halls have also sought to take their own steps, with some looking at bans in parks, squares and outside areas used by restaurants and pubs. The ban, it seems, has opened the floodgates. Additional reporting by Eleanor Lawrie Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"
risk appetite,Asian markets fall sharply after US losses,2024-09-15,2018-10-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45819250,"Asian stocks have slumped as concerns about higher US interest rates and a global trade war prompted investors to sell. Markets in Asia took their cue from US stocks, which suffered their sharpest one-day falls in months on Wednesday. By the end of trade in Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index had lost 3.9%, to close at 22,590.86 points.  In China, the Shanghai Composite lost 5.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 3.5%. The US Federal Reserve raised rates in September, in response to solid economic growth, and hinted that another rise could be coming before the end of the year. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, slowing economic activity and hurting investor appetite for risk. A US-led trade war against China has also made investors worried about the outlook for global growth. Elsewhere, South Korea's benchmark Kospi index lost 4.4% to close at 2,129.67, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 2.7% to end at 5,883.8. US markets have done better than expected this year, bouncing back after turmoil early in the year to set new records over the summer. But the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, with more hikes likely to come. The Fed last month abandoned its description of its policy as ""accommodative"", reflecting a view that the economy is strong enough not to need the kind of stimulus it received in the after-math of the financial crisis. Asia benefited from low interest rates globally post-crisis, as investors sought to put their money in markets offering higher returns. The prospect of dwindling US stimulus has been compounded by a trade war between the world's two largest economy - which the IMF has warned could harm growth. US President Donald Trump has been particularly critical of the Fed's rate rises, breaking with tradition in the US where presidents are expected to respect central bank independence. ""The Fed is making a mistake,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""I think the Fed has gone crazy."" The stock market fall came ahead of America's latest corporate earnings season, when companies will provide updates to investors about their outlook for the rest of the year."
risk appetite,"Ethiopia PM eyes Red Sea port, inflaming tensions",2024-09-15,2023-11-08,By Alex de Waal,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67332811,"Ethiopia is abuzz with rumours of a new war - which would be Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's fourth in five years.  As well as importing weapons and mobilising his army, Mr Abiy - who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his rapprochement with Eritrea - has been saying that access to the sea is an existential question. Ethiopia's most obvious target is the Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab, which was part of Ethiopia until Eritrean independence more than 30 years ago.  Since the 1998 Ethiopian-Eritrean war and the closure of the border between the two countries, the Assab docks have been rusting away, while Ethiopia's trade has been channelled through neighbouring Djibouti.  The logistics and economics of Djibouti are perfectly workable, but it is not Ethiopian territory. Many Ethiopians - and their neighbours - read between the lines and think the prime minister is threatening to use force. But Mr Abiy publicly denies that he intends to invade Eritrea, telling soldiers recently on armed forces day: ""Ethiopia has never invaded any country and will not do so in the future."" He has also called for dialogue via an emergency summit of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (Igad), a bloc of eight north-east African states. Yet Ethiopia's aggressive posture and new arms race have consequences. In July, Mr Abiy publicly raised the question of Ethiopia's access to the sea.  He made the point that Ethiopia is the world's most-populous landlocked country - it has 125 million people - and that access to the sea was a top priority for Ethiopian emperors, notably Haile Selassie who ruled from 1930 until 1974.  Quoting a famous 19th Century general, Ras Alula, Mr Abiy said that the Red Sea was Ethiopia's natural boundary. He reportedly told a meeting of businessmen that ""we want to get a port by peaceful means. But if that fails we will use force"". Some saw this as a gambit to win political support at home.  It appealed to an influential elite from the Amhara ethnic group who advocate for a greater Ethiopia.  Mr Abiy alienated this group when he made peace with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in northern Ethiopia a year ago, following a bloody civil war. He further antagonised them by launching a military operation in April to disarm Amhara militia, who sided with him in the conflict in the Tigray region.  Many Ethiopians also believe, falsely, that international law entitles a large country to a seaport. Another interpretation is that Mr Abiy is obsessed with his legacy, and sees acquiring a port, by force if it cannot be done by negotiation, as his contribution to Ethiopia's greatness. For decades, Ethiopia's foreign policy was predictable. It wanted to stabilise the Horn of Africa under its own leadership.  Part of this was partnering with the United Nations and African Union on peace efforts in Sudan and Somalia. Ethiopia became Africa's biggest contributor to UN and African Union peacekeeping missions. Another part was ambitious cross-border infrastructure projects, including transport corridors and power lines.  The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile was designed to generate enough electricity that it could export to neighbouring countries. The idea was to bind the Horn of Africa together as a single economic bloc. Today, Mr Abiy has gained a reputation for unpredictability. That's the case for both domestic and foreign affairs. In a remarkable reversal, Eritrea, once widely shunned for destabilising the Horn of Africa, is positioning itself as the responsible, status quo power.  In response to Mr Abiy, its statements have been terse and acerbic, pointedly refusing to join the ""discourses"" of its former ally on a matter that had ""perplexed all concerned observers"".  Ethiopia's other neighbours have been rattled too, and Djibouti, the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, Somalia and Kenya are joining Eritrea in an informal bloc to contain Ethiopia - issuing statements echoing one another's concerns. Middle Eastern actors face dilemmas. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is Mr Abiy's principal patron - most conspicuously, it is financing his lavish palace, as well as providing drones.  Emirati aircraft have been observed unloading supplies in Ethiopian airbases in recent days.  Abu Dhabi also supports Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) group led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as ""Hemeti"", who controls much of Sudan including most of its capital, Khartoum, and may soon be able to form a government.  For the UAE, Mr Abiy's adventurism is both an opportunity and a risk: Ethiopia could become an important Red Sea power - and an Emirati client state; or a new war in the Horn could jeopardise their gains in Sudan. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is sponsoring ceasefire talks in Sudan jointly with the US and is reportedly disturbed by how Mr Abiy's Ethiopia is acting.  If Mr Abiy overreaches, Saudi Arabia may feel obliged to overcome its wariness over the Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki, and support him. If he is serious about a new war, Mr Abiy faces two major challenges. One is who will fight.  The Ethiopian army has been depleted by the last three wars. The first was against the Oromo Liberation Army, and is still unfinished.  The second war, against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), was fought in alliance with Eritrea, and ended with a cessation of hostilities a year ago. The Ethiopian army lost, by its own calculation, between 260,000 and 520,000 soldiers killed or missing in action, plus 374,000 wounded.   The third war, against Amhara militia, began in April and is bogging down a large proportion of the army in what increasingly looks like a quagmire - with reports that Eritrea is arming the Amhara militia, known as Fano. If Addis Ababa is to go to war, it will probably need the active involvement of Tigray, strategically positioned adjoining Eritrea. But Tigray's economy and services were destroyed in the two-year war that ended last year, and its people are exhausted.  Few have an appetite for new fighting. But there is deep and widespread anger at the atrocities committed by the Eritrean army.  Moreover, if the federal army were to start a war with Eritrea, Tigray would certainly be dragged in.  Some Tigrayans, fearing that a new war is inevitable, argue that Tigray should set out its conditions first, such as a return of western Tigray - seized by the neighbouring Amhara region three years ago - and control over some national military assets such as aircraft. A second challenge is paying for the war. The Ethiopian economy is in a tailspin, and desperately needs a bailout from western donors along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.  Mr Abiy may hope that the UAE will compensate for any lost funds, but while UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan may provide cash-in-hand for the prime minister, his money cannot compensate for the massive economic losses that a war would entail. Whether or not Ethiopia actually launches an invasion, Mr Abiy has made the war thinkable.  Beating the drums of war creates a dangerous atmosphere. The region's arms race is quickening. Ethiopia is buying more weapons. Eritrea and Djibouti will likely follow suit. Tigray's proposed demobilisation is frozen. The conflicts in Somalia may be exacerbated. Eritrea could pour arms to the Amhara militia to intensify that war. There is a danger that any small incident could get out of hand. The last thing that the Horn of Africa needs is a new war. But the risks are now alarmingly high. Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in the US."
risk appetite,The country that does not play international football,2024-09-15,2023-11-23,Mark Lomas and Kelvin Kimathi,https://www.bbc.com/sport/africa/67474407,"Ten Eritrean players were granted asylum in Botswana in October 2015 after playing a 2018 World Cup qualifier in the country The distant dream Eritrea's footballers had of reaching the 2026 Fifa World Cup was extinguished before it had even begun. The East African country, who last played an international in January 2020, pulled out of qualifiers for the finals in Canada, Mexico and the United States just a week before they were due to play their first game against 2022 World Cup semi-finalists Morocco. Neither the Eritrean National Football Federation (ENFF) nor the country's government have commented on the decision, which has angered both players and supporters. ""I don't know why it has happened or who is in charge. It is clear that those at the top aren't taking football seriously enough,"" Eritrea midfielder Mohammed Saeid, who plays for a club in Sweden, the country of his birth, told BBC Sport Africa. ""I feel so frustrated because there are a lot of players coming through right now with Eritrean backgrounds, many playing around Europe.  ""We could compete if given a chance but when they see what is happening, will they really want to represent Eritrea in the future? ""I'm going to be able to tell my kids one day that I played for the Eritrea national team and it was one of the most amazing things I've experienced. But there are now so many players being denied this opportunity."" After also withdrawing from preliminaries for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, the latest decision poses questions over what future the country has in the game. The country currently has no world ranking despite being a member association of global governing body Fifa. ""The sudden absence of Eritrea on the global stage leaves a void that's deeply felt by fans,"" Canada-based fan Aklil Tecleab told BBC Tigrinya. ""Soccer is more than a game; it's a source of national pride and unity. It's disheartening to see our nation seemingly becoming the only one dampening the spirit of sports. ""The lack of communication with supporters and the absence of a clear reason only intensifies the disappointment."" President Isaias Afwerki has governed Eritrea since it became an independent country in 1993 and his People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDF) is the sole political party Eritrea were scheduled to play 10 matches over the course of the next two years after being drawn alongside Morocco, Zambia, Congo-Brazzaville, Tanzania and Niger in Group E of Africa's World Cup qualifiers. It is believed a major reason for the withdrawal is because the country fears domestic-based plays will abscond and defect once they travel aboard - a risk heightened by five away trips which would have begun in Morocco last week. Eritrea has been plagued by repression at home and tense relations with its neighbours since winning independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and the one-party state has a highly-militarised society. A United Nations report this year highlighted ""serious concern"" over human rights in the country, including forced conscription and arbitrary detentions, and said that the rule of law was ""non-existent"". There are multiple previous instances of Eritrean players absconding while on club and international duty. Botswana granted asylum to 10 members of the squad which played a 2018 World Cup qualifier in the country in October 2015 and the most recent incident involving the men's national team came when seven went missing during a regional championship in Uganda in December 2019. ""Defection of players is incorporated with the political situation in our country,"" said a former government official, speaking anonymously to BBC Sport Africa. ""The government says everyone must be conscripted. Everyone, whether it is a doctor, football player, a cyclist or an engineer, has to finish national service. But it doesn't end after 18 months. ""They don't have any future and they are not living a good life in Asmara (the country's capital city). So, if they get a chance the best decision will be to defect."" One Eritrea fan understands why players would make that choice as he says ""nothing has been done"" to promote football in the country. ""The national team has not been participating in the main competitions so when players get a chance to go abroad they do not want to go back,"" Million Abraha, who now lives in Kenya, told BBC Tigrinya. BBC Sport Africa contacted both the ENFF and Eritrea's government for comment but neither responded. The anonymous government official believes the ENFF are now aiming to gather a squad of players from the Eritrean diaspora to play in future qualifiers on the continent to prevent the possibility of domestic-based players defecting. Saeid, who plays for Trelleborg in Sweden, had hoped his international debut in 2019 would be the start of an exciting new chapter in his career.  However, he is yet to add to the sole cap he won against Namibia and the first Saeid heard about Eritrea's withdrawal from World Cup qualifiers came on social media. ""I thought the match would still go ahead - all of the players did,"" the 32-year-old said. ""We were speaking among each other last month and there was genuine hope that we might play again. ""We even hoped we might be able to squeeze in a friendly in the last international break so we could all get to know each other again as it had been so long.  ""I was telling my parents I'd be representing Eritrea again and was looking forward to it. Then I found out that there was no game."" Mohammed Saeid, a former trainee at West Brom in England, has played in the United States, Denmark and Sweden Saeid's trip to Namibia to make his debut for Eritrea four years ago gave him a glimpse into what he perceives as deficiencies of the ENFF. ""It was chaotic and disorganised,"" he smiles ruefully. ""The coach didn't even know who I was. I had to introduce myself and tell him I was one of the few players who was playing in Europe. ""Surely the head coach should know who his players are? ""There was just very little information - if you don't know when and where to fly to, for example, how are you expected to perform on the pitch? You need these basic resources to be right."" Yet despite what Saeid describes as ""highs and lows"" amid difficult preparations, he was thrilled to make his international bow. ""It was still one of my best trips,"" Saeid recalls. ""I played for the country of my parents and this was a feeling of unbelievable pride for me. ""For the first time in my life, I was around people who all spoke the same language as me and looked the same as me. That was special. ""Playing for Eritrea made me better understand the fans and understand that no matter the result, they will support the national team and find joy in football. It felt like it was an exciting time, that we were part of a team that could do something great."" Despite the setbacks, Saeid remains hopeful that positive change can come to Eritrean football - and insists the appetite is still there among those keen to play for their country. ""It needs someone to come in and shake things up,"" he said. ""It would be great to have a coach who can bring experience and instil some professionalism - someone who can improve things off the pitch and also actually coach the players and help them improve. ""Every time there is an international window we are waiting for news. There have been so many opportunities that have come and gone. ""We are tired of all the time that has been wasted and we want to play; the players will always be ready to play for Eritrea."" But others believe nothing will improve until the country's government revises its outlook. ""The political status in our country is not safe,"" the former Eritrean government official said. ""The geopolitics of our region harms the situation. The main solution is the peace and stability of the country has to be sustained first."""
risk appetite,How the scramble for sand is destroying the Mekong,2024-09-15,2019-12-19,By Beth Timmins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50629100,"A crisis is engulfing the Mekong River, its banks are collapsing and half a million people are at risk of losing their homes. The entire ecosystem of this South East Asian river is under threat, all because of the world's insatiable demand for sand. Extracted from the bed of this giant river in Cambodia and Vietnam, sand is one of the Earth's most sought-after resources. Up to 50 billion tonnes are dredged globally every year - the largest extractive industry on the planet.  ""Extraction is happening at absolutely astronomical rates, we're having an industrial-scale transformation of the shape of the planet,"" says river scientist Prof Stephen Darby at Southampton University.  His studies on the lower Mekong show its bed has been lowered by several metres in just a few years, over many hundreds of kilometres, all in the quest for sand. From highways to hospitals, sand is the essential component for industries as varied as cosmetics, fertilisers and steel production - and particularly for cement. In the last two decades demand has increased threefold, says the UN, fuelled by the race to build new towns and cities. China consumed more sand between 2011 and 2013 than the US did in all of the 20th Century, as it urbanised its rural areas. Sand is also used to bulk up landmass - Singapore is 20% bigger now than it was at the time of independence in 1965. ""Every year we extract enough sand to build a wall 27m (89ft) high and 27m wide, all the way around the world,"" says Pascal Peduzzi of the United Nations Environment Programme. Not any old sand will do. Desert sand is too smooth and fine to make concrete. Nor is it the kind that is needed to make glass or be used in the electronic industry. So that is why sand is sought from ancient deposits in quarries - static extraction -  or through so-called dynamic extraction from the sea and rivers like the Mekong. Mr Peduzzi says dynamic extraction can be particularly damaging: ""The sand is part of the ecosystem and plays a vital role, which if lost effects biodiversity, erosion and increases salinisation.""  According to conservation charity WWF and the Mekong River Commission, the bed of the two main channels of Mekong Delta lost 1.4m in elevation in the 10 years to 2008, and between two and three metres have been lost in elevation since 1990. Research in Nature, published last month, says that the sand mining on one 20km (12.5 mile) stretch of the river is ""non-sustainable"" as it cannot be replaced fast enough by natural sediment from the river's upper reaches. It is not just a threat to the humans. The Mekong supports the world's largest inland fishery, providing a food source for the 60 million people living in the catchment area. The WWF reckons 800 species of fish and one of the largest remaining populations of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphin, live there. The Mekong is not the only place where the grab for sand is creating controversy.  In Kenya and India for example, there have been violent clashes over the resource, which is consumed at a rate of 18kg for every person on the planet each day.  So is the world running out of sand? Mark Russell, director of the UK Mineral Products Association, says it is not so much about running out, but reliance on harder to find sand. ""While this is a global issue it is playing out at a local scale, it is a resource no one really thinks about,"" he says.  One way to tackle the issue is by looking at ways to use the world's abundant desert sand. Scientists from Imperial College London have taken smooth desert sand and developed a building material which they have called ""Finite"". It has the same strength as residential concrete, with half the carbon footprint, and unlike concrete it is biodegradable.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: At the same time, limits to supply of river sand are being put in place. Vietnam and Cambodia officially banned sand exports from the Mekong River in 2009 and 2017, respectively. Yet on the internet, Mekong River sand is advertised in orders from 20,000 to 200,000 tonnes. And Rolf Aalto, a geography professor at Exeter University, has found that while Cambodia claims not to be exporting, Singapore continues to record imports from the country. The Cambodian Foreign Ministry for Mines and Energy did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. But the situation illustrates what Mr Russell describes as a global absence of transparency. ""If you don't actually know what you're consuming or where its coming from or going, it's incredibly difficult to take informed management decisions."" There is a lack of data, Prof Darby agrees. ""The major difficulty with sand mining is that the lack of governance tends to mean that there is not any systematic data on the extent and magnitude of the trade globally."" Mr Peduzzi says this is why a world monitoring centre is needed. ""At the moment all we have are general estimates and we need to centralise our efforts."" That is in addition to the resolution on mineral resource governance outlined by the UN in March, which stipulates how countries should reduce the impact of sand mining.  ""We just need to be much more clever in how we use it,"" says Mr Peduzzi. ""Sand has to be recognised as a strategic material, not just an endless supply."""
risk appetite,US pushes back on foreign takeovers,2024-09-15,2018-08-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45177254,"The US has passed a new law that strengthens the government's power to review - and potentially block - business deals involving foreign firms. US President Donald Trump signed the bill, which is part of a broader military spending measure, on Monday. The US worries Chinese firms use investments and acquisitions to gain access to new technology - a concern also behind the US-led trade war. China was critical of the US defence act. The law was supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, which approved the measure earlier this year. It comes as other countries, including the UK, consider ways to toughen their scrutiny of foreign deals with an eye to China. The new law expands the type of deals subject to potential review by the  Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), which vets foreign investments to see if they pose a risk to national security. For example, it directs the committee to consider how potential transactions might affect personal data and cyber-security and whether an investment gives foreigners access to ""material"" non-public information. It also strengthens export controls, allowing the US to review overseas deals, such as joint ventures.  The new law does not specifically name China. However, it directs CFIUS officials to consider whether the transaction involves a ""country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure"". China criticised the measures, saying it would comprehensively assess them. ""The US side should objectively and fairly treat Chinese investors, and avoid CFIUS becoming an obstacle to investment cooperation between Chinese and US firms,"" China's Commerce Ministry said, according to Reuters. The broader military spending legislation also says ""long-term strategic competition with China"" is a principal priority for the US. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he welcomed the new law. Even without the new law, rising US scrutiny of Chinese transactions appears to have dampened investor appetite. Chinese firms completed deals worth $1.8bn (£1.4bn) in the first half of 2018 - the lowest level in seven years and down more than 90% from the same period in 2017, according to the Rhodium Group, a US research firm. The decline followed tighter Chinese controls on overseas activity, which contributed to a global contraction in foreign investment last year. Rhodium found US regulators blocked about $2bn in Chinese deals in the first six months of 2018. Those included the sale of a US money transfer firm to Ant Financial, Alibaba's digital payments arm, and the acquisition of Skybridge Capital by HNA. Overall, foreign investment in the US fell 32% from 2016 to 2017, when it totalled about $260bn, according to the  US Commerce Department."
risk appetite,'Knock-off weight loss jab left me vomiting blood',2024-09-15,2023-11-15,By Aoife Walsh and Pria Rai,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67414203,"A woman who was illegally sold a weight loss drug on social media told the BBC she ended up in A&E vomiting blood. Maddy, 32, fell seriously ill after using an unlicensed version of semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic - from Instagram.  A BBC investigation found unregulated sellers offering semaglutide as a medicine, without prescription, online. It also found the drug being offered in beauty salons in Manchester and Liverpool. Doctors say drugs bought from unregulated sources are dangerous and could contain potentially toxic ingredients.  Demand for Ozempic, a prescribed type 2 diabetes medication, spiralled last year after it hit the headlines for being Hollywood's secret weight loss drug - nicknamed the skinny jab.  The drug works by lowering blood-sugar levels and slowing down food leaving the stomach. Its soaring popularity led to a rise in off-label prescriptions for weight loss, which triggered global supply issues and created a shortage for diabetes patients in the UK.  As pharmacies across the UK struggled to get hold of the medication, an illicit black market selling semaglutide ""diet kits"" began to flourish online. Delivered by post, these usually contain needles and two vials - one containing a white powder and the other a liquid - which have to be mixed together before the drug can be injected. That's what came through Maddy's letterbox after she searched for a ""quick fix"" on Instagram to help her lose weight ahead of an event.  ""I struggle in general with losing weight. I'm just not one of those people that can shift it easily,"" she says. Maddy came across The Lip King, a company run by Jordan Parke. The Lip King's Instagram feed was flooded with before-and-after transformation photos of women with newly slimmed physiques and screenshots of text messages from customers raving about his product. Maddy wanted in. After a brief message exchange with Mr Parke and a £200 bank transfer, Maddy was sold 10mg of semaglutide with no questions asked. She also received a video from him on WhatsApp instructing her how to mix and inject the drug, along with dangerous guidance advising her to take a higher dose than what health officials would recommend.  After her first injection, Maddy was instantly ""extremely ill, bed-bound, vomiting"". She says Mr Parke told her over text that vomiting was normal and to take anti-sickness tablets. A few weeks later, when the nausea had passed, Maddy tried the drug again - this time before bed. ""I was woken up by the vomiting,"" Maddy says.   ""It was bad. I was throwing up all night, to the point where I was throwing up stomach acid, blood, white foam."" She went to A&E the following afternoon, where she was put on a drip. ""I can be a bit of a drama queen, but I thought I was dying. I was literally crunched over, bawling my eyes out to my mum. I was so angry, as well, because I was like, no-one told me that this was going to be a side effect,"" she says.  ""I did my own research, but I didn't see anywhere that anyone was suffering to this level."" The BBC made several attempts to contact Mr Parke, but he did not respond.  Mr Parke is one of many illicit sellers peddling semaglutide through social media. To find out what is actually in the drugs, the BBC bought unlicensed semaglutide from several sellers and had them tested in the lab.  The results showed inconsistencies in what was in each sample. Although most of the products contained semaglutide, vials from two different sellers had no semaglutide in them at all, and nearly all of them, including the one bought from the Lip King, did not contain the full dose that had been paid for.  Ozempic is available on the NHS strictly for type 2 diabetes patients. Wegovy, another semaglutide drug prescribed specifically to treat obesity, will be offered on the NHS to those with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35, and exceptionally, some people with a BMI of 30 and a weight-related health problem.  Under UK law, it is illegal to sell semaglutide as a medicine without a prescription.  Drugs manufacturer Novo Nordisk is the only company approved to sell and market semaglutide, branded as Ozempic and Wegovy, in the UK, but it is now battling against knock-off online sales.  The firm says it is working with a third party to ""proactively identify and remove websites, ads or social-media accounts selling counterfeit semaglutide"", and has been carrying out ""in-depth investigations into copyright infringement, criminal networks and sellers illegally diverting our products"".  But the BBC has discovered sellers that are closed down one day usually return the next under a new name.  Online sellers attempt to get around the law by placing ""not fit for human consumption"" or ""for research purposes only"" on their product. Gerard Hanratty, a public law expert, says: ""You can put lots of different things on a label. It doesn't mean to say that it is then legal and you are compliant with the regulations."" He says sellers would need to be able to prove they are supplying the product for research purposes and not for human use in order for the warnings to be valid. A BBC Three documentary The Skinny Jab Uncovered found the unapproved versions of the drug advertised in beauty salons on British high streets. Undercover investigators visited four salons in Manchester and Liverpool and received dangerous advice about mixing and dosages in some about how to use the drug.  In one salon, a reporter was told: ""Well, if you have too much, you just wouldn't want to eat anything, and you might feel sick. It's not going to be dangerous."" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it has received reports of people ending up in hospital after using fake Ozempic pens, which are also flooding the market, with more than 300 seized since January. Prof Barbara McGowan, a consultant endocrinologist who co-authored a Novo Nordisk-funded study which trialled semaglutide to treat obesity, says licensed medications - like Ozempic and Wegovy - go through ""very strict"" quality controls before they are approved for use.  She warns that buyers using semaglutide sourced outside the legal supply chain ""could be injecting anything"".  ""We don't know what the excipients are - that is the other ingredients, which come with the medication, which could be potentially toxic and harmful, [or] cause an anaphylactic reaction, allergies and I guess at worse, significant health problems and perhaps even death,"" she says.  Prof McGowan says that drugs like semaglutide can cause ""significant side effects"", such as nausea, for some patients, which is why proper medical support is needed. ""The important thing to understand is not just about the prescription. It's about... all the wraparound care that one gets from senior health-care professionals,"" she adds. Dale Dennis, a personal trainer from East Yorkshire, sells 10mg vials of the unofficial drug and pre-mixed pens. Mr Dennis sells the unlicensed drug on social media, encouraging buyers to message him on WhatsApp to place an order. His company, Raw Peptides Limited, is listed as a business involved in the sale of ""new cars and light motor vehicles"". The BBC contacted Mr Dennis for comment, but after initially agreeing to speak to us, he cancelled our call and sent a text using an expletive, adding: ""I definitely make your yearly salary weekly"".  Dr Simon Cork, senior lecturer in physiology at Anglia Ruskin University, stresses that semaglutide is not a short-term weight loss solution and is suitable only for people with obesity. ""That might be seen as being kind of selfish, because those people quite understandably want to lose some weight, but the drug is not tested or designed to help people in that position."" He says mixing and injecting weight loss drugs at home comes with ""huge risks"".  ""The vast majority of the population are not qualified or trained to administer injectable drugs themselves. And the drugs you buy if you're prescribed Wegovy or Ozempic, or one of the licensed drugs, those come in predefined amounts,"" he says.   ""So you press a button and you get the correct dose of the medication. You're not drawing up an amount into a needle that you're then injecting into yourself."" The vials of semaglutide sold illegally online do not have the safeguards the official medication comes with to prevent patients from overdosing.  Tilly, 22, decided to stop using semaglutide she bought on TikTok after she accidentally injected double the amount she was supposed to.  ""When it came, it didn't have any instructions, which completely confused me… I messaged the company after being like 'what am I meant to do with this?' And she was like, 'well, join a Facebook group',"" she says.  ""It felt like the worst hangover ever. I felt like I had a really bad headache. I felt sick, and I felt stressed about the fact that I'd taken too much,"" she says.   The medicines regulator says it will use its powers to protect the public by taking ""appropriate enforcement action, including, where necessary, prosecuting those who put your health at risk"". The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's chief safety officer, Dr Alison Cave, warns that buying semaglutide from illegal suppliers ""means there are no safeguards to ensure products meet our quality and safety standards, and taking such medicines may put your health at risk"". ""If you suspect you've had an adverse reaction to semaglutide or any other medicinal product, are worried about its safety or effectiveness, or suspect it is not a genuine product, please report it to our Yellow Card scheme,"" she says.

risk appetite,Stadium row 'could hurt 2017 bid',2024-09-15,2011-08-08,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/14444780,"London is bidding to bring the Championships to the UK for the first time London's bid to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships could be derailed by the legal row surrounding the Olympic Stadium. Tottenham Hotspur have sought a judicial review of the decision to hand the stadium over to West Ham. IAAF president Lamine Diack said ruling members would be deterred by a lengthy legal dispute. ""If the legal problems are continuing you must convince my colleagues and many of them will say no,"" he said. ""If London are to win they have to come and say that they have the full support of the Government. ""They have that and I think they have a good bid.""  Diack said the stadium was a ""wonderful"" venue for athletics but also recalled that Britain had previously pulled out of hosting the 2005 World Championships in London. The IAAF rejected an offer by the then sports minister Richard Caborn to stage the event in Sheffield instead.  Diack told the Inside The Games website, external: ""Remember, we gave London the 2005 World Championships. Then we were asked by the minister if we would go to Sheffield and we said, 'No'.  ""We need to have the answer to the stadium. They have delivered a fantastic stadium. The problem is, are we going to have this continue in the future? ""That is the big problem.""  The IAAF will decide on the 2017 hosts in Monaco on 12 November.

risk appetite,What's changed as Super League returns?,2024-09-15,2020-08-01,Dave Woods,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/53607897,"Castleford were convincing winners over St Helens before the Super League season was suspended When the season was suspended because of coronavirus on 15 March, after Castleford's 28-14 win over St Helens, the Super League campaign was intriguingly poised. Saints, last year's champions but now under new coach Kristian Woolf, had lost half of their opening fixtures.  Leeds were smashed by Hull on the opening day of the new campaign, but then strung together four back-to-back wins to suggest they are back in the race for silverware after a couple of lean years.  Wigan and Castleford were showing good early form. And Huddersfield were probably causing the biggest stir, a heavy home defeat by Wigan their only blot on an otherwise eye-catching start with playmaker Aiden Sezer making an early bid for 'signing of the year'. Hull FC had also sacked two-times Challenge Cup-winning coach Lee Radford just days before lockdown. But the season had hardly settled into any telling or set patterns, and when it restarts there will be a real scramble to get off the new starting grid as quickly as possible.  The newly-structured competition means the race is on to make the top four at the end of the regular campaign to stand a chance of playing in November's Grand Final.  As it stands, there are only six points between joint-leaders Wigan, Castleford and Huddersfield and bottom club Hull Kingston Rovers. And, while Hull have played seven games, Leeds and Catalans have only played four and everyone else has played either five or six fixtures. So it is all up for grabs and it will be a few weeks before the obvious runners and riders become clear. Not even the presence of Sonny Bill Williams could prevent Toronto losing all six of their Super League games Toronto Wolfpack made big noises when they arrived in Super League at the start of the season, not least with the signing of world superstar Sonny Bill Williams. The first-ever transatlantic side in British sport was clearly set on making many more headlines. But they have been of the wrong kind. They lost their opening six Super League matches - all played in England - had begun to accumulate a worrying number of injuries and looked on course for a relegation battle.  Their possible salvation came from the fact that still had to enjoy home advantage back in Canada in front of promised big crowds. But Covid-19 has done for them - for this year, anyway. In pulling out of the 2020 campaign they have cited financial problems that no other Super League club has had to face.  Unable to furlough players, unable to access the £16m government loan given to the British game, unable to take a share of the central TV funding, and unable to draw much more from owner David Argyle's dwindling liquid assets, they decided they were unable to carry on for the time being and have been mothballed. Whether they come straight back into Super League next year, or are forced to drop down into the Championship or even League One, has still to be decided. But the noises from the club are that they will be back, in one form or another. There will be no scrums when Super League resumes on Sunday Oh yes, some significant rule changes. For the time being scrums have been axed. It is part of trying to make the playing environment as safe as possible and reduce the risk of any potential spread of the Covid-19 virus. But removing scrums will change the dynamic of the game. No longer will six players from each side congregate for a few seconds in close proximity and give rise to a different potential for attack for the side winning the ball. Instead, it will be a tap restart for the team that would have had the feed - although there will be a few seconds' delay, signified by in-stadium shot-clocks, before they are allowed to tap and go.  How that plays out remains to be seen. Will the sport look a little two dimensional as a result? And if it is judged to be a positive change, might it lead to the push for a demise of scrums altogether? The other significant change is the so-called 'six again' rule, which was introduced in Australia's National Rugby League when they started after lockdown mid-season as pressure grew to make the game more entertaining. Saints coach Woolf expects 'six again' to thrive Under the 'six again' rule, any offence in the tackle other than foul play - such as lying on in the tackle or interfering at the play-the-ball - would lead to the referee resetting the six tackle count back to zero, rather than giving a penalty. In Australia the rule has been widely acclaimed as a success, making the game quicker, helping tire out some of the bigger players and opening up more possibilities for dummy-half runners and game-breakers. Again it will be interesting to see how the rule plays out here. Will it lead to some big blow outs? Will teams with quick dummy-halves simply milk the advantage with some metronomic charges out from behind the ruck? Or will we see the skilful sixes and sevens given more chance to stamp their class on games with the ball moving wider earlier? There is a Covid-19 element to introducing the 'six again' rule because it theoretically leads to less contact time in the tackle. But it's the expectation of extra fun that it possibly brings to the game that is behind it being introduced so soon. London Broncos were relegated from Super League on the final night of last season after losing at Wakefield No-one will be relegated this year, and that could be a great relief to a clutch of clubs who may find themselves in danger of finishing bottom in a potentially tight table come the end of the season. The Super League clubs lobbied for relegation to be voided in 2020, given the disruption to the fixture list and the imbalance created by having to play at least some matches at neutral venues behind closed doors. The Rugby Football League agreed and, given that the Championship will not be returning in a recognisable form this year, has also said there will be no promotion either. So clubs can now play without any pressure. That might give coaches of clubs near the bottom the chance to blood a few younger players. With the tensions of livelihoods-at-stake being lifted we may see some more entertaining, free-flowing games. There will be those that will miss the cut and thrust of the annual relegation dog-fights. But I think we can forgive the owners, coaches and players for lacking the appetite to fight for survival, when a more existential fight for survival has been going on since March. It has been a long lay-off, a shorter than normal pre-season for players to prepare for the 'new' campaign and there will be a fear of an increased number of injuries as a result, especially given how crowded the fixture list begins to look by September and October. But, for the moment, there is just a game-wide relief that Super League is back.  Everyone will be hoping that the fans will be back as well before long."
risk appetite,Rugby League World Cup postponed until 2022,2024-09-15,2021-08-04,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/57630566,"Australia beat England in Brisbane to win the 2017 men's Rugby League World Cup This year's Rugby League World Cup in England has been postponed until 2022 after the withdrawal of champions Australia, and New Zealand. The two countries pulled out of the tournament citing ""player welfare and safety concerns"" related to Covid-19. The World Cup, featuring men's, women's and wheelchair events, was set to start in Newcastle on 23 October. ""It became unfeasible and irresponsible for us to carry on,"" said Jon Dutton, chief executive of the tournament. ""I think it will take some time for international rugby league to recover from this. I hope we can be a beacon of light.  ""Certainly we've prioritised player voice and player choice, we know the players want to play, we took our responsibilities very seriously, and we are determined to stage the biggest and best ever rugby league World Cup.  ""It's a real shame that it cannot be this year but leadership is about making tough decisions, it's about being responsible, and we've done this in the best interests of not just the tournament but of the sport of rugby league."" Listen: BBC Radio 5 Live Rugby League Podcast Australia and NZ World Cup withdrawal 'premature' Super League Show - watch and catch-up here Organisers were given only four minutes' notice that the antipodean neighbours intended to pull out on 22 July, with Rugby Football League (RFL) chairman Simon Johnson calling it a ""selfish, parochial and cowardly decision"". Dutton last week gave it a ""50-50"" chance of going ahead as scheduled this year after discussions with the board and numerous stakeholders, including players. ""There's been some really disappointing behaviour,"" added Dutton when asked about whether Australia, New Zealand and the NRL had called the shots. ""We can't end up in this position again and we'll make sure we don't."" Delaying the World Cup by a year could mean it clashes with the football equivalent in 2022, but Dutton said a window will be found to avoid such a scenario. ""I am disappointed that we've needed to take the decision to delay the Rugby League World Cup,"" said Sport Minister Nigel Huddleston. ""Despite working tirelessly to explore solutions that would allow us to go ahead as planned, circumstances beyond our control have meant that postponing the Rugby League World Cup until next year is the strongest option for staging a successful tournament."" The Rugby League Players Association (RLPA) said it acknowledged ""the extremely difficult decision"" to delay the World Cup and the ""tremendous effort of the RLWC board, Jon Dutton, and the entire team to maintain the tournament's viability up to this point"". ""We have worked exceptionally close with the RLWC team to date and want to thank them for engaging in such a collaborative process which has allowed the players to feel respected and valued throughout the RLWC planning,"" said RLPA chief executive officer Clint Newton. Fresh Covid outbreaks in Australia have forced most states to reimpose restrictions, while the majority of coronavirus restrictions in England have been lifted despite a rise in cases - although those numbers appear to be falling. There were concerns about players and staff having to quarantine for 14 days on their return to Australia, with the country's borders currently closed because of the pandemic. Rugby league officials estimate about 400-500 players, staff and team officials from Australia's National Rugby League - representing several different countries - would be impacted by any quarantine measures on their return to the country after the tournament. Those measures would mean players would only return to their NRL clubs two weeks before trial games for the 2022 season begin. The number of those who would be affected is significantly higher when the women's and wheelchair events are taken into consideration. Outbreaks emerge across Australia in 'new phase' of pandemic The postponement will be a major blow to English rugby league, a sport that has been hit hard by the financial fallout of the pandemic. The UK government has provided rugby league with more than £32m in loan support in the past year. Australia, as 11-time and defending men's champions, were favourites to win the tournament in England, while 2008 winners New Zealand were again poised to be contenders. The event, regarded as one of the most inclusive sports events ever hosted in Britain, was to be staged across 16 towns and cities across England. St James' Park, home of Premier League football side Newcastle United, was scheduled to host the opening game between England and Samoa. Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium was to host the men's and women's finals in a back-to-back spectacle on 27 November. BBC rugby league correspondent Dave Woods Australia's NRL clubs have got their way. The postponement seemed inevitable once they decided, through the voice piece of the Australian Rugby League Commission, that they didn't want to allow their players to compete in a World Cup in England this year. Covid is only the broad issue.  The risk of players being exposed to the virus in this country is a valid concern, despite the RLWC2021 organisers bending over backwards to ensure that protocols would have been in place to keep the tournament as safe as possible. But at the heart of this is that those NRL clubs have only self-interest. They want to protect their own domestic competition going into the 2022 season, rather than seeing the bigger picture of what a World Cup could do for the international profile of the game. It's to be hoped they will prove honourable when they say they will support a rearranged Rugby League World Cup.  With the number of Covid cases in Australia not yet reaching the numbers seen in other countries, and with their vaccine roll out programme a long way behind schedule, it's hard to gauge how badly the pandemic will hit that country in 2022. And indeed, whether a dramatic spike in cases over the next few months will again lessen their appetite to send players abroad. In the meantime, some more incredibly hard work begins for the Rugby League World Cup organisers. Stadiums will have to be rebooked. Cities and towns where the Men's, Women's and Wheelchair teams were going to be based will have to be re-primed in readiness for the delayed event. Broadcasters will have to reschedule. This year's tournament had been over four years in the planning up to this point. Now they have to do a lot of the work again, but this time with less than 14 months to go. Finances will be stretched because budgets were only due to run up to the end of November of this year and the government will be called upon to add to the £25m that it's already invested into the tournament. But in the circumstances of the last few weeks, and the stance of the NRL clubs, Jon Dutton, the RLWC2021 chief executive and his board of directors, had little option but to call a halt to their desperate hard work to get the tournament on as planned.

risk appetite,NRL clubs back World Cup postponement,2024-09-15,2021-07-30,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/58024695,"2020 NRL Premiership winners Melbourne Storm are one of 16 clubs to support the postponement of this year's Rugby League World Cup Clubs from Australia's NRL have backed calls to delay the Rugby League World Cup in England until 2022. On Thursday, tournament chief executive Jon Dutton said there was a ""50-50"" chance it would be staged this year. Australia and New Zealand have pulled out of the event, citing ""player welfare and safety concerns"" related to Covid-19 - a stance backed by the NRL. A decision on whether the tournament will begin as planed on 23 October is expected in days. ""The 16 clubs are united that it is in best interests of player health, safety, wellbeing and the international game for the World Cup not to proceed in 2021,"" the NRL said in a statement. ""The support not to play is based on the high Covid-19 infection rate in the United Kingdom and onerous biosecurity and quarantine protocols that would be placed on all players having just completed a lengthy period away from home during the NRL Telstra Premiership. ""The 16 clubs support the World Cup being delayed until 2022 where it is expected there will be less risk to player health and safety and a stronger competition."" Melbourne Storm and Queensland prop forward Christian Welch, who is also a director of the Rugby League Players' Association, says players were not consulted before reigning champions Australia, the 11-time winners, and New Zealand, who lifted the trophy in 2008, withdrew last week. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Dutton says their withdrawal is ""irreversible"". Following an emergency meeting of the event's board on Wednesday, Dutton said it will explore what appetite there is to go ahead as planned with the contest, which is scheduled to start on 23 October. Dutton also told BBC Sport that ""time is no longer on our side"" and a final decision about the staging of the tournament, which includes men's, women's and wheelchair competitions, will come ""in days, not weeks""."
risk appetite,Why L’Oreal won’t hire introverts,2024-09-15,2015-05-21,Ronald Alsop,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20150521-why-loreal-wont-hire-introverts,"Introverts need not apply to work at French beauty giant, L’Oreal. If they do, recruiters probably won’t select them, and should they somehow manage to get hired, they aren’t likely to thrive at the company. That’s just one of many personal characteristics the company considers when it seeks employees who will fit the company culture. L’Oreal prefers confident, outgoing employees because “we believe ideas come out of confrontation — we will always challenge you and we want you to defend your views,” said Frederique Scavennec, vice president for global talent acquisition. “You also need to have passion, be entrepreneurial and be able to connect with others. Without those, you will die at L’Oreal.” To try to keep casualties to a minimum, L’Oreal uses various techniques to size-up job candidates’ personalities. For example, it might put applicants through a product or advertising exercise, evaluating their creativity and storytelling skills. To find students who are both creative and collaborative, the company also runs its annual Brandstorm competition, challenging university teams to work together to devise a marketing plan for one of its products. More businesses are following L’Oreal’s lead to try to ensure that their hires fit well with the corporate culture. They hope to detect attributes like patience, persistence, curiosity, agility and appetite for risk-taking by subjecting candidates to personality tests and multiple behavioural interviews. Some employers also observe potential hires in situations where they must interact with other workers. And there are even online games that assess everything from creativity to empathy. Work experience still trumps all other qualifications in the recruiting process, but personality and fit with the culture ranked ahead of such factors as leadership experience in a 2014 survey of more than 2,300 chief executive officers, human-resource managers and other executives in 18 countries. The study, by Universum, a consulting firm for employer branding, found nearly half of respondents rate personality profile as one of the most important hiring considerations and about 40% cite culture fit. Only 16% consider the university an applicant attended to be important. In the study, 44% of the people surveyed said they currently use what Universum calls persona-based recruiting, and 69% said they will do so in the future. Disastrous pick Picking the wrong personality is expensive for both employee and employer. The individual will be unemployed, while the employer will have wasted thousands of dollars on recruiting and training. “I don’t want people to leave after six months, so I start all my interviews by telling them to be transparent and not play games,” Scavennec said. “I want to know what makes them happy and unhappy and how they react to events. I tell them that if they lie to me and we get married, we may get divorced.” Some employers are using data analysis to identify the personality characteristics that their top performers have in common. L’Oreal itself is considering a project to try to create models of the personality types that succeed most at the company. “But it’s a complicated thing, and we don’t want to get into cloning employees,” Scavennec said. Grant Thornton in the UK ran a different kind of analysis and found that academic grades didn’t correlate strongly with performance. The results encouraged the accounting firm to take a more holistic view of applicants, including their personality traits, values and potential. “It was a bold move in our industry, which traditionally has had strict academic entry standards,” said Helen Baldwyn, national student recruitment manager at Grant Thornton. “But we decided grades aren’t the be all and end all and reframed our selection process around values and behaviours to really learn what makes students tick.” Now, recruiters observe students in group exercises and ask more behavioural questions in interviews. “We might ask students about how they spotted an opportunity and how they acted on it,” Baldwyn said. “We want to know how well they engage with others, how they build relationships and how curious they are.” Grant Thornton is not only making better hires, but it also is increasing the socioeconomic diversity of its workforce. About 20% of new trainees in 2015 wouldn’t have been able to apply in previous years because they didn’t meet the firm’s academic standards, Baldwyn said. Matching and weeding Of course, it isn’t easy to accurately assess personality and cultural fit during the short recruitment period. That’s why Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi devised a longer, more thorough programme to try to match the right people with the right jobs and weed out those who aren’t suited to any position at the company. When the fast-growing airline tried to hire more Emirati nationals, it found that many people were being rejected because it focused primarily on technical skills and experience. Now, it tries to identify candidates’ personality traits and their suitability for specific jobs through a four-month process called Discovery Centre. The airline first explains what the available jobs entail, then puts candidates through a self-discovery process. For example, it asks people to draw pictures of themselves, highlighting their personal qualities. One woman depicted herself as a treasure box to show how much family and friends value her and seek her advice. “People start to speak freely about themselves in front of everybody, whereas before, they were reserved when we asked them questions in an interview,” said Wissam Hachem, vice president for learning and development. “People in this culture don’t like to brag and sell themselves.” After receiving a provisional offer, the candidates participate in a three-month learning program to better understand the company and airline industry and to build their skills. They also undergo skill and personality assessments and complete a one-month group project before receiving final confirmation of their continued employment with Etihad and before being placed in the job they’re most qualified for. Thus far, about 40 people have gone through the Discovery Centre, with some changing career tracks after the four-month process, but all remaining with the airline. “We are growing fast and have developed a can-do attitude culture, so we’re looking for people who are agile and work well under pressure given our constant change,” Hachem said. “We also want people who are positive and sociable and interact well with people both internally and externally. We need to be as sure as possible they will fit into our dynamic environment where everything is based on winning behaviour.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,No experience? No problem,2024-09-15,2014-08-15,Ye Eun Charlotte Chun,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140814-no-experience-no-problem,"Whether you’re a recent college or simply want to switch industries, entering a new field can be a daunting task.  For starters, it’s unlikely you’ll have the just-right experience an employer is looking for. So, what happens when entry-level jobs ask for relevant work experience, and you simply don’t have any? It turns out that, in some cases, not having the perfect background on your CV can fall in your favour. Several LinkedIn Influencers weighed in the topic this week, with insights on how to optimize a lack of work experience — and get hired fast. Here’s what two of them had to say. Robbie Waeschenfelder, senior director of marketing at Ask.com  “You have a job opening, posted the job and you're getting resumes. Awesome. Now what do most hiring managers and recruiters do? They pick the resumes of people who already have a ton of experience with the kind of job you're hiring for,” wrote Waeschenfelder in his post Hire Someone With No Experience! Wait, what? But, that could be a mistake, he wrote. It seems intuitive to pick candidates who have ideally done the exact same job you need in a different business or a competitor.  “But, if you ask me… there is a huge problem: they're not motivated” wrote Waeschenfelder. “What possibly is their motivation to do this job really well? They've literally been there and done that.” That’s why Waeschenfelder  believes hiring a candidate with no relevant experience could actually be a smarter move. “They'll put 150% effort into it, learn every detail of the job, half out of appetite to impress and learn, half out of (a positive) anxiety of failing,” Waeschenfelder wrote. “There is some risk in them drowning in their new responsibility, but that’s not really a highly likely outcome if…they have you to keep them on track and guide them.” James Citrin, senior director at Spencer Stuart  At some point in your career, you’ve faced it, the big career Catch-22: the “permission paradox”. It’s that moment  when “you can’t get the job without the experience but you can’t get the experience without the job,” wrote Citrin in his post How to Get the Job When You Don’t Have the Experience. “Overcoming this conundrum is fundamental both to launching your career successfully and thriving over the long term,” he wrote. “You are confident in your abilities if only you’re given the chance. The hard part is getting the shot to show what you can do.” One key to overcoming the “permission paradox” is to recognise you are being evaluated on two points: your potential to add value to the firm, and your track record “in the area most central to the job”. “Depending on the seniority of the position, these two sources of value…will be weighted in different proportions,” wrote Citrin. “Your potential value is best demonstrated by your attitude, enthusiasm, work ethic, communications skills, curiosity/quality of your questions, willingness to learn, and your knowledge of the company and role,” he wrote. Citrin offered five key ways to shift the scales in your favour. Among them: “Get credentials. This can be in the form of a specialized degree or targeted training,” he wrote. “So go ahead, pick your field of interest, whether it be coding, finance, aviation, or the business of art, and find a respected credential-granting school or organization and pursue it.” “Be willing to start at the bottom. “Whether it’s in the Internet industry, financial services, retail, hospitality, or any other business that touches large numbers of people, starting at the point of customer interface, whether in customer support, behind the cash register, on the sales floor, or at the concierge desk, will give you a valuable opportunity to learn what’s really going on in the market.” Citrin wrote. “You’ll be able to use this when you seek to work your way up the ladder internally or interview elsewhere.” “Barter. You may not yet have a job. But if you don't, by definition you have something else of enormous value, which you may not be fully considering,” he wrote. And that is time. “Treat your time as the precious asset it is. If you are creative and package your time with energy, enthusiasm, and initiative, you can barter your way to opportunity.” Consider what you could do with your time that can help a potential employer now — and offer to do it.

Sand. We take it for granted. From deserts to beaches to children’s playgrounds, it seems ubiquitous. Yet the abundant resource is feeding a global land grab that’s even bred a sand-smuggling underworld. While researching beach erosion in Negril, Jamaica about six years ago, scientist Pascal Peduzzi’s conversation with residents in a fishing village left him astounded. Despite the high-tech geospatial modelling and remote sensing tools he was using to survey the damage, he’d never have surmised one reason for erosion on the country’s western coastline. Locals told him about the local mafias — armed men who came to the beach in the middle of night, hauled away bags of sand and sold them for the construction of beachfront developments. “I was shocked that people would fight for sand,” said Peduzzi, director of science at the United Nations Environment Programme’s Division of Early Warning and Assessment. “I have been working for more than 20 years in the environment sector, but sand came to me as a surprise.” As a building material, sand has withstood the test of time. In 3500BC, ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians were using sand, mostly formed when wind and water grind rocks into silica-rich grains, to make glass. Today, builders the world over use the natural resource, found in quarries, rivers, lakes and oceans, for many of their materials including paint and cement. With a global building boom and the arrival of hydraulic fracturing technology for oil and gas in the United States, the demand for sand has been skyrocketing. In 2014, 196 million tons of sand and its bigger counterpart gravel were mined around the world, according to the US Geological Survey. After water, it’s the most abundantly used natural resource, Peduzzi said. It’s used in everything from swimming-pool filters, metal castings and oil wells to smartphone screens and toothpaste. The overall sand and gravel market was valued at $8.3bn in the US last year and £1.7bn ($2.5bn) in the UK in 2013, according to the USGS and the UK’s Mineral Products Association. Global demand for sand is expected to rise 5.5% a year through 2018, according to a December 2014 report from the Freedonia Group. Investors willing to weather the volatility, sift through the fragmented market and take on potential environmental risks could stand to profit from the growing appetite for this global commodity. For years the sand market had been pretty “boring,” said Sonny Randhawa, a vice president in charge of research for the energy sector at D.A. Davidson, an Oregon based investment firm. But in the past few years the sand market has been more “feast or famine”, he said, particularly in the US. Uneven global demand Demand for sand is spread unevenly across the globe. Building booms in China and India have increased the need for sand in those markets. Globally, China accounts for a fifth of the world’s sand imports, according to the Trade Statistics Branch of the United Nations.  Because of the frenzied development of new dams, roads, buildings and factories the country has used more sand in the last four years than the US has in the last century, according to Peduzzi. China has even been piling huge amounts of sand onto reefs to create new islands and expand its foothold in the South China Sea. Even the United Arab Emirates imported $456m worth of sand, stone and gravel in 2014, according to the UN. Despite being in the heart of the desert, imported sand built Dubai, according to Pascal. Wind-formed desert sand is too smooth for construction. Meanwhile, in the UK, the need for sand has dropped off as new construction cools and recyclables get a political push. Demand for rock, gravel and sand is 25% below 2007 levels, according to the UK Mineral Products Association.  And in the US, the rise of hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” has created a huge appetite for sand. In 2013, the production of sand for fracking wells was 19 times higher than a decade earlier, according to the USGS. The process involves injecting water, sand and chemicals down a horizontally drilled well thousands of feet below the earth’s surface into a rock formation to extract oil or natural gas. While the market for industrial sand has tracked overall economic growth in the US, the demand for frac sand has been as volatile as oil prices. From 2011 to 2014 the demand for frac sand more than doubled from 24 million tons to 59 million tons, but then dropped off last year to 50 million tons, said Randhawa. But even as oil prices tail off, demand for sand is growing, largely due to the increased amount of sand going into wells in an attempt to extract more oil, according to Marc Bianchi, a managing director at Cowen and Company. As fracturing technology becomes better at extracting more oil per well, the amount of sand used per well has also doubled, from 2,000 tons a well in the second quarter of 2013 to 4,400 tons in the fourth quarter of 2015, he said.  How to invest It takes deep pockets and pioneering spirit to buy up a sand mine or offshore facility directly. Many countries regulate sand extraction, handing out a limited number of licenses to prevent overmining. And the technology to extract, process and transport sand will likely be far too expensive for individual investors.   Even investing in existing sand companies requires untangling complex layers across the value chain, from smaller mom-and-pop operations that may own a single mine, to large multinational players like Belgium-based Sibelco Group, a 144-year-old company that operates in 41 countries, or Germany’s Heidelberg Cement, which makes and sells cement in 40 countries and owns and operates sand facilities globally. For the most part, the highly fragmented market is regionally focused. On the European side, the European Association of Industrial Silica Producers maintains a comprehensive list of major players on the continent. In the US, 230 companies have 335 sand operations across 35 states, according to the USGS. Within the past few years, four US sand companies have started selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Randhawa has “buy” ratings on all them. Two of the companies — Emerge Energy Services and Hi Crush Partners — focus exclusively on the frac sand market, while Fairmount Minerals and U.S. Silica also have industrial sand operations. Because of their recent listings, Randhawa said that it’s tough to track returns, but with unpredictable oil prices, investors willing to take the risk should be prepared for volatility. Both Randhawa and Bianchi believe that U.S. Silica, which has been around since 1900, is best prepared to survive the roller coaster. They said the company’s long-standing customers provide the company a stable source of revenue even if demand for frac sand levels off. Plus, the company has been churning out new sand-related products such as adding antimicrobial coating to swimming pool-filter sand. Future concerns Finally, there are legal and environmental concerns to think about around the world. Beaches have eroded on average 40m from 1968 to 2008, according to Peduzzi. In some areas, such as South Carolina and California in the US, erosion from overmining and global warming has measured hundreds of metres. In other parts of the world, islands have disappeared altogether. “We do still have a huge amount of sand,” said Peduzzi. But “because we use it so much, sand is becoming rare. That’s not to say we should stop using sand, but we should be a bit more cautious.” This story was produced under the BBC's guidelines for financial journalism.

risk appetite,When Airbnb turns into a nightmare,2024-09-15,2016-03-07,Kate Ashford,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160304-dogs-booze-and-chaos-is-renting-through-airbnb-worth-it,"Homestay sites are a hugely popular way to make some extra cash. But it can quickly become a nightmare if you don’t protect yourself. Cary Carbonaro used to rent out her Florida home on Airbnb for a couple of weekends every year to earn a little extra cash. But after her experience in 2015, she’ll never do it again. “My house policy said ‘no pets,’ and they came with three dogs — my neighbour called me,” said Carbonaro, a certified financial planner and author who lives in both New York and Florida. “My husband is highly allergic.” Carbonaro called the tenants and Airbnb, but she was unable to get the dogs removed from her home. When her guests departed two days later, they left rubbish everywhere, they had broken various items and there was dog hair on every surface. Carbonaro had to hire an industrial cleaning service to clean the pet hair so her husband could be in the house, and she estimates that she spent nearly $800 fixing the damage. Nick Shapiro, a spokesperson at Airbnb said that experiences like this aren’t common. “More than 80 million people have had safe, positive experiences on Airbnb and negative incidents are extremely rare,” he said. “At the end of the day, we obviously can’t eliminate all the risk in traveling, but we work very hard to ensure that hosts and guests have the ability to make the most informed decisions they can.” As unfortunate as Carbonaro’s experience was, some hosts on homeshare and homestay sites have seen far worse. Some have been evicted for renting out their apartments because they breached their lease agreements. Others have had their homes destroyed by wild parties, valuable heirlooms stolen or even found their property being used for illegal businesses. Even with some negative stories out there, Airbnb has more than 600,000 hosts in more than 34,000 cities worldwide. There are still plenty of people happy to take the plunge and making a lot of money from their property. Before you list your spare room or house on a home-sharing site, here’s what you should know: What it will take: You’ll need an appetite for risk, because you’re inviting strangers into your space. And even if you’re present and being careful, bad things can happen. You’ll need good insurance, a strong safe for your valuables and the ability to take on the extra work involved in preparing your property for guests, who might not behave in a manner you find appealing. “This is the sharing economy,” said Galen Hayes, president of Hayes Insurance Agency in California, which means “if you’re not using your bedroom, rent it out to somebody.” He warned the problem with this is that people can “tend to be creepy and a little on the dishonest side.” How long you need to prepare: You can list a property or room on a site quickly and easily, but allow enough time beforehand to cover your bases. Call your homeowners or renters insurance firm and see if your policy covers you during a short-term rental, and if it doesn’t, ask if you can purchase additional coverage. Some vacation rental sites offer host protection coverage, but reports vary on its effectiveness. “Airbnb’s Host Guarantee provides protection for up to £600,000 [$1 million] in damages — but this excludes cover for cash, pets, personal liability, shared or common areas while providing limited cover for valuables, collectibles and artworks,” said Ben Wilson, home insurance expert at UK site GoCompare.com. “Airbnb makes it clear that home-hosts shouldn’t consider its Host Guarantee as a replacement or stand-in for homeowners’ or renters’ insurance.” Your insurer might tell you that you need to purchase a business or commercial insurance policy, but you may also be able to find what you need from your hosting company or a third party. Vacation rental site HomeAway, for instance, partners with an insurance company to offer Assure insurance, which acts like a commercial policy. And in the UK, Belong Safe just launched a new pay-per-day household insurance policy “for the sharing economy.” Also consider securing a space for your valuables, such as a locked closet or safe, or even an off-site storage space. Do it now: Understand the time commitment. If you plan to rent the odd weekend here and there, hosting isn’t a huge time suck. But if you intend to try to make a steady side income, be prepared. “It’s a huge amount of work to be competitive,” said Henry Parry-Okedon, co-founder of InvitedHome.com, a vacation rental site. From managing inquiries and guest screening to handling questions and maintenance issues, there’s plenty to keep you busy. And if you don’t do it well, your guests’ reviews will reflect that and impact future bookings. Know your local restrictions. Are you renting? Make sure your landlord allows you to sub-let. Do you belong to a neighbourhood association, a common US arrangement in which a group of residents or property owners share a set of rules for a neighbourhood? Make sure they allow short-term rentals. Have you checked into your city’s ordinances? In San Francisco, short-term rental operators must be certified as a business and pay a 14% tax on short-term stays. Violating the terms of your housing agreements can have consequences ranging from fines to eviction. It’s also worth noting that in some areas, once a tenant has stayed for a certain amount of time, sometimes as little as 30 consecutive days, they are granted tenant’s rights — and can be extremely difficult to evict. One case made headlines after a woman had to take legal action to evict two Airbnb guests who were squatting in her apartment and wouldn’t leave. Investigate your guests. To the extent that you can, look into the people who will be staying in your home. Read their profiles and check for positive reviews. Google them and confirm they exist in real life. Be wary of guests who are uncommunicative or pushy early on, asking for exceptions to your house rules or being vague about the details of their stay, such as the number of guests or the reason they’re visiting. “Hosts should make sure to look at the reviews on the potential guest left by previous hosts to see if the guest exhibits the behavior you would like in your home,” Shapiro said. “Hosts should also use the secure messaging system to get to the know the potential guest beforehand and they should review their profile."" Consider imposing your own guest restrictions. “We thoroughly vetted potential guests,” said Leo Biy, an Airbnb host in Massachusetts in the US. “We would not rent to anyone under 30. We would not rent to anyone without reviews. We also set a high per-night cost. I believe that when people pay more, they are much less likely to trash your place, or steal something. So our cost per night is $275 average, whereas you can rent a similar place nearby for $150 to $175.” Stop your post arriving at your property. Go in to a post office and request that they hold mail delivery while you’re away — or ask a neighbour to collect it — to keep financial and other information out of harm’s way. Install an electronic lock. An electronic lock removes keys — and the ability for guests to take them — from the equation. “Once a customer tried to sneak in an extra guest, to whom they gave the key,” said Bill Seavey, an Airbnb host in California. “We never got the key back and charged the reserving customer $25 to change the lock. She went ballistic on the review. Now we have an electronic lock.” Do it smarter: Trust your gut. “My wife and I have a policy that if we get a weird feeling or something doesn’t seem quite right upon meeting the guest for the first time, we will pay for a room in a local hotel and take the loss,” said Aaron Hatch, an Airbnb host in California. “Luckily, we have never had to put someone up in a hotel.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,When loose lips sink companies,2024-09-15,2014-09-11,Lucy Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140910-loose-lips-and-corporate-secrets,"Boardroom 101 What do board committees do? Most of the detail
work of the broader board is done by subcommittees. They look in-depth at
things like executive pay, the corporate audit, various risks and much more. What risks do boards consider? Directors
look at a broad range of risks, from strategic to operational. They also think
about what the companies risk
appetite is. A company is planning to go public sometime in the next year and I know everything about it. I know management’s strategy, which board members they are planning to ""dump"", which employees they are going to ease out and replace before they announce the IPO, who the company’s main competitors are, who its bankers are, how management plans to finesse the filing to make negatives sound more positive… Suffice it to say, I know a lot about them. Have I ever worked with them? Nope. Do I know anyone who works at the company? Not really. I know all this because the person (that I surmised is their chief financial officer) came and sat down in a seat next to me in an airline lounge at the airport in Munich, Germany, and spent the entire time speaking freely, and without moderating his tone about any of it. It was information I didn’t want to know, particularly because much of it was insider information that could have had regulatory repercussions, and yet now I know it all, as do a couple dozen other people who were sitting nearby giving him the evil eye. This all happened as I was travelling back from a board meeting where I’d spent a good amount of time in a risk and governance committee meeting. This chap’s oversharing phone call got me to thinking about risk in a new way. “Loose lips” risk Over the years I’ve sat on several board committees that focus on company risk, including audit and governance and risk committees. We talk about a lot of types of risk. Cyber, money, market, strategy and much more. The company risk register, which is essentially a rolling record of potential risks, helps keep track and measure all these possible dangers, and it can grow to pages long. There is one risk I'm going to be looking at more carefully in the coming months. I’m going to call it the “loose lips” risk. It is a human risk that can be found anywhere. Mostly it is heard in crowded public places such as airline and hotel lounges and trains, but it can also be found in quiet, out-of-the-way places.    Bucolic public gardens are not immune. Imagine my surprise when two senior executives of a large public company had a frank talk about their board meetings while standing over my son and me as we were pond dipping. We’d been there for a little while and I suppose we looked harmless enough, just a mother and her son. These guys paused in their walk to gaze over the pond, talking intimate board business and plans for the future. This case was a bit more embarrassing because I actually knew a lot about the company and people they were talking about. Public places can lure people into thinking they are invisible. Creating a bubble Mobile phones and video chatting have their plusses. They allow you to get work done anywhere — be it the beach or the airport. The downside, from a risk perspective, is that we are not forced to sit in closed offices where information is more secure. Now we can talk confidential business anywhere. Until someone invents a device that creates a personal bubble (not a bad idea, come to think of it), we are surrounded by a lot of strangers at close quarters whenever we eat out, travel on public transportation — that includes taxis — and go for a walk and talk. It happens often enough that I think I may suggest this risk be separated from the human error line in the risk register into its own ""loose lips sink ships"" line item. My fellow committee members will laugh until I tell them how many times in my last month of travel I've encountered this, then they will likely realise it has happened a lot to them too, and that, frankly, we’ve all been guilty of it. We'll have to make a strategy about how to tell executives not to blabber without being patronising — some will clip and send this column as a not-so-subtle hint. But one thing is certain: it is vital that we pay attention because no one needs to hack our secure servers or tap our phones for private information if they can simply get it by sitting a couple seats away on the train. Discretion is the wiser part of valour, and in this case, not only will we be protecting the companies we work for from an easy-to-manage risk, we’ll also make much more pleasant neighbours in public spaces.

risk appetite,The art and science of taking risks,2024-09-15,2017-06-07,Vivian Giang,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170606-you-can-teach-yourself-to-be-a-risk-taker,"Business leaders say taking risks is an essential part of getting ahead in today's world. If that's not your style, how can you become more comfortable with leaping into the unknown? It took Binta Niambi Brown several years to walk away in 2013 from the comfortable life she had built for herself as a corporate lawyer. She was going to start her own business, in a tough market that was already flooded. By 2015, she had launched Fermata Entertainment, a production and artist management company based in Brooklyn, New York. Her boutique record label, Big Mouth Records, followed shortly after. “I could have gone and worked for a record label as an executive and there were certainly opportunities to do that,” Brown says. “But there was a particular problem that I wanted to solve and I believed that I had a solution to it. I felt compelled to try that and see if I could build something and be successful at it.” This past year, Brown’s record label won its first Grammy and produced a song that’s been streamed tens of millions of times. Her story can serve as inspiration for others who dream of taking a similar leap from an easy and secure way of life into the unknown. In a world where a guaranteed job for life is now a rare gem, the conventional career path no longer exists in most developed economies. So does this mean we have to take risks to get ahead? Bill Aulet, a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, believes so. He insists that doing things the way they’ve always been done at a time of such uncertainty is the “most risky thing you can probably do.” This attitude is perhaps reflected in the way we view risk-takers. For better or worse, those who are brave enough to take the plunge are often celebrated. After all, playing it safe just doesn’t make for a great story. Would Elon Musk be idolised by entrepreneurs around the world in the way he is today if he hadn’t taken a gamble that saw his companies rocket from near bankruptcy in 2008 into the multibillion-dollar enterprises Tesla and SpaceX? So perhaps we should not be surprised to see risk-taking becoming a modern, global phenomenon. The “go big or go home” start-up culture has cultivated a mentality that says only those willing to take big risks can reap great rewards. Those who do not take chances are on the path to “guaranteed failure”, according to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. But what does it take to be a risk-taker? And is it possible to turn yourself into one? What makes a risk-taker? Our ability to take a chance and be comfortable with an unknown outcome is affected by our own psychological make-up, the physiological functions in our bodies, the culture in which we grew up and wider societal acceptance of risky behaviour. Research has found, for example, that our individual testosterone levels can directly correlate with our appetite for risk. Since men tend to have higher testosterone levels than women, they can often be more willing to act impulsively, on partial information – even though both genders have similar appetites for risk. “When you’re gearing up for a fight or you’ve taken a risk and it’s paid off well, your testosterone levels increase and you become more confident,” says Dr Tara Swart, a neuroscientist and leadership coach based in London, England. On the other hand, when your risky venture leads to failure, your testosterone levels drop. “Your brain will actually prevent you [from taking more risks] by giving you more memories of times when things went wrong,” Swart adds. Our own experiences and our individual emotional histories will also affect how risky we’ll be. Your parents may have been particularly risk-averse during your upbringing, or you may have taken a risk in the past that didn’t pay off, making you cautious when you face your next “should-I-shouldn’t-I?” moment. And then there are cultural factors. You might come from a society or social group that values steady and safe successes in a person’s professional, financial or personal life, over the chance involved in trial and error. In some environments, such as California’s Silicon Valley, taking risks is seen as being fundamental for success in the start-up culture that flourishes there. How to become a risk-taker For those who are not natural risk takers, there are a few ways to make yourself more comfortable with taking a chance. To a limited extent, you can alter the physiological responses that might keep you from taking risks by mastering some of the psychological issues too. Swart recommends a practice she refers to as “silencing the mind.” These techniques are designed to reduce “brain chatter” by training the brain on being in the present. Whether you’re walking, eating, or breathing, focusing on the sights, sounds, and physical sensations of that particular moment can help drown out our habit of replaying mistakes and worries, says Swart. Such mindful practices, along with living a healthy lifestyle, have been proven to control levels of adrenaline and cortisol, the stress hormone that’s released when you’re under the kind of pressure that’s associated with taking a risk. In other words, mindfulness can keep your cortisol and adrenaline levels down, so that you can be clear-headed enough to make intelligent decisions – even taking some risks necessary for success in today’s ambiguous business world. Taking risks also means overcoming some of your natural responses to uncertainty and anxiety. Srini Pillay, author of Think Less, Learn More: Unlock the Power of the Unfocused Mind and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, says biology plays a very small part in your risk-taking abilities compared to environmental factors. He believes one of the most effective ways we can build resilience against the anxiety risk-taking can cause is to tap into the power of our unfocused mind. Our conscious brain trains us to focus and use lessons from past experiences to make better decisions. But according to Pillay, most experts including Michael S. Gazzaniga, one of the world's foremost cognitive neuroscientists, think that between 90% and 98% of mental activity is unconscious. In order to be a better risk-taker, it is vital to let your subconscious take over sometimes, helping your brain to pick up long-lost memories and connect ideas, says Pillay. Some of the practical steps he gives to engaging our unconscious minds include resting, napping, and even adopting a persona – a study from 2016 found that people are more successful at solving problems and inevitably, practicing intelligent risk-taking, when they behave like an eccentric poet rather than a rigid librarian. “The brain is optimally designed to take both risk and certainty, focus and unfocus and for every human being learning how to balance the equation is crucial,” says Pillay. Recalibrating your thinking When it comes to overcoming our personal histories and bad experiences with previous risks, there’s an inevitable challenge. It’s also sometimes impossible to influence the views of our friends, family and colleagues when it comes to taking risks. But what we can change is the way we think about those elements and our reactions to them. Deena Goodman, a psychotherapist and executive coach, helps senior-level professionals change their “catastrophic thinking” patterns and become more at ease with taking risks. A classic example of uncertainty that gives many of us anxiety is public speaking. If you are asked to give a keynote speech at a major industry event, for example, you might know it could advance your career but you may also fear it could all go horribly wrong. By recalibrating your thinking, you can learn how to be comfortable with this uncertainty and attach less importance to the judgement of others. “Most catastrophic thinking comes from being out of control,” says Goodman. “When we’re out of control, we try to latch on to control by predicting the worst possible outcomes.” This fear of “what’s coming next” tends to drive the irrational thoughts that we have about ourselves, about how we’re going to be perceived and what’s going to happen to us. In instances where some risk is involved, Goodman advises her clients to write down their irrational thoughts, then for each of their worst-case scenarios, think: so what? In the case of the keynote speech, for example, you might forget what you’re saying midway through, but then what happens? Going through each one of these feared ‘bad’ outcomes can help “a person get in control over what feels almost impossible to control,” she says. She also suggests thinking of the many possible positive outcomes that can arise from taking a risk. What she finds is that along the way, people realise that they’ll survive most decisions that involve some risk and they come up with alternative plans in case anything does go awry. Taking a chance on yourself Perhaps ultimately you will need to be willing to take a chance on yourself, to accept that you can make the right choices and cope with the bad ones should things go awry. But it’s worth reminding yourself that risks are almost always necessary for innovation and for progress, says Aulet. It’s not about taking every risk that comes along, but training your brain to capable of taking intelligent and educated risks while also allowing yourself to think about what would happen if things don’t go as planned. For Brown, it is something she reminds herself of daily.  “It’s certainly a very different life for me,” she says. “I was making a very good living as a corporate lawyer, so going from that to being an entrepreneur and learning how to live differently and make choices in a different kind of way has been one of the most extraordinary rides of my life.” “It’s funny because I never thought I could be happier with more risk and less security and with less certainty.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

risk appetite,Is breakfast the most important meal?,2024-09-15,2018-11-28,Jessica Brown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181126-is-breakfast-good-for-your-health,"We’ve all heard that healthier, fitter people don’t skip breakfast. But does that mean breakfast makes us healthier and thinner – or is it something else? Along with old classics like ‘carrots give you night vision’ and ‘Santa doesn’t bring toys to misbehaving children’, one of the most well-worn phrases in the arsenal of tired parents everywhere is that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Many of us grow up believing that skipping breakfast is a dietary travesty – even if only two thirds of adults in the UK eat breakfast regularly, according to the Association of UK Dieticians (BDA), and around three-quarters of Americans. The clue for why breakfast is supposed to be important is in its name: we’re advised to eat it to break our overnight fast. “The body uses a lot of energy stores for growth and repair through the night,” explains dietician Sarah Elder. “Eating a balanced breakfast helps to up our energy, as well as protein and calcium used throughout the night.”   But there’s widespread disagreement over whether breakfast should keep its top spot in the hierarchy of meals. As well as the rising popularity of fasting diets, there have been concerns around the sugar content of cereal and the food industry’s involvement in pro-breakfast research – and even one claim from an academic that breakfast is “dangerous”. So what’s the reality? Is breakfast a necessary start to the day… or a marketing ploy by cereal companies? You might also like: • Is sugar really bad for you?  • We don’t need nearly as much protein as we consume  • Is having a low-salt diet as unhealthy as too much? Weighty decision The most researched aspect of breakfast (and breakfast-skipping) has been its links to obesity. Scientists have different theories as to why there’s a relationship between the two.   In one US study that analysed the health data of 50,000 people over seven years, researchers found that those who made breakfast the largest meal of the day were more likely to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who ate a large lunch or dinner. The researchers argued that breakfast helps increase satiety, reduce daily calorie intake, improve the quality of our diet – since breakfast foods are often higher in fibre and nutrients – and improve insulin sensitivity at subsequent meals, which can be a risk for diabetes. But as with any study of this kind, it was unclear if that was the cause – or if breakfast-skippers were just more likely to be overweight to begin with. To find out, researchers designed a study in which 52 obese women took part in a 12-week weight loss programme. All had the same number of calories over the day, but half had breakfast, while the other half did not. What they found was that it wasn’t breakfast itself that caused the participants to lose weight: it was changing their normal routine. The women who said before the study that they usually ate breakfast lost 8.9kg when they stopped having breakfast, compared to 6.2kg in the breakfast group. Meanwhile, those who usually skipped breakfast lost 7.7kg when they started eating it – and 6kg when they continued to skip it. If breakfast alone isn’t a guarantee of weight loss, why is there a link between obesity and skipping breakfast? Alexandra Johnstone, professor of appetite research at the University of Aberdeen, argues that it may simply be because breakfast-skippers have been found to be less knowledgeable about nutrition and health. “There are a lot of studies on the relationship between breakfast eating and possible health outcomes, but this may be because those who eat breakfast choose to habitually have health-enhancing behaviours such as not smoking and regular exercise,” she says. A 2016 review of 10 studies looking into the relationship between breakfast and weight management concluded there is “limited evidence” supporting or refuting the argument that breakfast influences weight or food intake, and more evidence is required before breakfast recommendations can be used to help prevent obesity. Feast or fast? Intermittent fasting, which involves fasting overnight and into the next day, is gaining ground among those looking to lose or maintain their weight or improve their health.   One pilot study published in 2018, for example, found that intermittent fasting improves blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity and lowers blood pressure. Eight men with pre-diabetes were assigned one of two eating schedules: either eating all their calories between 9:00 and 15:00, or eating the same number of calories over 12 hours. The results for the 9:00-15:00 group were found to be on par with medicine that lowers blood pressure, according to Courtney Peterson, the study’s author and assistant professor of nutrition sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Still, the study’s small size means more research is needed on its possible long-term benefits. If skipping breakfast (and other food outside of a restricted time slot) could potentially be good for you, does that mean breakfast could be bad for you? One academic has said so, arguing that breakfast is ‘dangerous’: eating early in the day causes our cortisol to peak more than it does later on. This causes the body to become resistant to insulin over time and can lead to type 2 diabetes. But Fredrik Karpe, professor of metabolic medicine at Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, argues this isn’t the case. Instead, higher levels of cortisol in the morning are just part of our body’s natural rhythm. Not only that, but breakfast is key to jumpstarting our metabolism, he says. “In order for other tissues to respond well to food intake, you need an initial trigger involving carbs responding to insulin. Breakfast is critical for this to happen,” Karpe says. A randomised control trial published last year involving 18 people with, and 18 people without, diabetes found that skipping breakfast disrupted the circadian rhythms of both groups and led to larger spikes in blood glucose levels after eating. Eating breakfast, the researchers conclude, is essential for keeping our body clock running on time. Peterson says those who skip breakfast can be divided into those who either skip breakfast and eat dinner at a normal time – getting the benefits of intermittent fasting, if not breakfast – or those who skip breakfast and eat dinner late. “For those who eat dinner later, their risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease goes through the roof. While it seems breakfast is the most important meal of the day, it might actually be dinner,” she says. “Our blood sugar control is best early in the day. When we eat dinner late, that’s when we’re most vulnerable because our blood sugar is worst. There’s more research to do, but I’m confident you shouldn’t skip breakfast and have dinner late.”   She says we should think of our circadian rhythm as an orchestra. “There are two parts of our circadian clock. There’s the master clock in the brain, which we should think of as analogous to a conductor of an orchestra, and the other half is in every organ, which has a separate clock,” she says. And that ‘orchestra’ is set by two outside factors: bright light exposure and our eating schedule. “If you’re eating when you’re not getting bright light exposure, the clocks that control metabolism are in different time zones, creating conflicting signals as to whether to rev up or down.” It’s like two halves of an orchestra playing different songs, Peterson explains, and this is why eating late impairs blood sugar and blood pressure levels. Researchers from the University of Surrey and University of Aberdeen are halfway through research looking into the mechanisms behind how the time we eat influences body weight. Early findings suggest that a bigger breakfast is beneficial to weight control. Health food Breakfast has been found to affect more than just weight. Skipping breakfast has been associated with a 27% increased risk of heart disease, a 21% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in men, and a 20% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women. One reason may be breakfast’s nutritional value – partly because cereal is fortified with vitamins. In one study on the breakfast habits of 1,600 young people in the UK, researchers found that the fibre and micronutrient intake, including of folate, vitamin C iron and calcium, was better in those who had breakfast regularly. There have been similar findings in Australia, Brazil, Canada and the US. Breakfast is also associated with improved brain function, including concentration and language. A review of 54 studies found that eating breakfast can improve memory, though the effects on other brain functions were inconclusive. However, one of the review’s researchers, Mary Beth Spitznagel, says there is “reasonable” evidence breakfast does improve concentration – there just needs to be more research. “Looking at studies that tested concentration, the number of studies showing a benefit was exactly the same as the number that found no benefit,” she says. “And no studies found that eating breakfast was bad for concentration.” What’s most important, some argue, is what we eat for breakfast. High-protein breakfasts have been found particularly effective in reducing food cravings and consumption later in the day, according to research by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. While cereal remains a firm favourite among breakfast consumers in the UK and US, a recent Which? investigation into the sugar content of ‘adult’ breakfast cereals found that some cereals contain more than three quarters of the recommended daily amount of free sugars in each portion, and sugar was the second or third highest ingredient in seven out of 10 flaked cereals. But some research suggests if we’re going to eat sugary foods, it’s best to do it early. One study found that changing levels of the appetite hormone leptin in the body throughout the day coincide with having our lowest threshold for sweet food in a morning, while scientists from Tel Aviv University have found that hunger is best regulated in the morning. They recruited 200 obese adults to take part in a 16-week-long diet, where half added dessert to their breakfast, and half didn’t. Those who added dessert lost an average of 40lbs (18kg) more – however, the study was unable to show the long-term effects. A review of 54 studies found that there is no consensus yet on what type of breakfast is healthier, and conclude that the type of breakfast doesn’t matter as much as simply eating something. Final take While there’s no conclusive evidence on exactly what we should be eating and when, the consensus is that we should listen to our own bodies and eat when we’re hungry.   “Breakfast is most important for people who are hungry when they wake up,” Johnstone says. For instance, research shows that those with pre-diabetes and diabetes may find they have better concentration after a lower-GI breakfast such as porridge, which is broken down more slowly and causes a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels. Every body starts the day differently – and those individual differences, particularly in glucose function, need to be researched more closely, Spitznagel says. In the end, the key may be to be mindful of not over-emphasising any single meal, but rather looking at how we eat all day long. “A balanced breakfast is really helpful, but getting regular meals throughout the day is more important to leave blood sugar stable through day, that helps control weight and hunger levels,” says Elder. “Breakfast isn’t the only meal we should be getting right.” Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,Is meat really that bad for you?,2024-09-15,2019-10-03,William Park,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191002-is-meat-really-bad-for-you,"Nitrates, saturated fats and salt – red meat is filled with things we are told to avoid. But what are the actual risks if we choose to eat it? A recent news story has whetted the appetite of meat-eaters around the world. Red meat might not be as bad for us as we are led to believe. The controversial report, which re-analysed data used in previous studies, led the authors to caution against most internationally-accepted health guidelines that urge people to cut down the amount of red meat they consume. The authors’ verdict is that there is uncertain evidence that reducing red meat intake affects the likelihood of cancer over your lifetime and often the evidence for health risks is very weak. The paper collected data from 70 studies that analysed the health records of six million people. This stacks up with how BBC Future has reported the health risks of foods, too. You might also like: In recent years, several reports have questioned the harms of meat and processed foods. In 2018, scientists and politicians campaigned against using nitrates and nitrites as preservatives in processed meats because of evidence linking the compounds to cancer. When Angela Dowden investigated for BBC Future, she found nitrates and nitrites occur in a much greater quantity in other areas of our diets. In fact, 80% of nitrates and nitrites in most European’s diets come from vegetables – and in some cases, nitrates have been associated with positive health outcomes, like lowering blood pressure. But that is not the whole story. Nitrites can turn into nitrosamines, which have been linked to bowel cancer. This happens when nitrites react with amines, a chemical found in protein-rich foods – which is why the nitrates and nitrites in meat, for example, can be more dangerous for you than from vegetables. Nitrosamines also form from the chemical reactions that occur during high-heat cooking – again, a process you are more likely to encounter with, say, sausages than with celery. As a result, cancer risk can have less to do with the composition of our food than with how we prepare it. This is where red meat falls foul. Grilling and frying are particularly high risk. The good news? Choosing a cooking method that reduces the cancer risk, such as slow-cooking, is a preventative measure we can all do. Likewise, how we replace the harmful components of our foods is important. Saturated fats in meat are associated with several illnesses, including heart disease. But replacing saturated fats with sugars and refined starches actually increases heart attack risk. Replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats has been shown to reduce the risk of death by any cause by 19%, however. So, switching from animal-based oils and fats to sunflower oil can help. Clearly, then, our foods contribute towards our health risks. But the way these risks are presented can be misleading. A 19% decrease in risk of death by any cause sounds compelling, but this decrease might be the same as saying a decrease from five in 100 to four in 100 people. What happens when we reframe those risks? As David Robson has written BBC Future, bacon has been linked to colorectal cancer – but instances of this type of cancer are very rare. Roughly 56 in every 1,000 people are at risk of colorectal cancer in their lifetimes. If those 1,000 people were to eat bacon every day of their lives, the number rises to 66. Bingeing on bacon raises your risk by a small amount. Contrast this with the risk of cancer from smoking: for every 100 people who give up the habit, 10-15 will avoid lung cancer. However, if you are tempted to follow up reading this article with an extra helping of red meat, you might want to pause for thought. We consume far more protein that we really need – and supplementing your diet with extra protein is pointless. Most people already get more than their daily recommended protein allowance from their food. Even the fitness-conscious should not spend money on protein supplements – unnecessary protein is excreted out of the body. Taking supplements is like flushing money down the loo.

risk appetite,Why palm oil is a climate problem,2024-09-15,2021-10-29,Nithin Coca,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211025-palm-oil-the-everyday-ingredient-that-harms-the-climate,"If we ended the use of fossil fuels tomorrow, we would still face huge challenges in stopping climate change – in no small part because of one very common household ingredient: palm oil. In September 2015, just a few months before the world signed up to the Paris Agreement on climate change, a number of huge forest fires erupted across Indonesian Sumatra and Borneo, darkening the skies across Southeast Asia and threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people. More than 2.6 million hectares (10,000 sq miles) had burned by the time the fires subsided in October. The fires were responsible for the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as produced by the whole of Germany that year. The loss of tropical forests – the home of endangered species such as orangutans – was a hard blow for biodiversity. But it was the peat below the forests' surface that had the greatest impact on the climate. Peat is a dense, soil-like material made up of partially decomposed organic matter which accumulates in swamp-like peatlands. Particularly in tropical regions, it can grow into a massive carbon store many metres deep. Worldwide, peatlands store more than 550 gigatonnes (billions of tonnes) of carbon globally. That's equal to 42% of the carbon stored in soil on the planet, despite peatlands covering less than 5% of the Earth’s surface area. Indonesia is home to some of the largest and most carbon-dense peatlands in the world. Much of Indonesia's vast tropical forest – the third largest in the world – grows on peatlands. These soils are naturally wet, which keeps the peat from decomposing, but when forests are converted into palm oil plantations the peat dries out, leading them to rapidly degrade and release their carbon into the atmosphere. Globally, almost all oil palm is grown on lands that were once tropical moist forests. The scale of Indonesian forest fires is a reminder to the world that addressing climate change means more than just shifting away from fossil fuels or adopting clean energy. Land also matters. Emissions from land-use, including agriculture, deforestation and peatland degradation, account for about a quarter of all global emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Indonesia is ground zero for land-use change emissions. They typically make up around half of the country's total emissions, depending on the scale of fires in a certain year. The fires in 2015 made Indonesia the fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter globally, after China, the US and India. Unlike temperate forests, fires are very rare in the tropics under natural conditions, because ample rainfall keeps the water table high. The problem is that oil palm, a non-native plant originally from West Africa, prefers dry land. As plantations expanded across Riau, North Sumatra and Central Kalimantan from the 1990s, canals were built to drain the land, putting peatlands at risk. ""Palm oil, much more than other crops, tends to expand onto tropical forests and peatlands with high carbon stock,"" says Stephanie Searle, fuels program director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. ""Those impacts are really, really huge for the global climate."" Since 1990, palm oil has grown from a niche commodity to become one of Indonesia's main exports. The industry now encompasses 6.8 million hectares (26,300 square miles) of land, an area approaching the size of the Republic of Ireland. It produces 43 million metric tonnes of oil, 58% of the world's total, which is both consumed domestically and exported to regions including Europe, the United States, India and China. ""Palm oil has been a major driver of deforestation,"" says Annisa Rahmawati, a Jakarta-based forests campaigner at Mighty Earth, an environmental non-profit. ""Insufficient law enforcement and disclosure created a situation that diminished our environment and harmed our people."" In 2021, six years after the historic fires, it seemed like progress was finally being made. While fires still burn yearly, including significant fires in 2018 and 2019, they were far less widespread than those in 2015. Furthermore, deforestation in 2020 had fallen 70% from its 2016 peak, according to Global Forest Watch data. The government's Peatland Restoration Agency and non-profits like Wetlands International and the Borneo Nature Foundation have re-wetted and restored hundreds of thousands of hectares of peatlands. In 2018, Indonesia implemented a ban on new oil palm plantations. Meanwhile, entities like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), set up in 2004 after a wave of negative attention on the links of palm oil with deforestation, claim to have pushed supply chains to become more responsible. Major palm oil buyers such as L'Oreal, PepsiCo and Unilever have made zero-deforestation commitments. But these fixes are not yet permanent. There has not yet been enough progress in transparency and responsibility in the palm oil industry to cut its links with deforestation, Rahmawati says. The RSPO has been criticised for enabling industry greenwashing, with a 2015 report from the Environmental Investigation Agency alleging fraud and a lack of credibility in its assurance processes in the organisation's supply chain certification scheme, and a 2019 follow-up finding many of these issues still remained. The RSPO responded that it is ""committed to continuous improvement"", and that the reports were inaccurate and did not take into account improvements to its assurance processes. Indonesia's ban on new palm oil concessions expired in September 2021, and has not been replaced. The passage of a major new law in Oct 2020, meant to create jobs and spur economic recovery from Covid-19, paired with near-record high prices for palm oil globally, have led many to fear that a return to fires, peatland and widespread deforestation could again be on the horizon. The fires in 2015 were, in many ways, a worst-case scenario. That year saw an extremely strong El Niño effect, which brought dry conditions to much of Indonesia. Once the fires reached the peat underground, they became extremely difficult to put out, and burned for weeks until rains finally came. The massive scale of these fires acted as a wake-up call to Indonesia. Ahead of United Nations global climate conference in 2015 (COP21), Indonesia announced in its UN climate pledge to reduce emissions from forestry by 66% to 90% by 2030, depending on international assistance. To support this, in January 2016 President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo created the Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) and tasked it with meeting new goals to restore 1.7 million hectares (6,600 sq miles) of peatlands within concession areas (including palm oil plantations), and 900,000 hectares (3,500 sq miles) of peatlands outside of these areas by 2020. The country's 2018 palm oil concession ban took this a step further, and in 2019 its moratorium on deforestation became permanent. The BRG and other entities tasked with supporting peatland restoration faced a huge challenge. Peatlands are incredibly fragile, so they needed to work fast to restore those that were already being lost in order to limit CO2 emissions. ""If we are too late in restoring our peatlands, it will not be possible,"" says Nyoman Suryadiputra, a senior advisor at Wetlands International Indonesia. ""Once the organic matter disappears, the ecosystem will change and it's no longer possible to rehabilitate it."" If anyone knows about this, it's Wetlands International Indonesia. The organisation has been working on peatland restoration across the archipelago since the late 1990s in the same provinces where the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations has transformed landscapes. Its latest project, begun in 2019, is working with 350 households in the province of North Sumatra to restore degraded smallholder palm oil plots around their villages. In order to ensure that restoration is both effective and sustainable in the long-term, they take a community-centered approach. ""We have to look after the community's livelihood,"" says Nyoman. ""We cannot force them to restore their peatlands if they are hungry."" That means providing alternative income streams to palm oil, such as other kinds of forest products or aquaculture. It also means ensuring locals are well-informed about the restoration effort and directly involved in monitoring it. Many communities in Indonesia use peatlands for farming not only palm oil but other crops such as rice, maize and root vegetables, which they depend on for income, says Herry Purnomo, a researcher in peatland restoration at the Center for International Forestry Research in Bogor, Indonesia. ""The development of community-based business models hand-in-hand with peatland restoration is a must,"" he says. The BRG nearly met one of its goals, restoring 835,288 hectares (3,200 sq miles) of peatlands on state or community-controlled lands. But it failed, by far, to meet its other goal for peatland restoration within concession areas, restoring only 390,000 (1,500 sq miles) out of a planned 1.7 million hectares (6,600 sq miles) as of early 2020. The reason for this was BRG lacked the legal authority to force concession holders to restore peatlands, says Purnomo. ""Peatland restoration outside concession areas is mainly the responsibility of the government, while inside the concession it is the concession holder's responsibility,"" he says. Earlier this year, the organisation saw its mandate both extended and expanded. Now called the Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency (BRGM), it is tasked with restoring 600,000 (2,300 sq miles) hectares of degraded mangroves as well as a further 1.2 million hectares (4,500 sq miles) of peatlands by the end of 2024. ""I hope they can meet the updated goals,"" said Fadhli Zakiy, who leads the Peatland Restoration Information Monitoring System at WRI Indonesia. ""We believe that they can, as long as the government supports them with an adequate budget and with regulations."" It is proper regulations, however, that have in the past several months become a key concern. The 2020 legislation on job creation raised alarm due to its streamlining of environmental regulations and changes which make land acquisition by corporations easier. Alongside the expiration of the moratorium on new palm oil concessions, it led to concern that the industry would expand onto forest and peatland. The government did not respond to a request for comment. Juliana Nnoko-Mewanu, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch who has researched expansions of palm oil plantations in West Kalimantan, has expressed concerns that the job creation law could make things worse by ""curtailing communities' and environmental experts' involvement in environmental impact assessments [and] accelerating licensing processes for [oil palm] businesses"". Combined, the new bill and the end of the palm oil moratorium ""may end up increasing deforestation"", says Arkian Suryadarma, senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. He says that Indonesia's peatland and deforestation policies are ""not ambitious enough"" to meet the 2030 goal. Continuing peatland restoration will also require addressing the elephant in the room: peatlands which sit in existing palm oil plantations. Efforts to do land-swaps – from peat or high-carbon land to degraded land – haven't yet proven to have much impact, and canal-blocking and re-wetting on concession land has lagged behind activities on state-controlled land. This impacts everyone, says Nyoman, because the peatlands are both interconnected and porous. ""If a community is doing a rehabilitation project, but the private sector around it doesn't, then it will affect the peatland in the community land,"" he says. While the government attributes the fall in deforestation between 2016 and 2020 to its own efforts, others believe it was due to unfavourable market forces. The last five to six years have seen a weak price for crude palm oil so there was not so much appetite for industry expansion, says Andika Putraditama, forests and commodities senior manager at WRI Indonesia. This year, though, the price of palm oil has hit a five-year record high due to shortages in the global vegetable oil market. ""We need to be cautious to see if there is a spike in deforestation,"" says Putraditama. The end result is a push-and-pull between all these forces. ""A lot needs to happen for Indonesia to meet its 2030 [forestry and land-use] target,"" says Brurce Muhammad Mecca, an analyst at Climate Policy Initiative's Indonesia office. ""Indonesia needs to provide a mix of policies that incentivise forest conservation and outweigh the economic incentives for deforestation."" Wherever the balance falls will have broad repercussions for the global climate. It will take a momentous effort – from civil society, the government and the global community – to protect Indonesia's critically important tropical forests and peatlands. -- Data research and visualisation by Kajsa Rosenblad Animation by Adam Proctor -- Towards Net Zero Since signing the Paris Agreement, how are countries performing on their climate pledges?

risk appetite,The bizarre show that took over TV,2024-09-15,2022-11-11,Timmy Fisher,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20221110-teletubbies-the-bizarre-kids-tv-show-that-swept-the-world,"Teletubbies turns 25 this year, and now has a new Netflix reboot on the way. What made this colourful and strange world so appealing to children – and so controversial, asks Timmy Fisher. In March 1998 more than 1,500 television bigwigs from 82 different countries descended on the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London. They had come for the second ever World Summit on Television for Children. Various topics were up for discussion – funding, regulation, new media – but one word was on everybody's lips: Teletubbies. The preschool show, created by Ragdoll Productions for the BBC, had begun airing in the UK a year earlier, documenting the antics of four giant, alien-looking babies with antennae atop their heads and televisions in their tummies. It was a runaway hit with both adults and children. Talk of wibbly-wobbly bottoms and Tubby Toast had swept the nation. But Tinky Winky, Laa-Laa, Dipsy and Po, with their proto chatter and penchant for repetition, had experts worried.  More like this: -       The animation too dark for Hollywood -       The most comforting children's books ever -       The serious artist behind The Moomins ""Teletubbies: are they wising up or dumbing down?"" posed the moderator at the summit's first session. A robust exchange ensued. ""Regressive"" and ""vaguely evil"" were just some of the verbal shots fired. Ada Haug, head of pre-school programmes at Norway's NRK, accused Teletubbies of being ""the most market-oriented children's programme concept I've ever seen"". Mounting a passionate defence, Alice Cahn, a director at the US PBS network (which had just acquired Teletubbies), dismissed the criticisms as ""ludicrous"". She then shocked the audience with an insult lifted from a well-known Saturday Night Live sketch, though it's unclear whether Haug got the joke. The exchange was promptly quoted in newspapers from Paris to New York to Hong Kong: the debate had gone global. Though it emerged from a tradition of gently surreal British children's programmes, beginning with Watch with Mother in 1952, Teletubbies wasn't as didactic as its immediate BBC Two predecessors, Play School or Playdays. It was aimed at a younger demographic and, like all Ragdoll shows from Rosy and Jim to Tots TV, took a heavily child-centred approach – one informed by years of careful observation and response gathering. ""A lot of work for children is approached from an adult's perspective,"" Ragdoll founder Anne Wood tells BBC Culture. ""Play School, by its title, suggests that the producers were 'teaching'. We were trying to reflect life as a young child might engage with it. Previous Ragdoll shows didn't get as close to what we managed with Teletubbies because it was a constant learning process."" This ethos governed every aspect of Teletubbies, from the basic plots and rudimentary speech (""eh-oh!"") to the rituals and slapstick humour – even the giggling Sun Baby. It was all incredibly appealing to toddlers – and baffling to parents. But to suggest the show wasn't ""educational"", as many did, is not quite right. ""Early years environments don't have so much of a class-based, clear learning structure,"" Tim Smith, a developmental psychologist at London's Birkbeck Babylab, tells BBC Culture. ""It's more about exposure to themes and ideas – to numbers, naming and language – to ways of seeing the world. And that's what happened in Teletubbies: it isn't educational in a strict way but there are educational components to its entertainment."" This synthesis was best demonstrated in the Teletubbies' embrace of technology. Tinky Winky et al were ""technological babies on the cusp of technological change"", says Wood. They lived in a Tubbytronic Superdome with a sentient vacuum cleaner called Noo-Noo. And they had TV screens planted on their tummies, through which they viewed children out in the real world. This resonated with millennial toddlers. And this, as Smith notes, was ""a clever way of embedding real-life stories within a fantastical, cartoony realm… of having educational content wrapped up into entertainment"". The repetition (""again, again!"") gave children a second chance ""to really consolidate their learning, to understand what's been presented so that they can reflect on it in the real world"". These arguments were made repeatedly by Wood and the show's writer Andrew Davenport, a trained speech therapist. But many remained unconvinced. ""An emphasis on learning through play seems all well and good, but I found the programme confusing,"" wrote one Telegraph columnist. ""Let us, for heaven's sake, stop treating the pre-kinder set as brain-dead,"" pleaded another in The Australian. Their concern seemed to reflect a broader culture war raging between traditionalists, for whom a distinction between education and entertainment was an imperative, and progressives, for whom that distinction was false. This was felt keenly in the UK, where the New Labour government fronted by Tony Blair had recently been elected on the slogan ""Education, education, education"" and reforming initiatives included schemes designed to address a perceived decline in literacy, such as Education Secretary David Blunkett's National Reading Campaign. That Teletubbies caused less of a stir in northern Europe – Ada Haug excluded – may be a symptom of those countries' greater emphasis on play-based learning. After all, Denmark's Bamses Billedbog (""Teddy's Picture Book""), going since 1983, contained many Tubby ingredients: giant costumes, songs and nonsensical language. Celebrity and controversy The debate was fiercest in the US, where Sesame Street had been the gold standard for preschool TV since its launch in 1969, employing education experts from the outset. Sesame Street was very clearly didactic: each episode was – and still is – planned with specific learning objectives in mind. And its success in this regard, particularly among children from disadvantaged backgrounds, has been well documented. So, when Teletubbies frolicked on to US screens in April 1998, filling a slot in PBS's Ready to Learn service, it provoked outcry among Sesame die-hards who saw little instruction. ""There is no documented evidence that Teletubbies has any educational value at all,"" decried Harvard psychologist Susan Linn. Moreover, the US was home to a large cohort of what media and education scholar David Buckingham calls the ""anti-television division"", for whom any programme – Sesame Street included – was corrosive. Teletubbies' narrow target audience would prove a major concern: ""Gearing a show for very young children goes against everything I believe in"", said Dorothy Singer of Yale's Family TV Research and Consultation Center. Even today, the American Association of Paediatrics recommends no screen time at all for children until 18 months, except for video chatting. However, the controversy peaked not in academic but Christian circles. In a promotional publication for his evangelical Liberty University, televangelist Jerry Falwell issued a ""Parent Alert"" censuring Tinky Winky and his fabulous red handbag: ""He is purple, the gay pride colour, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle: the gay pride symbol."" After his remarks were picked up by the press Falwell doubled down, claiming such ""role modelling"" was ""damaging to the moral lives of children"". Liberal factions jumped to Tinky Winky's defence. Berkeley City Council, a hotbed for progressive politics, drew up a resolution in support: ""Long live Tinky Winky and long live freedom from self-righteousness!"". Still, the show was boycotted by many conservative parents in the US. For context, it would be four years until the country's Supreme Court ruled anti-sodomy laws unconstitutional, and 16 years until it struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage. ""We laughed when we first heard [about Falwell],"" Wood later told Reuters. ""But in the United States certain communities took it seriously, to our horror, and it damaged the brand considerably."" The same drama then played out in Poland eight years later when Ewa Sowińska, then Children's Commissioner, ordered psychologists to investigate whether the show promoted a homosexual lifestyle. Teletubbies was ultimately exonerated by the industry, picking up two Bafta Children's Awards and two Daytime Emmy nominations. Accolades also came from bodies in Japan, Ghana and Germany. Its success prompted an avalanche of shows designed for very young children. And of these, there are few today that don't contain a little Teletubbies DNA, whether that's in their embrace of technology (Go Jetters, Octonauts and Tinpo are all gadget-heavy) or strongly child-centred approach. From In the Night Garden to Moon and Me, bright, fun and queasily off-kilter has become the status quo. With hindsight, the furore was just another example of the moral panic that frequently besets children's popular culture. Talking movies, comics and video games: each was considered harmful when first introduced. What made the Teletubbies phenomenon unusual, however, was its rapid proliferation into adult culture. In July 1997, UK magazine The Face ran a five-page story on ""Teleclubbers"", a new raver subset apparently turning to Teletubbies for their ""post-club comedown"". Dedicated fan pages began appearing online. At London's Imperial College the campus activities calendar included airtimes and episode highlights. When the show first came to Hong Kong in June 1998, producers, hoping to capitalise on its burgeoning cult status, scheduled Teletubbies for 21:30 on a Friday. Not since 1960s hit The Magic Roundabout had children's characters commanded such celebrity. Commentators pointed to their corresponding psychedelic qualities: The Magic Roundabout featured a motley crew of brightly coloured, talking creatures – Dougal the dog, Zebedee the jack-in-the-box, Dylan the rabbit – residing in a Magic Garden. (When the show was moved to the earlier time of 16:55, meaning fewer working adults would be able to watch, the BBC was inundated with complaints.) For David Buckingham, Teletubbies' adult fanbase was also symptomatic of a more general sense of irony suffusing pop culture at the time, which perhaps explains Mr Blobby's perennial presence on UK television or Aphex Twin's teddy bears. All this adult attention was doing wonders for ratings. With two million UK viewers Teletubbies was the most-watched programme in its Saturday morning slot, overtaking Channel 4's The Big Breakfast. Which made it a target for the tabloids. Euan Stretch was deputy news editor for the Mirror at the time. He recalls how the 1990s was a decade in which British newspapers embraced and even helped create the celebrity culture that kept Teletubbies in the spotlight. ""They were employing showbiz editors and reporters en masse for the first time,"" he tells BBC Culture. ""People wanted to read about celebrities, and newspapers reacted to provide the stories… Circulations were high, profits were high and competition was fierce."" Teletubby Land certainly felt the heat. In her memoir Over the Hills and Far Away Nikky Smedley, aka Laa Laa, describes how the cast were banned from driving their own cars home, should they be followed. Paparazzi would dangle from helicopters in the hope of capturing a headless Tubby. It didn't help that they’d all been made to sign NDAs, making any morsal of information that bit more delicious. ""Do you know a Teletubby? Call this number and we'll pay you for your story,"" asked a daily footer in The Sun. The storm reached a climax when David Thompson, aka Tinky Winky, was sacked, via letter, just before the first season's wrap party. Concerns over his skill in the suit had reached boiling point; Ragdoll had already been over-dubbing his voice. Unimpressed, Thompson sold a spurious story to the News of the World via the celebrity publicist Max Clifford. Headlined ""Kinky Winky"", it detailed salacious on-set antics with a girlfriend. Both featured scantily clad on a double-page spread. Poor Noo-Noo had been pasted in too. Hell hath no fury like a Teletubby scorned. For Wood, the adult world's corruption of The Tubbies' brand was cause for great sadness, amounting to a lack of respect for the target audience. But in many ways the BBC helped promote, and profited from, this attention. ""The potential on this one is limitless,"" the Head of Investment at BBC Worldwide told the Independent in 1997. There were fast-food tie-ups and a chart-topping, double platinum-selling single. (In one of the stranger episodes in pop history, hit single Teletubbies Say ""Eh-Oh"" was shortlisted for an Ivor Novello Award.) Barry Eldridge, then communications manager at The Entertainer, recalls the frantic build-up to Christmas 1997 as UK shoppers queued overnight to get their plush dolls. The ""must have toy"" had been a Christmas ritual since the late 1980s and, because orders had to be placed months in advance by hedging retailers, demand often outstripped supply. This led to ""scalping"" (reselling at a markup) and cheap counterfeits (Walmart's Bubbly Chubbies met a sticky end following a Ragdoll lawsuit). ""Toy rage"" was also rife. The Entertainer staff had to be given training to deal with bellicose customers. ""Boy, I can remember some close run-ins that nearly turned pretty ugly,"" sighs Eldridge. The saga was repeated around the world. One newspaper reported children ""tipped from strollers"" in Hamilton, New Zealand, as shoppers stormed a store. According to the BBC's annual reports £330 million was generated during Teletubbies' first two years, much of this coming from sales to overseas broadcasters. Indeed, Ada Huag's ""market-orientated"" charge wasn't far off the mark: Teletubbies could be overdubbed, and its live-action sequences replaced with more culturally appropriate content. The slightest change had to be signed off by Wood, mind. And copycat programmes, such as Mexico's rather brazen Tele Chobis, were quickly stamped out by Ragdoll's legal team. To date Teletubbies has aired in over 120 countries and been translated into 45 languages. It has reached well over a billion children, many in China, where in 2002 the show became the first foreign production aired on prime-time TV. Even Iran's national broadcaster bought 65 episodes, dubbing them into Farsi. ""It's taking a long time to translate, as you can imagine,"" a spokesperson told The Sun. The next Teletubbies? Twenty-five years later the Teletubbies brand continues to evolve and adapt. After five seasons, a spinoff series and a movie, the IP was bought by Canada-based DHX Media (now WildBrain). The company rebooted the show in 2015, swapping out tummy TVs for touch screens. Two animated spinoffs have since followed on YouTube, a key launch pad for children's series. And this month a second reboot is set for release on Netflix, featuring Broadway star Tituss Burgess as narrator. It's one of a roster of new preschool shows acquired by the streaming platform, whose dedicated kids' zone is becoming increasingly important in the battle for subscribers. Trusted brands form part of this strategy. ""Netflix, unlike Paramount+ and Disney+, for example, doesn’t have the Nickelodeon library to fall back on, so it has to commission its own children's content. Teletubbies provides instant brand recognition,"" Richard Middleton, editor of Television Business International, tells BBC Culture. The move reflects a wider industry trend: Big Brother, Gladiators and Frasier are just some of the other shows from the 1990s returning. ""The proliferation of streamers and the associated programming boom means audiences are swamped by a multitude of options,"" Middleton explains. ""One way to cut through the clutter is to reboot."" Still, rebooting isn't new. Jeanette Steemers, professor of culture, media and creative industries at King's College London, points to various classic children's shows revisited over the years, such as Thomas & Friends and Bob the Builder. Some represent an opportunity to reimagine characters that don't stand up to modern day views on representation, race or disability, such as Disney's Dumbo, the original of which employed blatant African-American stereotypes. (Similarly, WildBrain asserts the multi-racial casting of Sun Babies in the new Teletubbies is an effort to ""reflect the diversity of the audience"".) More often, however, reboots demonstrate a low appetite for risk in an increasingly cash-strapped sector: ""It's really difficult to come up with a hit,"" Steemers tells BBC Culture. ""Nobody knows what that magic sauce is, so people instead try and replicate it. The problem is that the reboot is often not as good as the original."" Angelina Ballerina is a case in point. The original series, with 2D animations based on Katharine Holabird's beautifully illustrated books, was later revived using CGI with arguably diminishing returns. This resonates with Wood, for whom the Netflix Teletubbies represents a major devaluation of the brand. She disparages the use of digital production techniques, though her main concern is that the careful observation undertaken before shooting the original – perfecting that child-centred lens – hasn't been replicated. When this was put to WildBrain the company chose not to comment. In detailing how Teletubbies had been updated, however, it stressed that the ""spirit and concept of Teletubbies remains unchanged from the original series,"" and ""the stories and themes still centre around wonder, discovery, joy and silliness"". It remains to be seen whether the reboot resonates in the same way. Netflix wields huge power but it doesn't operate in China, where much of the Teletubbies fanbase resides. Nor will the new series be available in the UK, where the BBC holds exclusive rights. And though the Tubbies have learned to play the social media game, tweeting celebrities and riling up politicians, the controversies and zeitgeisty debates that both plagued the show and lifted it to the top of the news agenda have long since moved on. But perhaps a more pertinent question is the one Wood asks: ""Where will the next Teletubbies come from?"" It would be difficult to bankroll such an outlandish project today. In the UK there are no longer any quotas on children's content for commercial channels and the Young Audiences Content Fund, a lonely olive branch, was discontinued in January. Wood also worries that a deference to nostalgia is restricting the creativity she and Davenport were afforded in the '90s. ""There are other people out there making good work, or at least they could, were they given the opportunity."" She cites a project currently sitting with Ragdoll. ""It is, I hope, in the zeitgeist of now, as much as you can feel it. Will it be seen in the whole mass of stuff being churned out? Who knows, but you have to keep trying.""   Love film and TV?

risk appetite,Does 'cli-fi' inspire us to act?,2024-09-15,2023-04-18,Tyler Harper,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230418-what-snowpiercer-and-climate-fiction-get-wrong,"Novels and films that tackle global warming can inadvertently lead to paralysis, writes Tyler Harper. In the opening scene of The Last of Us, HBO's immensely popular zombie prestige drama, a pair of epidemiologists sit cross-legged on the set of a talk show in 1968. As the playfully mild-mannered host queries his guests about viral threats to the human species, one of the scientists – a man named Newman – responds that fungi, not viruses or bacteria, pose the greatest risk to mankind. The crowd jeers, but Newman presses on undaunted, suggesting that – were Earth's global temperatures to one day rise – an incurable fungal plague could become a very real possibility. Minutes later, we flash forward to a future in which a pandemic has led to the collapse of human civilisation by 2023, the epidemiologist's fungal prophecy fulfilled. More like this:  - How science fiction reimagines the future  - The rise of apocalyptic novels  - Why does cinema ignore climate change? This opening is jarring, not least because it alerts viewers to the catastrophic dangers of planetary warming, only to implicitly critique them for not heeding that same message. Like the disregarded epidemiologist whose concern falls on deaf ears, HBO's drama is clear from the start that its zombie metaphor is meant as a thinly veiled warning about our own, all-too-real climate crisis. The implication of the talk-show scene and its apocalyptic aftermath are straightforward: the future will be a hellscape if you don't listen to the scientists. In this, The Last of Us is like most works that belong to the ever-expanding roster of cultural products given the moniker ""climate fiction"". Coined by the environmental activist Dan Bloom around 2008, ""cli-fi"" is the term used to describe a loose genre of novels, films, and other forms of media that depict climate change, generally through the lens of speculative or science fiction. Spanning bona fide literary classics like Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower to densely allegorical (and shamelessly pretentious) films like Darren Aronofsky's Mother!, works of cli-fi are commonly apocalyptic in both tone and content. And like The Last of Us, they caution their audience about the world to come.   Public discourse around this new genre has been largely unquestioning. Novels and films about climate change are frequently described by the media as ""prescient"" or ""prophetic"", and invariably as offering a ""dire warning"" about the future.  What's more, climate works are nearly always heralded as a kind of call to arms. We are led to believe that reading or watching climate fiction is going to inspire activism, that ""cli-fi"" can foment an appetite for real societal change either by ""scaring audiences straight"" or by communicating climate science more persuasively than actual climate scientists. These are assumptions that have been part of public discussion about ""climate fiction"" from the very beginning. The first major article about this emerging genre, a 2015 piece in The Atlantic, bore the lofty title: ""Climate Fiction: Can Books Save the Planet?"" This is a question that has been repeated endlessly in the years since. ""Can Climate Fiction Inspire a Response to Help Save the Planet?"" The Independent queries. The New Yorker wonders ""Can Science Fiction Wake Us Up to Our Climate Reality?"" while Smithsonian Magazine asks ""Can Climate Fiction Writers Reach People in Ways that Scientists Can't?"" The answer in every case is assumed to be ""yes."" The Guardian cuts to the chase by simply providing a list of climate ""Stories to Save the World."" Truly transformative? Yet, what is missing from the innumerable articles like these – articles that assert that climate fiction will inspire climate action – is any actual evidence that this is the case. Instead, claims about climate fiction's transformative impact are repeated by the media as settled dogma, as though there is a straight and obvious line to be drawn between reading a novel about the climate crisis and becoming a radical environmentalist. Don't get me wrong, I desperately wish this were true: I am a literary scholar who researches and writes about climate fiction. I have given interviews and published articles on the genre in both academic journals and major media outlets. I teach a course called ""Climate Fiction"". Yet, the more I have immersed myself in ""cli-fi"" over the past decade, the more I have come to feel uneasy about the genre and the media's claims about its salvific potential. In fact, I not only worry that ""cli-fi"" might not be an effective form of environmental expression – I have come to believe that the genre might be actively dangerous, stunting our cultural ability to imagine a future worth living in or fighting for. Part of the problem is that the genre – which is almost exclusively dystopian, operating in the model of ""cautionary tale"" – traffics in the kind of apocalyptic rhetoric that has long been shown to demotivate consumers of environmental media. Novels like Paolo Bacigalupi's The Water Knife or films like Bong Joon-Ho's Snowpiercer might be riveting climate thrillers, but their bleak storytelling doesn't exactly inspire the kind of can-do attitude that might help motivate their audience to get involved in the climate struggle. Indeed, since I began teaching climate fiction a few years ago, I have been struck by how many of my students – a number of whom are involved in the Youth Climate Movement – became demoralised after engaging with such works; convinced, at least momentarily, that climate activism is pointless. When I share my students' deflated reaction to ""cli-fi"" novels and films with Danielle Endres, an expert on environmental communication at the University of Utah, she is not surprised. ""Apocalyptic rhetoric sparks paralysis, even among the motivated,"" observed Endres. ""If we only see the future as a set-in-stone catastrophe, it justifies the idea that we don't have to take action."" Nichole Seymour, a cultural theorist whose book Bad Environmentalism critiques the doom-mongering in climate discourse, concurs that the ""scared straight"" model doesn't work. ""We've long held that people are just lacking information about climate change and that's why they're not acting. But now we're starting to see the opposite: that the more you know – if the knowing is mainly bad news – the more paralysed and hopeless you feel."" These viewpoints are echoed by Katherine Buse of the University of Chicago, a scholar who researches the relationship between climate literature, climate policy, and climate science. According to Buse, there is a mismatch between how climate novelists imagine the future and how climate scientists forecast it: she notes that climate modellers are at great pains to frame the future as a ""possibility space"" in which a variety of different futures could unfold, depending on what actions we take in the coming years. However, like Endres and Seymour, Buse observes that climate fiction can often reproduce the opposite feeling: that there is only one possible future, and it will be irredeemably catastrophic. Yet, cli-fi's apocalyptic tenor is not its only problem: the genre is also a victim of the unreasonable expectations of both members of the media and academics who insist that ""cli-fi"" is a form of climate activism. Smaran Dayal, a scholar of Afrofuturism and an expert on Octavia Butler, notes that this common assumption is both flawed and self-aggrandising. ""Literature is often assumed by literature professors to have an automatic activist function, which it absolutely does not,"" Dayal says with a laugh. ""It's a controversial thing for us as literature professors to say, but you are disconnected from the world if you think that people are reading novels as inspiration to go and organise on the streets. We like to assume a smooth transition from reading Octavia Butler to becoming a revolutionary, but that's just not how it works."" Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, a literary critic who authored the first empirical study that examined the impact of ""cli-fi"" on readers' environmental attitudes, agrees that we should be more realistic about what tangible impacts we can expect from the genre. His study of reader responses to climate fiction found that novels that depict catastrophe ""may actually be hindering [the] goal of heightening environmental consciousness"" by producing feelings of hopelessness just like those experienced by my students. He also discovered that cli-fi novels are mostly consumed by people who are already worried about and believe in climate change, so the genre has a ""preaching to the choir"" problem that also limits its ability to recruit new environmentalists. Yet, his research does suggest that climate stories that employ a positive frame – particularly those that focus on resilience or innovation – might be able to inspire readers to act. He concedes that examples of non-dystopian climate fiction are few and far between, but he highlights Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior or Clara Hume's Back to the Garden as promising examples. (To this I would also add stories like Rebecca Roanhorse's Trail of Lightning, Becky Chambers' A Psalm for the Wild-Built, Grist's ongoing ""Imagine 2200"" project, or just about any novel by Kim Stanley Robinson). Schneider-Mayerson believes that climate fiction shouldn't be the main focus of criticism. ""The real problem is that the vast majority of fiction published today does not acknowledge the reality of climate change. Climate fiction is such a smaller portion of everything that's being read today. It's valid and valuable to criticise it and ask what it could be doing differently, but the bulk of criticism should go to non-climate fiction that portrays the natural world as a stable and reliable backdrop to human affairs,"" he says. ""The reality is that those works are essentially all fantasy now.""  Every scholar I talk to holds out hope – some more, some less – that there are forms of environmental art that might succeed in shaping the public's imagination for the better. But they are equally clear that ""cli-fi"" is certainly not the panacea that was promised, and that as long as it continues to operate in a mode of unremitting doom, it will never live up to its potential. Perhaps the first step toward a better climate fiction, then, is to stop clinging to the sort of magical thinking which holds that a novel can save the world; to be clear-eyed about what tangible impact we can expect from a paperback. Here, I am reminded of Socrates, who suggests in Plato's Republic that there is no place for poets in a well-running city. Socrates' quibbles with poetry are manifold, but the core of his objection is that literature confers on its audience the false sense of having taken real action – it provides readers with the feeling of war without the risk of combat, the feeling of love without the hazards of romance. That is, the problem with a certain kind of literature is that it gives us the sense that we have really done something noble, when in fact we have done nothing loftier than sit on the couch and read a book.

risk appetite,Secret world of Obama’s victory,2024-09-15,2012-11-09,Bob Trevelyan,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20121109-secret-world-of-obamas-victory,"Our pick of the week’s science and technology stories include election-winning geeks, the difficulties in defining death and a journey through the human mind. Inside the secret world of data crunchers who helped Obama win  Michael Scherer | Time | 7 November 2012 It won't have escaped your attention that there was an election this week. But did you know what, and who, drove the Obama campaign? ""The role of the campaign pros in Washington who make decisions on hunches and experience is rapidly dwindling, being replaced by the work of quants and computer coders who can crack massive data sets for insight. In politics, the era of big data has arrived."" Why we can't solve big problems  Jason Pontin | MIT Technology Review | 24 October 2012 The motivation for the Apollo space programme was partly about proving the superiority of American rocketry over Soviet engineering, says Pontin, but ""the strongest emotion at the time of the moon landings was of wonder at the transcendent power of technology.” Somewhere along the way since then we seem to have lost that. The public has lost its appetite for high-risk, big-ticket projects. Governments have lost their nerve. And Silicon Valley has ""ceased to be the funder of the future, and instead become a funder of features, widgets, irrelevances.” It's time we got back that ambition and determination to solve big problems through technology. One man, one computer, 10 million students  Michael Noer | Forbes | 2 November 2012 Twenty-four months ago, Salman Khan had left his job and was working alone in a walk-in closet. He wanted to see if he could use internet-based technology to rethink the educational model that had prevailed for hundreds of years. Now it's no exaggeration to say that his Khan Academy, funded by some of the biggest names in tech, is upending assumptions about education. The potential is immense. Beginnings of bionic  Meghan Rosen | Science News | 2 November 2012 Computers used to fill whole rooms; then they sat on desks; now they're in the palm of your hand. Joining them to the body is ""the next logical step"", says Princeton researcher Michael McAlpine. ""People are going to be bionic."" And, when the medical applications are considered, it could be very useful indeed. Dead as a doornail?  Peter Rothman | H+ | 1 November 2012 Developments in technology could extend the lives of many of us (see above). But what happens when the end finally approaches? ""Death is the ultimate binary condition. Black or white. Alive or dead. Right? In reality, death is not well defined and the definition of death has changed substantially over time."" Today, it's a term with more legal than scientific meaning. And medical advances mean the definition of death will continue to change. Will a boundary have to be drawn somewhere? How to stop illegal downloads  Dan Ariely | Dan Ariely | 3 November 2012 Dan Ariely is a behavioural economist who studies dishonesty; he even wrote a book about it. Then he discovered that book had been downloaded many times illegally. He was a little flattered, a little amused at the irony of people illegally downloading a book about dishonesty, and most of all he was curious. It changed his mind about digital piracy, and got him thinking about what might stop it. I won't claim that you'll find his remedy convincing, but this short blogpost does make for enjoyable reading. The psychology of everything  Paul Bloom | Big Think | 24 October 2012 Now, as they say, for something completely different. This is a longish video: It's 48 minutes. But it's a biggish subject: The human mind. What compassion, racism and sex tell us about the human mind, as explained by Paul Bloom, professor of psychology at Yale.

risk appetite,Pay attention,2024-09-15,2014-11-18,Tom Chatfield,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130104-pay-attention,"We should learn that we do not have to respond instantly to emails, text messages and status updates, says Tom Chatfield. Have you ever received a “phantom” text message? If you’ve been convinced your phone is vibrating or ringing in your pocket when it turns out to be nothing, the answer is yes. And you’re not alone. According to the Pew internet research center, 67% of American adults in a national survey experienced the same thing. The same report also found that almost 37% of those surveyed said that they “couldn’t live without” their smartphones, depicting a world in 2013 where ubiquitous computing is increasingly taken for granted – and where our bodies are every bit as involved as our minds. In my case, phantom messages sometimes arrive when I don’t actually have my phone. I usually keep it in my left trouser pocket and, even when it isn’t there, I sometimes feel a silent-message-style buzzing in my thigh muscles, as if a message has been sent directly into my skin. It’s a disconcerting feeling, and suggests an unwelcome degree of physical conditioning, not least because of the invariable accompanying rush of blood at the thought of someone or something wanting my attention. Text messages may seem a trivial business, but one thinker who’s increasingly concerned by the dynamic of how we interact with machines is the author and computer scientist Jaron Lanier. In a December interview with the Smithsonian magazine, Lanier railed eloquently against the social consequences of a culture conditioned to respond instantly to services like texts and social media. “Look what we’re setting up here in the world today,” he says. “We have economic fear combined with everybody joined together on these instant twitchy social networks which are designed to create mass action. What does it sound like to you? It sounds to me like the prequel to potential social catastrophe.” ‘Advertising fodder’ Lanier’s view may sound extreme, but it chimes with other thinking. Take the words of behavioural economics Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, for example. In his 2011 book Thinking, Fast and Slow, he writes “the often-used phrase ‘pay attention’ is apt: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities.” High quality human attention is a scarce resource; and whenever it is in short supply, the universal human tendency is to fall back on what Kahneman calls “heuristics”: snap judgements based on assumptions and shortcuts, not to mention more visceral impulses and appetites.   Much of the time, these heuristics are vital to successful living, allowing us to function on a daily basis while conserving our higher faculties – the “slow” thinking of the book’s title. When it comes to challenges more complex than recognizing a friend or selecting a favourite food, however, our rapid-response systems for decision-making are alarmingly prone to error: riven with bias and prejudice, and ripe for manipulation. Even something as simple as the amount of time since we last ate can have a profound effect on our decision-making. In Lanier’s terms, this is precisely what many of the constantly-connected patterns of online living push us towards: a metaphorical dismembering, in which we become little more than clicks and eyeballs. We risk, his interviewer Ron Rosenbaum says, “outsourcing ourselves into insignificant advertising-fodder”, twitching from one stock response to another, and possibly into more vicious forms of stock action than mere trolling-by-tweet. When I sense a phantom message buzzing in my leg, I find it hard not to think of Lanier’s warning against how technology is eroding our better natures – or, at least, of the time and attention it takes to treat each other as more than a means to constant diversion and aggregation. I’m also, however, conscious of the ways in which these very systems might help us push back. Think ahead A New York Times article that discussed the Pew research findings,  for example, lists some of the solutions being tried by those on the sharp end. Technology company Atos reportedly plans to phase out all forms of email between employees by the end of 2013, preferring to rely on more efficient and less demanding methods of communication. Similarly, German car company Daimler now offers the option of deleting employees’ email during their vacations to avoid the electronic logjam usually waiting for hapless workers upon their return. These are small steps, but they tie in with another, central observation of Kahneman’s: that, faced by an attention-sapping situation and the escalating possibility of poor judgement, the best thing you can do is “recognize that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement.” Lanier’s is a critique above what he has elsewhere called the “antihuman” perversity of many technologies: of how exploitative and reductive habits can ensnare us, via tasty digital carrots and daunting sticks. Endless sharing and clicks on ""like"" are, after all, far easier than taking the time to work out what we actually feel - let alone express it - while personal identity can become little more than a perpetual present of status updates, drop-down-menu preferences and instant interactions.  Against this, in Kahneman’s formulation, we must ask what kind of “reinforcements” we can best build into the organisations and routines within which we work – and which systems we have already built that do more than augment our capacities for prejudice and error. It’s a tricky proposition. But it’s also one whose time has surely come. To borrow a final phrase from Kahneman, “cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain.” For me, at least, the reception of phantom smartphone messages in my upper thigh feels like my body trying to tell me something. 2013 is a year for making the very best of my high-quality attention, and asking what it means to help others do the same. It’s time to stop twitching. Do you agree with Tom? If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,Why we are all scientists now,2024-09-15,2012-03-29,Dan Drollette,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120329-citizen-science-enters-a-new-era,"From China to the Congo, a new wave of volunteer science projects aims to allow amateur participants to actively gather data for the benefit of their communities. Earthquake researchers have a problem. So do scientists trying to investigate the spread of deadly malaria. Whilst conservationists trying to get a handle on the state of illegal logging may have it worst of all. What connects all of these is that when it comes to cracking some of their field’s biggest issues, traditional science methods are not fully up to the task. The earthquake researchers would like to have monitoring systems that fully span high-risk areas, but having enough research-grade sensors that cover hundreds of miles of fault lines would cost them millions and millions of dollars. Swiss malaria researchers need to run enormous numbers of calculations to simulate the spread of malaria worldwide; valuable information for governments deciding where best to spend limited resources on life-saving interventions. But the computing power to run it is too expensive. Whilst in the deep, lush forests of the Congo Basin having enough well-trained people to monitor illegal tree felling and poaching is almost impossible. But science is changing. In the age of the internet it is waking up the idea of people power: the combined forces of thousands of ordinary connected volunteers can help collect or crunch overwhelming masses of data. “There’s so many people that can take part in this way, I think crowd-sourcing could almost be more important than the development of the Web,” says Ben Segal, who has worked on many volunteer computing projects at the at the European Particle Physics Laboratory, Cern – and who mentored, among others a young Tim Berners-Lee, who would go on to invent the World Wide Web. “Citizen science” is not a new concept. So-called “volunteer computing” projects have expanded rapidly since the launch of Seti@Home in 1999, a program that still uses the power of millions of ordinary computers in screen-saver mode to help search for signs of intelligent life in the universe. Tapping into aspects of computer processing power, such as recharging modes, and making use of previously wasted “cycles”, desktops or laptops from people scattered worldwide can band together to mimic the number-crunching power of a supercomputer. By the end of the last decade, several projects were using volunteer computing power for solving complex problems, ranging from cataloguing stars in the distant corners of the universe with Galaxy Zoo to predicting the complex three dimensional structures of protein structures with FoldIt. There is even a site (scistarter.com) devoted to the growing popularity of citizen science, where people can discover, take part in and fund research projects. But those at the forefront of the field say that citizen science is now beginning to enter a new era. What has changed is a growing sense that participants can actively take part in projects, rather than passively allowing their idle computer to do the grunt work. “Their feeling is that science is too important to be left to scientists alone,” says Francois Grey from the Citizen Cyberscience Centre, a collaboration set up in 2009 between CERN, the University of Geneva, and the United Nations, with seed money from the Shuttleworth Foundation. Tools for the trade Grey’s Citizen Cyberscience Centre is one of the main operations pushing citizen science into unexplored territories. One reason Grey says this is becoming increasingly possible is that the technology barrier is dropping, so more and more sophisticated hardware can be placed in citizen’s hands. One project the CCC supports – the “Quake Catcher Network”, or QCN as it is known  – epitomizes the trend towards ever-smaller, more nimble devices, based upon the latest chips. A customized external motion-detecting device with a USB plug turns peoples’ ordinary desktops into automated earthquake detectors. Connect computers via the internet to a centralized system, or server, and you now have a wide-ranging system that maps an earthquake’s aftermath. The network has been tested in the San Francisco Bay Area, and sensors were sent to New Zealand following the earthquake in September 2010 to learn more about the occurrence of “aftershocks” – which are almost as dangerous as the main event itself. In November last year, researchers at Taiwan’s Academia Sinica set up a server to monitor the quake-prone island that lies between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates. The sensors were developed by Elizabeth Cochran of the US Geological Survey and Jesse Lawrence of Stanford University an currently cost between $60 and $200 per sensor, a fraction of the cost of professional seismometers which can cost anything up to $100,000 apiece. The QCN devices only have a fraction of the sensitivity of research-grade seismometers, but what they lack in sensitivity, they more than make up for in sheer volume, says Lawrence. “With many more cheap sensors, instead of guessing where strong motions were felt by interpolating between research sensors, we should be able to know where strong motions were felt immediately, because we have (QCN) sensors there.” And soon there could be an army of mobile “quake-catchers”, according to QCN’s Carl Christensen. Smartphones are ideal for the task, as they already have built-in motion-detectors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and GPS signaling. By summer 2012 QCN expects to release an app that turns your Android smartphone into a pocket-sized earthquake sensor. Soon after, they hope to send 1,000 sensor-equipped phones to places where a fault-line has just slipped. Some of the hardware being adopted in other citizen science projects also hail from unexpected origins. A major advance in scientific computing came from the development of superfast 3D Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to run video games on Sony’s PlayStation 3 console. GPUs can do 10 times more than an ordinary chip. Consequently, Dave Anderson, founder of the open-source software platform BOINC, foresees volunteer computing at an “exascale” level – about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second – 100 times more powerful than today’s top supercomputers. Gaming for gain The scientific benefits of volunteer computing can be enormous, and consequently there are a host of efforts looking to capitalise on people’s unused processing power. For example, malariacontrol.net simulates the spread of the disease on computer – helping governments decide how to invest most effectively on, for instance, bednets versus vaccines. In 2005, the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute’s 40-strong office computers struggled to run the enormous numbers of epidemiological simulations needed to get “real-world” results. After turning to volunteer computing, they now have the computing power of up to 15,000 desktops working simultaneously. Nicolas Maire, a researcher for the organization, estimates that this figure is the equivalent of a single desktop computer operating between 800 and 1,000 years. “Realistically, it would have been unfeasible to do in any other way,” he admits. But it is not all serious work. Some of the most successful volunteer computing approaches have their roots in the world of gaming. Designers and software engineers are taking algorithms and game design principles and using them to solve longstanding scientific puzzles that require complex computer calculations. The programs they are creating encourage volunteers to donate spare processing power by turning it into an online game where people compete and collaborate with each other. In FoldIt, for instance, players bend, pull and fold digital versions of protein molecules on their computer screens. Building the protein components needed for life involves a complex set of machinery in our cells translating information encoded in our genes into a sequence of amino acids, which are then wrapped and folded by into a three-dimensional form designed to carry out its required function. The amino-acid sequence dictates the shape the protein will eventually adopt, but even small proteins can potentially fold in a huge number of different ways, and so it is always a challenge for computers to figure out which of the many possible structures is the best one. With around 240,000 registered players FoldIt is proving invaluable for researchers trying to solve the complex structural and folding patterns of proteins. Players can bend and pull proteins into their optimum shape, as long as they obey the rules of physics. The closer your attempts at protein origami adhere to those rules, the more points you get. In recent months the game-playing volunteers have shown they can both actively predict protein structures and design new proteins. Last September, scientists reported the structure of a key enzyme that allows HIV to replicate, making it an obvious target for drugs. The precise protein structure had stumped them for almost 15 years, but the FoldIt community produced it within days. In January this year, gamers produced the first crowdsourced protein redesign – revving up the performance of an enzyme for one of the most important reactions organic chemists use to build compounds ranging from drugs to pesticides. Another online program, Phylo, is advancing scientists’ knowledge of genetics by making a game out of DNA matching. If areas of genetic sequence are roughly similar between species, it suggests strongly that they could have an important function. Finding them has been beyond the scope of computer algorithms. But earlier this month, researchers published a study where gamers outsmarted the best computers – they made the best possible DNA sequence match between up to eight species at a time. Active citizens Despite these notable successes, CCC’s Grey is quick to point out that volunteer computing does not provide a universal solution. “There are certain problems you can crack with a supercomputer that would be hopeless with volunteer computing,” he says. Supercomputers are best suited for problems where thousands of processors must communicate with each other and swap data frequently during a calculation, according to Grey. Volunteer computing works best on easily shared problems that are divisible into digestible pieces that can be worked on in any order at any time. That said, the successes highlight how much volunteers want more of an active role in citizen science. Volunteers do not just want to contribute data passively to a study, they want to learn and develop as a result of taking part. Some projects have volunteer-run support, forums and message boards. Scientists, volunteers, and the open-source community gather at hackfests to find volunteer programming and computing solutions to science problems. Cern’s Segal says he has been struck by volunteer’s appetite for learning on projects like LHC@Home, and that volunteer computing seems to attract a lot of retired scientists and teachers, as well as people with a degree in science who wound up doing some other job. “We’ve had a number of cases of people who put in hours of unpaid labour to help newbies,” he says. “The advantage is that it can be self-policing, much like the original Wikipedia.” Getting extreme But the deepest forests of the Congo Basin may provide a glimpse of where citizen science could be heading. An initiative aims to help pygmy tribes fight logging and poaching in this area by allowing them to document destruction and deforestation with games and interactive maps. This initiative is part of the Extreme Citizen Science programme based at University College London, which officially launched in February this year. Headed by computer scientist and geographer Muki Haklay and anthropologist Jerome Lewis, the idea is to allow any community, regardless of their literacy to start, run, and analyse a scientific study – whether it is to advance interests, or to effect policy change. “We want to move citizen science from the educated to everyone,” says Haklay. Working in a part of east London called Deptford, Haklay and his colleagues set up a community project where individuals monitored the noise pollution coming from a local scrapyard. By creating a bank of local data that showed the operation was violating noise limits, the UK Environment Agency revoked the scrapyard’s licence. Lewis meanwhile is working with indigenous people in the Republic of Congo and Cameroon to develop data collection tools that can be used by non-literate people. In the 1990s, vast regions of forest in the Congo Basin were divided up and sold to multinational companies to mine resources. But by the mid-2000s, many of these companies wanted FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification to signify products that are from responsibly harvested and verified sources, and they turned to people like Lewis for help. So Lewis devised ways for monitoring what the indigenous people wanted to preserve, for instance, trees from which they harvest a particularly delicious and tradable species of caterpillar. People are equipped with touchscreen devices with icons for various options like “valuable tree” that they can select and tag with GPS coordinates. “What is good is that these maps will do the talking for communities,” says Lewis. However, there are still several fundamental issues to resolve with these types of projects. One is how you train people adequately for the task. Another is how scientists can ensure that the methods used and quality of data are robust enough when people have a clear stake in the outcome. Making data-collection protocols, instruments and analysis as robust as possible can overcome malicious or accidental bias, says Haklay. “The importance of smartphones as scientific instruments cannot be underestimated in this context: GPS provides accurate time and good location; phone pictures provide location and timestamps (which are unlikely to be tampered by non-literate and technically challenged users), which provide you with evidence; and when they communicate with air pollution sensors or a microphone about noise level, for instance, you have a time stamped observation from an instrument.” Another concern is that there are simply not enough potential volunteers available. CCC’s Grey points out that with only 40% of the population of China hooked up to the internet so far, that means there’s potentially another half-billion about to join. Already a number of citizen science projects are trying to harness the large number of potential volunteers in China, and the first project devised by Chinese scientists launched in 2010. Researchers at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, with the support of IBM’s World Community Grid, set up Computing for Clean Water to use computing power from more than 50,000 volunteers to virtually design better low-cost, low-pressure water filters, which will hopefully make water purification cheaper and more accessible. And this interest will only increase, says Grey. “I did the maths, and every second another Chinese person joins the Internet for the first time – and all of them could potentially donate computing time on their laptop or tablet or phone,” he says. “So, when someone says there are just not enough possible volunteer computers out there, I say that at one new Chinese internet user per second, don’t worry.” If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,More cars = more accidents?,2024-09-15,2012-05-11,David Spiegelhalter,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120510-more-cars-more-accidents,"How crunching the numbers reveals some startling differences in the risk of road accidents  between richer and poorer countries. Karl Benz would likely be shocked at the continued popularity of his invention. Our appetite for cars has grown to a point where there is now around one car for every 11 people in the world. Reasonably, you may think that more cars means more road accidents. But, as ever, numbers tell a more complex truth. Take the UK as an example. In 1950, a few years before I was born, there were 4.4 million vehicles registered in Britain, one for every 11 people. In 2010, there were 34 million vehicles, eight times as many, and more than one for every two people. There were 5,012 deaths on UK roads in 1950, but by 2010 the number of deaths had dropped by 63% to 1,850. When I remember how as a child I enjoyed riding in the front seat of our old van, which had no regular safety inspection or seat belts, and how people used to drive to the pub, drink all evening, and then meander home, I am not really surprised by these extraordinary changes.  If we translate these figures into the chance in a million of dying, or micromorts, there was an average of 102 micromorts per person per year in 1950, dropping to just 31 micromorts per year in 2010. Or to put it another way, each 100,000 vehicles in 1950 were responsible for 114 deaths, but by 2010 they were responsible for only five deaths. Crash test Almost all of the richer nations have followed this pattern, despite traffic increasing. In the 30 years between 1980 and 2009, road fatalities fell by 55% in Australia, 69% in France, 63% in Britain, 54% in Italy and 58% in Spain. The reduction in the US was only 34%, while deaths slightly rose in Greece. For countries that collect the relevant data, we can get the average number of micromorts per 1,000 kilometres a vehicle travels: four in the UK, seven in the USA, 10 in Belgium, 20 in Korea, 40 in Romania and 56 in Brazil. Counting accidents and injuries is more tricky – what exactly counts as an injury? But taking the UK as an example, its figures for being injured have hardly changed: in 1950 there were 167,000 accidents with 196,000 injuries; in 2010 there were 154,000 accidents with 207,000 injuries. People still crash into each other about 400 times a day, but the proportion of these accidents that are fatal has dropped staggeringly – thanks to speed limits, safety features, and improved and quicker medical care. Sadly these trends are not observed the world over. While the average risk for an individual from dying on the roads in high-income countries is 103 micromorts per year, it is 205 in low- and middle-income countries. Of the estimated 3,500 people killed a day worldwide, 3,000 are in the developing world, in spite of those countries containing less than half of all cars on the road. Notable in the per-capita list is South Africa, which sees 15,000 road deaths each year, a statistic that was brought into sharp relief when Nelson Mandela’s great grand-daughter Zenani was killed.  Smeed and speed Who bears this risk again exposes a divide between richer and poorer nations. In richer countries, the majority of road fatalities are the occupants of cars. In poorer countries it is what are known as “vulnerable road users”: pedestrians, cyclists and whole families squeezed onto a single small motorbike. For instance, 70% of all road deaths in Thailand are riders of two-wheeled vehicles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) points out that only 47% of countries have laws about safety features such as speeding, drinking, seatbelts, helmets and child restraints. And these are often not enforced. Not that this shows any sign of improving. The WHO also predicts that road traffic injuries will rise from its current ninth position in the cause-of-death league table to fifth place by 2030 – causing 2.4 million deaths, as well as between 20 and 50 million injuries, largely of young people, and at enormous cost to the economies. It might seem odd that countries with fewer cars are riskier places for road travel, but “Smeed’s law” of traffic says that deaths per vehicle decline strongly as roads get busier – it is empty roads that are so lethal. This is reflected in some extraordinary statistics about Ethiopia: the WHO report states its 244,000 registered vehicles in 2007 managed to kill 2,517 people, the majority of which were pedestrians. That is one death per year for every 100 vehicles. If the US had the same rate with its 250 million vehicles, this would mean 2.5 million deaths on the roads each year – 75 times the current amount of around 32,000 deaths.   If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,Are alternative flours any healthier?,2024-09-15,2023-05-25,Jessica Bradley,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230524-are-flours-made-with-pulses-better-for-us,"One of our most unhealthy collective eating habits in the West is not having enough fibre in our diets. A diet high in fibre is associated with numerous health benefits, including a decreased risk of heart disease and early death. You might worry that boosting your intake of fibre through whole foods, including fruit, vegetables, pulses and wholegrains, means having to sacrifice some of your favourite foods. But in recent years, manufacturers have introduced higher fibre alternatives to many of our traditionally low-fibre staples – including pastas, crisps, breakfast cereals and cereal bars. But are they any better than the foods they replace? It's generally accepted that people should be eating more legumes, including pulses such as lentils and chickpeas, because we don't eat enough fibre. Pulses can help reduce the risk of certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease, because we digest them more slowly than other foods, which keeps our blood glucose levels more consistent. ""When you eat a potato, you get a big rise in blood sugar, but legumes have a much lower glycaemic index and insulinemic response,"" says Peter Ellis, professor of carbohydrate biochemistry at King's College London. Pulses are also packed with nutrients, and low in fat – although they don't have what researchers call a ""complete protein profile"". This means that their protein value is lower compared to meat or eggs because they don't contain all the amino acids our body needs. For this reason, experts recommend pairing pulses with wheat, such as pasta. You might also like: Another way manufacturers are giving pasta a fibre boost is by replacing some of the flour they traditionally use – usually wheat flour – with flour made from fibre-rich alternatives, including lentils, chickpeas and fava beans. In 2020, Sophie Saget, a researcher at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, analysed and compared the nutritional content of pasta made partly with chickpea flour with traditional pasta made with durum wheat flour. She found that the chickpea pasta contained 1.5 times more protein, 3.2 times more fibre and eight times more essential fatty acids. Eating pasta made with chickpea flour, Saget says, makes it much easier to consume pulses, which she describes as ""forgotten heroes"". It's also a good way to control how much food we consume, she adds. ""Legumes are a huge source of fibre, and if you eat a lot fibre, you'll feel full faster, so you won't tend to eat more than you need."" But while pulse-based pasta looks like a strong competitor to traditional durum wheat pasta, based on Saget's research, it's unlikely to be a match for whole pulses. This is because of the processing required to make pulses into pasta. Processing isn't always a bad thing; in a dried state, the nutrients in pulses wouldn't be very bioavailable, says Ellis – but grinding the pulses into flour changes their structure at a cellular level. ""Even if you're eating the whole pulse, the cells containing protein and nutrients separate during the cooking process. But pulse-based pasta takes this processing one step further,"" he says, as making flour out of pulses involves grinding the dry sediment, which ruptures all the cells. But there's a lack of research yet on how exactly this changes their nutritional content, Ellis adds, and the exact nutritional profile of a pulse-based pasta will depend on how the pulses are processed, which will vary among manufacturers. ""You're dealing with very complex materials that contain a multitude of different components,"" he says. ""Increasing the concentration of plant foods in your diet is a good thing, but it's right to raise the question of whether pulse-based pastas have any long-term beneficial effects."" The taste test  Like with any other new food product – especially those imitating our favourite foods – the biggest challenge is winning people over with taste and texture. In fact, this is the biggest challenge, says Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading. ""If something tastes too healthy, people don't like to eat it,"" he says. ""Unless people like it and accept it as a replacement, it won't be successful."" And in that vein, he argues that pulse-based pastas will ""probably remain a niche product"". Taste can be influenced by many external factors. For example, knowing that you're eating pasta that defies tradition could be a palette-spoiler. But traditional Italian pasta actually has a history of incorporating pulse flours, says Nick Saltmarsh, managing director of Hodmedods, which produces and sells pulse flours. When Hodmedods' pasta maker, Giovanni Carleschi, was first tasked with making a pulse-based pasta, he was sceptical. ""But once he realised that there was true Italian pasta using bean flour, he was keen to give it a go,"" Saltmarsh said. The end result, using 50% emmer wheat flour and 50% fava bean flour, tastes different to traditional wheat flour – Saltmarsh calls it ""distinctive"". And having a product that tastes and looks different to its popular counterparts is no easy feat. ""It's a challenge to overcome the preconceptions of what something should taste like when the product is slightly different,"" says Saltmarsh. But the product, actually, isn't that different. Italians aren't the only ones to have used pulse-based flour to make pasta – its use is widespread. While pulse-based pasta might seem like a new health fad, we've actually been pushing the health benefits of pulse flours for hundreds of years, says food historian Rebecca Earle. ""People have been making food from chestnut and rice flour for millennia,"" she says. ""And more recently – from around the 18th Century – people in France were advertising flour made from different ingredients, including lentils and haricot beans, as healthier alternatives to traditional flours, which would have been wheat flour, as it is now."" One of the reasons white wheat flour is the most common flour now is because it has become much cheaper over time, thanks to the industrial revolution. Its popularity also partly comes down to its historic association with the upper classes. ""Wheat doesn't have a high yield, so it was expensive in the Middle Ages,"" Earle says. ""And it makes particularly fluffy bread, so it had a high-class quality to it. This meant that, as it became affordable, it was still desirable."" White wheat flour was also considered more nutritious, because it was thought to be better for our digestive systems. However, we now know that higher-fibre alternative flours are generally better for us. Bringing the past into the present  While pastas made partly with pulse flours might make some pasta fans suspicious, lessons in how they can become more mainstream could soon emerge from a three-year project involving bread made from fava bean flour. Julie Lovegrove, professor of human nutrition at the University of Reading, has replaced up to 25% of wheat flour with fava flour, which makes it higher in protein, iron, zinc and fibre compared to traditional white bread. ""I imagine that, for pasta, replacing the durum wheat will have a greater nutrient content and lower GI, similar to our substitution with bread,"" she says. The Raising the Pulse project involves growing the broad beans and picking ones that are particular iron-rich and nutrient-dense, drying, milling them and then working with bakers to produce the final product – which will then be tested out across a university campus. ""We want the bread to be as identical as possible to commercial white bread so that people can consume it without changing their eating habits,"" she says. ""Scientists can develop foods with high amounts of pulses, but if people don't like the taste, it's just an academic exercise,"" she says. ""It'd be amazing for pulse-enriched bread to be the norm, but we've got to make sure it's accessible and acceptable for people."" The health benefits of adding pulse-based pasta to your diet really depend on what you're eating it instead of. When it comes to processed plant-based foods, pulse-based pasta is a relatively good choice, says Saget. ""Compared to a legume-based burger, for example, legume pasta is relatively low processed,"" she says. Despite a lack of research into pulse-based pastas, the wealth of evidence on the health benefits of pulses suggests that swapping pulses and other whole foods for pulse-based pasta won't be as beneficial to our health as using it as an alternative to regular wheat pasta. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,The best age to learn to read,2024-09-15,2022-03-02,Melissa Hogenboom,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220228-the-best-age-for-learning-to-read,"In some countries, kids as young as four learn to read and write. In others, they don't start until seven. What's the best formula for lasting success? Melissa Hogenboom investigates. I was seven years old when I started to learn to read, as is typical of the alternative Steiner school I attended. My own daughter attends a standard English school, and started at four, as is typical in most British schools. Watching her memorise letters and sound out words, at an age when my idea of education was climbing trees and jumping through puddles, has made me wonder how our different experiences shape us. Is she getting a crucial head-start that will give her lifelong benefits? Or is she exposed to undue amounts of potential stress and pressure, at a time when she should be enjoying her freedom? Or am I simply worrying too much, and it doesn't matter at what age we start reading and writing? There's no doubt that language in all its richness – written, spoken, sung or read aloud – plays a crucial role in our early development. Babies already respond better to the language they were exposed to in the womb. Parents are encouraged to read to their children before they are even born, and when they are babies. Evidence shows that how much or how little we are talked to as children can have lasting effects on future educational achievement. Books are a particularly important aspect of that rich linguistic exposure, since written language often includes a wider and more nuanced and detailed vocabulary than everyday spoken language. This can in turn help children increase their range and depth of expression. Since a child's early experience of language is considered so fundamental to their later success, it has become increasingly common for preschools to begin teaching children basic literacy skills even before formal education starts. When children begin school, literacy is invariably a major focus. This goal of ensuring that all children learn to read and write has become even more pressing as researchers warn that the pandemic has caused a widening achievement gap between wealthier and poorer families, increasing academic inequality.   Family Tree This article is part of Family Tree, a series of features from the BBC that explore the issues and opportunities that parents, children and families face all over the world. You might also be interested in some other stories about children, teenagers and education: Asia's new love of forest schools The school that transformed a city Why Germany loves ""school cones"" You can also climb new branches of the Family Tree on BBC Worklife. In many countries, formal education starts at four. The thinking often goes that starting early gives children more time to learn and excel. The result, however, can be an ""education arms race"", with parents trying to give their child early advantages at school through private coaching and teaching, and some parents even paying for children as young as four to have additional private tutoring. Compare that to the more play-based early education of several decades ago, and you can see a huge change in policy, based on very different ideas of what our children need in order to get ahead. In the US, this urgency sped up with policy changes such as the 2001 ""no child left behind"" act, which promoted standardised testing as a way to measure educational performance and progress. In the UK, children are tested in their second year of school (age 5-6) to check they are reaching the expected reading standard. Critics warn that early testing like this can put children off reading, while proponents say it helps to identify those who need additional support. However, many studies show little benefit from an early overly-academic environment. One 2015 US report says that society's expectations of what children should achieve in kindergarten has changed, which is leading to ""inappropriate classroom practices"", such as reducing play-based learning. The risk of ""schoolification"" How children learn and the quality of the environment is hugely important. ""Young children learning to read is one of the most important things primary education does. It's fundamental to children making progress in life,"" says Dominic Wyse, a professor of primary education at University College London, in the UK. He, alongside sociology professor Alice Bradbury, also at UCL, has published research proposing that the way we teach literacy really matters. In a 2022 report, they state that English school system's intense focus on phonics – a method that involves matching the sound of a spoken word or letter, with individual written letters, through a process called ""sounding out"" – could be failing some children. A reason for this, says Bradbury, is that the ""schoolification of early years"" has resulted in more formal learning earlier on. But the tests used to assess that early learning may have little to do with the skills actually needed to read and enjoy books or other meaningful texts. For example, the tests may ask pupils to ""sound out"" and spell nonsense words, to prevent them from simply guessing, or recognising familiar words. Since nonsense words are not meaningful language, children may find the task difficult and puzzling. Bradbury found that the pressure to gain these decoding skills – and pass reading tests – also means that some three-year-olds are already being exposed to phonics. ""It doesn't end up being meaningful, it ends up being memorising rather than understanding context,"" says Bradbury. She also worries that the books used are not particularly engaging.  Neither Wyse nor Bradbury make the case for later learning per se, but rather highlight that we should rethink the way children are taught literacy. The priority, they say, should be to encourage an interest in and familiarity with words, using storybooks, songs and poems, all of which help the child pick up the sounds of words, as well as expanding their vocabulary. This idea is backed up by studies that show that the academic benefits of preschool fade away later on. Children who attend intensive preschools do not have higher academic abilities in later grades than those who did not attend such preschools, several studies now show. Early education can however have a positive impact on social development – which in turn feeds into the likelihood of graduation from school and university as well as being associated with lower crime rates. In short, attending preschool can have positive effects on later achievement in life, but not necessary on academic skills.    Too much academic pressure may even cause problems in the long run. A study published in January 2022 suggested that those who attended a state-funded preschool with a strong academic emphasis, showed lower academic achievements a few years later, compared to those who had not gained a place. This chimes with research on the importance of play-based learning in the early years. Child-led play-based preschools have better outcomes than more academically focussed preschools, for example. One 2002 study found that ""children's later school success appears to have been enhanced by more active, child-initiated early learning experiences"", and that overly formalised learning could have slowed progress. The study concluded that ""pushing children too soon may actually backfire when children move into the later elementary school grade"". Similarly, another small study found that disadvantaged children in the US who were randomly assigned to a more play-based setting had lower behavioural issues and emotional impairments at age 23, compared to children who had been randomly assigned to a more ""direct instruction"" setting. Preschool studies like these don't shed light on the impact of early literacy per se, and small studies in single locations must always be treated with care, but they suggest that how it is taught, matters. One reason why early education can result in positive social outcomes later in life may have nothing to do with the teaching at all, but with the fact that it provides childcare. This means parents can work uninterrupted and provide more income to the family home. Anna Cunningham, a senior lecturer in psychology at Nottingham Trent University who studies early literacy, argues that if a setting is too academically focused early on, it can cause the teachers to become stressed over tests and results, which can in turn affect the kids. ""Of course it's not good to judge a five-year-old on their results,"" she says. Parental anxiety about how well their child is doing at school can also feed into this: according to a survey commissioned by an educational charity in the UK, school performance is one of parents' top concerns. Later start, better outcomes?   Not everyone favours an early start. In many countries, including Germany, Iran and Japan, formal schooling starts at around six. In Finland, often hailed as the country with one of the best education system in the world, children begin school at seven. Despite that apparent lag, Finnish students score higher in reading comprehension than students from the UK and the US at age 15. In line with that child-centred approach, the Finnish kindergarten years are filled with more play and no formal academic instruction. Following this model, a 2009 University of Cambridge review proposed that the formal school age should be pushed back to six, giving children in the UK more time ""to begin to develop the language and study skills essential to their later progress"", as starting too early could ""risk denting five-year-olds' confidence and causing long-term damage to their learning"".  Research does back up this idea of starting later. One 2006 kindergarten study in the US showed there was improvement in test scores for children who delayed entry by one year. Other research comparing early versus late readers, found that later readers catch up to comparable levels later on – even slightly surpassing the early readers in comprehension abilities. The study, explains lead author Sebastian Suggate, of the University of Regensburg in Germany, shows that learning later allows children to more efficiently match their knowledge of the world – their comprehension – to the words they learn. ""It makes sense,"" he says. ""Reading comprehension is language, they've got to unlock the ideas behind it."" ""Of course if you spend more time focusing on language earlier on, you are building a strong foundation of skills that takes years to develop. Reading can be picked up quickly but for language (vocabulary and comprehension) there's no cheap tricks. It's hard work,"" says Suggate. In other work looking at differing school entry ages, he found that learning to read early had no discernible benefits at age 15.  The question remains that if reading ability is not improved by learning early, then why start early? Individual variation in reading appetite and ability are one important aspect. ""Children are hugely different in terms of their foundational skills when they start school or start learning to read,"" explains Cunningham. In her study of Steiner-educated children, who only start formal education at about seven, she had to exclude 40% of the sample as the children could already read. ""I think that's because they were ready for it,"" she says. She also found the older children were more ready ""to learn the process to read in terms of their underlying language skills"" because they had had three extra years of language exposure. Studies also show that reading ability is more closely linked to a child's vocabulary than to their age, and that spoken language skills are a high predictor of later literary skills. However, we know that many children who enter school are behind on their language skills, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some argue that formal teaching allows these children to access the support and skills that others may pick up informally at home. This line of thinking is espoused by UK educational authorities, who say that teaching reading early to those behind on their spoken language  is ""the only effective route to closing this [language ability] gap"". Others favour the opposite approach, of immersing children in an environment where they can enjoy and develop their language comprehension, which is after all central to reading success. This is exactly what a playful learning setting helps encourage. ""The job of teaching is to assess where your children are and give them the most appropriate teaching related to their level of development,"" says Wyse. The 2009 Cambridge review echoed this and stated: ""There is no evidence that a child who spends more time learning through lessons – as opposed to learning through play – will 'do better' in the long run."" Cunningham, whose daughter has also recently started learning to read, has a reassuringly generous view of the ideal reading age: ""It doesn't matter whether you start to read at four or five or six as long as the method they are taught is a good, evidenced method. Children are so resilient they will find opportunities to play in any context."" Our obsession with early literacy appears to be somewhat unfounded, then – there's no need, nor clear benefit of rushing it. On the other hand, if your child is starting early, or shows an independent interest in reading before their school offers it, that's fine too, as long as there is plenty of opportunity to down tools and have fun along the way.  * Melissa Hogenboom is the editor of BBC Reel.

risk appetite,The secret to a long and healthy life?,2024-09-15,2020-05-30,Alex Riley,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170601-the-secret-to-a-long-and-healthy-life-eat-less,"Permanently cutting the daily calories you consume may turn out to have a profound effect on your future life, according to some tantalising scientific studies. BBC Future has brought you in-depth and rigorous stories to help you navigate the current pandemic, but we know that’s not all you want to read. So now we’re dedicating a series to help you escape. We’ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads.    You’ll find everything from the story about the world’s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us, the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long-buried World War Two tanks back to life. What you won’t find is any reference to, well, you-know-what. Enjoy.   In a restaurant setting sometime in the not-too distant future, a man and a woman are on their first date. After the initial nerves subside, all is going well. The man is 33, he says, has been single for most of those years, and, although he doesn’t mention it, knows he is looking to settle down and have a family. The woman replies that she is 52, has been married, divorced, and has children in their early 20s. He had no idea – she looked his age, or younger. This is a dream of Julie Mattison from the National Institute on Ageing (NIA) in the United States. She envisions a time when chronological age ticks by with every year, but biological age can be set to a different timer, where elderly doesn’t mean what it does now. It sounds far-fetched, but our society has already made great strides towards that goal, thanks to advances in medicine and improvements in healthy living. In 2014, for instance, the United States Health Interview Survey reported that 16% of people aged between 50 and 64 were impaired every day with chronic illness. Three decades earlier that number was 23%. In other words, as well as benefiting from longer lifespans, we are also experiencing longer “healthspans” – and the latter is proving to be even more malleable. To paraphrase and update a speech from John F Kennedy given at the first White House Conference on Ageing in 1961, life can indeed be added to years, rather than just years added to life. So, what do we need to do to enhance the length and quality of our lives even more? Researchers worldwide are pursuing various ideas, but for Mattison and colleagues, the answer is a simple change in diet. They believe that the key to a better old age may be to reduce the amount of food on our plates, via an approach called “calorie restriction”. This diet goes further than cutting back on fatty foods from time-to-time; it’s about making gradual and careful reductions in portion size permanently. Since the early 1930s, a 30% reduction in the amount of food consumed per day has been linked to longer, more active lives in worms, flies, rats, mice, and monkeys. Across the animal kingdom, in other words, calorie restriction has proven the best remedy for the ravages of life. And it’s possible that humans have just as much to gain. The idea that what a person eats influences their health no doubt predates any historical accounts that remain today. But, as is often the case for any scientific discipline, the first detailed accounts come from Ancient Greece. Hippocrates, one of the first physicians to claim diseases were natural and not supernatural, observed that many ailments were associated with gluttony; obese Greeks tended to die younger than slim Greeks, that was clear and written down on papyrus. Spreading from this epicentre of science, these ideas were adopted and adapted over the centuries. And at the end of the 15th Century, Alvise Cornaro, an infirm aristocrat from a small village near Venice in Italy, turned the prevailing wisdom on its head, and on himself. If indulgence was harmful, would dietary asceticism be helpful? To find out, Cornaro, aged 40, ate only 350g (12oz) of food per day, roughly 1000 calories according to recent estimates. He ate bread, panatela or broth, and eggs. For meat he chose veal, goat, beef, partridge, thrush, and any poultry that was available. He bought fish caught from the local rivers. Restricted in amount but not variety, Cornaro claimed to have achieved “perfect health” up until his death more than 40 years later. Although he changed his birthdate as he aged, claiming that he had reached his 98th year, it is thought that he was around 84 when he died – still an impressive feat in the 16th Century, a time when 50 or 60 years old was considered elderly. In 1591, his grandson published his posthumous three-volume tome entitled “Discourses on the Sober Life,” pushing dietary restriction into the mainstream, and redefining ageing itself. With an additional boost of health into the evening of life, the elderly, in full possession of their mental capacities, would be able to put decades of amassed knowledge to good use, Carnaro claimed. With his diet, beauty became the aged, not the youthful. Longevity trials Cornaro was an interesting man but his findings are not to be taken as fact by any branch of science. Even if he was true to his word and did not suffer ill health for nearly half a century, which seems unlikely, he was a case study of one – not representative of humans as a whole. But since a foundational study in 1935 in white rats, a dietary restriction of between 30-50% has been shown to extend lifespan, delaying death from age-related disorders and disease. Of course, what works for a rat or any other laboratory organism might not work for a human. Long-term trials, following humans from early adulthood to death, are a rarity. “I don’t see a human study of longevity as something that would be a fundable research programme,” says Mattison. “Even if you start humans at 40 or 50 years old, you’re still looking at potentially 40 or 50 more years [of study].” Plus, she adds, ensuring that extraneous factors – exercise, smoking, medical treatments, mental wellbeing – don’t influence the trial’s end results is near impossible for our socially and culturally complex species. That’s why, in the late 1980s, two independent long-term trials – one at NIA and the other at the University of Wisconsin – were set up to study calorie restriction and ageing in Rhesus monkeys. Not only do we share 93% of our DNA with these primates, we age in the same way too. Slowly, after middle age (around 15 years in Rhesus monkeys) the back starts to hunch, the skin and muscles start to sag, and, where it still grows, hair goes from gingery brown to grey. The similarities go deeper. In these primates, the occurrence of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease increases in frequency and severity with age. “They’re an excellent model to study ageing,” says Rozalyn Anderson, a gerontologist from the University of Wisconsin.  And they’re easy to control. Fed with specially made biscuits, the diets of the 76 monkeys at the University of Wisconsin and the 121 at NIA are tailored to their age, weight, and natural appetite. All monkeys receive the full complement of nutrients and minerals that their bodies crave. It’s just that half of the monkeys, the calorie restricted (or CR) group, eat 30% less. They are far from malnourished or starving. Take Sherman, a 43-year-old monkey from NIA. Mattison says that since being placed on the CR diet in 1987, aged 16, Sherman hasn’t shown any overt signs of hunger that are well characterised in his species. Sherman is the oldest Rhesus monkey ever recorded, nearly 20 years older than the average lifespan for his species in captivity. As younger monkeys were developing diseases and dying, he seemed to be immune to ageing. Even into his 30s he would have been considered an old monkey, but he didn’t look or act like one.  The same is true, to varying extents, for the rest of his experimental troop at NIA. “We have a lower incidence of diabetes, and lower incidence of cancer in the CR groups,” says Mattison. In 2009, the University of Wisconsin trial published similarly spectacular results. Not only did their CR monkeys look remarkably younger – with more hair, less sag, and brown instead of grey – than monkeys that were fed a standard diet, they were healthier on the inside too, free from pathology. Cancers, such as the common intestinal adenocarcinoma, were reduced by over 50%. The risk of heart disease was similarly halved. And while 11 of the ad libitum (“at one’s pleasure,” in Latin) monkeys developed diabetes and five exhibited signs that they were pre-diabetic, the blood glucose regulation seemed healthy in all CR monkeys. For them, diabetes wasn’t a thing.    Overall, only 13% of the monkeys in the CR group had died of age-related causes in 20 years. In the ad libitum group, 37% had died, nearly three times as many. In an update study from the University of Wisconsin in 2014, this percentage remained stable. “We have demonstrated that ageing can be manipulated in primates,” says Anderson. “It kind of gets glossed over because it’s obvious, but conceptually that’s hugely important; it means that ageing itself is a reasonable target for clinical intervention and medical treatment.” If ageing can be delayed, in other words, all of the diseases associated with it will follow suit. “Going after each disease one at a time isn’t going to significantly extend lifespan for people because they’ll die of something else,” says Anderson. “If you cured all cancers, you wouldn’t offset death due to cardiovascular disease, or dementia, or diabetes-associated disorders. Whereas if you go after ageing you can offset the lot in one go.” Eating less certainly seemed to help the monkeys, but calorie restriction is much tougher for people out in the real world. For one, our access to regular, high-calorie meals is now easier than ever; with companies like Deliveroo and UberEats, there is no longer a need to walk to the restaurant anymore. And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people. “There’s a huge genetic component to all of this and its much harder work for some people than it is for others to stay trim,” says Anderson. “We all know someone who can eat an entire cake and nothing happens, they look the exact same. And then someone else walks past a table with a cake on it and they have to go up a pant size.” Ideally, the amount and types of food we eat should be tailored to who we are – our genetic predisposition to gaining weight, how we metabolise sugars, how we store fat, and other physiological fluxes that are beyond the scope of scientific instruction at the moment, and perhaps forever. But a predisposition to obesity can be used as a guide to life choices rather than an inevitability. “I personally have a genetic history of obesity running through my family, and I practice a flexible form of caloric restriction,” says Susan Roberts a dietary scientist at Tufts University in Boston. “I keep my BMI at 22, and [have calculated] that that requires eating 80% of what I would eat if my BMI was at 30 like every other member of my family.” Roberts stresses that it isn’t hard – she follows her own weight management programme using a tool called iDiet to help her eat less but avoid feeling hungry or deprived of enjoyment. If this wasn’t possible, she adds, she wouldn’t practise calorie restriction. Not only has Roberts seen the problems of obesity first-hand in her family, she knows the benefits of CR better than most. For over 10 years she has been a leading scientist in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy trial, also known as Calerie. Over two years, 218 healthy men and women aged between 21 and 50 years were split into two groups.  In one, people were allowed to eat as they normally would (ad libitum), while the other ate 25% less (CR). Both had health checks every six months. Unlike in the Rhesus monkey trials, tests over two years can’t determine whether CR reduces or delays age-related diseases. There simply isn’t enough time for their development. But the Calerie trials tested for the next best thing: the early biological signs of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Published in 2015, the results after two years were very positive. In the blood of calorie-restricted people, the ratio of “good” cholesterol to “bad” cholesterol had increased, molecules associated with tumour formation – called tumour necrosis factors (TNFs) – were reduced by around 25%, and levels of insulin resistance, a sure sign of diabetes, fell by nearly 40% compared to people who ate their normal diets. Overall, the blood’s pressure was lower. Admittedly, some benefits may come from weight-loss. Earlier trials from Calerie had included people that were obese as well as those with a healthy body mass index (BMI) of 25 or below, and slimming down would have certainly improved the welfare of the heavier participants. “One thing that’s been very clear for a long time is that being overweight or obese is bad for you,” says Roberts. Diseases and disorders previously thought to be age-associated diseases are now popping up in the obese population, she adds. But the latest results suggested that significant health benefits can be garnered in an already healthy body – a person who isn’t underweight or obese. That is, someone whose BMI lies between 18.5 and 25. Despite these results, evidence from further trials will be needed before someone with an already healthy BMI should be advised to reduce their calorie intake. (And anyone wanting to change their diet would be advised to consult a medical professional beforehand.) In the meantime, the scientists will be hoping that their rhesus macaques may help us to understand exactly why calories restriction may have these effects. With nearly 30 years of data on lives and deaths, and blood and tissue samples, from nearly 200 monkeys, the work at NIA and the University of Wisconsin aim to shine a light into the black box of calorie restriction, illuminating just how it delays ageing. With less food, is the metabolism forced to be more efficient with what it has? Is there a common molecular switch regulating ageing that is turned on (or off) with fewer calories? Or is there an as of yet unknown mechanism underpinning our lives and deaths? The importance of monkeys like Sherman far outspans their lives. Answers to such questions might be long in coming. “If I cloned 10 of myself and we all worked furiously, I don’t think we’d have it solved,” says Anderson. “The biology is inordinately complicated.” It’s a worthwhile undertaking – understand how CR works and other treatments could then be used to target that specific part of our biology. Ageing could be treated directly, that is, without the need of calorie restriction. “And I think that’s really the golden ticket,” says Anderson. Although lacking a neat explanation, calorie restriction is one of the most promising avenues for improving health and how long it lasts in our lives. “There was nothing in what we saw that made us think caloric restriction doesn’t work in people,” says Roberts, from the Calerie trial. And, unlike drug-based treatments, it doesn’t come with a long list of possible side effects. “Our people were not hungrier, their mood was fine, their sexual function was fine. We looked pretty hard for bad things and didn’t find them,” says Roberts. One expected issue was a slight decrease in bone density that is often tied to gradual weight loss, says Roberts. But as a precaution, volunteers were provided with small calcium supplements throughout the trial. Even with such promising findings, “this [the Calerie trial] is the first study of its kind, and I don’t think that any of us would feel confident in saying, ‘okay, we’re going to recommend this to everyone in the world,’” says Roberts. “But it’s a really exciting prospect. I think that delaying the progression of chronic diseases is something that everyone can get behind and get excited about, because nobody wants to live life with one of those.” Alex Riley is a writer based in Berlin, Germany.

risk appetite,The benefits of eating adventurously,2024-09-15,2017-06-13,David Robson,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170612-should-the-world-eat-more-like-the-cantonese,"Hong Kong is a rabbit’s warren of eateries offering all manner of dishes – some of them not for the faint-hearted. But could this adventurous eating actually be good for us? Sitting down in this small Hong Kong restaurant, I assume that the white chest of drawers behind me are filled with tea leaves, herbs, and fungi. So I’m rather perturbed when my guide Cecilia Leung tells me that they are not filled with dried plant life – but live snakes. If the owner were here, Cecilia says, he would happily bring one out for me to inspect. Indeed, the “snake king’s” talents are so famous that he is sometimes called out in the middle of the night to capture and relocate venemous specimens blocking public rights of way. Luckily for me, the only serpent I see is skinned, sliced, and served up in a thick, gravy-like broth with pork, chicken, mushrooms, and lemon grass. The snake meat itself is greyish with a slightly pink blush – and what appear to be the imprint of its scales still marking its delicate surface. The rich fumes of the broth are undoubtedly appetising, but I let my spoon hover nervously over the edge of the bowl – not quite sure whether I dare to dig in. Intellectually, I know that snake meat is really no different from eating fish, or squid, or chicken. And yet my brain can’t quite seem to communicate that message to my mouth or to my stomach. I’m in Hong Kong on a reporting assignment – and part of my mission is to understand the territory’s rich culinary history. But as a science journalist, I’m also interested in what experiences can tell me about the psychology of eating, including the somewhat arbitrary mental barriers that determine what we will and won’t eat – and the surprising benefits of overcoming those boundaries. As I hesitate, Cecilia tells me that about half the people she brings on this tour are willing to overcome their aversion and eat the snake. Will I be one of them? I first meet Cecilia and her sister Silvana at a bakery and café in the working-class district of Sham Shui Po. Together, they run Hong Kong Foodie Tours, and over breakfast they offer me a crash course in the history and culture of Hong Kong cuisine. “I hope you’ve got a big appetite,” Silvana asks me, before ordering me a huge pineapple bun, made from a sweet, airy dough and covered in a cracked yellow topping. It is served with a mug of steaming Hong Kong-style milk tea, made by repeatedly drawing water through a huge “stocking” filled with tea leaves, which helps release the tannins and the caffeine for a ‘smoother’ flavour, and mixed evaporated milk. The Hong Kong government recently included the meal as part of the territory’s “intangible cultural heritage”, and it clearly betrays the influence of British colonialism and its status as one of the world’s most important ports. Along similar lines, the café’s menu also includes a “macaroni soup” and “Swiss wings” – chicken coated in a sticky brown liquid that looks suspiciously like chocolate, but which is really a sweet soy sauce. “Because it was a colonial city, we borrowed and adapted a lot of our foods from cultures,” Cecilia tells me. It is for the same reason that the locals will happily cover their traditional dim sum in Worcester sauce. We next stop for a bowl of wonton noodle soup, topped with shrimp roe. Many of the wonton restaurants came via mass migration from mainland China many years ago, Cecilia and Silvana tell me – but like those Western dishes, the locals have now made it their own. “These people, when they came here, they had no skills, they were not educated – but they could make food for a living,” explains Silvana. For lunch, we taste the city’s famous roast meats, dripping with a glaze that turns my rice gold in the bowl – with a few detours into the markets and dried seafood shops selling shark fins and fish bladders eaten at important banquets. Many of the local foods are thought to have medicinal value, and along the way I stop off at a stall to buy a cup of kuding, or “bitter nail tea”. According to traditionalists, it is meant to disperse excess fire in the body, soothing the digestion, and sharpening the mind. I found its bitterness to be surprisingly invigorating – like a square of dark chocolate – though it is not always a hit with Cecilia’s tour groups. “You’re the first foreigner who’s ever told me that it’s refreshing!” she tells me. My first real test comes a little later with a bowl of a black jelly called guilinggao, made from ground-up turtle shells, which is meant to reduce acne and improve circulation. I had been too nervous to try it on my first trip to Hong Kong, but like my cup of kuding, it is pleasingly bitter, and slides soothingly across the tongue and down the throat. As I leave, I notice an Uber Eats sign at their entrance, offering home delivery – a sign of the ways that even the most traditional foods are being incorporated into the modern lifestyle. By the early afternoon, I’m already beginning to feel that I’ve at least caught a glimpse of the amazing fusion of culinary influences that have shaped Hong Kong’s diet today. And it seems to serve them well: with its emphasis on balance and moderation, the territory has one of the highest life expectancies in the world. But I’m intrigued to hear how new expats, unused to living in such a rich melting pot of cultures, adapt to the choice. Do they all learn to take advantage of the foods on offer? Cecilia says that most people tend to fall to the two extremes: she even knows one couple where the wife will eat everything, and the husband will try nothing new. Looking into the scientific literature, I found that psychologists describe those two “food personalities” as neophilia and neophobia. Studies have shown that neophobics exhibit significant signs of stress when facing unfamiliar foods, including increased pulse, fast breathing, and increased skin conductance from sweating. By influencing the variety of our diet, that fear of new foods may damage our overall health and wellbeing. Neophobics are more likely to be overweight, for instance, perhaps because they tend to opt for blander, more calorific foods. They also tend to show deficits in key nutrients, including proteins, monounsaturated fats, and minerals like magnesium. Such preferences may partly be down to our genes. Food neophobes tend to be more sensitive to a particular chemical, phenylthiocarbamide, that gives many foods their bitter tastes (and which, in nature, may have been a way of judging a plant’s toxicity). Such variation may explain why I find the kuding, guilinggao and stir-fried bitter melon to be pleasantly refreshing, while other visitors claim that the flavours are over-powering to the point of being revolting. But our food personalities may also be determined by a range of psychological factors. One study by Laith Al Shawaf, then at the University of Texas in Austin, found that food neophobic people seem to be more fearful of diseases and pests in general – suggesting it may be part of an overall heightened disgust response. An evolved fear of infection may be the reason that we are particularly suspicious of new types of meat, given that they may carry the greatest risk of food poisoning, he says. Intriguingly, Al Shawaf found that food neophobia also seemed to correlate with self-reported disgust in other domains – including sex – and it even appeared to be related to the kinds of relationships they preferred. “Those who are more oriented toward short-term mating and casual sex tend to be more food neophilic than those who are more inclined toward monogamy and committed mating,” says Al Shawaf, who is now based at Bilkent University in Turkey. Al Shawaf therefore wonders if a tendency to try new foods may also be a way of demonstrating the fact that we have a robust immune system, capable of dealing with the potential pathogens that may come from eating new foods. Whatever our current food personality, he thinks we can all learn to overcome our disgust response to some degree, through increased exposure to new tastes and textures. “There’s no reason to expect food neophobia to be set in stone,” he says. “It can change across the lifespan, from context to context, and as a function of mood and physiological state.” One study, from Phan Hong at the University of Wisconsin, found that adopting a deliberately attentive, mindful approach (akin to meditation) is best – apparently, the act of calmly observing and savouring the unfamiliar experience helps us to override the initial aversion. I experience this myself, once we reach the snake soup restaurant at Tai Po Market in the New Territories. In England, we have been conditioned to fear snakes, and the sight of its scaly flesh swimming in a swampy, viscous broth, would have once been hard for me to stomach. But after my day’s whistle-stop tour through Hong Kong’s culinary highlights, I decide to take my first spoonful. Far from being a trial to eat, the soup felt like a perfect, warming comfort food, with the snake itself offering a subtle fishy flavour, offset by the citric bite of the lemongrass. The locals believe it can improve circulation and fend off illness. It’s our last stop before our final destination – a restaurant on the top floor of the Tai Po wet market. Cecilia tells me that fresh, lightly seasoned seafood is the pride of the region, and so we order a gently steamed fish in black bean sauce, deep fried squid balls, and glutinous rice with a fresh crab. The art is in the precision of the steaming, Cecilia tells me. “If you leave it for just one minute too long it becomes a bit too tough.” Since the Cantonese word for “fish” sounds similar to the word for “leftovers”, the dish is often eaten at New Year’s celebrations to signify abundance and prosperity, she tells me. By the time we’re finished, I’m burning to explore more of Hong Kong’s hotspots on my own. Cecilia, who is a keen traveller herself, compares the process to learning a second language; it can take a while to adjust your mind to the new way of thinking, but once you have begun to absorb its vocabulary, there’s really no better way of getting to know a culture. “It’s really getting to the soul of who we are.” --- David Robson is a freelance writer.

risk appetite,Could we live in a world without rules?,2024-09-15,2020-02-21,Nick Chater,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200220-could-we-live-in-a-world-without-rules,"We might dream of a world where there are no rules, but how practical would it be? ""I'm in my late 20s and I'm feeling more and more constrained by rules. From the endless signs that tell me to 'stand on the right' on escalators or 'skateboarding forbidden' in public places to all those unwritten societal rules such as the expectation that I should settle down, buy a house and have a family. Do we really need all these rules, why should I follow them and what would happen if we all ignored them?"" Will, 28, London   We all feel the oppressive presence of rules, both written and unwritten – it's practically a rule of life. Public spaces, organisations, dinner parties, even relationships and casual conversations are rife with regulations and red tape that seemingly are there to dictate our every move. We rail against rules being an affront to our freedom, and argue that they're ""there to be broken"".   But as a behavioural scientist I believe that it is not really rules, norms and customs in general that are the problem – but the unjustified ones. The tricky and important bit, perhaps, is establishing the difference between the two.   A good place to start is to imagine life in a world without rules. Apart from our bodies following some very strict and complex biological laws, without which we'd all be doomed, the very words I’m writing now follow the rules of English. In Byronic moments of artistic individualism, I might dreamily think of liberating myself from them. But would this new linguistic freedom really do me any good or set my thoughts free?   You might also like:   Some – Lewis Carroll in his poem Jabberwocky, for example – have made a success of a degree of literary anarchy. But on the whole, breaking away from the rules of my language makes me not so much unchained as incoherent.    Byron was a notorious rule breaker in his personal life, but he was also a stickler for rhyme and metre. In his poem, When We Two Parted, for example, Byron writes about forbidden love, a love that broke the rules, but does do so by precisely following some well-established poetic laws. And many would argue it is all the more powerful for it:   In secret we met   In silence I grieve,   That thy heart could forget,   Thy spirit deceive.   If I should meet thee   After long years,   How should I greet thee?--   With silence and tears.   Consider, too, how rules are the essence of sport, games and puzzles – even when their entire purpose is supposedly fun. The rules of chess, say, can trigger a tantrum if I want to ""castle"" to get out of check, but find that they say I can’t; or if I find your pawn getting to my side of the board and turning into a queen, rook, knight or bishop. Similarly, find me a football fan who hasn't at least once raged against the offside rule.   But chess or football without rules wouldn’t be chess or football – they would be entirely formless and meaningless activities. Indeed, a game with no rules is no game at all. Lots of the norms of everyday life perform precisely the same function as the rules of games – telling us what ""moves"" we can, and can't, make. The conventions of ""pleases"" and ""thank yous"" that seem so irksome to young children are indeed arbitrary – but the fact that we have some such conventions, and perhaps critically that we agree what they are, is part of what makes our social interactions run smoothly.   And rules about driving on the left or the right, stopping at red lights, queueing, not littering, picking up our dog's deposits and so on fall into the same category. They are the building blocks of a harmonious society.   Of course, there has long been an appetite among some people for a less formalised society, a society without government, a world where individual freedom takes precedence: an anarchy.  The trouble with anarchy, though, is that it is inherently unstable – humans continually, and spontaneously, generate new rules governing behaviour, communication and economic exchange, and they do so as rapidly as old rules are dismantled.   A few decades ago, the generic pronoun in written language was widely assumed to be male: he/him/his. That rule has, quite rightly, largely been overturned. Yet it has also been replaced – not by an absence of rules, but by a different and broader set of rules governing our use of pronouns.   Or let's return to the case of sport. A game may start by kicking a pig's bladder from one end of a village to another, with ill-defined teams, and potentially riotous violence. But it ends up, after a few centuries, with a hugely complex rule book dictating every detail of the game. We even create international governing bodies to oversee them. The political economist Elinor Ostrom (who shared the Noble Prize for economics in 2009) observed the same phenomenon of spontaneous rule construction when people had collectively to manage common resources such as common land, fisheries, or water for irrigation.   She found that people collectively construct rules about, say, how many cattle a person can graze, where, and when; who gets how much water, and what should be done when the resource is limited; who monitors whom, and which rules resolve disputes. These rules aren't just invented by rulers and imposed from the top down – instead, they often arise, unbidden, from the needs of mutually agreeable social and economic interactions.    The urge to overturn stifling, unjust or simply downright pointless rules is entirely justified. But without some rules – and some tendency for us to stick to them – society would slide rapidly into pandemonium. Indeed, many social scientists would see our tendency to create, stick to, and enforce rules as the very foundation of social and economic life. Our relationship with rules does seem to be unique to humans. Of course, many animals behave in highly ritualistic ways – for example, the bizarre and complex courtship dances of different species of bird of paradise – but these patterns are wired into their genes, not invented by past generations of birds. And, while humans establish and maintain rules by punishing rule violations, chimpanzees – our closest relatives – do not. Chimps may retaliate when their food is stolen but, crucially, they don't punish food stealing in general – even if the victim is a close relative.   In humans, rules also take hold early. Experiments show that children, by the age of three, can be taught entirely arbitrary rules for playing a game. Not only that, when a ""puppet"" (controlled by an experimenter) arrives on the scene and begins to violate the rules, children will criticise the puppet, protesting with comments such as ""You are doing that wrong!"" They will even attempt to teach the puppet to do better.   Indeed, despite our protests to the contrary, rules seem hardwired into our DNA. In fact, our species' ability to latch onto, and enforce, arbitrary rules is crucial to our success as a species. If each of us had to justify each rule from scratch (why we drive on the left in some countries, and on the right in others; why we say please and thank you), our minds would grind to a halt. Instead, we are able to learn the hugely complex systems of linguistic and social norms without asking too many questions – we simply absorb ""the way we do things round here"". But we must be careful – for this way tyranny also lies. Humans have a powerful sense of wanting to enforce, sometimes oppressive, patterns of behaviour – correct spelling, no stranded prepositions, no split infinitives, hats off in church, standing for the national anthem – irrespective of their justification. And while the shift from ""this is what we all do"" to ""this is what we all ought to do"" is a well-known ethical fallacy, it is deeply embedded in human psychology.   One danger is that rules can develop their own momentum: people can become so fervent about arbitrary rules of dress, dietary restrictions or the proper treatment of the sacred that they may exact the most extreme punishments to maintain them.   Political ideologues and religious fanatics often mete out such retribution – but so do repressive states, bullying bosses and coercive partners: the rules must be obeyed, just because they are the rules. Not only that, but criticising rules or failing to enforce them (not to draw attention to a person wearing inappropriate dress, for example) becomes a transgression requiring punishment itself.    And then there's ""rule-creep"": rules just keep being added and extended, so that our individual liberty is increasingly curtailed. Planning restrictions, safety regulations and risk assessments can seem to accumulate endlessly and may extend their reach far beyond any initial intention.   Restrictions on renovating ancient buildings can be so stringent that no renovation is feasible and the buildings collapse; environmental assessments for new woodlands can be so severe that tree planting becomes almost impossible; regulations on drug discovery can be so arduous that a potentially valuable medicine is abandoned. The road to hell is not merely paved with good intentions, but edged with rules enforcing those good intentions, whatever the consequences.    Individuals, and societies, face a continual battle over rules – and we must be cautious about their purpose. So, yes, ""standing on the right"" on an escalator may speed up everyone's commute to work – but be careful of conventions that have no obvious benefit to all, and especially those that discriminate, punish and condemn.   Rules, like good policing, rely on our consent. And those that don't have our consent can become the instruments of tyranny. So perhaps the best advice is mostly to follow rules, but always to ask why.   --   This article is part of Life's Big Questions, a new series by The Conversation that is being co-published with BBC Future.

risk appetite,How our tastes change as we age,2024-09-15,2020-04-16,Chermaine Lee,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200414-food-for-the-old-the-chicken-made-from-cauliflower,"As we age our nutritional needs change, but our taste buds and appetites also deaden, limiting what many older people eat. Is it possible to make food better for the elderly? It looked like a golden roasted chicken drumstick. The smell wafting up from the plate in front of a dozen hungry senior citizens was of chicken too. When they dug in with their knives and forks, it even tasted loosely like one. Except that it was not chicken at all. What this group of elderly nursing home residents in Germany were tucking into was puree, printed into the shape of a drumstick. Each “chicken leg” – actually formed from vegetable paste shaped by a 3D printer and given a more pleasurable texture than ordinary puree – was tweaked to match the nutritional needs of the individual elderly diners. The group, who first ate this “not-chicken” meal in taste tests five years ago, were the participants of an innovative food project in Europe, named “Performance”, which explored whether 3D printed food could be delivered to elderly people with problems swallowing food, also known as dysphagia. You might also like: • Why we get nicer as we age • Can AI keep us from getting lonely? • Could carbs help us live longer For many people with chewing and swallowing issues eating a chicken drumstick would normally be difficult. Currently, however, most foods created for elderly people with this problem tend to be unappetising and boring, which can often lead to them not getting the nutrition they need. But a number of research teams are now developing solutions that might allow older people to still enjoy a nutritious, varied and interesting diet in a format which is easy to eat. To create their “chicken” dish, Biozoon, the company leading the 3D-printing project, first mixed fresh broccoli, cauliflower and potato puree with a variety of vitamins, calcium, carbohydrate and protein according to the needs of each diner. This mixture was then put into a 3D food printer, where it was mixed with a gelling agent to help the mixture solidify when printed into any shape they desired. The printed food was then frozen, to be reheated for serving. The project proved to be a success in terms of improving the appetite of those taking part, says Biozoon chief executive Matthias Kück. During the trial participants gained an average of 1.7kg (3.7lb) and over half of the respondents gave thumbs up to the texture of the 3D printed food. Their efforts are more important than you might think. More of us than ever before can expect to live to a ripe old age. By 2050, one in six people in the world will be over age 65, while one in four people living in Europe and Northern America could be aged 65 or over, according to figures released by the United Nations in 2019.  The number of people aged 80 or over is estimated to triple from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050. And there could be as many as 3.7 million people over the age of 100 by 2050. With this “silver tsunami” set to hit nearly every country, creative food solutions are needed to ensure they get the healthy diets they need. Older people tend to experience more issues preventing them from eating the right diet. Dental problems as well as trouble swallowing can make eating difficult, while those with neurodegenerative conditions also struggle to get the right balance of food, according to a 2018 study in Hong Kong. One in three Chinese people aged 60 years and above have chewing difficulties, the study says. In Belgium alone, a study in 2009 found that over 70% of adults aged between 75 and 85 were identified with swallowing difficulties. Ageing also tends to blunt the sense of taste and smell due to a declining number of odour receptors in the nose. These issues in turn have a significant impact on nutritional status.  When coupled with other factors such as lower levels of exercise and the side effects of medication, many older people can suffer from malnutrition or obesity. Food consumption among the elderly can decline by as much as 25% in people aged 70 years and older while the proportion of malnourished adults in nursing homes, for example, can be as high as 60%. “Malnutrition is more frequent in the elderly that do exercise regularly, develop depressive disorders and have poor health,” says Mariane Lutz, a professor of human nutrition at the University of Valparaiso in Chile. Obesity is also becoming more prevalent among the elderly. Almost a fifth of people over the age of 50 in Europe were obese in 2015 while roughly 30% of people over the age of 60 in the US are classified as obese. A major part of the problem is that as we age we tend to change our diet, either through choice or because we are forced to. But the World Health Organization says although changes to the diet can alter the risk of disease through out a person’s life, it has a greater impact in older people. Reductions in saturated fat and salt intake, for example, can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations, as well as the burden of cardiovascular disease. An ideal diet for the elderly should be rich in proteins, vitamins – especially B complex and D which can increase bone and muscle strength – along with minerals, long-chain omega-three fatty acids and fibre, according to Lutz. An adequate supply of calcium can also help preserve bone and muscle mass, while they also require a high amount of energy derived from dietary protein, according to recent research conducted by Lutz. “A diet that includes plenty of plant-based foods – vegetables, legumes, cereals, nuts, seeds and fruits – is also a good source of phytochemicals (compounds that form part of a plant’s chemical defense system) that exert many beneficial effects, avoiding the need to use commercial dietary supplements,” she added. Fish and shellfish products are also highly recommended for better protein intake, Lutz adds. But in a strong body of research on the nutritional needs of the elderly, one European study found that one in five adults and people aged 64 or above don’t get enough vitamin D, folic acid, calcium, selenium and iodine. So, how do you get older people to eat more food that is nutritionally right for them? Serving them the same food you would serve younger adults is not the right approach, says Tanja Sobko, a food scientist at the University of Hong Kong. “The elderly eat much slower and a lot less, so the nutritional value of the food should be much higher,” she says. Pureed food has been a common solution, but the texture and appearance can often be off-putting. Many experts argue how food is represented is also important. Foods that are sticky and adhesive also require more effort for the elderly to eat. Biozoon’s Kück agrees that mashed food is not visually appealing and may play a role in the loss of appetite that many older people experience. In their project at the German nursing home, his team used red colouring to make the 3D printed food more stimulating. The colour of the food can enhance its visual appeal and warm colours work best, says Lutz. “Foods should be appealing in their representation, and a good combination of colours is fundamental,” she says. “Colour is a very important intrinsic sensory cue that drives our sensory and hedonic expectations towards the food to be consumed, by making predictions and judgements about their taste and flavour.” Biozoon are not the only ones to have tested concept of 3D food printing to cater for the old. Sweden’s research institute Rise, based in Gothenburg,  is also testing 3D-printed food in elderly care homes.  The project spans three locations – Halmstad and Helsingborg, and a company that offers catering to hospitals. “In Sweden, we recreate the purees into shape-stable products that can be cut, or picked up by hand, and are smooth and easy enough to swallow,” says Evelina Höglund, the project organiser. “It aims to make the meal looks more appealing and you can eat it with a knife and a fork.” The team use food purees of broccoli, chicken and bread to give a protein boost to their elderly diners. The printed food is then baked in the oven before being served to the participants. “We want the food for dysphagia to look just like normal food, so they know what they are eating,” says Höglund. “Achieving the same goal by hand is too time-consuming in a commercial kitchen. That’s why we want to 3D print it.” In Asia, a university in Singapore has attempted to recreate some of the country’s most popular foods and signature dishes as a sensory solution for older people. The joint project between Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre and SIT-Massey University used 3D printing to create a version of chicken rice for older people that was fortified with calcium, chicken and broccoli puree. The result was a ginger-yellow coloured drumstick, surrounded by white and green puree meticulously printed to resemble rice and broccoli. The team also created 3D printed durians – a large and hugely popular fruit in Asia – with reduced sugar, and a chilli crab dish intended to resemble the original in taste and texture. “We conducted consumer insight gathering in the initial phase of our research, to understand the needs of the silver-agers; specifically, foods that they love but restricted in consumption due to health concerns,” says Evelyn Ong, production innovation manager at Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre. But despite the excitement around projects like those in Germany, Singapore and Sweden, 3D food printing is still relatively early in development and some way from a viable commercial product. Biozoon’s Kück says they encountered difficulties ensuring the printed food had the same quality when using cauliflower puree, as printers perform differently in varying room temperatures, and it took too long to print all the meals. When feeding residents in a large nursing home, that could be a problem. The project has instead led to another company that is focused on 3D printing of chocolates instead. That’s nearly the only area where 3D food printing is finding success, according to Jeffrey Lipton, a mechanical engineer at the University of Washington focusing on soft robotics and 3D printing. The biggest hurdle facing the technology is its ability to produce foods on large scale and at speed. The number of edible materials that can be printed are also limited. “Not every food should or can be put into a 3D fabrication process,” he says. “For that, we need to interface with robotic cooking technology more broadly.” Fortunately there are other ways to improve the food for the senior generation. One study found that it can be as easy as adding monosodium glutamate, a flavour enhancer commonly-used in canned and processed food, to elderly people’s food to increase their salivary flow and improve their appetite. Other artificial flavourings including roast beef, bacon, cheese, fruits are also said to be able to increase the elderly person’s food intake. Manipulating food textures has also been found to be effective in helping the elderly with eating difficulties. Making foods softer, moister and in smaller portions can all help with this. The Irish Agricultural Development Agency, for example, has been experimenting with adding rice protein and lentil flour to beef patties in order to improve their texture. But sometimes simply getting to the food itself can be a challenge for the elderly. Operating a tin opener or twisting open a jar with arthritis, for example, can leave many older people unable to eat a wide range of food. There are attempts, however, to develop innovative food packaging tailor-made for older age groups . These include paper wrappers that can be easily torn but keep the food fresh. Others include orbit lids on jars, which have a separate outer ring that can be loosened more easily than a traditional lid. Vacuum skin packaging technology also allows food to be cooked, transported, reheated and served in one single package. “Food label texts should be reader-friendly, well distinguished from the background and use short texts,” adds Lutz. In Australia, government agencies and non-governmental organisations provide a rating on packaging accessibility, showing how easily products can be opened by older people. Their research showed more than 80% of elderly patients in hospitals in New South Wales experienced difficulties or unable to open food packaging items. Other tricks can also make a difference. In Sweden, some nursing homes bake cinnamon buns before mealtimes so the elderly can connect the smell with positive emotions. “It is a strong tradition in Swedish homes to bake cinnamon rolls – we do this for children and when we sell our houses,” says Sobko. “It brings back the good memories for the old people. It is difficult for them to feel hungry, but the pleasant smell can stimulate it. Coupled with milk, that is their childhood memory.” -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter orInstagram.

risk appetite,Can spices really benefit your health?,2024-09-15,2020-04-07,Jessica Brown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200406-are-there-benefits-to-eating-turmeric-and-other-spices,"Spices have been eaten for millennia. Turmeric and chilli, in particular, have been researched extensively in recent decades. And while consuming them is correlated with some health benefits, those benefits – and the reasons for them – are not what you might think. Spices have been a part of our diets for thousands of years – it’s second nature to sprinkle our chips with pepper, sip on ginger tea and add chillies to our meals. But recently, some spices have been unofficially promoted from everyday culinary staples to all-healing superfoods. Hillary Clinton reportedly ate one chilli pepper a day while on the campaign trail in an attempt to ward off illness. Turmeric, which has been used in Asia for millennia, recently has found its way into coffee shops around the world in the form of “golden lattes” – and, most recently, into viral messages that claim it can “boost your immune system” and protect you from getting sick. Meanwhile, cayenne pepper still hasn’t recovered since the ill-advised “Beyoncé diet” back in 2013, which suggested consuming a concoction of cayenne pepper, maple syrup, lemon and water to lose weight. (Also see our story on whether ""boosting"" your immune system can really protect you). But do spices really add any health benefits to our food, or help us ward off illness? And can any of them actually do us harm?   Hot trend One of the most well known and widely used spices are chilli peppers. Many studies have examined their potential effects on our health – but have found both beneficial and adverse results. Capsaicin is the main active ingredient in chillies. When we eat chillies, capsaicin molecules interact with the temperature receptors in our bodies, sending signals to the brain to create the feeling of heat. You might also like: Some studies point to the idea that capsaicin may help you live longer. In 2019, an Italian study found that people who ate food seasoned with chilli peppers four times a week had a lower risk of death compared to those who never ate chillies. (Researchers controlled for lifestyle factors including smoking, exercise and overall diet quality.) And in 2015, researchers in China, who examined the chilli consumption and health of nearly 500,000 Chinese adults, found that eating chillies was associated with lower risk of death. Those who consumed spicy foods almost every day had a 14% lower risk of death than those who ate spicy foods less than once a week. “The major findings were that higher intake of spicy foods is related to a lower risk of mortality, particularly deaths due to cancer, heart disease, and respiratory diseases,” says researcher Lu Qi, professor of nutrition at Harvard's school of public health. This does not, however, mean that starting to eat large quantities of chilli peppers will protect your health – or protect you from respiratory illness – in the short-term. It’s important to remember that the China study followed people for a median time of seven years each. So even if chillies had a protective effect on participants’ health, rather than the people who ate chillies happening to be healthier to begin with, the effect likely built up over time – not within weeks or months. Qi tried to separate the effects of chilli consumption from everything else by controlling for age, sex, education level, marital status, diet and lifestyle factors including alcohol intake, smoking and physical activity. He says the lower risk of disease relating to eating chillies may be partly due to capsaicin. “Certain ingredients in spicy foods, such as capsaicin, have been found to improve metabolic status, such as lipid profiles” – cholesterol in the blood – “and inflammation, and these may partly account for the observations in our study.” A number of studies also have shown that capsaicin can increase the amount of energy we burn and can decrease our appetites. Zumin Shi, associate professor at Qatar University's human nutrition department, has found that chilli consumption is associated with lower risk of obesity and is beneficial for high blood pressure. So when she studied the effects of chilli pepper consumption on cognitive function, she expected a hat trick.   But when she measured Chinese adults’ cognitive function against their chilli consumption, she found that people who ate more chillies had poorer cognitive function. This effect was strongest with memory: chilli intake above 50g per day was associated with almost double the risk of self-reported poor memory. Still, it’s worth noting that self-reported data is widely considered unreliable. The burning sensation that comes with eating chillies has long fascinated scientists. It also gives us some insight into why chillies may be associated with cognitive decline: the sensation is the result of plants evolving to protect themselves against diseases and pests. “While some plants have evolved to become bitter or spicy to predators, it’s better if the plant can make themselves toxic, too,” says Kirsten Brandt, senior lecturer at the Human Nutrition Research Centre Population Health Sciences Institute at the UK’s Newcastle University. But these compounds generally have a smaller effect on us than on insects. “A little bit of toxin can be good, such as caffeine, which speeds up our metabolism so we feel more awake,” she says. “However, a lot of it is bad for you.” On the other hand, even if a compound within a certain spice may have beneficial effects, we normally don’t consume enough of it to make any difference. Take polyphenols: the compounds found in many plants that have anti-inflammatory effects. Spices’ health benefits are partly attributed to their high levels of these polyphenols. A 2014 review of research, however, says it’s still unclear whether the limited amount of these we get when we consume spices lessens their health benefits. Curcumin “cure” Another popular spice that is widely regarded to have beneficial effects on human health is turmeric. This is widely attributed to curcumin. A small molecule found in turmeric, it is commonly used in alternative medicine to treat inflammation, stress and many other conditions. Robust evidence for turmeric being beneficial, however, is lacking. Numerous studies have found curcumin to have anti-cancer effects in the laboratory. But a lab environment is very different to the human body. And curcumin has poor water solubility, meaning the body can't make proper use of it from the turmeric we consume. In the Western world, this increasing interest in spices including turmeric as an alternative medicine was last seen in the Middle Ages, when spices were thought to have healing properties, says Paul Freedman, professor of history at Yale University. “Spices were used to balance the properties of food. People thought of food as having hot, cold, moist and dry qualities, and they needed balance,” says Freedman. Fish was considered cold and wet, for example, while spices were hot and dry. The idea of using food as medicine, and of balancing out properties like hot and cold or wet and dry, also are main tenets of Ayurvedic medicine, which has been practised in India for thousands of years. In many Western countries, where such ideas are much newer, “this idea of balance is shared with modern new-age medicine,” Freedman says. “Our modern fascination with spices brings us closer to a medieval outlook than 50 years ago – when there was a wall between modern medicine like antibiotics and superstitious medicine of the past that didn’t work.” As part of her job, Kathryn Nelson, research assistant professor at the University of Minnesota's Institute for Therapeutics Discovery and Development, looks at molecules to see if they could be a compound for new drug. She decided to study curcumin after she kept coming across the health claims associated with it. “Researchers are able to exert effects in cells grown in test tubes by adding compounds to it and seeing what happens to the cells,” she says. But she found that curcumin is a “terrible” drug molecule, as it isn’t bio-available – meaning the body can’t make use of it once it’s digested. It isn't easily absorbed by the small intestine, and its structure can be modified when it binds with proteins in the small and large intestines. As a result, it doesn’t actually do much. There could be something about turmeric that’s beneficial, but it’s not curcumin, she says. Plus, if turmeric is cooked as part of a meal, she says, it’s added alongside other foods, and heated up, so its chemical components change. “There might be something else in turmeric worth looking at, but not curcumin, and it might not be one thing. It might need to be chemically modified or added to something to be beneficial.” She says consuming lots of turmeric isn’t harmful, but she wouldn’t advise using it as self-medication. Correlation vs causation Chilli and turmeric have been widely studied, but most trials have only compared data on consumption and different health outcomes, which doesn’t separate cause from effect. And research done in labs doesn’t necessarily translate to the human body. And as is true for so many nutritional studies, it’s difficult to tease out correlation versus causation. Take the 2019 Italian study finding that there was a lower risk of death associated with chilli consumption. It was observational, so it’s impossible to know whether eating chilli made people live longer, whether already healthy people tend to consume more chilli, or if something else is at work. One clue could, however, lie in how chillies are consumed by Italians and other Mediterranean cultures, says the study’s author Marialaura Bonaccio, epidemiologist at Italy's Mediterranean Neurological Institute. “Chilli is common in Mediterranean countries,” says Bonaccio. “It’s mostly eaten with pasta and legumes or vegetables.” This is just one example of how spices could be indirectly beneficial – they’re eaten with legumes and vegetables. Research also has found that adding a spice mix to burgers could potentially lead to fewer free radicals forming in a person’s body than those who ate the burger without spices, and could make the meat less carcinogenic. But these benefits could be explained simply by the preservative qualities of the spices, says Mellor, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Putting spices into meat is a well-known technique to preserve meat,” he says. “The benefits of spices, therefore, may be more food preservation, rather than them having direct benefits to us. But either way, we could benefit as it still makes the food less harmful to us.” Many researchers believe the health benefits of spices actually come from what we eat them with. For example, there's a tendency to use them to replace salt, says Lipi Roy, clinical assistant professor at the NYU Langone Health medical centre in New York. “Spices make food delicious and flavourful, and they can be a healthier alternative to salt,” she says. (Read more about how much salt we really need). We also tend to eat chillies with vegetables – which of course benefits our health, too. So while golden lattes won’t do us any harm, we might be better off having some vegetables seasoned with a sprinkling of spices. And we certainly shouldn’t rely on them as a way to ward off – or to fight – any kind of illness. Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,Switzerland’s secret fourth language,2024-09-15,2018-06-28,Dena Roché,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180627-switzerlands-mysterious-fourth-language,"Despite Romansh being one of Switzerland’s four national languages, less than 0.5% percent of Swiss can speak it. Discurras ti rumantsch? Despite Romansh being one of Switzerland’s four national languages, less than 0.5% percent of Swiss can answer that question – ‘Do you speak Romansh?’ – with a ‘yes’. Romansh is a Romance language indigenous to Switzerland’s largest canton, Graubünden, located in the south-eastern corner of the country. In the last century, the number of Romansh speakers has fallen 50% to a meagre 60,000. Travellers in the canton can still see Romansh on street signs, or hear it in restaurants when they’re greeted with ‘Allegra!’ (Welcome in). But nearly 40% of Romansh speakers have left the area for better job opportunities in places like Zürich and it’s rare that you will see or hear Romansh outside the canton. In such a small country, can a language spoken by just a sliver of the population survive, or is it as doomed as the dinosaur and dodo? You may also be interested in: • The invisible lines through Switzerland • The mysterious origins of Europe’s oldest language • The town that’s losing its language Romansh is believed to have originated around 15BC when the Romans conquered Rhaetia, which is now Graubünden. Romansh is the result of the combination of the Vulgar Latin spoken by soldiers and colonists, and Rhaetian, the language of the native people. This new hybrid language became the primary language of the area until the 15th Century, when the canton first came together in a loose confederation known as the Free State of the Three Leagues. The leagues used German as their primary language, and because local villages were isolated in the mountainous area’s 150 valleys, Romansh fragmented into five somewhat different dialects, each with its own written language. This lack of a uniform standard hindered Romansh’s ability to grow the way German or French did in the country. More and more Germans came to the area, and by the 19th Century, the canton encouraged its Romansh residents to learn German. Today German is the prominent language in Graubünden. You might think that would be the end of Romansh, but the Swiss are proud of their culture and in 1938 more than 90% of the country voted to make Romansh an official national language. The Swiss government spends about 7.6 million CHF annually to promote and preserve Romansh. Because the economics and practicality of having an official language with five idioms was cumbersome, in 1982 an artificial, unified version of Romansh, Rumantsch Grischun, was developed by Heinrich Schmid, a linguist from the University of Zürich, and the Lia Rumantscha, a non-profit organisation dedicated to preserving and promoting Romansh language and culture. Since 1996, the unified Romansh has served as the administrative language, but the people of Graubünden have resisted giving up their own dialects in favour of the common version. “The individual speakers regard unification as a major threat to their own original dialect or idiom,” explained Daniel Telli, head of the Unit Lingua at Lia Rumantscha. “They frequently consider the unified language as artificial, whereas the variety they use is the language of the heart.” Language exists to convey a people’s culture to the next generation, so it makes sense that each area is protective of its unique dialect. When the world loses a language, as it does every two weeks, we collectively lose the knowledge from past generations. “Language is a salient and important expression of cultural identity, and without language you will lose many aspects of the culture,” said Dr Gregory Anderson, Director of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages.  Without the Romansh language, who is to say if customs like Chalandamarz, an ancient festival held each 1 March in the Engadine Valley to celebrate the end of winter and coming of spring, will endure; or if traditional local recipes like capuns – spätzle wrapped in greens – will be forgotten. “Romansh contributes in its own way to a multilingual Switzerland,” Telli said. “And on a different level, the death of a language implies the loss of a unique way to see and describe the world.” But the number of Romansh speakers continues to dwindle as Graubünden residents place a bigger value on more mainstream languages. The five dialects of Romansh The dialects are divided into Rhine (more German influenced), and Engadine (more Italian influenced). Rhine:  Sursilvan: The most common of the dialects is found in the Surselva area of the Vorderrhein Valley. Around 60% of the population considers it their primary language. Sutsilvan: Only a small percentage of the 1,000 people in the Hinterrhein Valley still speak their dialect of Romansh. It is the least spoken dialect. Surmiran: This version is spoken in the Albulatal and Vaz/Obervaz area. Engadine: Puter: Spoken in the Upper Engadine Valley, it is the primary language of 30% of the area’s residents. Vallader: Spoken in the Lower Engadine Valley, it is the second most popular dialect and nearly 80% of the population there considers it their primary language.  However, there is hope on the horizon: in recent years, there has been a slight uptick of interest in Romansh that could help revive the language. Ironically, globalisation might be driving the trend. “Years ago no-one wanted things that were traditionally Swiss, but now people are tired of everything being the same everywhere. It’s seen as hip and cool to go back to your roots and be more local than global,” Gartmann said. “Now people are proud to speak Romansh because it’s different and rare, and anything that is rare and exclusive is interesting today.” There is a Romansh TV and radio station and a Romansh newspaper, all of which use a mix of the unified language and the different dialects; and bookstores like Provini Il Palantin, which carries one of the largest selections of Romansh books in the canton. There is even a hip-hop group who rap in Romansh. “Everyone in the band grew up in Grison [Graubünden],” said Johannes Just, a member of Liricas Analas (Ass Lyrics) “The language in rap is a tool for expression, and if you don’t rap in your mother tongue you’re more absorbed with the usage of that tool than the free expression of thoughts and ideas. It was never the idea to promote the language by our musical work, but if we can do our part [promoting Romansh] it is a welcome effect.” And technology is helping resuscitate fading languages like Romansh. The language lives on websites and blogs; online apps like Memrise help teach the language; online translators like Romansh English Translator APK can aid communication; and social media sites allow Romansh speakers to connect, especially among younger people. Technology behemoth Google launched The Endangered Languages Project, to preserve the world’s most at-risk languages, including Romansh. A line from 19th-Century poem Al pievel romontsch (To the Romansh people) by Giachen Caspar Muoth instructed people to ‘Stand up and defend your ancient language, Romansh!’ What remains to be seen is whether enough canton residents believe that preserving the area’s historic culture and language is a worthy thing to do in the 21st Century.

risk appetite,The rare ingredient healthier than meat,2024-09-15,2019-09-11,Jessica Vincent,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20190910-mexicos-ancient-caviar,"Loosely translating to “seeds of joy”, ahuautle, or water fly eggs, were considered by the Aztecs to be the food of the gods. It was approaching 17:00, but Mexico City’s fierce summer heat wasn’t letting up. By the time I arrived at Ayluardo’s, a family-owned restaurant in the Iztapalapa neighbourhood, beads of sweat had formed along my hairline, and I was starving. I checked the menu – damp and crinkled around the edges – and saw Central Mexico’s usual fare staring back at me: enchiladas drenched in spicy tomato sauce; cheese-stuffed poblano chillies topped with pomegranate seeds; and chargrilled meats served with fresh guacamole and refried beans. It wasn’t until I turned to the back page in search of my favourite agua fresca (water blended with fruit) that I spotted something unusual. Three platillos ancestrales (ancestral plates) lay hidden among the drinks as if cast out from the main menu: sopes del comal con chapulines (toasted grasshoppers served on a thick, doughy tortilla); conejo (rabbit); and tortitas capeadas de ahuautle en salsa verde. I was familiar with the first two; grasshopper snacks and slow-cooked rabbit can be found across the country, particularly in Central and Southern Mexico. But despite having lived in Mexico for six months at the time, I’d never heard of the last one. Intrigued, I asked the waiter what “ahuautle” is. “Insect eggs, señorita,” he replied, explaining that they were mixed into a batter, fried and topped with green salsa. “It’s a very special dish that goes back many, many years. Shall I place the order?”  You may also be interested in: • A sauce made from flying ants • Japan’s mysterious moving meal • The truth about açaí bowls Laid by water flies from the Corixidae and Notonectidae families (though often referred to as “mosquitos” by locals), ahuautle is a delicacy that pre-dates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico. Loosely translating to “seeds of joy” from Nahuatl, the ancient Aztec language, these precious quinoa-sized eggs were considered by the Aztecs to be the food of the gods. Believing the eggs would give them strength, Aztec emperors – including, most famously, Montezuma – were said to have eaten ahuautle every morning during the summer rainy season, when the eggs were in abundance and at their freshest. Mexico City locals will tell you that ahuautle also took centre stage at the human sacrifice ceremonies held in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán (which now forms part of modern-day Mexico City) for Xiuhtecuhtli, the Aztec god of fire, every 52 years (an Aztec century). According to 16th-Century Spanish chronicles, after the victims’ hearts had been removed, the empty chest cavity would be coated in the insect eggs as an offering to Xiuhtecuhtli. The gold-coloured eggs were considered so sacred that the sixth Aztec emperor of Tenochtitlán (the father of Montezuma) was named Axayácatl after the type of water fly that lays them. Axayácatl aren’t the only insects revered by Mexico’s ancient civilisations. According to researcher and insect specialist Julieta Ramos Elorduy B, author of ¿Los insectos se comen? (Can you eat insects?), the Maya referred to grasshoppers as “las divinas flores de dios” (the divine flowers of god), while the Huichol believed wasps carried people’s souls into the afterlife. Among the Teotihuacanos, the Papilio butterfly was a symbol of beauty and youth. It was only when the Spanish conquistadors arrived – repulsed, among other things, at their subjects’ affinity for insects – that Mexico’s love of bugs began to wane. Perhaps noticing my slight hesitation, the waiter quickly asked: “Would you like to see how they’re prepared?” Before I could accept, he signalled me to follow him to the kitchen. I shuffled past a sea of lime-green tablecloths and daffodil-yellow chairs, almost every one of which was taken up by the afternoon rush of Mexican families enjoying feasts of grilled meats, vegetable soups and corn tortillas. Inside the cramped, dimly lit kitchen, I was greeted by head chef and restaurant co-owner, Beatriz Ayluardo. “We don’t get many ahuautle orders these days,” she said, as she showed me a plastic container filled with thousands of sun-dried Axayácatl eggs, each no bigger than a grain of sand. “It’s more expensive than our other dishes, and not many people know about it.” As I looked on, she mixed the ahuautle with milk, eggs, breadcrumbs, finely chopped onion and coriander to make a runny pancake batter, and then dropped tennis ball-sized portions into a pan of sizzling oil. “This recipe was passed down to us from my husband’s mother,” Ayluardo explained, as she flipped the insect-egg pancakes at lightning speed. “She was very passionate and knowledgeable about ancestral ingredients like ahuautle. She would make them at home and tell us stories about how they were once eaten by emperors and gods.” While she prepared a sauce from garlic, tomatillos and serrano chillies to accompany the pancakes, she continued: “When we inherited the family business, we wanted to honour the recipe my mother-in-law had taught us, as well as promote the culinary culture we inherited from [the Aztecs]. But it hasn’t been easy.” Ahuautle cultivators use the same insect-farming techniques as the Aztecs employed on the banks of Lake Texcoco hundreds of years ago before the lake was largely drained and Mexico City was built in its place. Farmers place hand-woven reed nets just under the water’s surface and secure them with sticks and rope. They leave the nets floating for up to three weeks, during which time the Axayácatl flies will lay thousands of their eggs atop the tightly woven reed bundles. To extract the eggs from the lake, cultivators simply lift the nets from the water and lay them out in the sun to dry. Once all the moisture is gone, a sand-like pile of eggs remains. Similar to the harvesting of other edible insects such as grasshoppers, ants and mealworms, ahuautle farming requires far less water, land and energy than the rearing of cattle. Yet the tiny eggs fetch a much higher price. According to Ayluardo, a small jar of ahuautle starts at 400 Mexican pesos, or around £16.50, compared to around 100 Mexican pesos (£4) you’d pay for a kilo of beef. Because of its high cost, ahuautle has been dubbed by local restaurateurs like Ayluardo as “the caviar of Mexico”. But, unlike the famous wild sturgeon roe found in the Caspian and Black seas, ahuautle’s steep price tag isn’t due to its popularity. Rather, it’s because ahuautle is extremely hard to get hold of. Due to a drop in cultivators and vendors, ahuautle has become increasingly rare (particularly out of rainy season), and often has to be ordered weeks in advance. Mexico City’s water shortage means the region’s Axayácatl population is declining, and could disappear altogether. “For the last 20 years, we’ve had a reliable source of ahuautle thanks to a man called Don Manuel Flores, one of the last ahuautle sellers in Mexico City,” Ayluardo said as she plated my pancakes. “He’s in his late 70s and partially blind, but he still made his rounds through Iztapalapa, leaning on his cane, shouting ‘ahuautle!’ every weekend. Like us, he felt passionate about not allowing this ancient caviar to die.” However, Ayluardo told me it’s been several weeks since Don Manuel had last stopped by the restaurant. “He isn’t well,” she said sadly, “and I’m not sure when, or if, he’ll return.” With none of Don Manuel’s children or grandchildren interested in taking up the position, his absence is felt heavily at Ayluardo’s restaurant. “We may be able to find the eggs in the San Juan or La Merced markets during the rainy season,” Ayluardo said, “but it will be even more difficult and expensive to source them. The saddest part is that we may never hear ‘ahuautle’ ring through the streets of Iztalpalapa again, and that’s very worrying for the future of an already forgotten ingredient.” Ahuautle isn't the only insect dish at risk of disappearing. According to Elorduy B, despite Mexico having one of the largest entomophagous cultures in the world (Mexicans consume 531 of the planet’s 2,111 recorded edible insects), the country is losing its appetite for bugs. In her book, Elorduy B warns that this could threaten a culinary culture that has been practiced here for hundreds – perhaps thousands – of years. Not only that, but a rejection of entomophagy also puts further pressure on water- and land-intensive animal agriculture, which, with a world population set to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, may not be sustainable forever. Ayluardo held out the ahuautle pancakes – now lightly browned and bathed in the moss-green sauce – for me to try. I took a bite, first noticing the tangy, spicy hit from the salsa and the slightly gritty texture from the eggs laced through the spongy batter. Then, the distinctive flavour of the ahuautle hit me: a potent, fishy taste similar to that of the tiny dried shrimp popular in East Asian cuisine. It’s certainly an acquired taste, but with a 63.8% protein content (most lean, cooked beef has just 26-27%) and requiring only a fraction of the resources used to cultivate the flame-grilled steak on the neighbouring table, it was a taste I could get behind.

risk appetite,What causes an unhealthy stress diet?,2024-09-15,2020-04-01,Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200331-how-to-eat-a-healthy-diet-when-work-from-home-coronavirus,"Stress eating is a common and understandable response to work-life distress. But for the longer term, it’s useful to develop some alternative strategies for managing emotions. You may have seen a meme going around about “the Covid 19” – a reference to gaining 19 pounds while observing social distancing. These types of jokes can be triggering for people with disordered eating. Yet they also reveal more general anxiety about the coping strategies of people cooped up inside. “A lot of people are struggling with their eating right now – and probably in different ways than they’re used to,” says Las Vegas-based clinical psychologist Cortney Warren. “There is certainly a great deal of research to suggest that when people are in a crisis situation, when they are highly stressed, one of the first things that will change is their eating behaviour.” There are physiological reasons for turning to food when the world has turned upside down. The body tends to crave high-calorie and high-sugar foods during stressful times, as these foods provide short-term bursts of energy. Stress leads to elevated cortisol levels, which can increase appetite. And sugary foods generate dopamine, the neurotransmitter associated with motivation and reward. Like other distracting behaviours, Warren says, disinhibited eating “can activate the pleasure centre of your brain but also can psychologically remove you from the negative emotion that you’re feeling at the time”. Seeking out pleasure via food is a common strategy. Of adults surveyed by the American Psychological Association in 2013, 38% reported that they’d overeaten or eaten unhealthy foods in the past month due to stress. Jim Quick, a management professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, says that (along with badly managed conflict) the main factors in occupational stress are uncertainty and a lack of control – two things which are in high supply right now. Thus, sometimes emotional eating is “the only coping toolkit we have in our bag – especially during times like now”, says Katherine Kimber, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. “It’s okay to give yourself some slack.” Unique stressors It might seem insensitive to talk about stress eating now, with so many people worrying about food and money due to Covid-19’s massive economic disruption. Yet worrying about food can itself transition into emotional eating. Kimber explains that “restriction, whether it be a physical restriction (not physically being able to access food) or an emotional restriction (perceiving foods as bad), can have a backlash effect and increase disordered eating behaviours”. This sense of restriction, if people are experiencing it, will now be interacting with other unique stressors linked to social isolation and sheltering in place. One of these stressors is the loss of routine for the many people whose work and social lives have been overhauled. For instance, an office worker whose weekday is partly structured around a cold meal before commuting, a purchased meal midway through the workday and a hot meal after returning home has lost that familiar way of ordering the day. Having to expend more mental energy on each of these decisions, from the timing to the possible shortages, can lead to higher anxiety. Another stressor at the moment is increased boredom, which is linked with emotional eating. At the same time, people have become untethered from many of their usual coping strategies, such as meeting up with friends and spending time in nature. Caroline Kamau, an organisational psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London, whose research links burnout to binge eating, points to five risk factors that might now make someone especially prone to this common form of disordered eating: 1)      Mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression 2)      Body image issues, including frequent dieting and weight changes pre-pandemic 3)      A highly impulsive personality, which might take the form of excessive gaming, gambling or drug use 4)      Emotional eating, for instance reaching for food when upset 5)      Friends and relatives who have disordered eating “Most people probably binge eat once in a while but wouldn’t be classified as having binge-eating disorder,” Kamau is careful to point out. For instance, it’s common to devour a whole pizza once in a while, and this wouldn’t be concerning. Yet a milder form of this may be becoming more frequent now, even if it doesn’t reach the threshold of a disorder. “When you’re in a situation where you’re highly stressed, you’re more prone to engage in disinhibited eating,” Warren says. While over-eating can feel good in the short term and provide initial comfort, this doesn’t last. That first flush of feeling good is often followed by guilt, which increases distress. Connect with family and friends So how can we maintain a healthy relationship with food at a time when there are limited avenues for fun and higher levels of stress? The US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has a fact sheet on coping with stress during infectious disease outbreaks. Though it was published in 2014, and specifically mentions Ebola, many of the recommendations remain relevant for Covid-19. A key suggestion is finding social connection. In my WhatsApp group of fellow vegans, we’ve been sharing photos of our “corona cupboards” and some of our meals. It’s a way to practise photography and exchange practical tips, but also to continue connecting by means of food – the very thing that brought us together in the first place. It’s a means of making food a more social experience, especially for those of us who live alone or live with non-vegans. Kimber also suggests continuing to celebrate milestones like birthdays with food. This could involve, for example, sharing photos of cake for people who can’t connect in person, cooking the same favourite meal from different corners of the world, or gifting restaurant vouchers to be used in a post-coronavirus world. On a daily basis, Kamau emphasises the importance of structure as a way of boosting wellbeing. “It is important for people to carry on with having aroutine, to try to wake up at set times and go to sleep at certain times,” she says. “People shouldn’t be tempted to sort of have a chaotic lifestyle because of the freedom that working from home comes with.” Routines should incorporate sleep, exercise, socialising, meditation/prayer/therapy (for people who practise them), and of course food. It’s obvious that a healthy diet should include plenty of fruit and vegetables, but there are other rules of thumb for nourishing our psyches. “Evidence suggests that working from home can improve what we call synchronicity in family eating: having mealtimes together,” Kamau says. Having three family meals a day is associated with fewer symptoms of depression – part of a chain effect between disrupted routines and depression. And as a low-fat diet can be associated with a risk of depression, adding in healthy fats may be helpful. This may not be feasible for everyone, including people temporarily separated from their families and those experiencing financial distress. Kimber acknowledges “the huge amount of class privilege that comes with being able to follow specific dietary advice, and even more so during these uncertain times. Some people can’t even eat consistently, because they can’t afford it.” More generally, Warren advises people to lean into their emotions rather than stuffing them down by means of food. Of the Covid-19 world, she says: “This is a ‘crisis situation’ that is unlikely to end soon. We’ve got to develop some longer-term coping strategies for dealing with it.” Manage your triggers One tool could be “worry time”, where you take up to 30 minutes to bring up all the negative emotions you can about the topic that’s worrying you. You allow yourself this period to feel your emotions as intensely as you can – screaming, writing in a diary, calling a friend or doing whatever else is necessary. Afterwards, as Warren describes it, “you just put it to the side until your next scheduled worry time, because you really can’t potentially sustain that amount of fear and pain and negative emotion for a whole day”. This technique won’t work for everyone, but Warren encourages experimentation. Another tool is an exercise Kimber uses with her clients to find alternatives to emotional eating. This involves writing down: The aim is to understand what’s driving your craving for a chocolate bar, for example. It might not be the chocolate itself, but a desire for relaxation or a change. “If you find yourself looking for food when you know you’re not physically hungry, and you know you’re not restricting [food], then this is great information. Your body is asking you for something. So this is a good time to ask yourself, what is that?” Kimber explains. Related to this, it’s important to know our triggers. Mine is reading the news online. Mindlessly chewing and scrolling, I might barely register what I’m eating until the crisp bag is empty. So for people like me, eating a satisfying meal before clicking over to a news site (or simply checking the news less often) might be helpful. Food can be a source of comfort and connection during turbulent times. But your health, and more importantly your relationships, will be stronger if you reach for the phone rather than for a biscuit the next time you’re looking for comfort. And if you know someone who might be struggling with self-judgement over their eating, Warren says, “reaching out while we’re socially distancing, still trying to stay connected to people, will be very beneficial probably to all of us”."
risk appetite,The toxic 'cut-throat' work problem,2024-09-15,2022-05-12,Alex Christian,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220506-the-toxic-cut-throat-culture-that-drives-out-workers,"Many employees thrive in high-pressure work environments. But ruthless cultures can poison the well, eroding wellbeing and ultimately driving out workers. When Anthony was called into a meeting room at work, he expected the worst. Following a market downturn, lay-offs at his Hong Kong firm were imminent; the investment banker was aware his job was at risk. “Cuts were coming, but no one was sure if their job was on the line – it was a secret management kept from us.”  In the company’s cut-throat environment, this kind of secrecy was par for the course. In Anthony’s line of work, firms vied with one another for the highest-paying clients. Rivalry spilled over among internal teams. Employees were made to fight for their futures; every year, the bottom 10% of performers would automatically face the sack.  Finally, Anthony’s boss delivered the news. “We were told everyone in our meeting room would be staying – everyone else on the floor would be fired. Desks were cleared, people were marched out and then placed on gardening leave. I never saw them again.”  For Anthony, this kind of workplace culture meant he had to become ruthless if he wanted to keep his job. “Competition permeated the whole firm,” he adds. “You survive long term if you’re political, prepared to put in insane hours and not make enemies of certain people. It’s a dog-eat-dog world. It breeds chest-beating, Spartan-like behaviour: ‘I work longer hours than you’. You either fight and work harder than the next man, or you’re quickly out the door. It can be absolutely brutal.”  While a degree of healthy competition in a company can be beneficial, a ruthless, cut-throat environment seems to poison workplaces. In fact, an analysis of 1.4 million reviews written by US employees on company-reviews website Glassdoor shows toxic workplace culture was the leading cause of resignations last year. One of the biggest factors in this toxicity was cut-throat culture: hyper-competitive work environments featuring continuous undermining from management and colleagues.  Competition seems to be in the DNA of certain sectors, companies and even employees. Yet it’s clear companies need to do more to draw the line between rivalry that can be motivating, albeit high-pressured, versus toxic – or risk an exodus of unhappy staff.  Defining cut-throat culture  Cut-throat culture has been a fixture of workplaces for decades, particularly in professional services where only certain employees will ever climb to the top of the corporate ladder. Johnny C Taylor Jr, president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), based in Washington, DC, says these kinds of workplace cultures breed internal competition between workers from day one. “In law firms, there are a large number of recruits with only a few ever making that coveted partner status. So, by definition, you have to do better than your colleagues if you want to make it.”  These internal tensions are often further stoked by competition with rival businesses for the highest-paying clients. Taylor says this competitive corporate culture begins at the executive level, and cascades via middle management down to junior-level employees. “Cut-throat is where an organisation over-values competition to the point that their main focus is to beat another company. If you’re in the 100 top law firms, you’re naturally going to fight to remain there when you’re up against tens of thousands competing against you.”  Cut-throat culture is often synonymous with toxic workplaces. The recent analysis of Glassdoor reviews by human capital insights firm CultureX, seen by BBC Worklife, shows mentions of “cut-throat” are often listed alongside problems like being unable to raise issues, speak freely or promote racial equity at work; abusive leadership, favouritism and negative feedback are also frequently cited. Phrases like “Darwinian”, “back-stabbing” and “two-faced” are used to describe cut-throat environments.  According to the research, although mentions of “cut-throat” appeared in just 1% of 1.4 million reviews across 40 industries, use of the term had one of the biggest impacts on a company’s rating. “The most frequent criticism of an organisation will be compensation – but it has a mild effect on an employee’s overall review,” explains Charlie Sull, co-founder of CultureX, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US. “Toxic culture, however, significantly tanks a Glassdoor rating. And ‘cut-throat’ is one of its biggest factors: it’s on the same level as unethical and exclusionary behaviour. It’s a very powerful driver of employee dissatisfaction.”  Glassdoor data shows cut-throat culture appears across a wide variety of sectors, from Big Tech to aerospace and construction. There is also a higher prevalence in media and entertainment, as well industries that have more frontline employees, such as in retail and health. “Cut-throat culture can even exist in non-profits,” says Taylor. “It’s ultimately people-led: if management believes in winning by all means, then it becomes the corporate culture.”   Age, gender and seniority play their part in determining cut-throat work environments. Taylor says firms with this kind of culture often have leadership that skews towards older white men, those who “understand the rules of the game”. Cut-throat firms can also have a lack of diversity at employee-level. Anthony describes his industry dominated by alpha males. “The attitude is to put everyone in the snake pit and see who climbs out,” he adds. “It’s a very aggressive, macho, male-dominated work environment.”  For some, this competitive workplace culture can be an immediate turn-off. Angela says she quit her job at a major consulting firm in New York City after realising climbing the corporate ladder meant playing – and winning – at internal politics. “Everyone was gunning for promotion: it wasn’t the work you were doing, but who you knew that could vouch for you,” she explains. “I didn’t necessarily have those mentors and people vouching for me. As a recent graduate, I’d had a notion of meritocracy in the workplace – it was a big shock to me.”  Can competitive companies change?  While cut-throat culture seems to be a huge indicator of employee dissatisfaction, references to it seem to be declining, according to Glassdoor figures. Sull believes this is due to the rise of remote working; fewer face-to-face interactions have somewhat muted toxicity issues.  “It’s one thing if your boss is mean to you on a virtual call, another if it’s done to your face,” he adds. “Our hypothesis is that cut-throat culture has been hibernating during Covid and hybrid work – it’s become less immediate.” Yet it seems unlikely it’s going away. In a recent survey of more than 16,000 business leaders, across 650 global organisations, seen by BBC Worklife, CultureX found political connections influenced promotions more than collaboration. Respondents were also nearly as likely to say there were factions among their top teams as there was cohesion. It implies that cut-throat culture remains widespread.  “Culture and toxicity are very obdurate forces,” says Sull. “They don’t change much unless they’re pushed very hard, or there’s a sudden shock like a major CEO-led culture change initiative. Even if the company wants to change, and knows how to, it’s a generally slow process that can take years in large organisations.”  Across traditionally high-pressure and competitive industries, such as finance and law, however, there may be little appetite to overhaul the cut-throat environments that turn over huge profits, despite trends in other sectors towards building kinder workplaces. Many of the biggest firms are multinational institutions with decades-old working practices that have become baked in over time. Change, therefore, may be hard to come by.  In these industries, Taylor suggests firms should implement “guardrails” to keep cut-throat culture in check, creating healthier competition. “There should be an agreement that no individual can win at the cost to their colleagues or organisation,” he says. “Management should establish what constitutes ethical or unethical behaviour – guiding principles that articulate a good work culture.”  Without such measures in place, a win-at-all-costs mentality creates the kind of toxic environment that, ultimately, forces employees to quit. Although Anthony still works in finance, he says his cut-throat days are, thankfully, behind him.   “It was always, ‘We’re the best bank because we do the best work, have the best price performance and raise the most money’,” he explains. “I became so wrapped up in the money and lifestyle of it all until I eventually hit a wall. I was a mess, snatching a bit of sleep at my desk at night, pulling all-nighters. I knew I couldn’t do it anymore: I quit.”  Angela’s surname is being withheld for future career considerations; Anthony is using his middle name for job-security reasons "
risk appetite,The stepmother myth that persists today,2024-09-15,2022-11-21,Ali Francis,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221118-the-myth-of-the-evil-stepmother,"Popular culture tells us that stepmothers are mean, neglectful – even deadly. Yet there’s little evidence to support the myth. Why does it prevail? The fictional world is rife with stepmothers who are highly unpleasant – or even murderous monsters. Think Snow White’s envy-ridden stepmother; the witch in Hansel and Gretel, who banishes her stepchildren to the woods. Both belong to a class of evil women with “voracious appetites for human fare, sometimes even for the flesh and blood or for the liver and heart of their own relatives”, wrote Maria Tatar, a professor of literature, folklore and mythology at Harvard University, in The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales. At bare minimum, these villainous characters are painted as cold and unloving. In the 1950 Disney adaption of Cinderella, the vicious Lady Tremaine forces her stepdaughter into back-breaking labour, and encourages her biological children to shun their stepsister. The 1961 film The Parent Trap features two twins, unknowingly separated when their parents divorced; they join forces to overthrow their father’s horrible new fiancée, and reunite their family. And in the comedy-horror Wicked Stepmother, which first showed in 1989, the character played by Bette Davis is not only a stepmother, but also a literal and figurative witch. It’s no coincidence stepmothers today are thought of in a less favourable light than any other family figure. Thanks to more than 900 international stories written about nefarious stepmothers throughout centuries – and the endless stream of on-screen adaptations from filmmakers  – they’re frequently perceived as less affectionate, kind, happy and likeable, and more cruel, unfair and even hateful. The bias against them is woven into our language: ‘step’ evolved from the Old English ‘steop’, which captured a sense of loss and deprivation. Even colloquially, describing something as a metaphoric ‘stepchild’ of something else implies its inferiority.  Though stepfamilies of all kinds certainly face challenges and conflicts that could reinforce some elements of these stereotypes, there’s no real evidence supporting the wicked stepmother caricature. In fact, research shows that stepmothers can be uniquely beneficial to families, serving as the glue that holds members together after a separation, and providing extra support to grieving children.  Why, then, do these harsh perceptions persist? And as stepfamilies become increasingly common across the world, might these tropes one day fade into irrelevance? The emergence of the evil stepmum The stereotype of the wicked stepmother has existed in fairy tales and folklore around the world for millennia – with some stories dating back to Roman times. References can also be found in the Bible: Sarah, the matriarch who birthed Abraham’s son, cast his other children out to die so as not to dilute the inheritance pool. Most of the popular characters that underpin modern film and literature took hold in 1812, however, when German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm first published their collection, Children's and Household Tales, explains Tatar. The authors used fragments of existing oral stories and appropriated others into new narratives, the combination of which chronicled fairy tales such as Hansel and Gretel, Cinderella and Snow White. Though fictional, the focus on stepmothers does reflect some truths about 19th Century society. “When these fairy tales were created, lifespans were extraordinarily low,” says Lawrence Ganong, an emeritus professor of human development at the University of Missouri, US, who has studied stepfamilies for decades. Women often died in childbirth, leaving children in the care of fathers only. The evil stepmothers who appeared in the pages of fairy tales offered cautionary family advice: fathers should protect and support their children, and stepmothers should do the right thing by stepchildren – or bad things will happen. The stories also offered readers safe, therapeutic outlets to process taboo feelings – like maternal rage and resentment, says Tatar. In the 1800s, fathers likely remarried younger women, who could be close in age to their stepdaughters. In those circumstances, all sorts of “strange, intense” feelings might arise – such as rivalry over the father’s attention, intergenerational “beauty contests” like we see in Snow White and “a good deal of struggle, conflict and anger”, says Tatar. In the centuries since the Grimm brothers published their fairy tales, the wicked stepmother was transmuted from stories into real life. Even as divorce, re-marriage and the creation of stepfamilies became more common in the late 20th Century, various psychologists aided in the blurring of fact and fiction. Some believed that humans are biologically programmed to protect genetic children ahead of stepchildren, says Lisa Doodson, a UK-based psychologist specialising in stepfamily dynamics, which likely puts the latter camp at greater risk of mistreatment. In the 1970s, researchers came up with a name for instances of stepparent abuse: the Cinderella Effect. Studies have since uncovered that stepparents do harm children at higher rates per capita than genetic parents, but it’s important to note that virtually all instances of violence involve stepfathers – not stepmothers. Other studies have – perhaps unintentionally – also helped to perpetuate the myths. Research from the 1980s showed that stepmothers report feeling closer to their biological children than to stepchildren, even when both share a biological father. And those who have had children of their own also report feeling less satisfied with their role as a stepmother. None of this means stepmothers are cruel, however. Yet empirical evidence wasn’t necessary for stereotypes about awful, neglectful stepmothers to live on. They continued to thrive for the same reasons they did centuries ago, says Ganong; culturally dominant ideals surrounding the all-important nuclear family and the sacred biological parent-child relationship. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, riffs of Disney classics – such as the 1997 film Snow White: A Tale of Terror and the 1998 film Ever After, which is based on Cinderella – continued to damn the stepfamily. The idea, it seemed, was firmly stuck in the public psyche: stepmothers were negligent, second-rate caretakers at best – and heinous killers at worst. ‘Wicked stepmothers don’t show up in the data’ Despite the strength of these tropes, however, there’s little evidence proving stepmothers behave like the heartless caricatures of popular culture – and plenty showing that they don’t. “The majority of stepmothers get along well with their stepchildren,” says Ganong, who has read nearly 3,000 research reports on the topic, and talked to more stepfamily members than he can count. “Wicked stepmothers don’t show up in the data,” agrees Todd Jensen, a research assistant professor at the University of North Carolina, US, who studies relational patterns between stepparents and their stepchildren. In a 2021 survey of 295 stepchildren, Jensen found most had positive relationships with their stepmothers. Participants were asked about how close they felt to their stepmother, how much they thought their stepmother cared about them, whether she was warm and loving and how satisfied they were with communication and the relationship overall. In this sample, the average score for stepmother-youth relationship quality was 3.91 out of 5. These kinds of positive stepmother relationships can be hugely beneficial for a child. Compared to more negative relationships, Jensen found they’re associated with lower levels of a child’s psychological distress, anxiety, depression and loneliness caused by the stepfamily formation – along with better social and academic outcomes. Stepmothers can really “make a unique contribution to the wellbeing of a child”, he says. Family Tree This story is part of BBC's Family Tree series, which examines the issues and opportunities parents, children and families face today – and how they'll shape the world tomorrow. Coverage continues on BBC Future. That’s especially true after a divorce, says Cara Zaharychuk, a Canadian counsellor who’s studied the role stepmothers play in a separation. By spending quality time with children after a divorce, Zaharychuk found that stepmothers can help them feel part of a family again. They “can also be an incredible support for young children who have suffered a bereavement”, says Doodson. Research has also tied growing up with multiple adult relationships to various positive outcomes. One study of almost 1,000 ninth graders in the US showed that having good role models separate from biological parents built emotional resilience, boosted academic performance and neutralised the impacts of negative family dynamics. Stepmothers can offer the same sense of additional support for kids. “Having extra people who love and care for you is always positive,” says Doodson.  That doesn’t mean stepfamilies don’t face unique challenges — some of which can set the stage for those negative caricatures to percolate. “Although immensely exaggerated, these stereotypes do speak to some of the common tensions that stepfamilies need to grapple with,” says Jensen. The main one: where do we put our time and energy? What many of the early fairy tales accentuated was a sort of battle for resources and attention between a stepmother and her stepchildren. Those are “very real challenges” that can result in feelings of jealousy, says Jensen. In the Grimms’ era, most stepfamilies were formed after the death of a biological mother. These days, it’s more likely that a new stepparent enters the family after a divorce, says Jensen. With a mother still in the picture, a child might find themselves in a “loyalty bind”. They don’t want their biological parent “to feel replaced”, so they may resist connecting with their stepmother under actual or perceived instruction from their mother, says Jensen. This dynamic can be exacerbated if there’s conflict between the biological parents. It's not only the children who may have trouble adjusting to their new family situation. Life can also be hard for stepmothers, who are constantly living in fear of being branded wicked or evil. One 2018 survey of 134 stepmothers living in New Zealand showed 22% actively altered their behaviour so as not to be thought of negatively. This can have myriad consequences. “Stepmothers try too hard to become a super stepmom,” says Doodson – which is unsustainable, and might be off-putting for kids who resent being overly parented by a new adult figure. Ultimately, research shows that stepmothers aren’t villainous, as books and films might have us believe. Though their perceived role in a family depends on many factors – such as the intimate culture they’re entering, the attitudes of an existing biological mother and what stepchildren might want or need in terms of care and supervision – existing data suggests they mostly have a positive impact on families.  “Stepfamily living is challenging, but many individuals do well in stepparent roles,” says Ganong. “It is too bad that they also have to manage these persistent myths about them.”  Signs of disruption? Today, it seems that stepmothers still face somewhat dubious perceptions rooted in long-standing stereotypes.   Ganong often conducts a word association exercise with his college students. The term stepmother conjures adjectives such as “evil, or wicked or mean or uncaring”. Many stepmothers Ganong has spoken to during his decades of research are also reluctant to accept the label because of the stories they grew up with. “To me, that's an indication that the stereotype still exists and is potentially harmful,” he says. But the fact that stepfamilies are becoming more common may also be moving the needle. In the US, high divorce rates mean about 40% of people had at least one step relationship as of 2011. That same year in the UK, 10% of dependent children lived in a stepfamily – though Doodson suspects that’s a major underestimate. Canadian census data from 2016 paints a similar picture (though estimates don’t count children older than 14). As stepfamilies increasingly proliferate, there are signs negative stereotypes around stepmothers are being disrupted.  “I think there's no question that real tangible stigma about stepfamilies has been decreasing, in large part because they are so common,” says Jensen. “If you told someone that you had a stepparent or you yourself were a stepparent, it’s going to be far less likely that someone will be shocked or take issue with that.” Modern media also tells more varied tales of stepmothers now, from the nuanced 1998 film Stepmom; to the relaxed, happy relationship Gloria has with her two similarly aged stepchildren in the television series Modern Family; and the affectionate support a pregnant Juno receives from her stepmother in the eponymous 2007 film. Even Disney may one day get up to speed; it is increasingly featuring diverse, positive female relationships – think sisterly bonds in Frozen or the loving grandmother in Moana. And in 2020, a change.org petition lobbied Disney to finally feature a benevolent stepmother.  Going forward, Tatar hopes we can continue to rewrite the stepmother script in a way that reflects the realities of society today. She’s all for preserving historical accounts, but doesn’t think we should be reinforcing potentially harmful tropes. “The tale has evolved,” she says. “We should recognise that, because folklore is ours to recreate.”"
risk appetite,Eurostar secures £250m rescue package,2024-09-15,2021-05-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57157376,"Eurostar has managed to secure a £250m rescue package from banks and investors as it continues to battle a severe drop in demand due to the Covid-19 crisis. The funding will help keep it afloat in the medium term, a spokesperson said. The rail operator had warned in November that it was ""fighting for survival"", with its services scaled back dramatically amid the pandemic. Eurostar plans to gradually run more trains should coronavirus restrictions ease as hoped. It is currently only running one train per day between London St Pancras and Paris Gare du Nord, and one a day between Amsterdam and Brussels. The £250m in funding consists of £50m equity from shareholders, £150m in new loans from banks that are guaranteed by shareholders, and £50m from restructured existing bank loans. Eurostar chief executive Jacques Damas said the funding ""will allow us to continue to provide this important service for passengers"". ""The refinancing agreement is the key factor enabling us to increase our services as the situation with the pandemic starts to improve."" Mr Damas added that the coordinated action of governments in the UK and the EU was ""crucial to the restoring of demand and the financial recovery of our business"". The operator said that over the past year it ""has experienced a more severe decline in demand resulting from the global Covid-19 pandemic than any other European train operator or competitor airline."" Eurostar warned in November that it was ""fighting for its survival against a 95% drop in demand"". It called for more support from the UK government after airports were given up to £8m in grants equivalent to business rates. In January, it again called for UK government help, warning that there was ""a real risk"" to its survival. But in February, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that while the government was ""very keen for Eurostar to survive"", he said ""it's not our company"" and its difficulties were ""the shareholders' problem to resolve"". The UK government sold its stake in Eurostar in 2015. Eurostar's majority shareholder is the French state railway group SNCF. Other shareholders include pension funds Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (""CDPQ"") and Federated Hermes, and SNCB, the Belgian state train operator. Eurostar said that it would focus on restoring services on its core routes between London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and that it would maintain ""rigorous cost control"" to repay loans. It said there was a ""growing appetite"" for high-speed rail travel from passengers in light of increasing awareness of climate change and the impact of air travel on the environment. From 27 May, Eurostar will start running two daily return services on the London to Paris route, and three per day from the end of June ""with a view to gradually increasing the frequency over the summer period as travel restrictions are eased"". At present, travellers from the UK must have an ""essential reason"" for visiting France, and need to take Covid tests and self isolate for seven days on arrival. France is currently on the UK government's ""amber list"" for travel, meaning people from the UK need to quarantine for 10 days on their return."

More than 41,000 people have been infected in the first six months of 2018, leading to 37 deaths.  Last year there were 23,927 cases and the year before 5,273. Experts blame this surge in infections on a drop in the number of people being vaccinated.   In England, there have been 807 cases so far this year. The WHO is calling on European countries to take action.    Public Health England say the outbreaks in England are largely due to people who have travelled to areas of mainland Europe that have had outbreaks.  Measles is highly infectious and spreads by droplets in coughs and sneezes. The infection lasts seven to 10 days. But while most people recover completely, it can cause some serious complications, including: The MMR vaccine can prevent infection but discredited research 20 years ago that erroneously linked MMR to autism has stopped some people from trusting the vaccine.  The NHS recommends all children receive the MMR around their first birthday and then just before starting school. Ukraine and Serbia are among the countries with the highest rates in Europe.  Dr Nedret Emiroglu, from the WHO, said: ""This partial setback demonstrates that every under-immunised person remains vulnerable no matter where they live and every country must keep pushing to increase coverage and close immunity gaps."" Italy's upper house of parliament recently voted through legislation to abolish the law that makes vaccination mandatory for children before they start school. The amendment will mean parents of unvaccinated children will no longer face fines.  Find more NHS information on measles here. In England, there have been 807 laboratory confirmed measles cases, according to Public Health England (PHE). The highest numbers have been seen in: Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""We have seen a number of measles outbreaks in England which are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe.  ""The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children.  ""Anyone who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had two doses should contact their GP practice to catch up.  ""We would encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks, heading to large gatherings such as festivals, or before starting university.""  Dr Pauline Paterson from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""With a vaccine preventable disease, one case is one too many, and the numbers of measles cases so far this year is astounding."""
risk appetite,Response to fatal TB outbreak inadequate - report,2024-09-15,2023-01-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-64413555,"The management of a tuberculosis outbreak that lasted more than a decade was ""inadequate"", a report has found. The report was commissioned due to how long the outbreak in Llwynhendy, Carmarthenshire, lasted and how many people were affected. It gives a number of recommendations, including that any future outbreaks should be overseen by Public Health Wales from the outset. Hywel Dda health board said it accepted the recommendations of the review. The report, chaired by Prof Mike Morgan, ex-national clinical director for respiratory disease for NHS England, identified four phases of the outbreak between 2010 and 2022. The outbreak started when a 71-year-old woman who worked at a pub in Llwynhendy contracted the disease.  She was first identified in 2010 but had been highly infectious for a prolonged period due to a delay in her diagnosis, according to the report, jointly commissioned by Hywel Dda health board and Public Health Wales (PHW). During the outbreak, one woman died in 2018, but the report found it was not until 2019 that the outbreak was ""formally discussed at board level"" between Hywel Dda and PHW. The initial approach was ""too casual"", the report says, and public health professionals did not initially think the outbreak was ""likely to become as serious as it did"".  The report also found failings linked to contact tracing, which focused on the family rather than other customers at the pub.  It said that ""as a result, infected people were unrecognised and developed active disease, passing the infection on to others"". Staff shortages within local services was another reason why the initial response was inadequate, and there was not a lead clinician in place to oversee the response. There was no formal or co-ordinated clinical TB service in Hywel Dda at the beginning of the outbreak, and it was not until 2014 that Dr Llywellyn Jones was appointed lead clinician overseeing the response to the outbreaks.  Since the appointment of Dr Llewellyn Jones, the report said ""there had been a significant improvement in the care of patients with TB and their contacts"". But the report's authors warn the initial outbreak ""continues to cause concern now"" and may become the ""source of future outbreaks"". Cases linked to the outbreak continue to be identified over a decade later and it is estimated that there has been at least 31 cases of active TB and more than 300 cases of latent TB linked with the first outbreak in 2010. Prof Philip Kloer, medical director and deputy chief executive for Hywel Dda health board, said: ""We recognise the impact this outbreak has had on the Llwynhendy community and on behalf of Hywel Dda University Health Board, I offer my sympathies to all who have been affected.  ""Hywel Dda University Health Board fully accepts the recommendations of the review and is committed to delivering on our action plan to develop our local TB service for both this ongoing outbreak and any future outbreaks."" PHW also accepted the recommendations of the report and admitted the initial response was ""not satisfactory"". Both PHW and Hywel Dda said improvements had already been made, and a ""full action plan"" had been published to implement the report's recommendations. Public Health Wales has listed the following as the main symptoms"

The Food Standards Agency said the Sea Salt and Vinegar Veg Crunchers also posed a ""health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to milk"". The affected batches have best before dates of 20 June, 28 June and 2 July 2019, the FSA added. Graze apologised for the ""incorrect vegan claim"" and told customers with allergies not to eat the product.  ""The health and safety of our customers is of the utmost importance to us"", the company said, adding that no other products had been affected. In February, the London-based brand - which started out a decade ago as a snack box delivery service - was purchased by the conglomerate Unilever in a deal believed to be worth around £100m. Graze products are sold in shops such as Sainsbury's, Boots, WH Smith and Tesco, as well as online and direct to consumers. The BBC contacted Unilever for comment but is yet to receive a response. Late last year, the FSA said undeclared allergens were found in a quarter of food samples from UK businesses - with 673 out of 2,862 tests since 2016 described as ""unsatisfactory"". And, earlier this year, stronger food labelling laws were proposed to prevent the deaths of people with allergies. It came after the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, of Fulham, west London, who suffered an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette in 2016. The inquest into Natasha's death heard the teenager was ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging when she bought the sandwich at Heathrow Airport. But the baguette contained sesame seeds, which caused her to go into cardiac arrest on a flight. The sandwich chain later said a second customer was believed to have died from an allergic reaction to a product containing a non-dairy yoghurt. The person died in 2017 after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"" which was supposed to be dairy-free. Pret said it was mis-sold a guaranteed dairy-free yoghurt, as it contained dairy protein. But the company who sold Pret the yoghurt denied that it was to blame and said the ""true cause"" is unknown."
risk appetite,'Devastated' by European exit but where now for Arsenal?,2024-09-15,2021-05-06,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57017649,"Arsenal hit the post twice on Thursday but were unable to find the goal they needed to reach the final ""We are devastated"". Mikel Arteta is not a man for big displays of emotion, but you could tell that this one hurt. Arsenal's failure to score against Villarreal at Emirates Stadium on Thursday - and the Europa League exit that resulted - has repercussions. Sat ninth in the Premier League, the Gunners' season is now effectively over with little to show for it, and their proud record of having competed in continental competition for the past 25 seasons is likely to end. There will be question marks over the future of many players, the manager's position and - judging by the fan protests that were once again staged outside the ground prior to kick-off - no end to the pressure on the club's owners. Here, BBC Sport gathers reaction from the manager, players, pundits and more to gauge the mood after a disastrous night for Arsenal and asks where the club goes from here. Thursday's Europa League semi-finals as they happened Arsenal's Europa League hopes ended by Villarreal Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast ""We tried everything until the last minute,"" Arteta told BT Sport in his post-match interview. ""We have to congratulate Villarreal. I think we deserved to win the game but the details define these ties. We had three big chances, they didn't have anything but they are through. ""We are devastated. Really disappointed."" Arsenal did indeed hit the post twice through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while Emile Smith Rowe and Nicolas Pepe curled shots wide, but such moments were too few in a display that was strangely passive for long periods. Arteta felt there were mitigating circumstances, not least of all a lack of match fitness in key players, including Aubameyang following his bout of Malaria and Kieran Tierney, who replaced Granit Xhaka at left-back after he was injured in the warm-up. Arteta, who admitted everybody's job is now under scrutiny, said: ""It's various things. The way we started in Villarreal wasn't good enough. We didn't arrive here in the best moment with everyone in their best condition. For 90% of them it was their first semi-final and we have to learn."" Goalkeeper Bernd Leno agreed that a weak first-leg display and poor finishing on home soil cost the Gunners. ""It's very hard for all of us,"" the German told BT Sport. ""Also for the fans. We are all sad. Hopefully we can make next season better than this season but this season isn't over and in our final four games we must fight for this club and show that we love this club."" The pundits were less forgiving. ""Over the two legs Arsenal have not done enough,"" the club's former defender Lee Dixon told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Arsenal have given up on these two games too easily. There has not been enough.  ""You are hoping as Arsenal fans things would change but in the back of the mind you don't trust this team. They have outdone themselves, they have gone out with a whimper. ""I hope they're in that changing room hurting, but I'm not sure if they are."" Another ex-Arsenal defender, Matthew Upson, was equally damning: ""We can talk about being Mikel Arteta being outsmarted by Unai Emery but I don't think Villarreal had to do a lot and this is the problem. ""The manager has a good idea of how he wants to coach and how he wants to play but none of that matters if you don't have the application, the characters, the commitment and responsibility on the pitch."" There were high hopes when Arteta's side beat Liverpool in August's Community Shield, after winning last season's FA Cup, but what has followed this season has been a model of inconsistency. Since taking over as boss, the 39-year-old has won 43 of his 82 matches in charge, but it is the 13 defeats he has suffered in the league this campaign that are taking centre stage, leaving the club at risk of their lowest Premier League finish since 1994-95. This will be their fifth season finishing outside the top four. The fans' frustration has been exacerbated by the actions of owner Stan Kroenke, especially his eagerness to sign the club up to the proposed European Super League, prompting protests. Dixon's former team-mate Martin Keown zeroed in on Arteta and the club hierarchy, suggesting that big changes are needed before the club can even think of challenging again. ""There is a crossroads,"" he told BT Sport. ""It is a real fall from grace. Will it mean new owners, a new manager? ""The manager comes under enormous pressure. Look at the wisdom of a young manager taking a massive job. His inexperience has cost him.  ""It seemed to me this was the rescue package but it didn't arrive. Is there an appetite to keep him? He is very much the owner's man, but he is going to be under huge pressure.  ""I don't know if it changes Kroenke, does this club really matter to him? Does he love football enough? We need someone who wants this club and loves this club.  ""It is going to take big investment and if he doesn't want it, step aside for someone who does."" Eric Yung: All this chat about Arteta out & Kroenke out (all valid) but be realistic - both won't happen this summer, nor, will we have a sizeable summer transfer budget. The board, Arteta, Edu owe it to the fans for assurances on next steps.  Act like a big club, show leadership. Olivier Garnier: Yet another [piece of] evidence Arteta is too inexperienced. All season he has kept making wrong choices (starters and substitutions). Lacklustre football and poor results. Strong decision needed not to waste another year in reconstruction. M: We used to be contenders for the league season after season. We used to be regulars at the UCL knockout round. People at the club (owners, manager, players) should be ashamed of how they have turned our club into a joke.  Wardy: Arsenal finished on a high last year beating Man City, Liverpool and winning the FA Cup. Where's all that optimism a year on? We're a shadow of the team we were a year ago. Arteta's doing. Arteta's team. Arteta must go. American Gooner: I have been a tolerant Arsenal fan for 15 years. But I am now losing patience. We have no ambition, no style, no identity, no pride. It's our past that still allows us to feel like a big club but in all fairness we have been a mid-table club now for 10 years. Peter in Oxford: Arsenal fan very torn here - on the one hand we were pathetic and deserved nothing and on that Arteta should go. On the other hand surely you give him a proper transfer window and pre-season given how the last one was with Covid and at least see if things look to be on the turn at the beginning of next season. Adam in Oxford: Arteta has to go, 0-0 should never be an acceptable scoreline in a must-win European semi-final where Arsenal only had to score. At least lose having committed all 11 players forward chasing it. Arteta has transformed Arsenal, for the worst. John G: Now is not the time for knee-jerk reactions. Getting rid of Mikel solves nothing. There needs to be change. Kroenke must go otherwise our downwards trajectory continues. My only solace is at least we are not now going to be battered by United in the final. Mark, Swindon: It's looking like the shortcomings in Arsenal's squad are going to cost them dearly.

risk appetite,How the grilled cheese sandwich went gourmet,2024-09-15,2017-12-01,By David Silverberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42164538,"For some people cheese can seem as addictive as chocolate, especially when it's melted. To meet these cravings for all things cheddar, brie and parmesan, a slew of restaurants have popped up recently that focus specifically on selling cheese-based dishes. But is it wise to run a company that relies so heavily on one type of food? And isn't all this cheese-eating bad for our health? When Nate Pollak decided to set up a business specialising in ""gourmet"" grilled cheese sandwiches, some people thought he was crazy.  The 34-year launched the Great American Grilled Cheese Kitchen with his partner, Heidi, at the height of the US recession in 2010.  Both had lost their office jobs and, in what many would consider a risky move, chose to put their life savings into the venture.  But seven years on the decision is paying off.  The pair have opened two outlets in San Francisco, and sales are increasing 7% every year at their flagship outlet, and 35% at the newer site. They serve around 16 varieties of grilled cheese sandwich, ranging from the classic recipe to ones with fancy cheeses and experimental fillings, such as hickory-smoked turkey, apricot-jalapeno relish and lavender-basil pesto.  Mr Pollak now plans to franchise his brand across the US. But isn't he worried that his somewhat limited product range might one day go out of fashion? ""The grilled cheese sandwich is timeless comfort food,"" he says confidently. ""It elicits memories of your childhood, and all that cheese is so deliciously gooey. ""I can still remember making my first when I was three, using the toaster oven in my house."" The Grilled Cheese Kitchen is one of growing crop of businesses to have emerged in recent years, catering for our love for all things melted cheese. While the best known specialise in toasted sandwiches, others offer macaroni and cheese, Canadian poutine, or fondue, with all tending to put their own spin on these classic dishes.   It's all part of the ""fast casual"" dining trend that has swept the world in recent years, says Josh Benn, global head of food and retail at Duff & Phelps, a corporate-finance consultancy,  This sees fast food dishes being made with higher quality ingredients and served in trendier venues targeting millennial consumers, he says. ""Most types of fast food have been given a fast casual touch and we've seen billion dollar brands spring up, such as Shake Shack for burgers and Chipotle for burritos,"" says Mr Benn.   ""Now we're seeing businesses focused on grilled cheese dishes expanding, and it's become a fashionable food trend in the US and beyond.""  A British firm embracing the trend is the Mac Factory, which specialises in macaroni and cheese, or ""mac n cheese"", the classic baked dish of cooked macaroni pasta in a cheese sauce. The London-based chain serves its own fresh takes on dish, adding chorizo sausage or caramelised onions for example.  Since it launched in 2014 the business has opened three outlets to meet demand, says owner Graham Bradbury.  ""Cheese is coming back into fashion. Everything is melted-cheese this or melted-cheese that. Lots of companies are starting up and it does feel quite competitive."" Mr Bradbury recognises a hot food trend when he sees one. According to research firm Horizons, macaroni and cheese was five and a half times more likely to appear on restaurant menus in the 12 months to February 2016 than in 2010. More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: Some of the cheese dishes in the spotlight have roots that go way back - and perhaps worryingly for those serving them, they have tended to go in and out of fashion over the years.  Take the Swiss dish fondue, a shared pot of melted cheese into which groups of diners dip vegetables, charcuterie and bread. It is thought to have first been made in 1699, and saw spells of popularity in the 20th century, including in the US in the 1960s where it was enjoyed at parties.  But it fell out of favour in the 1980s when it was deemed passé and health-conscious consumers began to shun calorific dishes. Recently though retailers have been offering cook-at-home fondue sets, newspapers have been publishing recipes, and more restaurants are offering the gooey dish. London's St Moritz, which has served fondue since 1974, claims to sell up to 20,000 servings of fondue every year.  Boss Armin Loetscherm doesn't seem concerned that it might fall out of fashion again.  ""I think it will always have fans because of its communal aspect, as people are sharing and interacting with each other all the time.""  It's a similar story with poutine, a French-Canadian dish invented in 1957, traditionally comprising French fries and fresh cheese curds, covered with gravy.  It was typically only found in Canada, where it is a national dish, but today restaurants from New York to London, and Paris to Melbourne serve it as well. While loved by fans, however, some varieties of poutine can contain as many as 1,500 calories - just 500 short of the recommended daily intake for the average adult female. And other cheese-focused dishes can be similarly unhealthy.   ""The fact that cheese is culturally part of the Western and European diet doesn't make it a healthy food,"" says Dr Neal Barnard, author of The Cheese Trap, a book highly critical of the food stuff. ""It's a leading source of saturated fats, and is associated with a higher risk of getting heart disease and even Alzheimer's."" He also points out that cheese can be addictive, thanks to its high concentration of casein, a protein that can ignite your brain's opioid receptors.  ""And when it's melted, cheese has a smell that can be even more tempting,"" says Dr Barnard. Mr Benn believes we could see a backlash against cheese dishes as younger people once again embrace healthier diets and clean eating.  More worrying, he feels, is the tendency for companies in this space to focus only on one type of specialist dish.  ""When you launch a one-menu item business, you have to be aware of cyclical trends,"" Mr Benn says. ""Some items can be streaky, like the lobster roll, or follow seasonal patterns."" For now, it doesn't look like the appetite for cheese is waning. Britons eat around 27 grams of cheese per person per day, and other European countries often consume twice that amount. Americans are big fans too.  For this reason, Mr Pollak believes businesses like the Great American Grilled Cheese Kitchen will keep growing. He points to the success of sandwich chains such as Tom + Chee and the Melt Shop which now span the US. ""I strongly believe that a grilled cheese concept could be as big as a Chipotle [which has more than 2,000 branches globally],"" he says.  ""The grilled cheese sandwich has withstood the test of time, and grilled cheese concepts that have launched over the past 5-10 years are living proof of the concept's longevity."""
risk appetite,Consistent Gordon a strong midfield option,2024-09-15,2023-12-08,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67619855,"Last week Bryan Mbeumo was the hottest ticket in town, now we're all looking to remove him from our FPL squads with the news that he's going to be out of action for a few weeks after picking up an ankle injury against Brighton on Wednesday night. There's no point in holding on to him, particularly as Brentford don't have a fixture in gameweek 18. The good news is we're not short of options in midfield at Mbeumo's price of £7m and below so take your pick from Anthony Gordon, Cole Palmer, Raheem Sterling, Hwang Hee-Chan, Mohammed Kudus or any of Aston Villa's fine selection of Douglas Luiz, John McGinn, Moussa Diaby or the man-in-form Leon Bailey. Villa have another tough fixture at home to Arsenal this weekend but crucially they're also at home to Sheffield United in gameweek 18 when Manchester City and Brentford are both blank. My favourite picks are Gordon and Palmer as long-term signings who are continuing to deliver consistently and just remember if you go for Hwang then have a plan to sell him when the Asian Cup comes around in January. It's also worth considering Dejan Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson in this price bracket because Tottenham will keep scoring goals whoever they play against as Chris Sutton has been telling us since the start of the season on the Fantasy 606 podcast. The other opportunity to point you towards this week, if you haven't already taken it, is Newcastle's Martin Dubravka. He costs just £4m and will replace Nick Pope in one of the strongest defences in the Premier League as the England keeper sadly faces a long spell on the sidelines with his shoulder injury. Fantasy 606: Chelsea choices and chip strategy Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah both play in away fixtures this weekend, Haaland at Luton and Salah at Crystal Palace, and if you're choosing between the two then I'd go for Haaland even though Luton proved once again this week that no team is going to get an easy ride at Kenilworth Road. If you want to do something a little bit different then I'd suggest Kaoru Mitoma or Evan Ferguson for Brighton's home game against Burnley, or Hwang Hee-Chan if you feel that Wolves will continue to pile on the pain for Nottingham Forest. It's worth considering Son Heung-Min at home to Newcastle too, with the visitors' squad severely stretched and a vital Champions League game on the way against AC Milan next week. I was really impressed with Fulham when I commentated on them in their 4-3 defeat by Liverpool last weekend and they now face West Ham, Burnley and Bournemouth in three of their next four games. Alex Iwobi and Raul Jimenez both helped themselves to two goals apiece in the 5-0 thrashing of Nottingham Forest on Wednesday but Andreas Pereira out-scored them both with his three assists and three bonus points.  All three will cost you just over £5m but defender Antonee Robinson comes in at the slightly lower price of £4.4m. He really caught the eye in the game at Anfield and has provided three assists in his last four games. I also think it's time to buy into the Chelsea defence for a run of games against Everton, Sheffield United, Wolves, Crystal Palace and Luton before the end of the year. I would probably go for Levi Colwill at £4.5m who was made captain for their game at Old Trafford on Wednesday night. Thiago Silva is probably the safest pick in terms of consistent selection but he will be due a rest at some point and Reece James is definitely the one with the highest points-scoring potential, but he's still easing his way back in after injury. Bournemouth are one of the form teams in the Premier League right now with three wins in their past four games but sadly Statman Dave's man Dominic Solanke has now climbed over the differential threshold of 5% ownership. Never fear - Dave was telling us in this week's Fantasy 606 podcast that Bournemouth's defensive numbers are showing good signs too and suggested Illia Zabarnyi as the man to go for at £4.4m. Antoine Semenyo is worth a look as well, he costs just £4.6m as a forward in FPL, but just be aware that he hasn't made it past the 70-minute mark in any of the past three games. Bournemouth go to Old Trafford on Saturday to face Manchester United and then follow that with games against Luton, Nottingham Forest and Fulham.  I reckon an Evan Ferguson captaincy at home to Burnley is the way to go if you have an appetite for risk. I don't so I'm going for Erling Haaland at Luton.

risk appetite,Will China soon lead in fashion?,2024-09-15,2014-10-21,Harriet Quick,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140131-will-china-soon-lead-in-fashion,"Chinese consumers are turning away from ostentatious displays of wealth and discovering a new, more understated sense of luxury, reports Harriet Quick. For the last ten years or more, the world’s luxury businesses have been buoyed up on what seemed an insatiable appetite for new, status goods in China. But a soberer and subtler taste in fashion and luxury goods is emerging as the country’s economic boom slows. President Jin Ping has instilled anti-bribery measures that curb the habit of ‘gifting,’ a practice worth millions of dollars in sales each year. Self-styling is replacing ensembles straight from the look book. More discreet logos and designs from Saint Laurent and Celine are propelling taste in handbags and appreciation is growing for the dark romance of designers like The Row and Alexander McQueen. “Vogue readers now know their Haider Ackermann from their Balmain,” says Anjelica Cheung, editor-in-chief of Vogue China. “When we launched the title in 2005 we were running features and profiles at great length to be able to explain the heritage and background as a form of education – now, those same features are on two pages. What’s needed now is an expert point of view to help readers find their own style and stand out.” From being fashion followers, certain pockets in China are home to emerging tastemakers who are revelling in their own strength of self-expression, valuing artisanship and heritage over flash and obvious signs of wealth. In creative, fashion-forward circles in Shanghai, you can witness men wearing togas and turbans over skinny jeans and shirts at a time when designers are exploring possibilities of skirts and tribal layers on the menswear catwalk in London.  Come spring, you can bet that the nation’s female fashion leaders will be availing themselves of boxy midriff tops, swishy prom skirts and hybrid surf sandals. It is the rate of change from ‘nouveau’ to individualistic that is startling. In Japan, following the economic boom of the 1980s – a period that witnessed an unprecedented appetite for status luxury items – tastes evolved at a gradual pace edging towards the more artistic and expressive in a shift that was to slowly percolate down from the fashion crowd to the general population. More than three decades later and Japan holds its own as a leader in fashion. By comparison, the pace of change in some pockets of China has accelerated. What might be expected to evolve over ten years or more is happening in five years or less. “The cycle and speed of change is much faster than before, due to the rapid pace of the fashion industry itself, the avail of the internet – where knowledge and images of fashion are transmitted on a much more frequent basis – and also to do with the shift of influencers and fashion authorities, “ explains Shaway Yeh, group style editorial director of the Modern Media Group, which publishes a stable of fashion and art publications and apps including the lifestyle title, Modern Weekly. “What’s important to note is that Japan is a relatively homogenous market – smaller scale, more uniform taste – so it is easier to spot the direction of trends. China is a stratified society, where the differences between first tier cities and the third or fourth tiers are huge, not only in terms of taste and lifestyle, but also the availability of merchandise and access to products. The top tier fashionista or luxury customer may have already cultivated a sophisticated sense no different to people in Paris or New York, while the local trendsetters at third or fourth tier cities may still [be] following the trends of last year,” Yeh says. Looking out The impact of foreign travel is also influencing tastes as a growing number of Chinese are not only shopping abroad – taking advantage of lower taxations on luxury goods – but they are also bringing back inspiration. Over 100m Chinese are expected to travel abroad this year. Indeed when it comes to taste, China is dividing and sub-dividing into a highly intricate layer cake, making it ever more complex pin down. Even among the wealthy and privileged in one city there might be multiple style directions. Lane Crawford prides itself on being the first luxury department store in China. It was founded in Hong Kong and opened a 150,000 sq ft flagship in Shanghai in October 2013 and another store in Chengdu will soon follow. Its expansion suggests a growing confidence in consumers shopping outside of the single brand designer outlets that have dominated the luxury landscape to date. “You can never generalise with China as it’s so vast and every city and its population has its idiosyncrasies. Beijing, because it’s the power base of government and has a need for appropriate business attire. Shanghai is very fashion-forward and less about business needs,” says Lane Crawford’s fashion director, Sarah Rutson. “In general, however we are seeing a ground-swell [of] desire across all locations for new, more niche brands. Customers want to show off something that other people feel compelled to ask about – something is luxurious when it is hard to get or find and not seen everywhere.” The steer towards things that are original marks a paradigm shift. Remember: the mothers and grandmothers of this fashion-savvy generation wore Mao suits – even handbags and lipsticks were a rarity. The penalties associated with overt displays of vanity were simply too high to risk. But things couldn’t be more different now. What’s new, whether it’s the latest Samsung device or the newest La Prairie skin care, now holds tremendous interest. There’s no better affirmation of the power of novelty than being asked about your latest acquisition. Whereas Britons and Americans are keen to play things down (“I’ve had this for years”, “I bought it at sale”), the Chinese like to announce the freshness of their purchases. New kids on the block Such a shift in tastes and attitudes is paving the way for an emergent generation of Chinese designers who are surfing on a growing pride for products and designs that are ‘Made in China’. At Lane Crawford, you can discover the romantic modern designs of Ms Minn, flamboyant prints from Chictopia and clean simplicity of Helen Lee’s designs. “They are not copyists or derivative,” says Rutson. Meanwhile, a host of Chinese-born but Western-trained designers are coming to the fore. London-based Huishan Zhang is rapidly gaining a reputation for his artful fusion of traditional Chinese motifs and embellishments and modern shapes. “The younger generations are not afraid to step out of the safety net of established luxury and they are starting to define their own individualistic sense of style by choosing younger, more up and coming designers and above all choosing home-grown talent,” says Zhang who debuted at London Fashion Week in 2010. “The Chinese consumer is very good at this and has been moving away from logo heavy design for a long time but due to the size of China and how big it is we are only just starting to pick up on it now.” “My heritage is full of beautiful craftsmanship and history with a strong understanding of femininity and luxury. Expressing that with a modern twist and being proud of that is where all the potential is for Chinese talent,” says Zhang. It only seems a matter of time before the avant-garde taste for individuality further evolves into a ‘Made in China,’ homegrown style that will be applauded at home and abroad.

risk appetite,When does a joke go too far?,2024-09-15,2015-08-04,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150804-comedy-in-the-age-of-outrage-when-jokes-go-too-far,"Audiences today can be so sensitive to edgy jokes they publicly shame the comedians who make them. Have we lost our sense of humour? Nicholas Barber reports. Warning: this article may offend some readers. To be honest, it probably won’t, but it does include several remarks made by comedians, and there is a growing feeling that comedians can no longer say anything without offending somebody. All it takes is one joke to be taken out of context and quoted on Twitter or Facebook, and a comic can expect a storm of invective from people who are either outraged or pretending to be.  Trevor Noah is one such comic. In March, he was appointed as the new host of The Daily Show, and the following day he was pilloried on social media because six out of the 9,000 Tweets he had posted were deemed sexist or anti-Semitic. Other comedians saw this response as part of a worryingly hysterical trend. Patton Oswalt argued that the kind of instantaneous liberal outrage heaped on Noah “is going to hurt the progressive movement in this country more than anything”. Jim Norton wrote a feature for Time, stating that Americans were addicted to the buzz of being offended. “Western culture as a whole,” he continued, “has become an increasingly reactionary mob of self-centered narcissists who all have their own personal lines drawn in the sand. A comedian is fine unless he crosses their particular line, which, of course, in the mind of a self-centered narcissist, is the only line that matters.” What appears to be happening is that audiences are more sensitive than ever to perceived insults, and that they now have the technology to share that sensitivity with the world. In May, Louis CK talked about paedophilia in an opening monologue on Saturday Night Live, and he didn’t have to wait long for the inevitable Twitter backlash. Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock, meanwhile, have said that college audiences have become too quick to condemn a joke as racist or sexist. Rock has gone further, telling New York Magazine that he has started to censor himself at gigs in case someone is recording him on their phone. Once upon a time, comedians could try out an edgy joke in front of a small crowd, and if it was greeted by gasps instead of laughs, they would know not to tell it again. Now, though, the edgy joke can be broadcast to an almost limitless number of people via social media, so comedians are forced to be more careful. “If you think you don’t have room to make mistakes,” said Rock, “it’s going to lead to safer, gooier stand-up.” It’s a proposition that Jon Ronson examines in his new book, So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed. Over the course of three years, Ronson spoke to people who had been demonised for posting a single tasteless joke on Twitter or Facebook. The more he investigated, he says, the more he came around to the Patton Oswalt/Jim Norton point of view. “There’s a despicable ruthlessness coming from the ‘outrage’ camp which is destroying people’s lives,” says Ronson. “For every little bit of good it does for social justice, it does a terrible amount of harm. Twitter is like the Stasi: a surveillance network which declares war on behaviour that is considered un-Stasi-like.” PC or not PC? Even in the real, non-Twitter world, it’s not just Seinfeld and Rock who have noticed how tetchy audiences are becoming. “There’s a tendency now for sections of crowds to boo in the middle of a joke,” says Glenn Wool, a Canadian regular on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast. “They hear a word that they don’t like and they boo. It’s wrong. You can disagree with a joke, you can walk out on a joke, but you shouldn’t boo in the middle of it, because then you’re deciding if anyone else in the audience gets to hear it – and no one elected you the leader.” Tiff Stephenson, a comic and actor who appeared on BBC2’s The Office, blames this development on smartphones. “What you get now is people in comedy clubs who keep checking their phone,” she says. “They’re not really paying attention, but when they hear a certain trigger word, like ‘abortion’ or ‘suicide’, they pop up and get offended, even though they haven’t actually been listening to the routine.”  As irritated as comedians are by these kneejerk reactions, Nish Kumar of Comedy Central’s The Alternative Comedy Experience believes that an audience’s outrage is sometimes justified. “People are conflating two separate trends,” he says. “I find the practice of tweeting things out of context to be very scary, but political correctness is something different. I don’t think it’s a bad thing for comics to consider the impact of the words they’re choosing, and I don’t think it’s killing comedy. Jerry Seinfeld is a hero of mine, so I take what he says very seriously, but I’m not sure why he would want to undo the good work that’s already been done to make comedy more responsible. I’m certain he wouldn’t like it if someone did a routine that was anti-Semitic or racist.” For Kumar, Seinfeld’s grumblings about political correctness echo those of the bluff, bigoted comics who held sway on British television in the 1970s, “the era of white men in bow ties telling jokes about their Pakistani neighbours”. When alternative comedy came along in the 1980s, Bernard Manning and his peers suddenly found that they were out of touch and out of fashion. Could it be that Seinfeld and Rock, likewise, have simply failed to keep up with social progress? As Wool puts it, “They’re just coming to terms with the fact that they’re not very cool any more.”  Shock and awe Ronson isn’t convinced. “It’s a really interesting analogy, but Bernard Manning and that 1970s crowd were imperialistic misogynists who were all about maintaining the sexist, racist status quo. Their kind of comedy needed to be overthrown. But things are different now. These days, there’s no discernment. Nobody seems to be able to tell the difference between a racist joke and a liberal joke that comments on racism. The condemnation is harder and colder now, too. Someone whose joke lands badly is being treated with the same ferocity as a racist cop in Texas. They’re treated as if their secret evil has been uncovered, but some misjudged gag at a comedy club is not the clue to someone’s secret evil. Young people have decided it is, but it’s not. ” The Twittersphere’s self-righteous fury isn’t the whole story, though. The irony is that, at the same time as people are getting hot under the collar about a ‘misjudged gag’ here and there, there are signs that outrageous comedy is on the rise. After all, Louis CK’s Saturday Night Live monologue may have appalled viewers, but it was, nonetheless, broadcast across the US by a major television network. Two of this year’s most profitable film comedies, Ted 2 and Trainwreck, are stuffed with jokes so rude that they would have given censors a heart attack a decade ago. And that’s even before we get to podcasts and YouTube videos. There may be new platforms from which to complain about offensive comedy, but there are also new platforms where that offensive comedy can be seen.  “You may get a bit of abuse on Twitter, but I don’t think comedians are being silenced,” says Hal Cruttenden, a veteran of ITV’s Sunday Night at the Palladium and BBC1’s Live at the Apollo, “because people will always look for something that might shock them. They have an appetite for hearing something edgy, something that hasn’t been controlled. If you look at some of the things that Frankie Boyle got away with on Mock the Week [on BBC2], it’s amazing.” Boyle embodies our current contradictory attitudes towards risk-taking comedy. The Scottish stand-up is notorious for his dark material, but if his jokes had been “safer and gooier”, he would never have become such a big star. In July, campaigners asked for his show at Belfast’s Féile an Phobail festival to be cancelled because one of his jokes, five years ago, had involved Down’s Syndrome. It’s a sign of the times that people are protesting loudly about a comedian – but it’s also a sign of the times that the show is going ahead.  “It wasn’t the festival’s intention to upset anyone,” a Féile an Phobail spokesman told the Independent newspaper. “But it’s been the fastest selling comedy gig that that they have ever put on, and that’s the simple fact of the matter.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,Why Brits ‘snog’ and ‘chinwag’,2024-09-15,2017-06-19,Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20170619-why-british-english-is-full-of-silly-sounding-words,"From ‘gazump’ to ‘gobsmack’, ‘squiffy’ to ‘snog’, British English is full of words that sound like barmy balderdash. Christine Ro explains why. “That wazzock dared to gazump me; I'm gobsmacked by this sticky wicket full of codswallop that's gone pear-shaped!” That sentence may not sound serious. But the situation it describes is. Translated into standard English, it would be something like “That idiot dared to offer more money for the house after my offer already had been accepted; I'm shocked by this tricky situation full of nonsense that's gone awry!” Shakespeare, this isn’t. The first sentence sounds so peculiar to certain ears not just because of the mangling of parts of speech. It’s also full of words, with origins ranging from the 1700s to the 1980s, that have two qualities in common: they’re all rather silly-sounding, and they’re all British English. British English is full of whimsical terms like these. They reflect the UK’s cultural appreciation of wit, a long tradition of literary inventiveness – and Britain’s fluctuating global influence over the centuries. Whimsical words like these are formed in a number of ways. These include blends of other words (eg ‘Oxbridge’, from Oxford and Cambridge); reduplicatives, which repeat sounds or parts of words (‘higgledy-piggledy’); back-formations, which often remove the suffix of their originating word (like ‘kempt’, from ‘unkempt’); and of course sheer nonsense (like Roald Dahl’s invention ‘gobblefunk’). These types of coinages aren’t unique to English, let alone British English. But the relative simplicity of English words may lend itself to this kind of play, says Anatoly Liberman, professor of languages at the University of Minnesota and an etymology blogger for Oxford University Press. “English is largely a monosyllabic language (‘come’, ‘go’, ‘take’, ‘big’, ‘laugh’, and so forth),” he says. “This makes such games easy.” Especially characteristic of these formations in British English is the way they reflect a certain kind of humour. Pop anthropologist Kate Fox has written about the English “ban on earnestness” (an aversion to taking things too seriously) and the pervasiveness of humour in social interaction. This humour is of a particular kind: self-deprecating and given to understatement and irony. It’s unsurprising that this national trait has made its way into the language. Romantic activities (like ‘snog’ and ‘shag’) are spoken of in childish terms. Classic dishes are made to sound deliberately unappetising (‘dead man’s arm’ and ‘Eton mess’ – respectively, a rolled cake filled with jam and a dessert combining meringue, strawberries and cream. And there’s a healthy appetite for nonsensical ambiguity. To take just one example, ‘ladybird’ is a bugbear of perplexed Americans who wonder – although their version of the word is only slightly more sensible – “Why ladybird? Why not ladybug?” This hints at a gleeful willingness in British English to dispense with literal meaning. Food, for instance, is a rich vein of words like this. ‘Fairy cake’, ‘toad in the hole’, and ‘jacket potato’ have nothing to do with fairies, toads and jackets. Child’s play There’s a long tradition in British English of inventing words just for the fun of it. Eminent linguist David Crystal writes in The Story of English in 100 Words that ‘a gaggle of geese’, ‘an unkindness’ of ravens’, and other collective nouns of this ilk were created in the 15th Century. He speculates that this was done deliberately for comic effect, giving rise to ‘a superfluity of nuns’ (pun intended). While whimsical British terms have been coined in every era, certain periods have been especially fruitful. According to Crystal, linguistic inventiveness, particularly of a playful kind, seems to have peaked in the Elizabethan era. This is partly due to the enduring influence of wordsmiths like Shakespeare and his fellow dramatists. Meanwhile, Crystal adds, at this time “there were more people writing, with pressure to produce new plays to feed the daily demands of the new theatres. And there were no dictionaries to act as a stabilising influence.” This created a climate of lexical creativity, which we can thank for words like ‘balderdash’ (meaning, appropriately, a nonsense word or idea). Here are seven of our favourite silly-sounding British words: Since Shakespeare, British writers from Charles Dickens (‘whiz-bang’) and Lewis Carroll (‘mimsy’) to JK Rowling (‘muggle’) have continued to enliven English vocabulary. As Liberman points out, it’s not that these authors had a monopoly on childlike wit. Rather, historically, British English’s “influence was mainly exercised by great authors,” he says. “The joys and charm of British English have to be sought in the works of the great wits of various epochs. For comparison, in the US, the only figure of comparable size – in this respect – is Mark Twain.” Of course, there’s a risk of over-interpreting the relationship between culture and vocabulary. Fanciful terms can be found in all varieties of English: linguists also have written about how terms like ‘face like a dropped pie’ and ‘cultural cringe’ reflect an Australian culture of informality and ‘mateship’. To make matters more complex, the border between British and American English – the two most influential forms of English – is fairly blurry. In fact, many of the words popularly believed to stem from one country actually originated in the other. The University of Sussex’s Lynne Murphy, who has a blog and a forthcoming book about differences between US and UK English, notes that many Americans incorrectly think ‘bumbershoot’ and ‘poppycock’ are British words. That’s simply, she says, because “a lot of Americans stereotype the British as having silly words.” So words that fit that expectation are the ones that gain a great deal of currency overseas. This is also true of terms that mainly sound comical due to their difference from US terms. Murphy explains that Americans love slang with a (non-flattened) short ‘o’ sound, such as ‘cosh’, ‘bollocks’ and ‘dogsbody’, because “that’s a sound that Americans don’t make”. Even off-colour words can come to seem charming, if they’re sufficiently British and familiar. For instance, there were reports that before James Corden started hosting his late-night chat show in the US, his network instructed him that ‘shag’ and ‘squiffy’ were acceptable, but potentially puzzling words like ‘knackered’ weren’t. Mixed bag Today, a great deal of lexical innovation in English is coming from multilingual places, often former British colonies. One habit is transforming the meaning of British or American words (for example, the word ‘deadwood’ means ‘unproductive civil servant’ in Botswanan English). Another is coining words to refer to locally specific situations (like ‘killer litter’ in Singaporean English, referring to the dangerous practice of throwing objects off tall buildings). Not all of these ‘New Englishes’ are deliberately aiming to be humorous. Take Nigerian English, for example, with its delightful coinages like ‘go-slow’ for ‘traffic jam’. Farooq Kperogi of Kennesaw State University in the US has written extensively about Nigerian English. He says that the humour of terms like ‘go-slow’ (and archaic turns of phrase like ‘men of the underworld’ rather than ‘criminals’) is inadvertent. “One of the abiding features of Nigerian English is excessive lexical formality even in informal contexts, which produces unintended comical effects in native-speaker ears,” he notes. “There is nothing in Nigerian English that is purposely humorous.” But unfamiliarity and unexpectedness can give this kind of creativity a comic effect. And in Nigeria, Kperogi explains, “unintentional humour almost always occurs when Nigerian English, which is fundamentally rooted in British English, collides with American English”. However, given the continued primacy of British and American English, amusing words from other forms of English have been slow to reach the global mainstream. This may change, though. With the increasing influence of Nigerian and Indian cinema, for instance, it may only be a matter of time before a word like ‘prepone’ – an antonym of ‘postpone’ in Indian English – enters the vocabulary of British English speakers.

risk appetite,How your age affects your eating,2024-09-15,2018-07-02,Alex Johnstone,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180629-the-seven-stages-of-life-that-affect-how-we-eat,"We all need food every day, but our changing relationship with it through the years can have a big impact on our health. Do you eat to live or live to eat? We have a complicated relationship with food, influenced by cost, availability and even peer pressure. But something we all share is appetite – our desire to eat. While hunger – our body’s way of making us desire food when it needs feeding – is a part of appetite, it is not the only factor. After all, we often eat when we’re not hungry, or may skip a meal despite pangs of hunger. Recent research has highlighted that the abundance of food cues – smells, sounds, advertising – in our environment is one of the main causes of overconsumption. You might also like: Our appetite is also not fixed, it changes across our lifespan as we age. As Shakespeare might have put it, there are seven ages of appetite, and a better understanding of these phases could help us to develop new ways of tackling under-eating and overconsumption, along with the health effects, such as obesity, that follow. The first decade, 0-10 In early childhood, the body goes through rapid growth and dietary behaviour built up in early life can extend into adulthood, leading a fat child to become a fat adult. Fussiness or fear of particular foods can also contribute to meal time struggles for parents of young children, but a strategy of repeated tasting and learning in a positive environment can help children learn about unfamiliar but important foods, such as vegetables. Children should also experience some control, particularly in relation to portion size. Being forced to “clear the plate” by parents can lead youngsters to lose their ability to follow their own appetite and hunger cues, promoting overeating in later years. There are growing calls for governments to protect young children from targeted junk food advertising – not just on television but in apps, social media and video blogs – since food advertising increases food consumption, which can contribute to children becoming overweight. The second decade, 10-20 In the teenage years, a growth in appetite and stature driven by hormones, signals the arrival of puberty. How a teenager approaches food during this critical period will shape their lifestyle choices in later years. This means the dietary decisions that adolescents make are intrinsically linked to the health of the future generations that they will later become parents to. Unfortunately, without guidance, teenagers may adopt eating behaviours and food preferences associated with unhealthy consequences. Young women in general are more likely to suffer from nutritional deficiencies than young men because of their reproductive biology. Teenage girls who become pregnant are also at greater risk since their bodies are supporting their own growth in competition with that of the growing foetus. The third decade, 20-30 As young adults, lifestyle changes such as going to college, getting married or living with a partner, and parenthood can promote weight gain. Once accumulated, body fat is often difficult to lose. The body sends strong appetite signals to eat when we consume less than our energy needs, but the signals to prevent overeating are weaker, which can lead to a circle of over-consumption. There are many physiological and psychological factors that make eating less difficult to maintain over time. An area of new research is to develop satiety, the sense of having eaten enough. This is helpful when trying to lose weight, since feeling hungry is one of the main barriers to eating less than your body says you need. Different foods send different signals to the brain. It’s easy to eat a tub of ice cream, for example, because fat doesn’t trigger signals in the brain for us to stop eating. On the other hand, foods high in protein, water or fibre content make us feel fuller for longer. Working with the food industry provides an opportunity to shape the future of meals and snacks in beneficial ways. The fourth decade, 30-40 Adult working life brings other challenges beyond a rumbling stomach, but also the effects of stress, which has been shown to prompt changes in appetite and eating habits in 80% of the population, equally divided between those that gorge and those that lose their appetite. These different coping strategies are intriguing: the phenomena of “food addiction” – an irresistible urge to consume specific, often high-calorie foods – is not well understood. Many researchers even question its existence. Other personality traits, such as perfectionism and conscientiousness, may also play a role in mediating stress and eating behaviour. Structuring the work environment to reduce problematic eating patterns such as snacking or vending machines is a challenge. Employers should strive to subsidise and promote healthier eating for a productive and healthy workforce, along with ways of managing stress and stressful situations. The fifth decade, 40-50 The word diet comes from the Greek word diaita meaning “way of life, mode of living”, but we are creatures of habit, often unwilling to change our preferences even when we know it is good for us. We want to eat what we want without changing our lifestyle, and still have a healthy body and mind. There is much evidence to show that diet is a major contributing factor to ill-health. The World Health Organisation highlights smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and problem drinking as the main lifestyle impacts on health and mortality. It is between the ages of 40-50 that adults should change their behaviour as their health dictates, but symptoms of illness are often invisible – for example high blood pressure or cholesterol – and so many fail to act. The sixth decade, 50-60 After the age of 50, we begin to suffer a gradual loss of muscle mass, at between 0.5-1% per year. This is called sarcopenia, and lessened physical activity, consuming too little protein, and menopause in women will accelerate the decline in muscle mass. A healthy, varied diet and physical activity are important to reduce the effects of ageing, and an ageing population’s need for palatable, cost-effective, higher-protein foods is not being met. Protein‐rich snack foods might represent an ideal opportunity to increase total protein intake in older adults, but there are currently few products designed to meet the requirements and preferences of older adults. (Read more about how much protein we need) The seventh decade, 60-70, and beyond A major challenge today in the face of increasing life expectancy is to maintain quality of life, or else we will become a society of very old and infirm or disabled people. Adequate nutrition is important, as old age brings poor appetite and lack of hunger, which leads to unintentional weight loss and greater frailty. Reduced appetite can also result from illness, for example the effects of Alzheimer’s disease. Food is a social experience, but the loss of a partner or family and eating alone affect the sense of pleasure taken from eating. Other affects of old age, such as swallowing problems, dental issues, reduced taste and smell also interfere with the desire to eat and our rewards from doing so. We should remember that throughout life our food is not just fuel, but a social and cultural experience to be enjoyed. We are all experts in food – we eat it every day. So we should strive to treat every opportunity to eat as an opportunity to enjoy our food and to enjoy the positive effects eating the right foods can have on our health.

risk appetite,Can major world events be predicted?,2024-09-15,2019-04-12,David Robson,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190411-how-to-make-wiser-judgements-about-the-future,"Forecasting the future is far from easy, but there is a way to hone your skills no matter who you are. Will the UK leave the EU within 2019? Will the US House of Representatives impeach Trump this year? Will a man or a woman win the Democratic primary? How you answer these questions is not simply a matter of intelligence or education. A four-year forecasting tournament, the Good Judgment Project, tested thousands of people’s abilities to predict world events. The top performers were educated, for sure, but their performance also relied on many styles of thinking that are not measured in traditional academic tests. They also represented a mix of genders, ages and backgrounds. Take the example of Elaine Rich, a pharmacist from a Maryland suburb, who signed up in her 60s and quickly excelled in making the tournament’s probability-based predictions. As she told NPR, world affairs had never been her forte and she hadn’t studied maths in college. But with a bit of training, she ended up performing in the top 1% of forecasters. As the project leader, Philip Tetlock, wrote in his book Super-forecasting: “A brilliant puzzle-solver may have the raw material for forecasting, but if he doesn’t also have an appetite for questioning basic, emotionally charged beliefs, he will often be at a disadvantage relative to a less intelligent person who has a greater capacity for self-critical thinking.” If you fancy testing your own forecasting skills, BBC Future has teamed up with Good Judgment and the UK innovation foundation Nesta to launch our own forecasting challenge that is open to anyone to join. You may find that you already have an amazing talent for predicting the future – but don’t worry if you initially underperform. With a little practice, anyone can improve their prediction abilities on all kinds of issues, and in time you may see other benefits too, such as a boost in open-mindedness. If you would like to learn more about the science of making wiser judgements before joining the challenge, read on... The question of what constitutes good judgement has troubled philosophers for millennia, along with the suspicion that raw brainpower, alone, is not enough for truly wise insights. Indeed, according to Rene Descartes, it may even push us to greater error. “The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues,” he wrote in the 17th Century. “Those who go forward but very slowly can get further, if they always follow the right road, than those who are in too much of a hurry and stray off it.” As I write in my book The Intelligence Trap, cutting-edge psychological research now offers some very precise ways in which greater brainpower drive us down the wrong track. Consider the phenomenon of “motivated reasoning”. When we think about emotionally charged issues – particularly those associated with our identities – we don’t apply our thinking in an even-handed way to appraise the evidence at hand. Instead, we may simply use it to rationalise our existing viewpoint and demolish any arguments that contradict those views. And the more intelligent or knowledgeable you are, the easier it may be to build elaborate arguments that support your point of view. JOIN THE CHALLENGE Predicting the future is impossible – but signing up and participating will hone your skills and could make you a better forecaster than your peers.“When you’re part of the challenge, you’ll get feedback on how accurate your forecasts are. You’ll be able to see how well you do compared to other forecasters. And there’s a leader board, which shows who the best performing forecasters are,” says Kathy Peach, who leads Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence Design. It's also possible there will be unexpected upsides. “New research shows that forecasting increases open-mindedness, the ability to consider alternative scenarios and reduces political polarisation,” adds Peach. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up for the You Predict The Future challenge now [Update: The challenge is now closed], and take the first step to becoming a better, wiser, and more even-handed forecaster.  We can see this most clearly with views on global warming. Among Democrats, more numerate and scientifically literate people are more likely to endorse the view that human emissions are causing climate change; but among Republicans, the exact opposite is true. The more numerate and scientifically literate participants are more likely to deny the effect of human emissions on the environment. Researchers have now observed similar patterns on many other issues – from gun control to fracking and stem cell research –  where greater knowledge seems to increase political polarisation. If you’re trying to predict the outcome of something emotionally charged like Brexit, motivated reasoning is almost certainly skewing your thinking. Besides motivated reasoning, smart people may also suffer from “earned dogmatism” – in which your perceptions of your own expertise cause you to become more closed-minded. If you had a politics degree, for instance, you may have a tendency to ignore new evidence that contradicts your preconceptions – because you feel that you know everything there is to know already. Not every smart person falls for these traps, of course. It depends on whether your intelligence is complemented by some other traits that ensure you use it wisely. Take curiosity. Both questionnaires and behavioural measures confirm that some people are naturally more curious than others – for them, learning new facts is a reward in its own right (and even creates a dopamine kick in the brain). Do you actively seek new knowledge? And would you get the itch to read a newspaper article on a favourite subject, even if it threatens to challenge your assumptions? These people appear to be less likely to allow their views to be skewed by their political affiliations, since their hunger for new knowledge trumps any dogmatic tendencies. But there are many intelligent people who do not have this hunger for knowledge for its own sake. You might also enjoy: Psychologists are also interested in the protective potential of “intellectual humility” – essentially, how easily you can admit that you are wrong. Once again, this can be measured by questionnaires. People with greater intellectual humility are less likely to hold polarised, dogmatic views. Instead, they appraise the evidence at hand and to listen to alternative points of view. In the initial Good Judgment Project, the super-forecasters with the most accurate insights showed just this kind of thinking – they checked their confidence, and were quick to admit their mistakes and update their opinions when new evidence emerged. People who were most prone to rigid closed-minded thinking, dogmatism, and arrogance, in contrast, performed much worse – no matter what their IQ and academic credentials. Fortunately, our minds are malleable: anyone can learn to avoid blinkered reasoning. One technique is the “consider the opposite” strategy, in which you deliberately occupy the alternative stance and argue against your initial intuitions, a practice that has been shown to reduce a range of self-serving biases. (You can read more about that here.) There is also evidence that learning about logical fallacies and common thinking errors can help you to think more rationally about the news you consume, so that you appraise information based on the quality of the arguments – rather than whether it simply aligns with your existing beliefs. And a very basic refresher in ways to calculate risk and uncertainty can help improve your overall decision making on a range of issues – such as health, finance, and politics. Good thinking can be learnt – and our new forecasting tournament might be a perfect opportunity to sharpen your judgements. The practice of forecasting forces you to turn your intuitions and beliefs into testable hypotheses that can be proven or disproven. As a result, you will learn to overcome your motivated reasoning and earned-dogmatism – if you suffer from them – and you’ll develop a better understanding of risk and uncertainty. There’s evidence suggesting participants in forecasting tournaments can improve their accuracy with training. And what’s more, compared to a control group, the participants in a forecasting competition went on to show greater intellectual humility and reduced polarisation on a range of issues – including those that had not been discussed in the tournament itself. They had learnt to question their assumptions and to look beyond the blinkers of their ideology. So why not sign up to our project and see how you fare? [The challenge is now closed.] Whether you wish to be a super-forecaster or you simply want to develop a more rational understanding of the world around you, you might be surprised by what you find. -- David Robson is a senior journalist at BBC Future.

risk appetite,Will humans destroy all life on Earth?,2024-09-15,2021-05-21,Santhosh Mathew,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210520-could-humans-really-destroy-all-life-on-earth,"The seemingly insatiable human tendency to consume is changing our planet and the life on it, but can we change our behaviour? Among the many global catastrophic risks known to humans, some are entertained in the media more than the others. Asteroid impacts, supervolcano eruptions and climate change have all received the Hollywood treatment. And each of these have taken a devastating toll on our planet's life in the past. Yet, unknown to many people, a new global threat capable of destroying life itself is brewing in the shadows of our everyday lives. It's driven by the immense human desire for material consumption. And paradoxically it is a consequence of human life itself. Just look around – you are inseparably surrounded by material objects ­– whether they are needed in your life or not. For every bit of this material we use, there is a growing web of global actions that is slowly stripping human's emotional health, depleting Earth's resources and degrading our planet's habitats. If left unchecked, is there a risk that human consumption may finally turn the Earth into an uninhabitable world? Do we have it in us to stop before it is too late? A team of researchers from Weizmann Institute of Sciences, Israel, recently published a study that compared human-made mass – aka anthropogenic mass – with all the living mass, or biomass, on the globe. They revealed that for the first time in human history the former has either surpassed the latter or is close to doing so in coming years. The Weizmann Institute study estimates that on average, each person on the globe now produces more anthropogenic mass than his or her bodyweight every week. ""The finding that anthropogenic mass – human made stuff - now weighs as much as all living things, and the fact that it keeps accumulating rapidly, gives another clear perspective on how humanity is now a major player in shaping the face of the planet,"" says Professor Ron Milo, whose laboratory conducted this study. ""Life on Earth is affected in a major quantitative manner by the actions of humans.""  This revelation comes as no surprise to many who consider that humans have already ushered in a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene – the age of humans, a term popularised by Nobel Laureate and chemist Paul Crutzen. While the exact beginning of this era is debatable, there is no denying that humans have become a dominant force on this planet, altering every other form of life through our actions. The scale and size of the anthropogenic matter is alarming. Take the case of plastic – the birth of the modern plastics era came only in 1907, but today we produce 300 million tons of plastics every year. Further, the realisation that after water, concrete is the most widely used substance on Earth is beyond comprehension. The massive geoengineering process initiated by humans took an accelerated upswing when materials like concrete and aggregates became widely available. These two materials make up a major component of the growth in anthropogenic mass. Even the relatively recent human adventures of space exploration, which began about 60 years ago, is triggering a disastrous space junk problem. Alongside this we haphazardly observe polar cap melts, permafrost thaws, and global temperatures getting hotter. You might also like to read: So, why has this happened? Are humans genetically inclined to be materialistic to the point of our own destruction? Is the accumulation of anthropogenic matter merely a measure of humans' annihilation rate? Or will nature equip humans to cope with this problem? These are highly unsettled questions. Although there is evidence that materialism is learned and shaped by culture, there are some who argue that natural selection may have predisposed our species with a desire to accumulate stuff. Our belongings can offer us a sense of security and status that doubtless played a more important role earlier in human history. Somehow, creating new stuff has become a divine word in the collective human psyche. It's obnoxiously seated in all our endeavours from ancient stories to modern research and development rooms. ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the Earth…"" goes the Genesis story in Bible. Humans have been conditioned to believe that creating something new is a meaningful purpose of life and is the only way to advance their ambitions. Yet we forget to put a cap on the use.   The limits of science have never been more glaringly apparent when trying to solve this conundrum. Reliance upon green technological solutions alone is flawed because the focus is still based on new stuff and more use – not to alter lifestyles or business models that handed us this problem in the first place. Even if we can replace all fossil fuel-based vehicles with electric ones, for example, cities are already struggling to take road space from cars and electric vehicles have their own footprint on the world's resources due to the materials needed to build them. ""The accumulation of anthropogenic mass also relates to urban development, along with its associated environmental implications, already witnessed worldwide,"" says Emily Elhacham, one of the authors of the Weizmann Institute of Sciences study. ""I hope that raising awareness would promote behavioral change that would enable finding a better balance point. Every step in this direction will have a positive effect."" Look at the carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet and the systems supporting. It accounts for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions, and is predicted to double by 2025. It's possible to cut down emissions with one less email or avoiding an unnecessary photo sharing on social media – it may seem like an insignificant reduction from one individual but then add billions of such small actions together. (Read more about the impact of our internet activity on the climate.) Big technology companies claim they are going green or set goals for carbon neutrality but they rarely encourage people to spend less time on social media or order fewer products. Rather advertising and marketing models convey powerful messages that reinforce the motto: create and consume more. This irrational savage materialism is ingrained so deeply with traditions and cultural symbols as well. In the United States, Thanksgiving is followed by another carnival called Black Friday. During this ritual, long lines of customers hit the malls and often get injured or trampled – but people are convinced that it's an effort worth the trouble. In the age of Anthropocene, humans may feel entitled to pin hope on technology to fix any problems so that they can continue to do what they are doing. Faced with the accumulation of long-lived plastic in the environment, for example, a spurt of innovation led to biodegradable coffee cups, bags for life and reusable straws. But while it is true that a sustainable growth model that includes our environment has much larger potential to persist, we need a different approach to sustainability that addresses our massive consumerism. The Covid-19 has reminded us how fragile and unprepared human civilisation is when it comes to even known knowns like a pandemic. It has also taught us that human behaviour can be modified with minor actions like wearing mask to mitigate the intensity of global tragedies. The passive approach to proliferation of anthropogenic mass is not merely due to the lack of knowledge about its impact, but in general, it has also to do with human inclination to dismiss facts that don't fit their worldview. Humans are naturally disposed to disregard issues that are not challenging their daily lives or those which dilute their convenience. Additionally, humans might find the solace in the thought that nature might equip organisms to survive, no matter what we do. It is true that the slow and gradual, Darwinian-style evolution through natural selection is often overtaken in certain extremely polluted environments. In 2016, a team of scientists in Japan found a strain of bacteria from bottle recycling facility that can break down and metabolise plastic. On the other hand, this finding shows the subtle and powerful ways in which human actions are changing the life on this planet. The adaptation of organisms in response to pollutants is a complex phenomenon. ""In the long term, a sustained increase of anthropogenic mass would lead to the loss of habitats through physical dislocation and alteration of habitats such as contamination with pollutants resulting from the production and disposal of anthropogenic mass,"" says Alessandra Loria, a biologist at McGill University, Canada, who is the lead author of this study. Research indicates that negative effects induced by pollution often worsen over multiple generations, although the coping mechanism vary in different species.  The rapid depletion of natural resources and biodiversity is not a normal evolutionary race that nature is used to. While some species can certainly adapt to the changes taking place in our environment, humans are no longer a mere species that follows Darwinian evolution but a much larger force that has come to drive evolution on this planet. Studies have shown that for most species, evolutionary adaptation is not expected to be sufficiently rapid to buffer the effects of environmental changes being wrought by human activity. And our own species will be no exception to this. While there is no proof that we will destroy ourselves, there are clear indications that we ignore the effects at our own peril. For example, some of the mass extinctions in the Earth's history are related to acidification of oceans. The oceans absorb about 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, which in turn increases the ocean acidity. The oceans may be acidifying faster today than they did in the last 300 million years, primarily due to human activities. ""Human life will be negatively affected because of the loss of the many ecosystem benefits and services provided by biological diversity,"" says Loria. ""For example, water pollution may affect provisioning services, such as food and water, by causing a reduction in food diversity and/or in its quality and safety. Widespread degradation of ecosystems threatens the conditions of life on Earth, in particular the long-term survival of our own species."" Our impact on the planet is much is deeper than carbon footprints or global warming. It points to a future where the effects of anthropogenic matter will take over – if it hasn't already – the identity of the Earth and its life. In the face of this, humans themselves might lose out in the evolutionary race. Eliminating materials like concrete or plastic or replacing them with alternatives is not going to address the fundamental problem with human attitudes and our unparalleled appetite for more. This is exactly where materialism can seamlessly transform into a known unknown risk factor in global catastrophe. The myriad of ways in which it can turn this planet into a mundane world is something our civilisation has never experienced before. In the absence of a fully secure evolutionary shield, we could depend on our intelligence to survive. Nevertheless, as Abraham Loeb, professor of science at Harvard University and an astronomer who is searching for dead cosmic civilisations puts it, ""the mark of intelligence is the ability to promote a better future"". ""If we continue to behave this way, we might not survive very long,"" he says. ""On the other hand, our actions could be a source of pride for our descendants if they sustain a civilisation intelligent enough to endure for many centuries to come."" The story of Bhasmasura in Hindu Mythology offers an eerie parallel to the impact of materialism. As a devotee of Lord Shiva, he obtains a boon from Shiva, which empowers him to turn anyone into ashes with a mere touch on the head. Immediately after gaining this magical ability, he tries to test it on Shiva himself. Shiva manages to escape, the story goes. But humans may not be lucky enough to flee from their own actions. Unless, we offer a different vision rooted in reduction of consumption, the flames of our own materialism might consume both us and our Pale Blue Dot. * Santhosh Mathew is a professor of physics and astronomy Regis College, Greater Boston, and a science writer who has authored two books. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,How do you decaffeinate coffee?,2024-09-15,2018-09-18,Stephen Dowling,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee,"Some of us love the taste of coffee but can’t deal with the effects of caffeine. So how exactly do you take the caffeine out of a coffee bean? If you’re partial to a cup of coffee minus the caffeine, then next time you’ve boiled the kettle you should raise your mug in memory of Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge. Runge was a 19th-Century German chemist who had come to the attention of Goethe – the poet and statesman who was also a keen science scholar. Goethe had heard of Runge’s groundbreaking investigation into belladonna, otherwise known as nightshade. Runge had isolated the compound that caused eye muscles to dilate if it was ingested. Goethe had been recently given a case of coffee beans, and so he asked Runge to perform an analysis of the beans. What Runge discovered is arguably the most consumed drug in the modern world – caffeine. You might also like: Caffeine is present in other drinks and foods – notably tea and chocolate – but it is inextricably linked with coffee. It’s a stimulant and an appetite suppressant, a dependable pick-me-up for students cramming for exams, workers on nightshifts and anyone else needing a wake-up. But caffeine has a darker side, too. It can cause anxiety, insomnia, diarrhoea, excess sweating, racing heartbeat and muscle tremors. For many people, the pleasure of drinking coffee is outweighed by the caffeine-fuelled negatives. Could caffeine be removed from coffee? The answer, as any supermarket aisle will tell you, is yes – but the process isn’t as simple as you might think. The first person to hit upon a practical decaffeination method was another German, Ludwig Roselius, the head of the coffee company Kaffee HAG. Roselius discovered the secret to decaffeination by accident. In 1903, shipment of coffee had been swamped by seawater in transit – leaching out the caffeine but not the flavour. Roselius worked out an industrial method to repeat it, steaming the beans with various acids before using the solvent benzene to remove the caffeine. Decaffeinated coffee was born. Benzene, it turned out, was a possible carcinogen, so the search was on for new techniques that could prise out the caffeine from the beans – and yet leave the flavour intact. Chris Stemman, the executive director of the British Coffee Association, says most of those techniques from decaffeination’s earliest days are still being used today. But the process isn’t as straightforward as you’d expect. “It isn’t done by the coffee companies themselves,” says Stemann. “There are specialist decaffeination companies that carry it out.” Many of these companies are based in Europe, Canada, the US and South America. You might think that it would be easier to roast the coffee, grind it into the required powder (espresso, filter or instant) and then begin the decaffeination process. Not, so says Stemman. “It takes place when the coffee is green, before roasting. “If you were to try and decaffeinate roasted coffee you’d end up making something that tastes a bit like straw. So that’s why with 99.9% of decaffeinated coffee to this day, the process is done at the green coffee stage.” There are several ways to decaffeinate coffee but the most prevalent is to soak them in a solvent – usually methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Methylene chloride can be used as a paint stripper and a degreaser as well an agent to remove caffeine. Ethyl acetate, meanwhile, is a natural fruit ether usually made from acetic acid – the building block of vinegar – and it’s also used to make nail polish remover (it has a distinctive sweet smell, much like pear drops). The beans are first soaked in water and then covered in a solution containing either of these solvents. The caffeine is then drawn out by the solvent. The solvent-laced water is then reused again and again until it is packed with coffee flavourings and compounds – pretty much identical to the beans, except for the caffeine and solvent. By this stage in the process the beans lose very little flavouring because they’re essentially soaked in a concentrated coffee essence. Soaking coffee beans in solvents doesn’t sound like a particularly healthy enterprise, but both of these agents have got a clean bill of health. In 1985 the US’s Food and Drug Administration said the likelihood of any health risk from methylene chloride was so low “as to be essentially non-existent”. (FDA rules allow up to 10 parts per million of residual methylene, but coffee decaffeination usually uses solutions with one part per million). Two other methods use water. The Swiss Water method sees the beans soaked with water; the caffeine rich solution (full of flavours) is then strained though activated carbon which captures the caffeine. Starting in Switzerland in the 1930s, the process was first used commercially in 1979. It gained favour because it was the first decaffeination method not to use solvents. There is another method, Stemman says, which involves the use of “super critical carbon dioxide”.  Beans that have been soaked in water are put in a stainless-steel extractor which is then sealed, and liquid CO2 blasted in at pressures of up to 1,000lbs per square inch. Like the Swiss Water method, it’s the C02 which binds with the caffeine molecules, drawing them out of the unroasted bean. The gas is then drawn off and the pressure is lowered, leaving the caffeine in a separate chamber. It’s an ingenious method but it does have one big drawback, according to Stemman. “It can be enormously expensive.” Decaffeination became much more widespread as instant coffee became a staple, says Stemman. But the early incarnations of instant decaff coffee were not a roaring success. “If you look back 20 or 30 years ago, we [in the UK] really were a nation of instant coffee drinkers,” he says. “And the one thing that instant coffee didn’t really taste of was coffee. Decaff was even worse.” Stemman says that as people have become more used to quality coffee – for instance, the UK now boasts some 24,000 coffee shops – this has forced coffee-making companies to find ways of enhancing flavour even in decaffeinated instant coffee. “Decaffeination can be a complicated piece of chemistry, which is why there are these very sophisticated companies doing it.” The centenary of decaffeination – 2006 – went by with little in the way of public fanfare. In the UK at least, the number of people stumping for a decaff coffee has fallen markedly even as the quality has improved – while as many as 15% of coffee drinkers chose decaffeinated brews in the 1980s, that’s fallen to about 8% today. And does Stemman drink decaffeinated himself? “Generally, no, if I don’t want the caffeine, well I just won’t have a coffee or a tea.” And there’s another thing. While each of these methods will take most of the caffeine away, there’s no such thing as a completely decaffeinated drink. If you really want to avoid any caffeine at all, it’s probably better to drink something that never had a trace of it in the first place. -- Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

BBC Future has brought you in-depth and rigorous stories to help you navigate the current pandemic, but we know that’s not all you want to read. So now we’re dedicating a series to help you escape. We’ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads.    You’ll find everything from the story about the world’s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us, the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long-buried World War Two tanks back to life. What you won’t find is any reference to, well, you-know-what. Enjoy.   In a restaurant setting sometime in the not-too distant future, a man and a woman are on their first date. After the initial nerves subside, all is going well. The man is 33, he says, has been single for most of those years, and, although he doesn’t mention it, knows he is looking to settle down and have a family. The woman replies that she is 52, has been married, divorced, and has children in their early 20s. He had no idea – she looked his age, or younger. This is a dream of Julie Mattison from the National Institute on Ageing (NIA) in the United States. She envisions a time when chronological age ticks by with every year, but biological age can be set to a different timer, where elderly doesn’t mean what it does now. It sounds far-fetched, but our society has already made great strides towards that goal, thanks to advances in medicine and improvements in healthy living. In 2014, for instance, the United States Health Interview Survey reported that 16% of people aged between 50 and 64 were impaired every day with chronic illness. Three decades earlier that number was 23%. In other words, as well as benefiting from longer lifespans, we are also experiencing longer “healthspans” – and the latter is proving to be even more malleable. To paraphrase and update a speech from John F Kennedy given at the first White House Conference on Ageing in 1961, life can indeed be added to years, rather than just years added to life. So, what do we need to do to enhance the length and quality of our lives even more? Researchers worldwide are pursuing various ideas, but for Mattison and colleagues, the answer is a simple change in diet. They believe that the key to a better old age may be to reduce the amount of food on our plates, via an approach called “calorie restriction”. This diet goes further than cutting back on fatty foods from time-to-time; it’s about making gradual and careful reductions in portion size permanently. Since the early 1930s, a 30% reduction in the amount of food consumed per day has been linked to longer, more active lives in worms, flies, rats, mice, and monkeys. Across the animal kingdom, in other words, calorie restriction has proven the best remedy for the ravages of life. And it’s possible that humans have just as much to gain. The idea that what a person eats influences their health no doubt predates any historical accounts that remain today. But, as is often the case for any scientific discipline, the first detailed accounts come from Ancient Greece. Hippocrates, one of the first physicians to claim diseases were natural and not supernatural, observed that many ailments were associated with gluttony; obese Greeks tended to die younger than slim Greeks, that was clear and written down on papyrus. Spreading from this epicentre of science, these ideas were adopted and adapted over the centuries. And at the end of the 15th Century, Alvise Cornaro, an infirm aristocrat from a small village near Venice in Italy, turned the prevailing wisdom on its head, and on himself. If indulgence was harmful, would dietary asceticism be helpful? To find out, Cornaro, aged 40, ate only 350g (12oz) of food per day, roughly 1000 calories according to recent estimates. He ate bread, panatela or broth, and eggs. For meat he chose veal, goat, beef, partridge, thrush, and any poultry that was available. He bought fish caught from the local rivers. Restricted in amount but not variety, Cornaro claimed to have achieved “perfect health” up until his death more than 40 years later. Although he changed his birthdate as he aged, claiming that he had reached his 98th year, it is thought that he was around 84 when he died – still an impressive feat in the 16th Century, a time when 50 or 60 years old was considered elderly. In 1591, his grandson published his posthumous three-volume tome entitled “Discourses on the Sober Life,” pushing dietary restriction into the mainstream, and redefining ageing itself. With an additional boost of health into the evening of life, the elderly, in full possession of their mental capacities, would be able to put decades of amassed knowledge to good use, Carnaro claimed. With his diet, beauty became the aged, not the youthful. Longevity trials Cornaro was an interesting man but his findings are not to be taken as fact by any branch of science. Even if he was true to his word and did not suffer ill health for nearly half a century, which seems unlikely, he was a case study of one – not representative of humans as a whole. But since a foundational study in 1935 in white rats, a dietary restriction of between 30-50% has been shown to extend lifespan, delaying death from age-related disorders and disease. Of course, what works for a rat or any other laboratory organism might not work for a human. Long-term trials, following humans from early adulthood to death, are a rarity. “I don’t see a human study of longevity as something that would be a fundable research programme,” says Mattison. “Even if you start humans at 40 or 50 years old, you’re still looking at potentially 40 or 50 more years [of study].” Plus, she adds, ensuring that extraneous factors – exercise, smoking, medical treatments, mental wellbeing – don’t influence the trial’s end results is near impossible for our socially and culturally complex species. That’s why, in the late 1980s, two independent long-term trials – one at NIA and the other at the University of Wisconsin – were set up to study calorie restriction and ageing in Rhesus monkeys. Not only do we share 93% of our DNA with these primates, we age in the same way too. Slowly, after middle age (around 15 years in Rhesus monkeys) the back starts to hunch, the skin and muscles start to sag, and, where it still grows, hair goes from gingery brown to grey. The similarities go deeper. In these primates, the occurrence of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease increases in frequency and severity with age. “They’re an excellent model to study ageing,” says Rozalyn Anderson, a gerontologist from the University of Wisconsin.  And they’re easy to control. Fed with specially made biscuits, the diets of the 76 monkeys at the University of Wisconsin and the 121 at NIA are tailored to their age, weight, and natural appetite. All monkeys receive the full complement of nutrients and minerals that their bodies crave. It’s just that half of the monkeys, the calorie restricted (or CR) group, eat 30% less. They are far from malnourished or starving. Take Sherman, a 43-year-old monkey from NIA. Mattison says that since being placed on the CR diet in 1987, aged 16, Sherman hasn’t shown any overt signs of hunger that are well characterised in his species. Sherman is the oldest Rhesus monkey ever recorded, nearly 20 years older than the average lifespan for his species in captivity. As younger monkeys were developing diseases and dying, he seemed to be immune to ageing. Even into his 30s he would have been considered an old monkey, but he didn’t look or act like one.  The same is true, to varying extents, for the rest of his experimental troop at NIA. “We have a lower incidence of diabetes, and lower incidence of cancer in the CR groups,” says Mattison. In 2009, the University of Wisconsin trial published similarly spectacular results. Not only did their CR monkeys look remarkably younger – with more hair, less sag, and brown instead of grey – than monkeys that were fed a standard diet, they were healthier on the inside too, free from pathology. Cancers, such as the common intestinal adenocarcinoma, were reduced by over 50%. The risk of heart disease was similarly halved. And while 11 of the ad libitum (“at one’s pleasure,” in Latin) monkeys developed diabetes and five exhibited signs that they were pre-diabetic, the blood glucose regulation seemed healthy in all CR monkeys. For them, diabetes wasn’t a thing.    Overall, only 13% of the monkeys in the CR group had died of age-related causes in 20 years. In the ad libitum group, 37% had died, nearly three times as many. In an update study from the University of Wisconsin in 2014, this percentage remained stable. “We have demonstrated that ageing can be manipulated in primates,” says Anderson. “It kind of gets glossed over because it’s obvious, but conceptually that’s hugely important; it means that ageing itself is a reasonable target for clinical intervention and medical treatment.” If ageing can be delayed, in other words, all of the diseases associated with it will follow suit. “Going after each disease one at a time isn’t going to significantly extend lifespan for people because they’ll die of something else,” says Anderson. “If you cured all cancers, you wouldn’t offset death due to cardiovascular disease, or dementia, or diabetes-associated disorders. Whereas if you go after ageing you can offset the lot in one go.” Eating less certainly seemed to help the monkeys, but calorie restriction is much tougher for people out in the real world. For one, our access to regular, high-calorie meals is now easier than ever; with companies like Deliveroo and UberEats, there is no longer a need to walk to the restaurant anymore. And two, gaining weight simply comes more naturally to some people. “There’s a huge genetic component to all of this and its much harder work for some people than it is for others to stay trim,” says Anderson. “We all know someone who can eat an entire cake and nothing happens, they look the exact same. And then someone else walks past a table with a cake on it and they have to go up a pant size.” Ideally, the amount and types of food we eat should be tailored to who we are – our genetic predisposition to gaining weight, how we metabolise sugars, how we store fat, and other physiological fluxes that are beyond the scope of scientific instruction at the moment, and perhaps forever. But a predisposition to obesity can be used as a guide to life choices rather than an inevitability. “I personally have a genetic history of obesity running through my family, and I practice a flexible form of caloric restriction,” says Susan Roberts a dietary scientist at Tufts University in Boston. “I keep my BMI at 22, and [have calculated] that that requires eating 80% of what I would eat if my BMI was at 30 like every other member of my family.” Roberts stresses that it isn’t hard – she follows her own weight management programme using a tool called iDiet to help her eat less but avoid feeling hungry or deprived of enjoyment. If this wasn’t possible, she adds, she wouldn’t practise calorie restriction. Not only has Roberts seen the problems of obesity first-hand in her family, she knows the benefits of CR better than most. For over 10 years she has been a leading scientist in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy trial, also known as Calerie. Over two years, 218 healthy men and women aged between 21 and 50 years were split into two groups.  In one, people were allowed to eat as they normally would (ad libitum), while the other ate 25% less (CR). Both had health checks every six months. Unlike in the Rhesus monkey trials, tests over two years can’t determine whether CR reduces or delays age-related diseases. There simply isn’t enough time for their development. But the Calerie trials tested for the next best thing: the early biological signs of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Published in 2015, the results after two years were very positive. In the blood of calorie-restricted people, the ratio of “good” cholesterol to “bad” cholesterol had increased, molecules associated with tumour formation – called tumour necrosis factors (TNFs) – were reduced by around 25%, and levels of insulin resistance, a sure sign of diabetes, fell by nearly 40% compared to people who ate their normal diets. Overall, the blood’s pressure was lower. Admittedly, some benefits may come from weight-loss. Earlier trials from Calerie had included people that were obese as well as those with a healthy body mass index (BMI) of 25 or below, and slimming down would have certainly improved the welfare of the heavier participants. “One thing that’s been very clear for a long time is that being overweight or obese is bad for you,” says Roberts. Diseases and disorders previously thought to be age-associated diseases are now popping up in the obese population, she adds. But the latest results suggested that significant health benefits can be garnered in an already healthy body – a person who isn’t underweight or obese. That is, someone whose BMI lies between 18.5 and 25. Despite these results, evidence from further trials will be needed before someone with an already healthy BMI should be advised to reduce their calorie intake. (And anyone wanting to change their diet would be advised to consult a medical professional beforehand.) In the meantime, the scientists will be hoping that their rhesus macaques may help us to understand exactly why calories restriction may have these effects. With nearly 30 years of data on lives and deaths, and blood and tissue samples, from nearly 200 monkeys, the work at NIA and the University of Wisconsin aim to shine a light into the black box of calorie restriction, illuminating just how it delays ageing. With less food, is the metabolism forced to be more efficient with what it has? Is there a common molecular switch regulating ageing that is turned on (or off) with fewer calories? Or is there an as of yet unknown mechanism underpinning our lives and deaths? The importance of monkeys like Sherman far outspans their lives. Answers to such questions might be long in coming. “If I cloned 10 of myself and we all worked furiously, I don’t think we’d have it solved,” says Anderson. “The biology is inordinately complicated.” It’s a worthwhile undertaking – understand how CR works and other treatments could then be used to target that specific part of our biology. Ageing could be treated directly, that is, without the need of calorie restriction. “And I think that’s really the golden ticket,” says Anderson. Although lacking a neat explanation, calorie restriction is one of the most promising avenues for improving health and how long it lasts in our lives. “There was nothing in what we saw that made us think caloric restriction doesn’t work in people,” says Roberts, from the Calerie trial. And, unlike drug-based treatments, it doesn’t come with a long list of possible side effects. “Our people were not hungrier, their mood was fine, their sexual function was fine. We looked pretty hard for bad things and didn’t find them,” says Roberts. One expected issue was a slight decrease in bone density that is often tied to gradual weight loss, says Roberts. But as a precaution, volunteers were provided with small calcium supplements throughout the trial. Even with such promising findings, “this [the Calerie trial] is the first study of its kind, and I don’t think that any of us would feel confident in saying, ‘okay, we’re going to recommend this to everyone in the world,’” says Roberts. “But it’s a really exciting prospect. I think that delaying the progression of chronic diseases is something that everyone can get behind and get excited about, because nobody wants to live life with one of those.” Alex Riley is a writer based in Berlin, Germany.

risk appetite,The benefits of eating adventurously,2024-09-15,2017-06-13,David Robson,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170612-should-the-world-eat-more-like-the-cantonese,"Hong Kong is a rabbit’s warren of eateries offering all manner of dishes – some of them not for the faint-hearted. But could this adventurous eating actually be good for us? Sitting down in this small Hong Kong restaurant, I assume that the white chest of drawers behind me are filled with tea leaves, herbs, and fungi. So I’m rather perturbed when my guide Cecilia Leung tells me that they are not filled with dried plant life – but live snakes. If the owner were here, Cecilia says, he would happily bring one out for me to inspect. Indeed, the “snake king’s” talents are so famous that he is sometimes called out in the middle of the night to capture and relocate venemous specimens blocking public rights of way. Luckily for me, the only serpent I see is skinned, sliced, and served up in a thick, gravy-like broth with pork, chicken, mushrooms, and lemon grass. The snake meat itself is greyish with a slightly pink blush – and what appear to be the imprint of its scales still marking its delicate surface. The rich fumes of the broth are undoubtedly appetising, but I let my spoon hover nervously over the edge of the bowl – not quite sure whether I dare to dig in. Intellectually, I know that snake meat is really no different from eating fish, or squid, or chicken. And yet my brain can’t quite seem to communicate that message to my mouth or to my stomach. I’m in Hong Kong on a reporting assignment – and part of my mission is to understand the territory’s rich culinary history. But as a science journalist, I’m also interested in what experiences can tell me about the psychology of eating, including the somewhat arbitrary mental barriers that determine what we will and won’t eat – and the surprising benefits of overcoming those boundaries. As I hesitate, Cecilia tells me that about half the people she brings on this tour are willing to overcome their aversion and eat the snake. Will I be one of them? I first meet Cecilia and her sister Silvana at a bakery and café in the working-class district of Sham Shui Po. Together, they run Hong Kong Foodie Tours, and over breakfast they offer me a crash course in the history and culture of Hong Kong cuisine. “I hope you’ve got a big appetite,” Silvana asks me, before ordering me a huge pineapple bun, made from a sweet, airy dough and covered in a cracked yellow topping. It is served with a mug of steaming Hong Kong-style milk tea, made by repeatedly drawing water through a huge “stocking” filled with tea leaves, which helps release the tannins and the caffeine for a ‘smoother’ flavour, and mixed evaporated milk. The Hong Kong government recently included the meal as part of the territory’s “intangible cultural heritage”, and it clearly betrays the influence of British colonialism and its status as one of the world’s most important ports. Along similar lines, the café’s menu also includes a “macaroni soup” and “Swiss wings” – chicken coated in a sticky brown liquid that looks suspiciously like chocolate, but which is really a sweet soy sauce. “Because it was a colonial city, we borrowed and adapted a lot of our foods from cultures,” Cecilia tells me. It is for the same reason that the locals will happily cover their traditional dim sum in Worcester sauce. We next stop for a bowl of wonton noodle soup, topped with shrimp roe. Many of the wonton restaurants came via mass migration from mainland China many years ago, Cecilia and Silvana tell me – but like those Western dishes, the locals have now made it their own. “These people, when they came here, they had no skills, they were not educated – but they could make food for a living,” explains Silvana. For lunch, we taste the city’s famous roast meats, dripping with a glaze that turns my rice gold in the bowl – with a few detours into the markets and dried seafood shops selling shark fins and fish bladders eaten at important banquets. Many of the local foods are thought to have medicinal value, and along the way I stop off at a stall to buy a cup of kuding, or “bitter nail tea”. According to traditionalists, it is meant to disperse excess fire in the body, soothing the digestion, and sharpening the mind. I found its bitterness to be surprisingly invigorating – like a square of dark chocolate – though it is not always a hit with Cecilia’s tour groups. “You’re the first foreigner who’s ever told me that it’s refreshing!” she tells me. My first real test comes a little later with a bowl of a black jelly called guilinggao, made from ground-up turtle shells, which is meant to reduce acne and improve circulation. I had been too nervous to try it on my first trip to Hong Kong, but like my cup of kuding, it is pleasingly bitter, and slides soothingly across the tongue and down the throat. As I leave, I notice an Uber Eats sign at their entrance, offering home delivery – a sign of the ways that even the most traditional foods are being incorporated into the modern lifestyle. By the early afternoon, I’m already beginning to feel that I’ve at least caught a glimpse of the amazing fusion of culinary influences that have shaped Hong Kong’s diet today. And it seems to serve them well: with its emphasis on balance and moderation, the territory has one of the highest life expectancies in the world. But I’m intrigued to hear how new expats, unused to living in such a rich melting pot of cultures, adapt to the choice. Do they all learn to take advantage of the foods on offer? Cecilia says that most people tend to fall to the two extremes: she even knows one couple where the wife will eat everything, and the husband will try nothing new. Looking into the scientific literature, I found that psychologists describe those two “food personalities” as neophilia and neophobia. Studies have shown that neophobics exhibit significant signs of stress when facing unfamiliar foods, including increased pulse, fast breathing, and increased skin conductance from sweating. By influencing the variety of our diet, that fear of new foods may damage our overall health and wellbeing. Neophobics are more likely to be overweight, for instance, perhaps because they tend to opt for blander, more calorific foods. They also tend to show deficits in key nutrients, including proteins, monounsaturated fats, and minerals like magnesium. Such preferences may partly be down to our genes. Food neophobes tend to be more sensitive to a particular chemical, phenylthiocarbamide, that gives many foods their bitter tastes (and which, in nature, may have been a way of judging a plant’s toxicity). Such variation may explain why I find the kuding, guilinggao and stir-fried bitter melon to be pleasantly refreshing, while other visitors claim that the flavours are over-powering to the point of being revolting. But our food personalities may also be determined by a range of psychological factors. One study by Laith Al Shawaf, then at the University of Texas in Austin, found that food neophobic people seem to be more fearful of diseases and pests in general – suggesting it may be part of an overall heightened disgust response. An evolved fear of infection may be the reason that we are particularly suspicious of new types of meat, given that they may carry the greatest risk of food poisoning, he says. Intriguingly, Al Shawaf found that food neophobia also seemed to correlate with self-reported disgust in other domains – including sex – and it even appeared to be related to the kinds of relationships they preferred. “Those who are more oriented toward short-term mating and casual sex tend to be more food neophilic than those who are more inclined toward monogamy and committed mating,” says Al Shawaf, who is now based at Bilkent University in Turkey. Al Shawaf therefore wonders if a tendency to try new foods may also be a way of demonstrating the fact that we have a robust immune system, capable of dealing with the potential pathogens that may come from eating new foods. Whatever our current food personality, he thinks we can all learn to overcome our disgust response to some degree, through increased exposure to new tastes and textures. “There’s no reason to expect food neophobia to be set in stone,” he says. “It can change across the lifespan, from context to context, and as a function of mood and physiological state.” One study, from Phan Hong at the University of Wisconsin, found that adopting a deliberately attentive, mindful approach (akin to meditation) is best – apparently, the act of calmly observing and savouring the unfamiliar experience helps us to override the initial aversion. I experience this myself, once we reach the snake soup restaurant at Tai Po Market in the New Territories. In England, we have been conditioned to fear snakes, and the sight of its scaly flesh swimming in a swampy, viscous broth, would have once been hard for me to stomach. But after my day’s whistle-stop tour through Hong Kong’s culinary highlights, I decide to take my first spoonful. Far from being a trial to eat, the soup felt like a perfect, warming comfort food, with the snake itself offering a subtle fishy flavour, offset by the citric bite of the lemongrass. The locals believe it can improve circulation and fend off illness. It’s our last stop before our final destination – a restaurant on the top floor of the Tai Po wet market. Cecilia tells me that fresh, lightly seasoned seafood is the pride of the region, and so we order a gently steamed fish in black bean sauce, deep fried squid balls, and glutinous rice with a fresh crab. The art is in the precision of the steaming, Cecilia tells me. “If you leave it for just one minute too long it becomes a bit too tough.” Since the Cantonese word for “fish” sounds similar to the word for “leftovers”, the dish is often eaten at New Year’s celebrations to signify abundance and prosperity, she tells me. By the time we’re finished, I’m burning to explore more of Hong Kong’s hotspots on my own. Cecilia, who is a keen traveller herself, compares the process to learning a second language; it can take a while to adjust your mind to the new way of thinking, but once you have begun to absorb its vocabulary, there’s really no better way of getting to know a culture. “It’s really getting to the soul of who we are.” --- David Robson is a freelance writer.

risk appetite,Can pollution make you fat?,2024-09-15,2015-12-08,David Robson,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151207-the-air-that-makes-you-fat,"Some puzzling studies appear to show that tiny airborne particles may contribute to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Should we be concerned? Take a deep breath, and exhale. Depending on where you live, that life-giving lungful of air might just be pushing you towards diabetes and obesity. The idea that “thin air” can make you fat sounds ludicrous, yet some extremely puzzling studies appear to be showing that it’s possible. Two people can eat the same foods, and do the same exercise, but over the course of a few years, one may put on more weight and develop a faulty metabolism – thanks to the atmosphere around their home. Traffic fumes and cigarette smoke are the chief concerns, with their tiny, irritating particles that trigger widespread inflammation and disrupt the body’s ability to burn energy. While the short-term effects are minimal, over a lifetime it could be enough to contribute to serious disease – besides the respiratory illnesses more commonly associated with smog. “We are starting to understand that the uptake and circulation of air pollution in the body can affect more than just the lungs,” says Hong Chen, a researcher at Public Health Ontario and the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Canada. How strong is the evidence from these studies, and should you be concerned? Laboratory mice offered some of the earliest concrete clues that the effects of air pollution may penetrate far beyond the lungs. Their breeder at the Ohio State University, Qinghua Sun, had been interested in studying why city-dwellers seem to be at a particularly high risk of heart disease compared to country folk. Lifestyle, of course, could be one reason: in most major cities a fast food chain is rarely more than a block away, for instance, which might encourage unhealthy eating. Nevertheless, he wondered if another answer may be hanging, invisibly, in the air we breathe. To find out more, he started to raise laboratory mice in the kinds of conditions you might find across various cities. Some breathed filtered, clean, air, while others were funnelled the kinds of fumes you might find next to a motorway or busy city centre. Along the way, his team weighed the mice and performed various tests to study how their metabolism was functioning. After just 10 weeks, the effects were already visible. The mice exposed to the air pollution showed greater volumes of body fat, both around the belly and around the internal organs; at the microscopic level, the fat cells themselves were around 20% larger in the mice inhaling a fine mist of pollutants. What’s more, they seemed to have become less sensitive to insulin, the hormone that signals to cells to convert blood sugar into energy: the first step towards diabetes. The exact mechanism is still debated, but subsequent animal experiments suggest the air pollution triggers a cascade of reactions in the body. Small particles, less than 2.5 micrometres wide, are thought to be primarily to blame – the same minuscule motes of pollutant that give city air its gauzy haze. When we breathe in, the pollutants irritate the tiny, moist air sacs that normally allow the oxygen to pass into the blood stream. As a result, the lungs’ lining mounts a stress response, sending our nervous system into overdrive. This includes the release of hormones that reduce insulin’s potency and draws blood away from the insulin-sensitive muscle tissue, preventing the body from tightly controlling its blood sugar levels. The tiny irritating particles may also unleash a flood of inflammatory molecules called “cytokines” to wash through the blood, a response that also triggers immune cells to invade otherwise healthy tissue. Not only does that too interfere with the tissue’s ability to respond to insulin; the subsequent inflammation may also interfere with the hormones and the brain processing that govern our appetite, says Michael Jerrett at the University of California, Berkeley. All of which knocks the body’s energy balance off-kilter, leading to a constellation of metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity, and cardiovascular problems such as hypertension. Large studies from cities across the world suggest that humans might be suffering the same consequences. Chen, for instance, examined the medical records of 62,000 people in Ontario, Canada over a 14-year period. He found that the risk of developing diabetes rose by about 11% for every 10 micrograms of fine particles in a cubic metre of air – a troubling statistic, considering that the pollution in some Asian cities can reach at least 500 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Across the Atlantic, a Swiss study saw a similar signs of increased insulin resistance, hypertension, and waist-circumference in a sample of nearly 4,000 people living among dense pollution. The scientists have been particularly concerned about the effects on young children, with some concern that a mother's exposure to these pollutants may alter the baby's metabolism so they are more prone to obesity. Consider the work of Andrew Rundle at Columbia University, who studied children growing up in the Bronx. During pregnancy, the children’s mothers had worn a small backpack that measured the air quality as they went about their daily business, and over the next seven years the children’s health was monitored at regular intervals. Controlling for other factors (such as wealth and diet), the children born in the most polluted areas were 2.3 times more likely to be considered obese, compared to those living in cleaner neighbourhoods. Jerrett, meanwhile, has found that the risk can come from inside as well as outside the home: parental smoking, he showed, also led to faster weight gain among Californian children and teens. “It interacts synergistically with the effect of the air pollution,” he says – in other words, the combined risk was far greater than the sum of individual risks. Despite these troubling findings, we should be cautious about reading too much into them. “They only draw a link between exposure and outcome, but can’t prove that one factor causes another,” says Abby Fleisch at Harvard Medical School. Even so, her own findings would seem to agree with the general trend – she has shown that even in the first six months, babies of mothers living in polluted areas appear to put on weight more rapidly than those in cleaner areas – but she stresses that we still can’t be sure we haven’t neglected some other factor, besides pollution, that could explain the apparent link. Fortunately, a few teams are already searching for the missing pieces to fill those gaps in our knowledge with more detailed studies. Robert Brook at the University of Michigan and colleagues in China, for instance, recently tested a small group of subjects in Beijing over a two-year period. They found that whenever the city’s infamous smog descended, giveaway signs of developing problems like insulin resistance and hypertension peaked – providing more concrete evidence that the air quality was indeed driving changes to the metabolism. If the link is proven, how concerned should we be? The scientists stress that the individual, short-term risk to any one person is relatively small, and certainly shouldn’t be used as an excuse for obesity by itself, without considering other aspects of your lifestyle. But given the sheer number of people living in cities with high pollution, over the long term the total number of casualties could be enormous. “Everyone is affected by pollution to some degree,” says Brook. “It’s continuous, involuntary exposure, across billions of people – so the overall impact becomes much greater.” The solutions are familiar, if difficult to implement: restrict traffic pollution by promoting electric and hybrid vehicles, for instance. Jerrett suggests streets could also be redesigned to reduce the exposure to pedestrians and cyclists. In the short term, he points out that air purifiers could be added to more homes, schools and offices to filter out some of the harmful particles. Brook agrees that action needs to be taken internationally, both in the developing world and in cities like Paris and London that superficially, might seem to have their pollution under control. “In North America and Europe the pollution levels have been trending in right direction – but we shouldn’t rest on our laurels,” he says. “From the standpoint of improving health across the world, it should be one of our top 10 worries.” David Robson is BBC Future’s feature writer.

risk appetite,The coast overwhelmed with otters,2024-09-15,2020-08-19,Lesley Evans Ogden,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200818-the-canadian-sea-otter-rescue-plan-that-worked-too-well,"Sea otters were locally extinct in British Columbian waters in Canada, until a plane containing a romp of otters arrived and set off a population boom – with unintended consequences. Otters do not usually fly. But if sea otter elders in Checleset Bay told floating bedtime stories to modern day pups, they might tell of their ancestors’ bizarre flying adventure. Beginning in 1969, sea otters from Amchitka and Prince William Sound in Alaska were packed onto planes and flown on a long journey south. Canadian and US biologists had a plan – one they didn’t discuss with First Nations. Sea otter biologists hoped these otters would start a new colony in the forest-fringed waters of Checleset Bay, British Columbia. Otters were not entirely new on this section of windswept Pacific coast, but prior to these transplants the last sea otter seen in Checleset Bay was in 1929, just before it was shot. It wasn’t just this remote British Columbian bay where sea otters disappeared. Prized for their luxurious warm pelts, sea otters along vast stretches of the north Pacific Rim were decimated by the European fur trade of the 18th and 19th centuries. Historic population sizes, like the otters themselves, are fuzzy. But global estimates suggest sea otters numbered 150,000-300,000 in the early 1700s. By 1911, when an international treaty afforded the creatures some protection, they had shrunk to around 2,000. Now, the original Alaskan otters released into British Columbia waters have grown from a population of 89 to more than 7,000. In fact, the reintroduction of these early romps of otters has arguably been too successful, bringing a number of unintended consequences for British Columbia’s coastal First Nations. Tipping the balance As otter populations have grown – first slowly, now apace – other species they feed upon have been driven to scarcity, including the crabs, clams, abalone and shellfish that coastal First Nations communities formerly relied on. Rebounding otters are now so abundant that on some sections of British Columbian coast they are exhausting their own food supplies. That food squeeze lowers the survival of pups, driving pioneering males to seek food elsewhere. Females track behind causing the sea otter population to spread out and recolonise available habitat, explains Jenn Burt, a marine ecologist at Simon Fraser University who has been studying sea otters alongside First Nations collaborators. You might also like: Otter pressure is being felt most keenly by the Kyuquot/Checkleset First Nations who live at the epicentre of otter abundance: the site of their initial reintroduction. Before the otters returned, clams of many sizes and species were abundant on local beaches, recalls Saqᵂistl Hilda Hanson, an Elder of the Kyuquot/Checkleset Nation. “It was the best clam beach that ever was,” she said at a research workshop in 2018. Now that sea otters have returned, the clam cupboard is bare. Such traditional knowledge is supported by scientific data. Within one year of otter arrival at previously unoccupied sites on the Central Coast of British Columbia, territory of the Heiltsuk and Wuikinuxv First Nations, numbers of large sea urchins plummeted, a trend also seen from surveys on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Otter return has seen abalone numbers crash too, at some sites declining 16-fold, with similar trends for sea cucumbers in Alaska. For coastal First Nations in remote places like Kyuquot – at least five hours travelling time by dirt road, highway and boat from the nearest town – this has a huge impact. For these remote communities, “the supply of local shellfish is the grocery store – and has been forever”, says Burt. The loss of clams, sea urchins, crabs and other edible species easily harvested from the beaches year-round is felt acutely. It contributes, she says, to “a huge shift in food security and health”. Diving deep  Plenty is known about sea otter ecology. Iconic sleek swimmers, they bob on the waves by floating on their backs like humans lolling in a pool. One of the few marine mammals to use tools, sea otters pry loose and crack open hard-shelled prey like mussels using rocks like hammers and chisels underwater and on their bellies. These predators often feature in ecology students’ first lessons about keystone species and the waterfall of effects triggered by their extinction from communities – knowledge that emerged only after British Columbia’s otter reintroductions, and something scientists call an ecological cascade. But though sea otters have been the darlings of many a scientific study, there’s something most sea otter research has neglected: their coexistence with the humans that, pre-fur-trade, shared their habitat for thousands of years. This is an imbalance that First Nations knowledge holders and Elders, and a team of scientists led by Burt during her doctoral studies, are seeking to redress. To navigate the profound ecological shift from too few to what some argue is too many otters, their research took a human-centred look at solutions for smoothing the waters. To do that, they first had to understand the long history of otters on the British Columbian coast, and these mercurial animals’ relationship with humans. Otters are voracious shellfish eaters. And for at least 10,000 years, long before colonisation, British Columbia’s coastal First Nations harvested shellfish and managed otter populations too. University of Victoria archaeologist Iain McKechnie and his collaborators have gleaned evidence supporting this linked history from ancient coastal settlement sites. Looking within middens – ancient rubbish heaps – at the quantities of sea otter bones relative to those of other animals harvested by First Nations, they examined trends over time to estimate the abundance of otters. Geochemical information from the otter bones, with clues from stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, revealed the otters’ diets of the distant past. Chemical analysis revealed consistent diets over 5,000-plus years. That, suggests McKechnie, means otters were well fed and eating the things they liked to eat for centuries, until the fur trade upset the balance. In pre-colonial times, McKechnie’s work suggests, otters in coastal British Columbia never reached such high densities that competition drove them to look for new things to eat, like fish. That contrasts with what is happening with some modern-day otters, like those in California’s Monterey Bay and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. A consistent diet over time, says McKechnie, suggests that people coexisting with otters “were actively hunting and managing their landscapes”. Before European colonisation of the British Columbia coast, Burt’s research collaborator Wii-tsts-koom Anne Mack, Hereditary and elected Chief of Toquaht Nation, explains that for the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation, otter fur robes were a status symbol. “That’s how they would distinguish the chiefs,” Mack says. For the Haida, another Pacific coastal First Nation, head chiefs wore and lined beds with otter fur too, says Haida matriarch and scholar Kii’iljuus Barb Wilson. Long before the fur trade accelerated and led to some 99% of the animals being wiped out, sea otters were a culturally and economically important resource. First Nations developed multiple ways of managing sea otters, their co-competitors for shellfish. Beyond hunting otters for pelts in boats with paddles specially designed to quietly slip through kelp, they also defended the shoreline. It was the job of one family to dissuade hungry otters that attempted to rob shellfish, says Hup In Yook Tom Happynook, Huu-ay-aht Hereditary Whaling Chief of the Nuu-chah-nulth Nation. “My grandfather used to say that to deter the sea otters from coming onto the beach, they would kill a couple of them and anchor them… so that the sea otters that were coming in would see their cousins had been killed,” says Happynook. “Prior to colonialism being put upon us through the Fisheries Act and the Indian Act, our Hereditary Leaders had control over specific territories,” says Wilson. Controlling the area came with the responsibility for looking after everything in the territory. “That included the people, because people are very much a part of what is the ecosystem,” she says. Clam gardens – watery raised beds along the coast that created sheltered waters for shellfish cultivation – also had stone walls perhaps just high enough to impede otters climbing in for a feast. Department and Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) sea otter biologist Linda Nichol explains that while a river otter “can scoot around on the land quite well”, the hind paws of sea otters have “elongated to create flippers so they are quite awkward on land”. Nichol grew up around the Strait of Georgia, the protected narrow stretch of Pacific between Vancouver and Vancouver Island. She was a young child when sea otters were reintroduced to Checleset Bay. Checleset Bay otter numbers didn’t immediately take off. At first they struggled to adapt. By 1977, the original 89 had dipped down to 70. Somehow, just as sleeping otters cling to kelp, their population hung on and then began to grow. Similar translocations of Alaskan otters to the Washington and Oregon coast were not as successful. Colonies of otters in Oregon eventually blinked out, with sea otters in that state now found only in aquaria. On the island shores of Haida Gwaii , some 300km north-west of Checleset Bay, otters have been absent for a century but in recent years there have been periodic sightings of solitary otter males cruising by. With local reliance on shellfish, there is strong motivation to seek sea otter management solutions before more arrive along with their voracious appetites. As Burt’s collaborative study notes, First Nations were never consulted prior to British Columbia’s Checleset Bay sea otter reintroductions. “In that era there was a real recognition of major declines in species… and an overarching desire, where possible, to turn those things around,” says Nichol, who joined DFO in 2001 as part of a group monitoring otter recovery. Acknowledging the reintroduction era as one of disconnection with indigenous people, at that time, “a full grasp of the ecosystem shift that results from sea otters was also not yet well recognised”, she says. Smoothing the waters This story of sea otter conservation is part of a legacy of colonial-style conservation, says Anne Salomon, a socio-ecological systems researcher at Simon Fraser University, and originator of a broader Coastal Voices multimedia project, working with Burt and multiple First Nations. Protecting nature from people by treating humans and nature as separate rather than integrated, she elaborates, prioritises the well-being of an endangered species at the cost of impoverishing indigenous people who coexisted successfully with otters for millennia before Europeans arrived, historically managing numbers so that they, like the otters, could benefit from the shellfish bounty of the shores. Through Salomon and Burt’s research collaboration, combining indigenous knowledge and Western science, they are aiming to chart a middle ground, broadening the conversation surrounding sea otter recovery, says Salomon, “to one that focuses on social-ecological resilience and boldly addresses issues of equity, justice, and inclusivity”. To launch their more recent examination of otter-human interactions in British Columbia, Salomon and Wilson, her early partner on the project, wanted to gain the blessing of Hereditary Chief Councils of the Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida and Heiltsuk First Nations. Arriving in the massive room to present their research idea for review by assembled First Nation leaders, Salomon remembers feeling intimidated by the responsibility of forging positive relationships across cultures, the success of the project hanging in the balance. Wilson recalls turning to her to whisper “I’m so scared,” and Salomon whispering back “at least you’re First Nations!” The Hereditary Chiefs did give their blessing for the research to proceed. That affirmation led to the group’s 2014 workshop bringing together archaeologists, scientists, leaders and representatives from 19 First Nations across British Columbia and Alaska to discuss otter, shellfish, kelp and humans interactions and brainstorm coexistence solutions. Discussing the past, present and future, the researchers then surveyed attitudes and ideas of adults aged 19-96 in one Alaskan and one British Columbian community, places with contrasting timelines of rebounding otter coexistence. The people of the Kyuquot/Chekleset First Nations, living where biologists had introduced otters in the 1970s, had the least favourable view of the otters. “I feel like sea otters have more rights than I do,” says Skil Hiilans Allan Davidson, Hereditary Chief of the Haida Nation, one of Burt and Salomon’s coauthors. But in the Sugpiaq villages of Port Graham and Nanwalek, attitudes towards sea otters, which re-established there naturally in the 1950s, were more neutral or even positive. Though attitudes differed depending upon time since otter arrival, solutions suggested for improved coexistence converged on a desire for valuing indigenous knowledge, increasing indigenous authority and governance, and shared learning between indigenous communities around resource decision-making. The Sugpiaq people already hunt limited numbers of sea otters under a waiver to the US Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972) permitting hunting for processing and fashioning into handicrafts. But in Canada, despite otters reaching an abundance where the Species at Risk Act technically permits a First Nations licence to hunt otters for food, social or ceremonial purposes, a tense relationship between Canada’s Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and coastal First Nations has thus far not led to sanctioned sea otter hunting. That, this new research argues, needs to change, with First Nations rights to non-wasteful sea otter hunting part of new path forward. “First Nations are essentially in a never-ending battle of trying to assert their indigenous rights to manage resources,” says Burt. Though British Columbia was the first Canadian province to sign the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) into law in 2019, it has yet to be endorsed at a national level. “Each time we want to have one of the things we did pre-history… we have to go to court, and it’s dragged on for decades,” says Wilson. Canada has enacted blanket laws like the Fisheries Act and Indian Act that generically undermines rights of indigenous peoples to resource sovereignty on traditional territories. Yet in regaining the recognition of resource rights and sovereignty, “each nation has to go separately”, says Wilson. “It’s like having a bully at school.” Swimming forward Though a return to their once widespread global distribution is still not secured, in its ability to come back, the sea otter is a remarkable story of resilience, says Angela Doroff, scientist with the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s sea otter specialist group. Sea otters have some special traits that have made a comeback possible. These, she says, include “its diversity of prey, its ability to learn and share learning”. Shared learning, it appears, benefits otters and humans alike. From the beginning of the project, “we have all been willing to learn from each other and trust each other,” says Salomon. That positive relationship fostered between First Nations and Western scientists around study design, focus, and implementation, “is not typically done in science or resource management,” argues Salomon. “It ought to be. It needs to be,” she says. Towards more harmonious sea otter-First Nations coexistence, Wilson sees collaborations between scientists and indigenous communities as “the kind of outside the box [solutions] that we have to do”. From a purely species-driven ecological perspective, the sea otter boom along the British Columbian coast might seem like a simple success story. Otters were locally extinct. Now they are thriving and recolonising. But setting aside that narrow, colonialist conservation lens, a more complex picture emerges. The story of rebounding otters, notes Burt, “is a narrative where the costs and benefits differ depending on what perspective you come from”. With First Nations increasingly leading research efforts, the next chapter of the story could benefit from a new view: that the humans that have lived alongside otters for millennia are an important thread not separate from, but woven into the rich fabric of Pacific coast ecosystems. -- The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

risk appetite,Will humans destroy all life on Earth?,2024-09-15,2021-05-21,Santhosh Mathew,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210520-could-humans-really-destroy-all-life-on-earth,"The seemingly insatiable human tendency to consume is changing our planet and the life on it, but can we change our behaviour? Among the many global catastrophic risks known to humans, some are entertained in the media more than the others. Asteroid impacts, supervolcano eruptions and climate change have all received the Hollywood treatment. And each of these have taken a devastating toll on our planet's life in the past. Yet, unknown to many people, a new global threat capable of destroying life itself is brewing in the shadows of our everyday lives. It's driven by the immense human desire for material consumption. And paradoxically it is a consequence of human life itself. Just look around – you are inseparably surrounded by material objects ­– whether they are needed in your life or not. For every bit of this material we use, there is a growing web of global actions that is slowly stripping human's emotional health, depleting Earth's resources and degrading our planet's habitats. If left unchecked, is there a risk that human consumption may finally turn the Earth into an uninhabitable world? Do we have it in us to stop before it is too late? A team of researchers from Weizmann Institute of Sciences, Israel, recently published a study that compared human-made mass – aka anthropogenic mass – with all the living mass, or biomass, on the globe. They revealed that for the first time in human history the former has either surpassed the latter or is close to doing so in coming years. The Weizmann Institute study estimates that on average, each person on the globe now produces more anthropogenic mass than his or her bodyweight every week. ""The finding that anthropogenic mass – human made stuff - now weighs as much as all living things, and the fact that it keeps accumulating rapidly, gives another clear perspective on how humanity is now a major player in shaping the face of the planet,"" says Professor Ron Milo, whose laboratory conducted this study. ""Life on Earth is affected in a major quantitative manner by the actions of humans.""  This revelation comes as no surprise to many who consider that humans have already ushered in a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene – the age of humans, a term popularised by Nobel Laureate and chemist Paul Crutzen. While the exact beginning of this era is debatable, there is no denying that humans have become a dominant force on this planet, altering every other form of life through our actions. The scale and size of the anthropogenic matter is alarming. Take the case of plastic – the birth of the modern plastics era came only in 1907, but today we produce 300 million tons of plastics every year. Further, the realisation that after water, concrete is the most widely used substance on Earth is beyond comprehension. The massive geoengineering process initiated by humans took an accelerated upswing when materials like concrete and aggregates became widely available. These two materials make up a major component of the growth in anthropogenic mass. Even the relatively recent human adventures of space exploration, which began about 60 years ago, is triggering a disastrous space junk problem. Alongside this we haphazardly observe polar cap melts, permafrost thaws, and global temperatures getting hotter. You might also like to read: So, why has this happened? Are humans genetically inclined to be materialistic to the point of our own destruction? Is the accumulation of anthropogenic matter merely a measure of humans' annihilation rate? Or will nature equip humans to cope with this problem? These are highly unsettled questions. Although there is evidence that materialism is learned and shaped by culture, there are some who argue that natural selection may have predisposed our species with a desire to accumulate stuff. Our belongings can offer us a sense of security and status that doubtless played a more important role earlier in human history. Somehow, creating new stuff has become a divine word in the collective human psyche. It's obnoxiously seated in all our endeavours from ancient stories to modern research and development rooms. ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the Earth…"" goes the Genesis story in Bible. Humans have been conditioned to believe that creating something new is a meaningful purpose of life and is the only way to advance their ambitions. Yet we forget to put a cap on the use.   The limits of science have never been more glaringly apparent when trying to solve this conundrum. Reliance upon green technological solutions alone is flawed because the focus is still based on new stuff and more use – not to alter lifestyles or business models that handed us this problem in the first place. Even if we can replace all fossil fuel-based vehicles with electric ones, for example, cities are already struggling to take road space from cars and electric vehicles have their own footprint on the world's resources due to the materials needed to build them. ""The accumulation of anthropogenic mass also relates to urban development, along with its associated environmental implications, already witnessed worldwide,"" says Emily Elhacham, one of the authors of the Weizmann Institute of Sciences study. ""I hope that raising awareness would promote behavioral change that would enable finding a better balance point. Every step in this direction will have a positive effect."" Look at the carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet and the systems supporting. It accounts for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions, and is predicted to double by 2025. It's possible to cut down emissions with one less email or avoiding an unnecessary photo sharing on social media – it may seem like an insignificant reduction from one individual but then add billions of such small actions together. (Read more about the impact of our internet activity on the climate.) Big technology companies claim they are going green or set goals for carbon neutrality but they rarely encourage people to spend less time on social media or order fewer products. Rather advertising and marketing models convey powerful messages that reinforce the motto: create and consume more. This irrational savage materialism is ingrained so deeply with traditions and cultural symbols as well. In the United States, Thanksgiving is followed by another carnival called Black Friday. During this ritual, long lines of customers hit the malls and often get injured or trampled – but people are convinced that it's an effort worth the trouble. In the age of Anthropocene, humans may feel entitled to pin hope on technology to fix any problems so that they can continue to do what they are doing. Faced with the accumulation of long-lived plastic in the environment, for example, a spurt of innovation led to biodegradable coffee cups, bags for life and reusable straws. But while it is true that a sustainable growth model that includes our environment has much larger potential to persist, we need a different approach to sustainability that addresses our massive consumerism. The Covid-19 has reminded us how fragile and unprepared human civilisation is when it comes to even known knowns like a pandemic. It has also taught us that human behaviour can be modified with minor actions like wearing mask to mitigate the intensity of global tragedies. The passive approach to proliferation of anthropogenic mass is not merely due to the lack of knowledge about its impact, but in general, it has also to do with human inclination to dismiss facts that don't fit their worldview. Humans are naturally disposed to disregard issues that are not challenging their daily lives or those which dilute their convenience. Additionally, humans might find the solace in the thought that nature might equip organisms to survive, no matter what we do. It is true that the slow and gradual, Darwinian-style evolution through natural selection is often overtaken in certain extremely polluted environments. In 2016, a team of scientists in Japan found a strain of bacteria from bottle recycling facility that can break down and metabolise plastic. On the other hand, this finding shows the subtle and powerful ways in which human actions are changing the life on this planet. The adaptation of organisms in response to pollutants is a complex phenomenon. ""In the long term, a sustained increase of anthropogenic mass would lead to the loss of habitats through physical dislocation and alteration of habitats such as contamination with pollutants resulting from the production and disposal of anthropogenic mass,"" says Alessandra Loria, a biologist at McGill University, Canada, who is the lead author of this study. Research indicates that negative effects induced by pollution often worsen over multiple generations, although the coping mechanism vary in different species.  The rapid depletion of natural resources and biodiversity is not a normal evolutionary race that nature is used to. While some species can certainly adapt to the changes taking place in our environment, humans are no longer a mere species that follows Darwinian evolution but a much larger force that has come to drive evolution on this planet. Studies have shown that for most species, evolutionary adaptation is not expected to be sufficiently rapid to buffer the effects of environmental changes being wrought by human activity. And our own species will be no exception to this. While there is no proof that we will destroy ourselves, there are clear indications that we ignore the effects at our own peril. For example, some of the mass extinctions in the Earth's history are related to acidification of oceans. The oceans absorb about 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, which in turn increases the ocean acidity. The oceans may be acidifying faster today than they did in the last 300 million years, primarily due to human activities. ""Human life will be negatively affected because of the loss of the many ecosystem benefits and services provided by biological diversity,"" says Loria. ""For example, water pollution may affect provisioning services, such as food and water, by causing a reduction in food diversity and/or in its quality and safety. Widespread degradation of ecosystems threatens the conditions of life on Earth, in particular the long-term survival of our own species."" Our impact on the planet is much is deeper than carbon footprints or global warming. It points to a future where the effects of anthropogenic matter will take over – if it hasn't already – the identity of the Earth and its life. In the face of this, humans themselves might lose out in the evolutionary race. Eliminating materials like concrete or plastic or replacing them with alternatives is not going to address the fundamental problem with human attitudes and our unparalleled appetite for more. This is exactly where materialism can seamlessly transform into a known unknown risk factor in global catastrophe. The myriad of ways in which it can turn this planet into a mundane world is something our civilisation has never experienced before. In the absence of a fully secure evolutionary shield, we could depend on our intelligence to survive. Nevertheless, as Abraham Loeb, professor of science at Harvard University and an astronomer who is searching for dead cosmic civilisations puts it, ""the mark of intelligence is the ability to promote a better future"". ""If we continue to behave this way, we might not survive very long,"" he says. ""On the other hand, our actions could be a source of pride for our descendants if they sustain a civilisation intelligent enough to endure for many centuries to come."" The story of Bhasmasura in Hindu Mythology offers an eerie parallel to the impact of materialism. As a devotee of Lord Shiva, he obtains a boon from Shiva, which empowers him to turn anyone into ashes with a mere touch on the head. Immediately after gaining this magical ability, he tries to test it on Shiva himself. Shiva manages to escape, the story goes. But humans may not be lucky enough to flee from their own actions. Unless, we offer a different vision rooted in reduction of consumption, the flames of our own materialism might consume both us and our Pale Blue Dot. * Santhosh Mathew is a professor of physics and astronomy Regis College, Greater Boston, and a science writer who has authored two books. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,The 'raunchy' hit that is anything but,2024-09-15,2023-06-28,Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230627-no-hard-feelings-jennifer-lawrence-in-hollywoods-coyest-sex-comedy,"Jennifer Lawrence's latest film No Hard Feelings is R-rated and sold itself as raunchy – but is actually ""tame and inoffensive"", writes Caryn James. Is it a comment on today's ""Puriteens""? In a widely reported comment about her punningly-titled No Hard Feelings, Jennifer Lawrence said: ""Everybody in some sense will be offended by this film – you're welcome."" Wishful thinking on her part. Tame and inoffensive, No Hard Feelings is Hollywood's coyest sex comedy. Lawrence's character, Maddie (who's 32), is hired by 19-year-old Percy's parents to ""date"" him, as they put it, so he doesn't head off to college a virginal wallflower. That high concept was so full of edgy comic potential that Sony's publicity and the media coverage bought into the studio's talking points about the film being outrageous and subversive. In fact, it's retro, following the lead of Pretty Woman, playing into the ""Wholesome Escort"" meme. But that coyness reveals larger social trends. The modest success of its opening weekend – Variety characterised the $15m US box office as ""not bad"" – speaks to the audience's hunger for sex comedies, even this bland one. Yet the film also reveals how cautious Hollywood studios remain about sex, especially at a time when the cultural politics of the US is torn between an ever-more conservative right wing and the progressive left.  More like this:  - The 1998 film that predicted the future  - David Lynch on 'the beauty in the dark'  - Dating culture's most toxic stereotype Maddie is set up as the most sympathetic of sell-outs, a financially-strapped Uber driver whose car is repossessed just when she's trying to save the house her mother left her. In one of the more realistic, funnier scenes, Maddie and her best friend go through worse reasons they've had sex, including not wanting to make the commute home at night. To them, sex is no big deal, so why not get a car out of it? Except in this movie, it is such a big deal that Percy resists. As Owen Gleiberman said in his Variety review: ""No Hard Feelings is the first Hollywood comedy about a teenager losing his virginity in which the teenager in question has no apparent desire to lose his virginity."" It might sound as if No Hard Feelings is playing into the ""Puriteen"" concept: the idea, which many have questioned, that Generation Z doesn't have much sex. Maddie even asks at a high school party, ""Doesn't anyone [have sex] anymore?"" – using a common, but unquotable here, term. But the generational allusions are no more than throwaway lines. In the film, Percy is actually depicted as out of step with other people his age. He doesn't drive. He doesn't drink. He stands out at the party where others are pairing off and heading into bedrooms where, even if Maddie doesn't see them at it, they probably have sex. He's not typical, but an anomaly. That's part of the joke. The fact that No Hard Feelings is a comedy really matters. Recent articles have cited the lack of sex in movies today, looking back to a freer period and suggesting an appetite for more freewheeling films. Karina Longworth's podcast You Must Remember This has seasons called Erotic 80s and Erotic 90s, and the Criterion Channel has a programming package called Erotic Thrillers. But in thrillers, sex is fraught with danger. A comedy has to accept sex as a part of life for it to be funny. No Hard Feelings only pretends to accept it as the plot heads to a sentimental ending about Maddie and Percy finding themselves. The upcoming, very funny Joy Ride (opening on 7 July) is everything No Hard Feelings pretends to be. Four Asian-American friends, three female (including Oscar nominee Stephanie Hsu) and one non-binary, travel to China in a comedy that is sex positive, full-on raunchy (several basketball players they meet incur sex-related injuries) and outrageous in the style of 2017's Girls Trip. Joy Ride has its own sentimental ending, but sex isn't part of that emotional dynamic the way it is in No Hard Feelings. Girls Trip, which even created an outlandish sex scene between a grapefruit and a banana as demonstrated by Tiffany Haddish, was a commercial hit for Universal in 2017. But it looks like major studios have gotten more cautious since then. In today's climate of book banning, restricted abortion rights and attempts to ban drag, it's no wonder that Sony is trying to have it both ways with No Hard Feelings, talking up the raunchiness in a bid to draw viewers even while the movie tones it down. The film's director, Gene Stupnitsky, was more accurate than Lawrence when he told The Hollywood Reporter, ""We took great pains to be careful about the ick factor."" Joy Ride is getting a wide release by Lionsgate, not a tiny indie but not a megastudio. And Vulture has pointed out that its financing structure makes it less of a commercial risk than many movies, so presumably the filmmakers had more latitude than Hollywood's big studios would allow today.  If Joy Ride is a success, it might open the door to more comedies that are actually about sex, not non-sex. And if No Hard Feelings continues to do well, or well enough, it will be because of Lawrence. Her slapstick moments and comic delivery are winning, even though she is portraying an old-fashioned, good-hearted, sex-for-money Hollywood type. Love film and TV?

risk appetite,Will China soon lead in fashion?,2024-09-15,2014-10-21,Harriet Quick,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140131-will-china-soon-lead-in-fashion,"Chinese consumers are turning away from ostentatious displays of wealth and discovering a new, more understated sense of luxury, reports Harriet Quick. For the last ten years or more, the world’s luxury businesses have been buoyed up on what seemed an insatiable appetite for new, status goods in China. But a soberer and subtler taste in fashion and luxury goods is emerging as the country’s economic boom slows. President Jin Ping has instilled anti-bribery measures that curb the habit of ‘gifting,’ a practice worth millions of dollars in sales each year. Self-styling is replacing ensembles straight from the look book. More discreet logos and designs from Saint Laurent and Celine are propelling taste in handbags and appreciation is growing for the dark romance of designers like The Row and Alexander McQueen. “Vogue readers now know their Haider Ackermann from their Balmain,” says Anjelica Cheung, editor-in-chief of Vogue China. “When we launched the title in 2005 we were running features and profiles at great length to be able to explain the heritage and background as a form of education – now, those same features are on two pages. What’s needed now is an expert point of view to help readers find their own style and stand out.” From being fashion followers, certain pockets in China are home to emerging tastemakers who are revelling in their own strength of self-expression, valuing artisanship and heritage over flash and obvious signs of wealth. In creative, fashion-forward circles in Shanghai, you can witness men wearing togas and turbans over skinny jeans and shirts at a time when designers are exploring possibilities of skirts and tribal layers on the menswear catwalk in London.  Come spring, you can bet that the nation’s female fashion leaders will be availing themselves of boxy midriff tops, swishy prom skirts and hybrid surf sandals. It is the rate of change from ‘nouveau’ to individualistic that is startling. In Japan, following the economic boom of the 1980s – a period that witnessed an unprecedented appetite for status luxury items – tastes evolved at a gradual pace edging towards the more artistic and expressive in a shift that was to slowly percolate down from the fashion crowd to the general population. More than three decades later and Japan holds its own as a leader in fashion. By comparison, the pace of change in some pockets of China has accelerated. What might be expected to evolve over ten years or more is happening in five years or less. “The cycle and speed of change is much faster than before, due to the rapid pace of the fashion industry itself, the avail of the internet – where knowledge and images of fashion are transmitted on a much more frequent basis – and also to do with the shift of influencers and fashion authorities, “ explains Shaway Yeh, group style editorial director of the Modern Media Group, which publishes a stable of fashion and art publications and apps including the lifestyle title, Modern Weekly. “What’s important to note is that Japan is a relatively homogenous market – smaller scale, more uniform taste – so it is easier to spot the direction of trends. China is a stratified society, where the differences between first tier cities and the third or fourth tiers are huge, not only in terms of taste and lifestyle, but also the availability of merchandise and access to products. The top tier fashionista or luxury customer may have already cultivated a sophisticated sense no different to people in Paris or New York, while the local trendsetters at third or fourth tier cities may still [be] following the trends of last year,” Yeh says. Looking out The impact of foreign travel is also influencing tastes as a growing number of Chinese are not only shopping abroad – taking advantage of lower taxations on luxury goods – but they are also bringing back inspiration. Over 100m Chinese are expected to travel abroad this year. Indeed when it comes to taste, China is dividing and sub-dividing into a highly intricate layer cake, making it ever more complex pin down. Even among the wealthy and privileged in one city there might be multiple style directions. Lane Crawford prides itself on being the first luxury department store in China. It was founded in Hong Kong and opened a 150,000 sq ft flagship in Shanghai in October 2013 and another store in Chengdu will soon follow. Its expansion suggests a growing confidence in consumers shopping outside of the single brand designer outlets that have dominated the luxury landscape to date. “You can never generalise with China as it’s so vast and every city and its population has its idiosyncrasies. Beijing, because it’s the power base of government and has a need for appropriate business attire. Shanghai is very fashion-forward and less about business needs,” says Lane Crawford’s fashion director, Sarah Rutson. “In general, however we are seeing a ground-swell [of] desire across all locations for new, more niche brands. Customers want to show off something that other people feel compelled to ask about – something is luxurious when it is hard to get or find and not seen everywhere.” The steer towards things that are original marks a paradigm shift. Remember: the mothers and grandmothers of this fashion-savvy generation wore Mao suits – even handbags and lipsticks were a rarity. The penalties associated with overt displays of vanity were simply too high to risk. But things couldn’t be more different now. What’s new, whether it’s the latest Samsung device or the newest La Prairie skin care, now holds tremendous interest. There’s no better affirmation of the power of novelty than being asked about your latest acquisition. Whereas Britons and Americans are keen to play things down (“I’ve had this for years”, “I bought it at sale”), the Chinese like to announce the freshness of their purchases. New kids on the block Such a shift in tastes and attitudes is paving the way for an emergent generation of Chinese designers who are surfing on a growing pride for products and designs that are ‘Made in China’. At Lane Crawford, you can discover the romantic modern designs of Ms Minn, flamboyant prints from Chictopia and clean simplicity of Helen Lee’s designs. “They are not copyists or derivative,” says Rutson. Meanwhile, a host of Chinese-born but Western-trained designers are coming to the fore. London-based Huishan Zhang is rapidly gaining a reputation for his artful fusion of traditional Chinese motifs and embellishments and modern shapes. “The younger generations are not afraid to step out of the safety net of established luxury and they are starting to define their own individualistic sense of style by choosing younger, more up and coming designers and above all choosing home-grown talent,” says Zhang who debuted at London Fashion Week in 2010. “The Chinese consumer is very good at this and has been moving away from logo heavy design for a long time but due to the size of China and how big it is we are only just starting to pick up on it now.” “My heritage is full of beautiful craftsmanship and history with a strong understanding of femininity and luxury. Expressing that with a modern twist and being proud of that is where all the potential is for Chinese talent,” says Zhang. It only seems a matter of time before the avant-garde taste for individuality further evolves into a ‘Made in China,’ homegrown style that will be applauded at home and abroad.

risk appetite,When does a joke go too far?,2024-09-15,2015-08-04,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150804-comedy-in-the-age-of-outrage-when-jokes-go-too-far,"Audiences today can be so sensitive to edgy jokes they publicly shame the comedians who make them. Have we lost our sense of humour? Nicholas Barber reports. Warning: this article may offend some readers. To be honest, it probably won’t, but it does include several remarks made by comedians, and there is a growing feeling that comedians can no longer say anything without offending somebody. All it takes is one joke to be taken out of context and quoted on Twitter or Facebook, and a comic can expect a storm of invective from people who are either outraged or pretending to be.  Trevor Noah is one such comic. In March, he was appointed as the new host of The Daily Show, and the following day he was pilloried on social media because six out of the 9,000 Tweets he had posted were deemed sexist or anti-Semitic. Other comedians saw this response as part of a worryingly hysterical trend. Patton Oswalt argued that the kind of instantaneous liberal outrage heaped on Noah “is going to hurt the progressive movement in this country more than anything”. Jim Norton wrote a feature for Time, stating that Americans were addicted to the buzz of being offended. “Western culture as a whole,” he continued, “has become an increasingly reactionary mob of self-centered narcissists who all have their own personal lines drawn in the sand. A comedian is fine unless he crosses their particular line, which, of course, in the mind of a self-centered narcissist, is the only line that matters.” What appears to be happening is that audiences are more sensitive than ever to perceived insults, and that they now have the technology to share that sensitivity with the world. In May, Louis CK talked about paedophilia in an opening monologue on Saturday Night Live, and he didn’t have to wait long for the inevitable Twitter backlash. Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock, meanwhile, have said that college audiences have become too quick to condemn a joke as racist or sexist. Rock has gone further, telling New York Magazine that he has started to censor himself at gigs in case someone is recording him on their phone. Once upon a time, comedians could try out an edgy joke in front of a small crowd, and if it was greeted by gasps instead of laughs, they would know not to tell it again. Now, though, the edgy joke can be broadcast to an almost limitless number of people via social media, so comedians are forced to be more careful. “If you think you don’t have room to make mistakes,” said Rock, “it’s going to lead to safer, gooier stand-up.” It’s a proposition that Jon Ronson examines in his new book, So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed. Over the course of three years, Ronson spoke to people who had been demonised for posting a single tasteless joke on Twitter or Facebook. The more he investigated, he says, the more he came around to the Patton Oswalt/Jim Norton point of view. “There’s a despicable ruthlessness coming from the ‘outrage’ camp which is destroying people’s lives,” says Ronson. “For every little bit of good it does for social justice, it does a terrible amount of harm. Twitter is like the Stasi: a surveillance network which declares war on behaviour that is considered un-Stasi-like.” PC or not PC? Even in the real, non-Twitter world, it’s not just Seinfeld and Rock who have noticed how tetchy audiences are becoming. “There’s a tendency now for sections of crowds to boo in the middle of a joke,” says Glenn Wool, a Canadian regular on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast. “They hear a word that they don’t like and they boo. It’s wrong. You can disagree with a joke, you can walk out on a joke, but you shouldn’t boo in the middle of it, because then you’re deciding if anyone else in the audience gets to hear it – and no one elected you the leader.” Tiff Stephenson, a comic and actor who appeared on BBC2’s The Office, blames this development on smartphones. “What you get now is people in comedy clubs who keep checking their phone,” she says. “They’re not really paying attention, but when they hear a certain trigger word, like ‘abortion’ or ‘suicide’, they pop up and get offended, even though they haven’t actually been listening to the routine.”  As irritated as comedians are by these kneejerk reactions, Nish Kumar of Comedy Central’s The Alternative Comedy Experience believes that an audience’s outrage is sometimes justified. “People are conflating two separate trends,” he says. “I find the practice of tweeting things out of context to be very scary, but political correctness is something different. I don’t think it’s a bad thing for comics to consider the impact of the words they’re choosing, and I don’t think it’s killing comedy. Jerry Seinfeld is a hero of mine, so I take what he says very seriously, but I’m not sure why he would want to undo the good work that’s already been done to make comedy more responsible. I’m certain he wouldn’t like it if someone did a routine that was anti-Semitic or racist.” For Kumar, Seinfeld’s grumblings about political correctness echo those of the bluff, bigoted comics who held sway on British television in the 1970s, “the era of white men in bow ties telling jokes about their Pakistani neighbours”. When alternative comedy came along in the 1980s, Bernard Manning and his peers suddenly found that they were out of touch and out of fashion. Could it be that Seinfeld and Rock, likewise, have simply failed to keep up with social progress? As Wool puts it, “They’re just coming to terms with the fact that they’re not very cool any more.”  Shock and awe Ronson isn’t convinced. “It’s a really interesting analogy, but Bernard Manning and that 1970s crowd were imperialistic misogynists who were all about maintaining the sexist, racist status quo. Their kind of comedy needed to be overthrown. But things are different now. These days, there’s no discernment. Nobody seems to be able to tell the difference between a racist joke and a liberal joke that comments on racism. The condemnation is harder and colder now, too. Someone whose joke lands badly is being treated with the same ferocity as a racist cop in Texas. They’re treated as if their secret evil has been uncovered, but some misjudged gag at a comedy club is not the clue to someone’s secret evil. Young people have decided it is, but it’s not. ” The Twittersphere’s self-righteous fury isn’t the whole story, though. The irony is that, at the same time as people are getting hot under the collar about a ‘misjudged gag’ here and there, there are signs that outrageous comedy is on the rise. After all, Louis CK’s Saturday Night Live monologue may have appalled viewers, but it was, nonetheless, broadcast across the US by a major television network. Two of this year’s most profitable film comedies, Ted 2 and Trainwreck, are stuffed with jokes so rude that they would have given censors a heart attack a decade ago. And that’s even before we get to podcasts and YouTube videos. There may be new platforms from which to complain about offensive comedy, but there are also new platforms where that offensive comedy can be seen.  “You may get a bit of abuse on Twitter, but I don’t think comedians are being silenced,” says Hal Cruttenden, a veteran of ITV’s Sunday Night at the Palladium and BBC1’s Live at the Apollo, “because people will always look for something that might shock them. They have an appetite for hearing something edgy, something that hasn’t been controlled. If you look at some of the things that Frankie Boyle got away with on Mock the Week [on BBC2], it’s amazing.” Boyle embodies our current contradictory attitudes towards risk-taking comedy. The Scottish stand-up is notorious for his dark material, but if his jokes had been “safer and gooier”, he would never have become such a big star. In July, campaigners asked for his show at Belfast’s Féile an Phobail festival to be cancelled because one of his jokes, five years ago, had involved Down’s Syndrome. It’s a sign of the times that people are protesting loudly about a comedian – but it’s also a sign of the times that the show is going ahead.  “It wasn’t the festival’s intention to upset anyone,” a Féile an Phobail spokesman told the Independent newspaper. “But it’s been the fastest selling comedy gig that that they have ever put on, and that’s the simple fact of the matter.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
risk appetite,Can major world events be predicted?,2024-09-15,2019-04-12,David Robson,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190411-how-to-make-wiser-judgements-about-the-future,"Forecasting the future is far from easy, but there is a way to hone your skills no matter who you are. Will the UK leave the EU within 2019? Will the US House of Representatives impeach Trump this year? Will a man or a woman win the Democratic primary? How you answer these questions is not simply a matter of intelligence or education. A four-year forecasting tournament, the Good Judgment Project, tested thousands of people’s abilities to predict world events. The top performers were educated, for sure, but their performance also relied on many styles of thinking that are not measured in traditional academic tests. They also represented a mix of genders, ages and backgrounds. Take the example of Elaine Rich, a pharmacist from a Maryland suburb, who signed up in her 60s and quickly excelled in making the tournament’s probability-based predictions. As she told NPR, world affairs had never been her forte and she hadn’t studied maths in college. But with a bit of training, she ended up performing in the top 1% of forecasters. As the project leader, Philip Tetlock, wrote in his book Super-forecasting: “A brilliant puzzle-solver may have the raw material for forecasting, but if he doesn’t also have an appetite for questioning basic, emotionally charged beliefs, he will often be at a disadvantage relative to a less intelligent person who has a greater capacity for self-critical thinking.” If you fancy testing your own forecasting skills, BBC Future has teamed up with Good Judgment and the UK innovation foundation Nesta to launch our own forecasting challenge that is open to anyone to join. You may find that you already have an amazing talent for predicting the future – but don’t worry if you initially underperform. With a little practice, anyone can improve their prediction abilities on all kinds of issues, and in time you may see other benefits too, such as a boost in open-mindedness. If you would like to learn more about the science of making wiser judgements before joining the challenge, read on... The question of what constitutes good judgement has troubled philosophers for millennia, along with the suspicion that raw brainpower, alone, is not enough for truly wise insights. Indeed, according to Rene Descartes, it may even push us to greater error. “The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues,” he wrote in the 17th Century. “Those who go forward but very slowly can get further, if they always follow the right road, than those who are in too much of a hurry and stray off it.” As I write in my book The Intelligence Trap, cutting-edge psychological research now offers some very precise ways in which greater brainpower drive us down the wrong track. Consider the phenomenon of “motivated reasoning”. When we think about emotionally charged issues – particularly those associated with our identities – we don’t apply our thinking in an even-handed way to appraise the evidence at hand. Instead, we may simply use it to rationalise our existing viewpoint and demolish any arguments that contradict those views. And the more intelligent or knowledgeable you are, the easier it may be to build elaborate arguments that support your point of view. JOIN THE CHALLENGE Predicting the future is impossible – but signing up and participating will hone your skills and could make you a better forecaster than your peers.“When you’re part of the challenge, you’ll get feedback on how accurate your forecasts are. You’ll be able to see how well you do compared to other forecasters. And there’s a leader board, which shows who the best performing forecasters are,” says Kathy Peach, who leads Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence Design. It's also possible there will be unexpected upsides. “New research shows that forecasting increases open-mindedness, the ability to consider alternative scenarios and reduces political polarisation,” adds Peach. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up for the You Predict The Future challenge now [Update: The challenge is now closed], and take the first step to becoming a better, wiser, and more even-handed forecaster.  We can see this most clearly with views on global warming. Among Democrats, more numerate and scientifically literate people are more likely to endorse the view that human emissions are causing climate change; but among Republicans, the exact opposite is true. The more numerate and scientifically literate participants are more likely to deny the effect of human emissions on the environment. Researchers have now observed similar patterns on many other issues – from gun control to fracking and stem cell research –  where greater knowledge seems to increase political polarisation. If you’re trying to predict the outcome of something emotionally charged like Brexit, motivated reasoning is almost certainly skewing your thinking. Besides motivated reasoning, smart people may also suffer from “earned dogmatism” – in which your perceptions of your own expertise cause you to become more closed-minded. If you had a politics degree, for instance, you may have a tendency to ignore new evidence that contradicts your preconceptions – because you feel that you know everything there is to know already. Not every smart person falls for these traps, of course. It depends on whether your intelligence is complemented by some other traits that ensure you use it wisely. Take curiosity. Both questionnaires and behavioural measures confirm that some people are naturally more curious than others – for them, learning new facts is a reward in its own right (and even creates a dopamine kick in the brain). Do you actively seek new knowledge? And would you get the itch to read a newspaper article on a favourite subject, even if it threatens to challenge your assumptions? These people appear to be less likely to allow their views to be skewed by their political affiliations, since their hunger for new knowledge trumps any dogmatic tendencies. But there are many intelligent people who do not have this hunger for knowledge for its own sake. You might also enjoy: Psychologists are also interested in the protective potential of “intellectual humility” – essentially, how easily you can admit that you are wrong. Once again, this can be measured by questionnaires. People with greater intellectual humility are less likely to hold polarised, dogmatic views. Instead, they appraise the evidence at hand and to listen to alternative points of view. In the initial Good Judgment Project, the super-forecasters with the most accurate insights showed just this kind of thinking – they checked their confidence, and were quick to admit their mistakes and update their opinions when new evidence emerged. People who were most prone to rigid closed-minded thinking, dogmatism, and arrogance, in contrast, performed much worse – no matter what their IQ and academic credentials. Fortunately, our minds are malleable: anyone can learn to avoid blinkered reasoning. One technique is the “consider the opposite” strategy, in which you deliberately occupy the alternative stance and argue against your initial intuitions, a practice that has been shown to reduce a range of self-serving biases. (You can read more about that here.) There is also evidence that learning about logical fallacies and common thinking errors can help you to think more rationally about the news you consume, so that you appraise information based on the quality of the arguments – rather than whether it simply aligns with your existing beliefs. And a very basic refresher in ways to calculate risk and uncertainty can help improve your overall decision making on a range of issues – such as health, finance, and politics. Good thinking can be learnt – and our new forecasting tournament might be a perfect opportunity to sharpen your judgements. The practice of forecasting forces you to turn your intuitions and beliefs into testable hypotheses that can be proven or disproven. As a result, you will learn to overcome your motivated reasoning and earned-dogmatism – if you suffer from them – and you’ll develop a better understanding of risk and uncertainty. There’s evidence suggesting participants in forecasting tournaments can improve their accuracy with training. And what’s more, compared to a control group, the participants in a forecasting competition went on to show greater intellectual humility and reduced polarisation on a range of issues – including those that had not been discussed in the tournament itself. They had learnt to question their assumptions and to look beyond the blinkers of their ideology. So why not sign up to our project and see how you fare? [The challenge is now closed.] Whether you wish to be a super-forecaster or you simply want to develop a more rational understanding of the world around you, you might be surprised by what you find. -- David Robson is a senior journalist at BBC Future.

risk appetite,What we know about gut health,2024-09-15,2019-01-22,Jessica Brown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190121-what-we-do-and-dont-know-about-gut-health,"The microbiome inside our bodies dictates many aspects of our health – and is as individual as we are.    Inside your gastrointestinal (GI) tract are trillions of micro-organisms, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. You have roughly the same number of micro-organisms in there, mostly in the large intestine, as you do human cells in your entire body. But only 10% to 20% of the bacteria you have in your gut will be shared with anyone else. These microbiomes differ hugely from person to person, depending on diet, lifestyle and other factors, and they influence everything from our health to our appetites, weight and moods. But despite being one of the most-researched parts of the body, there's still a long way to go to fully understanding our guts. BBC Future reviewed the findings of some of the science so far. Diet Our diets have a huge influence the gut microbiome. Research has found links between Western diet, typically high in animal fat and protein and low in fibre, with increased production of cancer-causing compounds and inflammation. The Mediterranean diet, on the other hand, which is typically high in fibre and low in red meat, has been likened to increased levels of faecal short-chain fatty acids, which have been found to have anti-inflammatory effects and improve the immune system. Scientists hope that population-wide research will advance existing findings. One such project, the ongoing American Gut Study, is collecting and comparing the gut microbiomes of thousands of people living in the US. So far, research suggest those whose diets include more plant-based foods have a more diverse microbiome, and one that is ""extremely different"" from those who don't, says Daniel McDonald, the project's scientific director. You might also like: ""We can't say one end is healthy or unhealthy yet, but we suspect that those who are eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables have very healthy microbiomes,"" he says. However, McDonald adds, it's unclear if and how radically switching from a diet high in plant-based food to a diet low in healthy food would change the microbiome. Probiotics  There has been a lot of hype around the health benefits of prebiotics and probiotics in recent years, but while they're increasingly used in treatments including inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, several reviews suggest there needs to be further research on which strains and dosages are effective. Eran Elinav, an immunologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, has recently found that some people are immune to probiotics – although he did this in a relatively small study that would require future research to come to any concrete answers. He gave 25 healthy individuals either 11 strains of probiotics or placebos, and tested their microbiomes and gut function with colonoscopies and endoscopies before and three weeks after the intervention.   Microbes & me The life inside all of us Microbes & me is a new collaborative series between BBC Future and BBC Good Food. In the series, we’ll be looking at recent research into the microbiome of bacteria that lives inside us. We’ll be exploring how it affects our health, what could be having detrimental effects on it, and recommending recipes that might help it thrive. ""People could be divided into two groups – those in which probiotics were welcomed by indigenous microbiome and allowed to colonise the GI tract, where probiotics were able to change the microbiome, and those who were resistant. In this group, the probiotics weren't allowed to settle in, and did almost nothing,"" he says. The researchers were able to predict which category a person would fall into by examining features in their microbiome. Elinav says his findings suggest a need for more advanced tailoring to personalise probiotics to the needs of individuals. Health  Gut microbiota has a major role to play in the health and function of the GI tract, with evidence that conditions such as as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often coincide with altered microbiota. But it also plays a much wider role in our health, and this is largely determined in the first few years of life. Our microbiomes start developing when we're born, when microbes colonise the human gut. Babies delivered by natural birth have been found to have higher gut bacterial counts than those delivered by Caesarean section because of the contact they make with their mother's vaginal and intestinal bacteria, says Lindsay Hall, microbiome research leader at Quadram Institute Bioscience. ""C-section-born infants miss out on that initial inoculation, and some of the microbes they come into contact with will be from the skin and environment"" says Hall. ""This is very important for infants to develop their immune systems. Recent work has suggested that disturbances in early life gut microbiome have negative consequences for host health,"" she says. ""Numerous studies have shown that C-sections affect health long-term, and there's strong evidence to suggest they lead to a higher risk of developing allergies, and a less robust ecosystem, meaning you're more susceptible to changes and disturbances, such as antibiotics. “However, there is no robust evidence on what this difference means specifically for the immune system."" There are also differences in the microbiomes of breast-fed and formula-fed babies. Bifidobacterium, a group of bacteria associated with health, are often found in the guts of babies who are breast-fed. ""We know that Bifidobacterium are able to digest components found in breast milk. These components are not normally found in formula milk, which is why formula-fed babies have less of them,"" Hall says. Scientists are getting closer to understanding how the gut can also be used to treat disease. One of the newest treatments in the field is faecal microbiota transplants, where a healthy person's microbiota is put into a patient's gut. The procedure is used to treat antibiotic-resistant intestinal bacteria clostridium difficile, which can infect the bowel and cause diarrhoea. Though there's no conclusive evidence on the underlying mechanism, it's believed that the transplant repopulates a microbiome with diverse bacteria that helps to fight the bacterium off. The big question around these transplants is defining what a normal gut microbiome is. ""We haven't established what's normal, but also what's normal for each individual. It depends on their ethnicity, environment and other things they body has gone through,"" says Fiona Pereira, head of business development and strategy for the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College London, which oversees research into the relationship between the microbiome and diet. Pereira says if scientists can gain a clear understanding of what is healthy in different ethnic groups and age groups, they can then profile a person and see how their gut varies and what this is related to – it could be diet, environment, or genetic predispositions to certain diseases. Antibiotics It is already well established that antibiotics can dramatically alter our gut microbiota. The gut is an environment where harmless and beneficial bacteria are in very close contact to opportunistic pathogens that cause infections, says Willem van Schaik, professor at the University of Birmingham and lead researcher of a new study identifying more than 6,000 new antibiotic-resistance genes in pathogens. He found that most of these pathogens weren't associated with DNA that can transfer between bacteria, which means there's no immediate risk of spread of these genes from normal bacteria to pathogens. However, many of the genes thought to be fixed in certain bacterial environments can start spreading by overuse of antibiotics, which can put pressure on the resistant genes locked up inside a single bacterial cell, causing them to mobilise. ""Our findings highlight how many resistant genes are in the microbiome and could potentially be mobilised to be opportunistic pathogens. They should be seen as a warning that there is a large reservoir of these genes we don’t want to start mobilising,"" van Schaik says. The brain The brain and gut have a strong, two-way communication system referred to as the gut–brain axis. Each are essential to the other – studies have found that brain development is abnormal in the absence of the gut microbiome. However, a recent review stated that research hasn’t yet figured out which exact gut bacterium are crucial for brain development. Further investigation is uncovering how interlinked the gut is to the brain, however, including our mood and mental health, says Katerina Johnson, a researcher of the microbiome-gut-brain axis at the University of Oxford. ""Research shows that if we take gut bacteria from depressed humans and colonise the guts of mice with it, the mice show changes in their behaviour and physiology that are characteristic of depression,"" she says. Gut microbes can produce most of the neurotransmitters found in the human brain, including serotonin, which plays a key role in regulating mood. It is hoped that scientists will soon be able to understand how microbes can be used to produce neurotransmitters to treat psychiatric and neurologic disorders liked to our microbiomes, including Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Behaviour  We’ve also started to glimpse how gut microbes can influence behaviour. Some studies, largely conducted in animals, for example, suggest that certain types can affect brain chemistry and behaviour to make animals act more socially. Germ-free animals who've had no exposure to microbes, on the other hand, have shown deficits in social behaviour, and researchers have found that this can be restored by adding specific types of bacteria such as Lactobacillus, often found in yoghurt, according to Johnson. A recent paper titled 'Why does the microbiome affect behaviour?' examined the theory that the gut microbiome has evolved to manipulate its human host for its own success, much like parasites, by making the host more sociable in order to be transmitted. The paper argued, however, that this theory is unlikely, and behavioural changes are likely to be a by-product of processes that help microorganisms grow and compete in the gut, such as fermentation. ""The gut microbiome is so diverse that, even if there was a type of bacteria producing active chemicals to manipulate our behaviour, this bacteria would quickly be outcompeted by other bacteria not investing any extra energy to produce the compound,"" says Johnson, one of the paper's authors. The future  Science has not yet defined what a healthy microbiome looks like, and a conclusion appears some way off yet. But there is growing consensus that environmental factors, such as diet and antibiotics, affect our microbiome more than our genes, and that a more diverse microbiome is better for us. ""While we can change our microbiome with our diet, they seem to have a set point to which they often return after a temporary disturbance,"" says Johnson. ""But one thing we can do is eat more fibre, to increase the diversity of the gut, which is frequently associated with health."" While there have been many advancements within microbiome research in recent years, there also remain some challenges. One of these is the reliance on a method called 16S rRNA sequencing, says McDonald, which looks at a specific region of a single gene believed to exist in all bacteria. E. coli is an example of why this method is too broad, McDonald says. ""While there are pathogenic E.coli, there are also E.coli that play a neutral or beneficial role in the gut, which would all be indistinguishable with the current method we use. An increase in the level of E.coli doesn't mean it's bad for you."" McDonald's advice is that we should remain cautious. ""There are a lot of cool things microbiome research will lead to, and there are exciting developments going on now, but while continued advances will lead to improvements in health, a lot of this stuff is tied up in basic research, and there's a lot of research we can do with mice that we can't translate to humans, because it's not safe to do so."" In the meantime, the most scientists can advise is to eat our greens. -- Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,Is meat really that bad for you?,2024-09-15,2019-10-03,William Park,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191002-is-meat-really-bad-for-you,"Nitrates, saturated fats and salt – red meat is filled with things we are told to avoid. But what are the actual risks if we choose to eat it? A recent news story has whetted the appetite of meat-eaters around the world. Red meat might not be as bad for us as we are led to believe. The controversial report, which re-analysed data used in previous studies, led the authors to caution against most internationally-accepted health guidelines that urge people to cut down the amount of red meat they consume. The authors’ verdict is that there is uncertain evidence that reducing red meat intake affects the likelihood of cancer over your lifetime and often the evidence for health risks is very weak. The paper collected data from 70 studies that analysed the health records of six million people. This stacks up with how BBC Future has reported the health risks of foods, too. You might also like: In recent years, several reports have questioned the harms of meat and processed foods. In 2018, scientists and politicians campaigned against using nitrates and nitrites as preservatives in processed meats because of evidence linking the compounds to cancer. When Angela Dowden investigated for BBC Future, she found nitrates and nitrites occur in a much greater quantity in other areas of our diets. In fact, 80% of nitrates and nitrites in most European’s diets come from vegetables – and in some cases, nitrates have been associated with positive health outcomes, like lowering blood pressure. But that is not the whole story. Nitrites can turn into nitrosamines, which have been linked to bowel cancer. This happens when nitrites react with amines, a chemical found in protein-rich foods – which is why the nitrates and nitrites in meat, for example, can be more dangerous for you than from vegetables. Nitrosamines also form from the chemical reactions that occur during high-heat cooking – again, a process you are more likely to encounter with, say, sausages than with celery. As a result, cancer risk can have less to do with the composition of our food than with how we prepare it. This is where red meat falls foul. Grilling and frying are particularly high risk. The good news? Choosing a cooking method that reduces the cancer risk, such as slow-cooking, is a preventative measure we can all do. Likewise, how we replace the harmful components of our foods is important. Saturated fats in meat are associated with several illnesses, including heart disease. But replacing saturated fats with sugars and refined starches actually increases heart attack risk. Replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats has been shown to reduce the risk of death by any cause by 19%, however. So, switching from animal-based oils and fats to sunflower oil can help. Clearly, then, our foods contribute towards our health risks. But the way these risks are presented can be misleading. A 19% decrease in risk of death by any cause sounds compelling, but this decrease might be the same as saying a decrease from five in 100 to four in 100 people. What happens when we reframe those risks? As David Robson has written BBC Future, bacon has been linked to colorectal cancer – but instances of this type of cancer are very rare. Roughly 56 in every 1,000 people are at risk of colorectal cancer in their lifetimes. If those 1,000 people were to eat bacon every day of their lives, the number rises to 66. Bingeing on bacon raises your risk by a small amount. Contrast this with the risk of cancer from smoking: for every 100 people who give up the habit, 10-15 will avoid lung cancer. However, if you are tempted to follow up reading this article with an extra helping of red meat, you might want to pause for thought. We consume far more protein that we really need – and supplementing your diet with extra protein is pointless. Most people already get more than their daily recommended protein allowance from their food. Even the fitness-conscious should not spend money on protein supplements – unnecessary protein is excreted out of the body. Taking supplements is like flushing money down the loo.

risk appetite,The next generation of tomatoes,2024-09-15,2021-12-09,Marta Zaraska,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211207-the-tomatoes-at-the-forefront-of-a-food-revolution,"As global temperatures increase and extreme weather events become more common, can gene editing help to tweak our food plants so they can cope with the changes? At first glance, it looked like any other plant that can be found growing in the corners of offices or on the windowsills of university laboratories. But this particular tomato plant, grown in 2018 at the University of Minnesota, was different. The bushy tangle of elongated leaves and small red fruits were characteristic of a wild species of tomato plant native to Peru and Ecuador called Solanum pimpinellifolium, also known as the red currant tomato. A closer inspection, however, made the plant's uniqueness more apparent. This particular plant was more compact, with fewer branches but more fruits than the wild tomato. Its fruits were also a little darker than was usual, a sign of increased lycopene – an antioxidant linked to a lower risk of cancer and heart disease. It had, in fact, been designed that way. The plant was created by geneticist Tomas Cermak and his colleagues with the use of Crispr gene editing, a Nobel Prize-winning technology which works like a ""cut and paste"" tool for genetic material. The technique is now revolutionising agriculture and helping create crops for the future. Cermak himself is on a mission to find a perfect tomato, one that would be easy to cultivate, nutritious and tasty, yet more adaptable to a changing climate. ""The ideal plant would be resistant to all forms of stress — heat, cold, salt and drought, as well as to pests,"" he says. Climate change spells trouble for many crops, and tomatoes are no exception. Tomatoes don't like heat, growing best between 18C (64F) and 25C (77F). Cross either side of that threshold and things start going downhill: pollen doesn't form properly, the flowers don't form into berries in the way they should. Once the mercury goes over 35C (95F), yields begin to collapse. A 2020 study showed that by mid-21st Century up to 66% of land in California historically used for growing tomatoes may no longer have temperatures appropriate for the crop. Other modelling studies suggest that by 2050 large swaths of land in Brazil, sub-Saharan Africa, India and Indonesia will also no longer have optimal climate for cultivation of tomatoes. Of course, as average temperatures rise, other, previously too chilly regions, may become tomato-friendly. Yet observations in Italy show that weather extremes are something to consider, too. The 2019 growing season in northern Italy was marred by hail, strong winds, unusually high rainfall, and both exceptional frost and exceptional heat. The result was stressed tomato plants and poor harvests. And there is more. Water scarcity, which forces farmers to use lower quality irrigation water, often containing salt, leads to increases in soil salinity – something commercial tomato cultivars don't like. Higher ozone levels, meanwhile, make tomatoes more susceptible to diseases such as bacterial leaf spot. You might also like: That's all troubling, especially considering that tomatoes are currently the largest horticultural crop in the world – humanity produces 182 million tons of the fruit every year, equivalent to the weight of almost 32 Great Pyramids of Giza. What's more, our appetites for tomatoes are growing fast – over the last 15 years global production of tomatoes rose by more than 30%. Besides being humanity's favourite fruit, tomatoes also happen to be a model crop: they are fast to grow, easy to breed and relatively simple to manipulate on a genetic level. ""There is more funding available for research than there is for other plant species to develop resources like genome sequences, genetic engineering, and gene editing for tomato,"" says Joyce Van Eck, plant geneticist at the Boyce Thompson Institute in New York. Taken together, this makes tomatoes perfect for study of novel gene editing technologies such as Crispr, which could bring us many climate-adaptive crops in the near future. Crispr is a molecular toolbox scientists have repurposed from bacteria – when bacteria are attacked by viruses, they capture and cut the viral DNA to prevent the aggressor from being able to replicate and so fight it off. In use in plants since 2013, Crispr now allows researchers to modify genome with extreme precision and accuracy to obtain traits they desire. You can insert genes, delete them, and create targeted mutations. In non-human animals Crispr is being used for the study of human disease models, for improving livestock, and could even potentially be used to resurrecting extinct species. In plants, it can help create better, tastier, more nutritious and more resistant crops. The first step is finding the right genes to target. ""We need to identify the genes responsible or involved in being able to withstand abiotic and biotic stress because otherwise we cannot alter, modify or knock them out by using gene editing,"" says Richard Visser, plant geneticist at Wageningen University, the Netherlands. Domesticating crops, tomatoes included, has led to a huge loss of genetic diversity. Modern commercial cultivars may be fast to grow and easy to harvest, but genetically speaking they are plain vanilla. Just four highly homogenised crops – soybeans, rice, wheat and corn – dominate global agriculture, accounting for more than half of all the world's agricultural land. In contrast, their wild cousins – as well as so-called landraces (traditional varieties adapted to specific locations) – are a treasure box of genetic diversity. This is why scientists now search this genetic pool to identify traits that can be reintroduced into commercial plants – a process much helped by fast-dropping costs of DNA-sequencing technologies. One 2021 study looked at the genome of Solanum sitiens – a wild tomato species which grows in the extremely harsh environment of the Atacama Desert in Chile, and can be found at altitudes as high as 3,300m (10,826ft). The study identified several genes related to drought-resistance in Solanum sitiens, including one aptly named YUCCA7 (yucca are draught-resistant shrubs and trees popular as houseplants). They are far from the only genes that could be used to give the humble tomato a boost. In 2020 Chinese and American scientists performed a genome-wide association study of 369 tomato cultivars, breeding lines and landraces, and pinpointed a gene called SlHAK20 as crucial for salt tolerance. Once the climate-smart genes such as these are identified, they can be targeted using Crispr to delete certain unwanted genes, to tune others or insert new ones. This has recently been done with salt tolerance, resistance to various tomato pathogens, and even to create dwarf plants which could withstand strong winds (another side effect of climate change). However, scientists such as Cermak go even further and start at the roots – they are using Crispr to domesticate wild plant species from scratch, ""de novo"" in science speak. Not only can they achieve in a single generation what previously took thousands of years, but also with a much greater precision. De novo domestication of Solanum pimpinellifolium was how Cermak and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota arrived at their 2018 plant. They targeted five genes in the wild species to obtain a tomato that would be still resistant to various stresses, yet more adapted to modern commercial farming – more compact for easier mechanical harvesting, for example. The new plant also had larger fruits than the wild original. ""The size and weight was about double,"" Cermak says. Yet this still wasn't the ideal tomato he strives to obtain – for that more work needs to be done. ""By adding additional genes, we could make the fruit even bigger and more abundant, increase the amount of sugar to improve taste, and the concentration of antioxidants, vitamin C and other nutrients,"" he says. And, of course, resistance to various forms of stress, from heat and pests to draught and salinity. De novo domestication could also make orphan crops more attractive. These are plants that are grown on a limited scale, but have a great potential to help food security. Groundcherry, a wild cousin of tomatoes which produces subtly sweet berries, is one such crop that has been recently domesticated with Crispr technology. In the near future, de novo domestication could bring crops as cowpea, sorghum and teff — all cereals native to Africa – to a far wider audience around the world. Crispr is also now being used to improve various other plants, from bananas and grapes to rice and cucumbers. Some scientists believe that Crispr gene-editing marks the beginning of the second green revolution to help feed the fast-growing human population. Yet although the technology does hold a great promise for crop improvement, it's ""not a miracle potion"", Visser says. There are still technical hurdles to address. ""Efficiency of editing can be a problem in some crop species,"" Van Eck says. As opposed to diploid plants like tomato (which have paired chromosomes), those that have more than two paired sets of chromosomes (known as polyploid, like wheat), are much harder to work on. ""You basically have more copies of a gene in polyploids that need to be affected by Crispr than in a diploid,"" Van Eck adds. Regulation and social acceptance are also an issue. Crispr modified plants can be ""transgene-free"" – meaning that unlike traditional genetically modified (GM) crops, those created by Crispr technology do not contain DNA from a different species (ie transgenic) – that's because the technology either involves simply deleting genes, or may involve inserting genes from a different varieties of the same species (as is being done with tomatoes). Yet, the few existing studies on acceptance of Crispr-edited food products show a mixed picture. In a cross-country survey conducted in USA, Canada, Belgium, France and Australia, people perceived Crispr-edited and GM food similarly. However, in a 2020 Canadian study, consumers were more willing to accept Crispr-edited foods. And then, there is the law. Although in 2016 Crispr-edited mushrooms fell into a legal loophole in the US and escaped regulation, Europe's highest court decided in 2018 that gene-edited crops should be subject to the same stringent regulations that govern conventional GM organisms. For Cermak's climate-smart ""ideal tomato"", such legal hurdles paired with consumer hesitance, could prove a major obstacle. * This article was updated on 7 January 2022 to change Joyce Van Eck's affiliation from Cornell University to the Boyce Thompson Institute, where she is primarily based. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,Why palm oil is a climate problem,2024-09-15,2021-10-29,Nithin Coca,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211025-palm-oil-the-everyday-ingredient-that-harms-the-climate,"If we ended the use of fossil fuels tomorrow, we would still face huge challenges in stopping climate change – in no small part because of one very common household ingredient: palm oil. In September 2015, just a few months before the world signed up to the Paris Agreement on climate change, a number of huge forest fires erupted across Indonesian Sumatra and Borneo, darkening the skies across Southeast Asia and threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people. More than 2.6 million hectares (10,000 sq miles) had burned by the time the fires subsided in October. The fires were responsible for the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as produced by the whole of Germany that year. The loss of tropical forests – the home of endangered species such as orangutans – was a hard blow for biodiversity. But it was the peat below the forests' surface that had the greatest impact on the climate. Peat is a dense, soil-like material made up of partially decomposed organic matter which accumulates in swamp-like peatlands. Particularly in tropical regions, it can grow into a massive carbon store many metres deep. Worldwide, peatlands store more than 550 gigatonnes (billions of tonnes) of carbon globally. That's equal to 42% of the carbon stored in soil on the planet, despite peatlands covering less than 5% of the Earth’s surface area. Indonesia is home to some of the largest and most carbon-dense peatlands in the world. Much of Indonesia's vast tropical forest – the third largest in the world – grows on peatlands. These soils are naturally wet, which keeps the peat from decomposing, but when forests are converted into palm oil plantations the peat dries out, leading them to rapidly degrade and release their carbon into the atmosphere. Globally, almost all oil palm is grown on lands that were once tropical moist forests. The scale of Indonesian forest fires is a reminder to the world that addressing climate change means more than just shifting away from fossil fuels or adopting clean energy. Land also matters. Emissions from land-use, including agriculture, deforestation and peatland degradation, account for about a quarter of all global emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Indonesia is ground zero for land-use change emissions. They typically make up around half of the country's total emissions, depending on the scale of fires in a certain year. The fires in 2015 made Indonesia the fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter globally, after China, the US and India. Unlike temperate forests, fires are very rare in the tropics under natural conditions, because ample rainfall keeps the water table high. The problem is that oil palm, a non-native plant originally from West Africa, prefers dry land. As plantations expanded across Riau, North Sumatra and Central Kalimantan from the 1990s, canals were built to drain the land, putting peatlands at risk. ""Palm oil, much more than other crops, tends to expand onto tropical forests and peatlands with high carbon stock,"" says Stephanie Searle, fuels program director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. ""Those impacts are really, really huge for the global climate."" Since 1990, palm oil has grown from a niche commodity to become one of Indonesia's main exports. The industry now encompasses 6.8 million hectares (26,300 square miles) of land, an area approaching the size of the Republic of Ireland. It produces 43 million metric tonnes of oil, 58% of the world's total, which is both consumed domestically and exported to regions including Europe, the United States, India and China. ""Palm oil has been a major driver of deforestation,"" says Annisa Rahmawati, a Jakarta-based forests campaigner at Mighty Earth, an environmental non-profit. ""Insufficient law enforcement and disclosure created a situation that diminished our environment and harmed our people."" In 2021, six years after the historic fires, it seemed like progress was finally being made. While fires still burn yearly, including significant fires in 2018 and 2019, they were far less widespread than those in 2015. Furthermore, deforestation in 2020 had fallen 70% from its 2016 peak, according to Global Forest Watch data. The government's Peatland Restoration Agency and non-profits like Wetlands International and the Borneo Nature Foundation have re-wetted and restored hundreds of thousands of hectares of peatlands. In 2018, Indonesia implemented a ban on new oil palm plantations. Meanwhile, entities like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), set up in 2004 after a wave of negative attention on the links of palm oil with deforestation, claim to have pushed supply chains to become more responsible. Major palm oil buyers such as L'Oreal, PepsiCo and Unilever have made zero-deforestation commitments. But these fixes are not yet permanent. There has not yet been enough progress in transparency and responsibility in the palm oil industry to cut its links with deforestation, Rahmawati says. The RSPO has been criticised for enabling industry greenwashing, with a 2015 report from the Environmental Investigation Agency alleging fraud and a lack of credibility in its assurance processes in the organisation's supply chain certification scheme, and a 2019 follow-up finding many of these issues still remained. The RSPO responded that it is ""committed to continuous improvement"", and that the reports were inaccurate and did not take into account improvements to its assurance processes. Indonesia's ban on new palm oil concessions expired in September 2021, and has not been replaced. The passage of a major new law in Oct 2020, meant to create jobs and spur economic recovery from Covid-19, paired with near-record high prices for palm oil globally, have led many to fear that a return to fires, peatland and widespread deforestation could again be on the horizon. The fires in 2015 were, in many ways, a worst-case scenario. That year saw an extremely strong El Niño effect, which brought dry conditions to much of Indonesia. Once the fires reached the peat underground, they became extremely difficult to put out, and burned for weeks until rains finally came. The massive scale of these fires acted as a wake-up call to Indonesia. Ahead of United Nations global climate conference in 2015 (COP21), Indonesia announced in its UN climate pledge to reduce emissions from forestry by 66% to 90% by 2030, depending on international assistance. To support this, in January 2016 President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo created the Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) and tasked it with meeting new goals to restore 1.7 million hectares (6,600 sq miles) of peatlands within concession areas (including palm oil plantations), and 900,000 hectares (3,500 sq miles) of peatlands outside of these areas by 2020. The country's 2018 palm oil concession ban took this a step further, and in 2019 its moratorium on deforestation became permanent. The BRG and other entities tasked with supporting peatland restoration faced a huge challenge. Peatlands are incredibly fragile, so they needed to work fast to restore those that were already being lost in order to limit CO2 emissions. ""If we are too late in restoring our peatlands, it will not be possible,"" says Nyoman Suryadiputra, a senior advisor at Wetlands International Indonesia. ""Once the organic matter disappears, the ecosystem will change and it's no longer possible to rehabilitate it."" If anyone knows about this, it's Wetlands International Indonesia. The organisation has been working on peatland restoration across the archipelago since the late 1990s in the same provinces where the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations has transformed landscapes. Its latest project, begun in 2019, is working with 350 households in the province of North Sumatra to restore degraded smallholder palm oil plots around their villages. In order to ensure that restoration is both effective and sustainable in the long-term, they take a community-centered approach. ""We have to look after the community's livelihood,"" says Nyoman. ""We cannot force them to restore their peatlands if they are hungry."" That means providing alternative income streams to palm oil, such as other kinds of forest products or aquaculture. It also means ensuring locals are well-informed about the restoration effort and directly involved in monitoring it. Many communities in Indonesia use peatlands for farming not only palm oil but other crops such as rice, maize and root vegetables, which they depend on for income, says Herry Purnomo, a researcher in peatland restoration at the Center for International Forestry Research in Bogor, Indonesia. ""The development of community-based business models hand-in-hand with peatland restoration is a must,"" he says. The BRG nearly met one of its goals, restoring 835,288 hectares (3,200 sq miles) of peatlands on state or community-controlled lands. But it failed, by far, to meet its other goal for peatland restoration within concession areas, restoring only 390,000 (1,500 sq miles) out of a planned 1.7 million hectares (6,600 sq miles) as of early 2020. The reason for this was BRG lacked the legal authority to force concession holders to restore peatlands, says Purnomo. ""Peatland restoration outside concession areas is mainly the responsibility of the government, while inside the concession it is the concession holder's responsibility,"" he says. Earlier this year, the organisation saw its mandate both extended and expanded. Now called the Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency (BRGM), it is tasked with restoring 600,000 (2,300 sq miles) hectares of degraded mangroves as well as a further 1.2 million hectares (4,500 sq miles) of peatlands by the end of 2024. ""I hope they can meet the updated goals,"" said Fadhli Zakiy, who leads the Peatland Restoration Information Monitoring System at WRI Indonesia. ""We believe that they can, as long as the government supports them with an adequate budget and with regulations."" It is proper regulations, however, that have in the past several months become a key concern. The 2020 legislation on job creation raised alarm due to its streamlining of environmental regulations and changes which make land acquisition by corporations easier. Alongside the expiration of the moratorium on new palm oil concessions, it led to concern that the industry would expand onto forest and peatland. The government did not respond to a request for comment. Juliana Nnoko-Mewanu, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch who has researched expansions of palm oil plantations in West Kalimantan, has expressed concerns that the job creation law could make things worse by ""curtailing communities' and environmental experts' involvement in environmental impact assessments [and] accelerating licensing processes for [oil palm] businesses"". Combined, the new bill and the end of the palm oil moratorium ""may end up increasing deforestation"", says Arkian Suryadarma, senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. He says that Indonesia's peatland and deforestation policies are ""not ambitious enough"" to meet the 2030 goal. Continuing peatland restoration will also require addressing the elephant in the room: peatlands which sit in existing palm oil plantations. Efforts to do land-swaps – from peat or high-carbon land to degraded land – haven't yet proven to have much impact, and canal-blocking and re-wetting on concession land has lagged behind activities on state-controlled land. This impacts everyone, says Nyoman, because the peatlands are both interconnected and porous. ""If a community is doing a rehabilitation project, but the private sector around it doesn't, then it will affect the peatland in the community land,"" he says. While the government attributes the fall in deforestation between 2016 and 2020 to its own efforts, others believe it was due to unfavourable market forces. The last five to six years have seen a weak price for crude palm oil so there was not so much appetite for industry expansion, says Andika Putraditama, forests and commodities senior manager at WRI Indonesia. This year, though, the price of palm oil has hit a five-year record high due to shortages in the global vegetable oil market. ""We need to be cautious to see if there is a spike in deforestation,"" says Putraditama. The end result is a push-and-pull between all these forces. ""A lot needs to happen for Indonesia to meet its 2030 [forestry and land-use] target,"" says Brurce Muhammad Mecca, an analyst at Climate Policy Initiative's Indonesia office. ""Indonesia needs to provide a mix of policies that incentivise forest conservation and outweigh the economic incentives for deforestation."" Wherever the balance falls will have broad repercussions for the global climate. It will take a momentous effort – from civil society, the government and the global community – to protect Indonesia's critically important tropical forests and peatlands. -- Data research and visualisation by Kajsa Rosenblad Animation by Adam Proctor -- Towards Net Zero Since signing the Paris Agreement, how are countries performing on their climate pledges?

risk appetite,How your age affects your eating,2024-09-15,2018-07-02,Alex Johnstone,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180629-the-seven-stages-of-life-that-affect-how-we-eat,"We all need food every day, but our changing relationship with it through the years can have a big impact on our health. Do you eat to live or live to eat? We have a complicated relationship with food, influenced by cost, availability and even peer pressure. But something we all share is appetite – our desire to eat. While hunger – our body’s way of making us desire food when it needs feeding – is a part of appetite, it is not the only factor. After all, we often eat when we’re not hungry, or may skip a meal despite pangs of hunger. Recent research has highlighted that the abundance of food cues – smells, sounds, advertising – in our environment is one of the main causes of overconsumption. You might also like: Our appetite is also not fixed, it changes across our lifespan as we age. As Shakespeare might have put it, there are seven ages of appetite, and a better understanding of these phases could help us to develop new ways of tackling under-eating and overconsumption, along with the health effects, such as obesity, that follow. The first decade, 0-10 In early childhood, the body goes through rapid growth and dietary behaviour built up in early life can extend into adulthood, leading a fat child to become a fat adult. Fussiness or fear of particular foods can also contribute to meal time struggles for parents of young children, but a strategy of repeated tasting and learning in a positive environment can help children learn about unfamiliar but important foods, such as vegetables. Children should also experience some control, particularly in relation to portion size. Being forced to “clear the plate” by parents can lead youngsters to lose their ability to follow their own appetite and hunger cues, promoting overeating in later years. There are growing calls for governments to protect young children from targeted junk food advertising – not just on television but in apps, social media and video blogs – since food advertising increases food consumption, which can contribute to children becoming overweight. The second decade, 10-20 In the teenage years, a growth in appetite and stature driven by hormones, signals the arrival of puberty. How a teenager approaches food during this critical period will shape their lifestyle choices in later years. This means the dietary decisions that adolescents make are intrinsically linked to the health of the future generations that they will later become parents to. Unfortunately, without guidance, teenagers may adopt eating behaviours and food preferences associated with unhealthy consequences. Young women in general are more likely to suffer from nutritional deficiencies than young men because of their reproductive biology. Teenage girls who become pregnant are also at greater risk since their bodies are supporting their own growth in competition with that of the growing foetus. The third decade, 20-30 As young adults, lifestyle changes such as going to college, getting married or living with a partner, and parenthood can promote weight gain. Once accumulated, body fat is often difficult to lose. The body sends strong appetite signals to eat when we consume less than our energy needs, but the signals to prevent overeating are weaker, which can lead to a circle of over-consumption. There are many physiological and psychological factors that make eating less difficult to maintain over time. An area of new research is to develop satiety, the sense of having eaten enough. This is helpful when trying to lose weight, since feeling hungry is one of the main barriers to eating less than your body says you need. Different foods send different signals to the brain. It’s easy to eat a tub of ice cream, for example, because fat doesn’t trigger signals in the brain for us to stop eating. On the other hand, foods high in protein, water or fibre content make us feel fuller for longer. Working with the food industry provides an opportunity to shape the future of meals and snacks in beneficial ways. The fourth decade, 30-40 Adult working life brings other challenges beyond a rumbling stomach, but also the effects of stress, which has been shown to prompt changes in appetite and eating habits in 80% of the population, equally divided between those that gorge and those that lose their appetite. These different coping strategies are intriguing: the phenomena of “food addiction” – an irresistible urge to consume specific, often high-calorie foods – is not well understood. Many researchers even question its existence. Other personality traits, such as perfectionism and conscientiousness, may also play a role in mediating stress and eating behaviour. Structuring the work environment to reduce problematic eating patterns such as snacking or vending machines is a challenge. Employers should strive to subsidise and promote healthier eating for a productive and healthy workforce, along with ways of managing stress and stressful situations. The fifth decade, 40-50 The word diet comes from the Greek word diaita meaning “way of life, mode of living”, but we are creatures of habit, often unwilling to change our preferences even when we know it is good for us. We want to eat what we want without changing our lifestyle, and still have a healthy body and mind. There is much evidence to show that diet is a major contributing factor to ill-health. The World Health Organisation highlights smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and problem drinking as the main lifestyle impacts on health and mortality. It is between the ages of 40-50 that adults should change their behaviour as their health dictates, but symptoms of illness are often invisible – for example high blood pressure or cholesterol – and so many fail to act. The sixth decade, 50-60 After the age of 50, we begin to suffer a gradual loss of muscle mass, at between 0.5-1% per year. This is called sarcopenia, and lessened physical activity, consuming too little protein, and menopause in women will accelerate the decline in muscle mass. A healthy, varied diet and physical activity are important to reduce the effects of ageing, and an ageing population’s need for palatable, cost-effective, higher-protein foods is not being met. Protein‐rich snack foods might represent an ideal opportunity to increase total protein intake in older adults, but there are currently few products designed to meet the requirements and preferences of older adults. (Read more about how much protein we need) The seventh decade, 60-70, and beyond A major challenge today in the face of increasing life expectancy is to maintain quality of life, or else we will become a society of very old and infirm or disabled people. Adequate nutrition is important, as old age brings poor appetite and lack of hunger, which leads to unintentional weight loss and greater frailty. Reduced appetite can also result from illness, for example the effects of Alzheimer’s disease. Food is a social experience, but the loss of a partner or family and eating alone affect the sense of pleasure taken from eating. Other affects of old age, such as swallowing problems, dental issues, reduced taste and smell also interfere with the desire to eat and our rewards from doing so. We should remember that throughout life our food is not just fuel, but a social and cultural experience to be enjoyed. We are all experts in food – we eat it every day. So we should strive to treat every opportunity to eat as an opportunity to enjoy our food and to enjoy the positive effects eating the right foods can have on our health.

risk appetite,Is breakfast the most important meal?,2024-09-15,2018-11-28,Jessica Brown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181126-is-breakfast-good-for-your-health,"We’ve all heard that healthier, fitter people don’t skip breakfast. But does that mean breakfast makes us healthier and thinner – or is it something else? Along with old classics like ‘carrots give you night vision’ and ‘Santa doesn’t bring toys to misbehaving children’, one of the most well-worn phrases in the arsenal of tired parents everywhere is that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Many of us grow up believing that skipping breakfast is a dietary travesty – even if only two thirds of adults in the UK eat breakfast regularly, according to the Association of UK Dieticians (BDA), and around three-quarters of Americans. The clue for why breakfast is supposed to be important is in its name: we’re advised to eat it to break our overnight fast. “The body uses a lot of energy stores for growth and repair through the night,” explains dietician Sarah Elder. “Eating a balanced breakfast helps to up our energy, as well as protein and calcium used throughout the night.”   But there’s widespread disagreement over whether breakfast should keep its top spot in the hierarchy of meals. As well as the rising popularity of fasting diets, there have been concerns around the sugar content of cereal and the food industry’s involvement in pro-breakfast research – and even one claim from an academic that breakfast is “dangerous”. So what’s the reality? Is breakfast a necessary start to the day… or a marketing ploy by cereal companies? You might also like: • Is sugar really bad for you?  • We don’t need nearly as much protein as we consume  • Is having a low-salt diet as unhealthy as too much? Weighty decision The most researched aspect of breakfast (and breakfast-skipping) has been its links to obesity. Scientists have different theories as to why there’s a relationship between the two.   In one US study that analysed the health data of 50,000 people over seven years, researchers found that those who made breakfast the largest meal of the day were more likely to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who ate a large lunch or dinner. The researchers argued that breakfast helps increase satiety, reduce daily calorie intake, improve the quality of our diet – since breakfast foods are often higher in fibre and nutrients – and improve insulin sensitivity at subsequent meals, which can be a risk for diabetes. But as with any study of this kind, it was unclear if that was the cause – or if breakfast-skippers were just more likely to be overweight to begin with. To find out, researchers designed a study in which 52 obese women took part in a 12-week weight loss programme. All had the same number of calories over the day, but half had breakfast, while the other half did not. What they found was that it wasn’t breakfast itself that caused the participants to lose weight: it was changing their normal routine. The women who said before the study that they usually ate breakfast lost 8.9kg when they stopped having breakfast, compared to 6.2kg in the breakfast group. Meanwhile, those who usually skipped breakfast lost 7.7kg when they started eating it – and 6kg when they continued to skip it. If breakfast alone isn’t a guarantee of weight loss, why is there a link between obesity and skipping breakfast? Alexandra Johnstone, professor of appetite research at the University of Aberdeen, argues that it may simply be because breakfast-skippers have been found to be less knowledgeable about nutrition and health. “There are a lot of studies on the relationship between breakfast eating and possible health outcomes, but this may be because those who eat breakfast choose to habitually have health-enhancing behaviours such as not smoking and regular exercise,” she says. A 2016 review of 10 studies looking into the relationship between breakfast and weight management concluded there is “limited evidence” supporting or refuting the argument that breakfast influences weight or food intake, and more evidence is required before breakfast recommendations can be used to help prevent obesity. Feast or fast? Intermittent fasting, which involves fasting overnight and into the next day, is gaining ground among those looking to lose or maintain their weight or improve their health.   One pilot study published in 2018, for example, found that intermittent fasting improves blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity and lowers blood pressure. Eight men with pre-diabetes were assigned one of two eating schedules: either eating all their calories between 9:00 and 15:00, or eating the same number of calories over 12 hours. The results for the 9:00-15:00 group were found to be on par with medicine that lowers blood pressure, according to Courtney Peterson, the study’s author and assistant professor of nutrition sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Still, the study’s small size means more research is needed on its possible long-term benefits. If skipping breakfast (and other food outside of a restricted time slot) could potentially be good for you, does that mean breakfast could be bad for you? One academic has said so, arguing that breakfast is ‘dangerous’: eating early in the day causes our cortisol to peak more than it does later on. This causes the body to become resistant to insulin over time and can lead to type 2 diabetes. But Fredrik Karpe, professor of metabolic medicine at Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, argues this isn’t the case. Instead, higher levels of cortisol in the morning are just part of our body’s natural rhythm. Not only that, but breakfast is key to jumpstarting our metabolism, he says. “In order for other tissues to respond well to food intake, you need an initial trigger involving carbs responding to insulin. Breakfast is critical for this to happen,” Karpe says. A randomised control trial published last year involving 18 people with, and 18 people without, diabetes found that skipping breakfast disrupted the circadian rhythms of both groups and led to larger spikes in blood glucose levels after eating. Eating breakfast, the researchers conclude, is essential for keeping our body clock running on time. Peterson says those who skip breakfast can be divided into those who either skip breakfast and eat dinner at a normal time – getting the benefits of intermittent fasting, if not breakfast – or those who skip breakfast and eat dinner late. “For those who eat dinner later, their risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease goes through the roof. While it seems breakfast is the most important meal of the day, it might actually be dinner,” she says. “Our blood sugar control is best early in the day. When we eat dinner late, that’s when we’re most vulnerable because our blood sugar is worst. There’s more research to do, but I’m confident you shouldn’t skip breakfast and have dinner late.”   She says we should think of our circadian rhythm as an orchestra. “There are two parts of our circadian clock. There’s the master clock in the brain, which we should think of as analogous to a conductor of an orchestra, and the other half is in every organ, which has a separate clock,” she says. And that ‘orchestra’ is set by two outside factors: bright light exposure and our eating schedule. “If you’re eating when you’re not getting bright light exposure, the clocks that control metabolism are in different time zones, creating conflicting signals as to whether to rev up or down.” It’s like two halves of an orchestra playing different songs, Peterson explains, and this is why eating late impairs blood sugar and blood pressure levels. Researchers from the University of Surrey and University of Aberdeen are halfway through research looking into the mechanisms behind how the time we eat influences body weight. Early findings suggest that a bigger breakfast is beneficial to weight control. Health food Breakfast has been found to affect more than just weight. Skipping breakfast has been associated with a 27% increased risk of heart disease, a 21% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in men, and a 20% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women. One reason may be breakfast’s nutritional value – partly because cereal is fortified with vitamins. In one study on the breakfast habits of 1,600 young people in the UK, researchers found that the fibre and micronutrient intake, including of folate, vitamin C iron and calcium, was better in those who had breakfast regularly. There have been similar findings in Australia, Brazil, Canada and the US. Breakfast is also associated with improved brain function, including concentration and language. A review of 54 studies found that eating breakfast can improve memory, though the effects on other brain functions were inconclusive. However, one of the review’s researchers, Mary Beth Spitznagel, says there is “reasonable” evidence breakfast does improve concentration – there just needs to be more research. “Looking at studies that tested concentration, the number of studies showing a benefit was exactly the same as the number that found no benefit,” she says. “And no studies found that eating breakfast was bad for concentration.” What’s most important, some argue, is what we eat for breakfast. High-protein breakfasts have been found particularly effective in reducing food cravings and consumption later in the day, according to research by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. While cereal remains a firm favourite among breakfast consumers in the UK and US, a recent Which? investigation into the sugar content of ‘adult’ breakfast cereals found that some cereals contain more than three quarters of the recommended daily amount of free sugars in each portion, and sugar was the second or third highest ingredient in seven out of 10 flaked cereals. But some research suggests if we’re going to eat sugary foods, it’s best to do it early. One study found that changing levels of the appetite hormone leptin in the body throughout the day coincide with having our lowest threshold for sweet food in a morning, while scientists from Tel Aviv University have found that hunger is best regulated in the morning. They recruited 200 obese adults to take part in a 16-week-long diet, where half added dessert to their breakfast, and half didn’t. Those who added dessert lost an average of 40lbs (18kg) more – however, the study was unable to show the long-term effects. A review of 54 studies found that there is no consensus yet on what type of breakfast is healthier, and conclude that the type of breakfast doesn’t matter as much as simply eating something. Final take While there’s no conclusive evidence on exactly what we should be eating and when, the consensus is that we should listen to our own bodies and eat when we’re hungry.   “Breakfast is most important for people who are hungry when they wake up,” Johnstone says. For instance, research shows that those with pre-diabetes and diabetes may find they have better concentration after a lower-GI breakfast such as porridge, which is broken down more slowly and causes a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels. Every body starts the day differently – and those individual differences, particularly in glucose function, need to be researched more closely, Spitznagel says. In the end, the key may be to be mindful of not over-emphasising any single meal, but rather looking at how we eat all day long. “A balanced breakfast is really helpful, but getting regular meals throughout the day is more important to leave blood sugar stable through day, that helps control weight and hunger levels,” says Elder. “Breakfast isn’t the only meal we should be getting right.” Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,How do you decaffeinate coffee?,2024-09-15,2018-09-18,Stephen Dowling,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee,"Some of us love the taste of coffee but can’t deal with the effects of caffeine. So how exactly do you take the caffeine out of a coffee bean? If you’re partial to a cup of coffee minus the caffeine, then next time you’ve boiled the kettle you should raise your mug in memory of Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge. Runge was a 19th-Century German chemist who had come to the attention of Goethe – the poet and statesman who was also a keen science scholar. Goethe had heard of Runge’s groundbreaking investigation into belladonna, otherwise known as nightshade. Runge had isolated the compound that caused eye muscles to dilate if it was ingested. Goethe had been recently given a case of coffee beans, and so he asked Runge to perform an analysis of the beans. What Runge discovered is arguably the most consumed drug in the modern world – caffeine. You might also like: Caffeine is present in other drinks and foods – notably tea and chocolate – but it is inextricably linked with coffee. It’s a stimulant and an appetite suppressant, a dependable pick-me-up for students cramming for exams, workers on nightshifts and anyone else needing a wake-up. But caffeine has a darker side, too. It can cause anxiety, insomnia, diarrhoea, excess sweating, racing heartbeat and muscle tremors. For many people, the pleasure of drinking coffee is outweighed by the caffeine-fuelled negatives. Could caffeine be removed from coffee? The answer, as any supermarket aisle will tell you, is yes – but the process isn’t as simple as you might think. The first person to hit upon a practical decaffeination method was another German, Ludwig Roselius, the head of the coffee company Kaffee HAG. Roselius discovered the secret to decaffeination by accident. In 1903, shipment of coffee had been swamped by seawater in transit – leaching out the caffeine but not the flavour. Roselius worked out an industrial method to repeat it, steaming the beans with various acids before using the solvent benzene to remove the caffeine. Decaffeinated coffee was born. Benzene, it turned out, was a possible carcinogen, so the search was on for new techniques that could prise out the caffeine from the beans – and yet leave the flavour intact. Chris Stemman, the executive director of the British Coffee Association, says most of those techniques from decaffeination’s earliest days are still being used today. But the process isn’t as straightforward as you’d expect. “It isn’t done by the coffee companies themselves,” says Stemann. “There are specialist decaffeination companies that carry it out.” Many of these companies are based in Europe, Canada, the US and South America. You might think that it would be easier to roast the coffee, grind it into the required powder (espresso, filter or instant) and then begin the decaffeination process. Not, so says Stemman. “It takes place when the coffee is green, before roasting. “If you were to try and decaffeinate roasted coffee you’d end up making something that tastes a bit like straw. So that’s why with 99.9% of decaffeinated coffee to this day, the process is done at the green coffee stage.” There are several ways to decaffeinate coffee but the most prevalent is to soak them in a solvent – usually methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Methylene chloride can be used as a paint stripper and a degreaser as well an agent to remove caffeine. Ethyl acetate, meanwhile, is a natural fruit ether usually made from acetic acid – the building block of vinegar – and it’s also used to make nail polish remover (it has a distinctive sweet smell, much like pear drops). The beans are first soaked in water and then covered in a solution containing either of these solvents. The caffeine is then drawn out by the solvent. The solvent-laced water is then reused again and again until it is packed with coffee flavourings and compounds – pretty much identical to the beans, except for the caffeine and solvent. By this stage in the process the beans lose very little flavouring because they’re essentially soaked in a concentrated coffee essence. Soaking coffee beans in solvents doesn’t sound like a particularly healthy enterprise, but both of these agents have got a clean bill of health. In 1985 the US’s Food and Drug Administration said the likelihood of any health risk from methylene chloride was so low “as to be essentially non-existent”. (FDA rules allow up to 10 parts per million of residual methylene, but coffee decaffeination usually uses solutions with one part per million). Two other methods use water. The Swiss Water method sees the beans soaked with water; the caffeine rich solution (full of flavours) is then strained though activated carbon which captures the caffeine. Starting in Switzerland in the 1930s, the process was first used commercially in 1979. It gained favour because it was the first decaffeination method not to use solvents. There is another method, Stemman says, which involves the use of “super critical carbon dioxide”.  Beans that have been soaked in water are put in a stainless-steel extractor which is then sealed, and liquid CO2 blasted in at pressures of up to 1,000lbs per square inch. Like the Swiss Water method, it’s the C02 which binds with the caffeine molecules, drawing them out of the unroasted bean. The gas is then drawn off and the pressure is lowered, leaving the caffeine in a separate chamber. It’s an ingenious method but it does have one big drawback, according to Stemman. “It can be enormously expensive.” Decaffeination became much more widespread as instant coffee became a staple, says Stemman. But the early incarnations of instant decaff coffee were not a roaring success. “If you look back 20 or 30 years ago, we [in the UK] really were a nation of instant coffee drinkers,” he says. “And the one thing that instant coffee didn’t really taste of was coffee. Decaff was even worse.” Stemman says that as people have become more used to quality coffee – for instance, the UK now boasts some 24,000 coffee shops – this has forced coffee-making companies to find ways of enhancing flavour even in decaffeinated instant coffee. “Decaffeination can be a complicated piece of chemistry, which is why there are these very sophisticated companies doing it.” The centenary of decaffeination – 2006 – went by with little in the way of public fanfare. In the UK at least, the number of people stumping for a decaff coffee has fallen markedly even as the quality has improved – while as many as 15% of coffee drinkers chose decaffeinated brews in the 1980s, that’s fallen to about 8% today. And does Stemman drink decaffeinated himself? “Generally, no, if I don’t want the caffeine, well I just won’t have a coffee or a tea.” And there’s another thing. While each of these methods will take most of the caffeine away, there’s no such thing as a completely decaffeinated drink. If you really want to avoid any caffeine at all, it’s probably better to drink something that never had a trace of it in the first place. -- Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

risk appetite,Can pollution make you fat?,2024-09-15,2015-12-08,David Robson,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151207-the-air-that-makes-you-fat,"Some puzzling studies appear to show that tiny airborne particles may contribute to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Should we be concerned? Take a deep breath, and exhale. Depending on where you live, that life-giving lungful of air might just be pushing you towards diabetes and obesity. The idea that “thin air” can make you fat sounds ludicrous, yet some extremely puzzling studies appear to be showing that it’s possible. Two people can eat the same foods, and do the same exercise, but over the course of a few years, one may put on more weight and develop a faulty metabolism – thanks to the atmosphere around their home. Traffic fumes and cigarette smoke are the chief concerns, with their tiny, irritating particles that trigger widespread inflammation and disrupt the body’s ability to burn energy. While the short-term effects are minimal, over a lifetime it could be enough to contribute to serious disease – besides the respiratory illnesses more commonly associated with smog. “We are starting to understand that the uptake and circulation of air pollution in the body can affect more than just the lungs,” says Hong Chen, a researcher at Public Health Ontario and the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Canada. How strong is the evidence from these studies, and should you be concerned? Laboratory mice offered some of the earliest concrete clues that the effects of air pollution may penetrate far beyond the lungs. Their breeder at the Ohio State University, Qinghua Sun, had been interested in studying why city-dwellers seem to be at a particularly high risk of heart disease compared to country folk. Lifestyle, of course, could be one reason: in most major cities a fast food chain is rarely more than a block away, for instance, which might encourage unhealthy eating. Nevertheless, he wondered if another answer may be hanging, invisibly, in the air we breathe. To find out more, he started to raise laboratory mice in the kinds of conditions you might find across various cities. Some breathed filtered, clean, air, while others were funnelled the kinds of fumes you might find next to a motorway or busy city centre. Along the way, his team weighed the mice and performed various tests to study how their metabolism was functioning. After just 10 weeks, the effects were already visible. The mice exposed to the air pollution showed greater volumes of body fat, both around the belly and around the internal organs; at the microscopic level, the fat cells themselves were around 20% larger in the mice inhaling a fine mist of pollutants. What’s more, they seemed to have become less sensitive to insulin, the hormone that signals to cells to convert blood sugar into energy: the first step towards diabetes. The exact mechanism is still debated, but subsequent animal experiments suggest the air pollution triggers a cascade of reactions in the body. Small particles, less than 2.5 micrometres wide, are thought to be primarily to blame – the same minuscule motes of pollutant that give city air its gauzy haze. When we breathe in, the pollutants irritate the tiny, moist air sacs that normally allow the oxygen to pass into the blood stream. As a result, the lungs’ lining mounts a stress response, sending our nervous system into overdrive. This includes the release of hormones that reduce insulin’s potency and draws blood away from the insulin-sensitive muscle tissue, preventing the body from tightly controlling its blood sugar levels. The tiny irritating particles may also unleash a flood of inflammatory molecules called “cytokines” to wash through the blood, a response that also triggers immune cells to invade otherwise healthy tissue. Not only does that too interfere with the tissue’s ability to respond to insulin; the subsequent inflammation may also interfere with the hormones and the brain processing that govern our appetite, says Michael Jerrett at the University of California, Berkeley. All of which knocks the body’s energy balance off-kilter, leading to a constellation of metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity, and cardiovascular problems such as hypertension. Large studies from cities across the world suggest that humans might be suffering the same consequences. Chen, for instance, examined the medical records of 62,000 people in Ontario, Canada over a 14-year period. He found that the risk of developing diabetes rose by about 11% for every 10 micrograms of fine particles in a cubic metre of air – a troubling statistic, considering that the pollution in some Asian cities can reach at least 500 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Across the Atlantic, a Swiss study saw a similar signs of increased insulin resistance, hypertension, and waist-circumference in a sample of nearly 4,000 people living among dense pollution. The scientists have been particularly concerned about the effects on young children, with some concern that a mother's exposure to these pollutants may alter the baby's metabolism so they are more prone to obesity. Consider the work of Andrew Rundle at Columbia University, who studied children growing up in the Bronx. During pregnancy, the children’s mothers had worn a small backpack that measured the air quality as they went about their daily business, and over the next seven years the children’s health was monitored at regular intervals. Controlling for other factors (such as wealth and diet), the children born in the most polluted areas were 2.3 times more likely to be considered obese, compared to those living in cleaner neighbourhoods. Jerrett, meanwhile, has found that the risk can come from inside as well as outside the home: parental smoking, he showed, also led to faster weight gain among Californian children and teens. “It interacts synergistically with the effect of the air pollution,” he says – in other words, the combined risk was far greater than the sum of individual risks. Despite these troubling findings, we should be cautious about reading too much into them. “They only draw a link between exposure and outcome, but can’t prove that one factor causes another,” says Abby Fleisch at Harvard Medical School. Even so, her own findings would seem to agree with the general trend – she has shown that even in the first six months, babies of mothers living in polluted areas appear to put on weight more rapidly than those in cleaner areas – but she stresses that we still can’t be sure we haven’t neglected some other factor, besides pollution, that could explain the apparent link. Fortunately, a few teams are already searching for the missing pieces to fill those gaps in our knowledge with more detailed studies. Robert Brook at the University of Michigan and colleagues in China, for instance, recently tested a small group of subjects in Beijing over a two-year period. They found that whenever the city’s infamous smog descended, giveaway signs of developing problems like insulin resistance and hypertension peaked – providing more concrete evidence that the air quality was indeed driving changes to the metabolism. If the link is proven, how concerned should we be? The scientists stress that the individual, short-term risk to any one person is relatively small, and certainly shouldn’t be used as an excuse for obesity by itself, without considering other aspects of your lifestyle. But given the sheer number of people living in cities with high pollution, over the long term the total number of casualties could be enormous. “Everyone is affected by pollution to some degree,” says Brook. “It’s continuous, involuntary exposure, across billions of people – so the overall impact becomes much greater.” The solutions are familiar, if difficult to implement: restrict traffic pollution by promoting electric and hybrid vehicles, for instance. Jerrett suggests streets could also be redesigned to reduce the exposure to pedestrians and cyclists. In the short term, he points out that air purifiers could be added to more homes, schools and offices to filter out some of the harmful particles. Brook agrees that action needs to be taken internationally, both in the developing world and in cities like Paris and London that superficially, might seem to have their pollution under control. “In North America and Europe the pollution levels have been trending in right direction – but we shouldn’t rest on our laurels,” he says. “From the standpoint of improving health across the world, it should be one of our top 10 worries.” David Robson is BBC Future’s feature writer.

risk appetite,Why good feedback often backfires,2024-09-15,2017-03-09,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170308-why-even-the-best-feedback-can-bring-out-the-worst-in-us,"Our minds have many cunning strategies for shunning feedback – but there are ways to avoid these traps, say psychologists Robert Nash and Naomi Winstone. There’s a curious thing about people. All of us are driven in some way or another to achieve – we want to run faster, be more creative, win more awards, cure more illnesses, earn more money. But here’s the thing: if you want to help us reach our individual potentials by pointing out how we’re doing and where we could improve, if you want to offer warm words of wisdom, constructive criticism or “360-degree feedback”, then think again. Most of us would rather not hear it. Our fragile egos are partly to blame. We all want to meet our own expectations of ourselves, and so being critiqued – or even just the prospect of being critiqued – can present an enormous threat to our self-esteem and positive sense of identity. Yet as decades of psychological theory and research have demonstrated, people have endless cunning tactics at their disposal for remaining positive in the face of criticism. For this reason, rather than us welcoming feedback with open arms, our first response is often a defensive knee-jerk. These reflexes serve to make us feel better about ourselves and yet, almost paradoxically, they also shine an unflattering spotlight on our insecurities, character flaws, and unpleasant attitudes. Ignorance is bliss The art of deflecting feedback requires being adept with selective attention and self-deception techniques. Many people will cautiously fish for compliments, for example, innocently seeking feedback only from supportive allies, and only on matters in which they know they excel. But perhaps the simplest deflection technique is to avoid hearing feedback at all. We observe this “fingers in the ears” reaction within the education system, where students sometimes fail to even collect or look at the advice they receive on their assignments. And in the world of public health, we see that people will go to great lengths to avoid visiting their family doctor, rather than risk being advised to lose weight or stop smoking, or given other unwanted home truths. Psychological research reveals more about this unhealthy appetite for ignorance. In one study, students watched a bogus educational film about a serious disease called “TAA Deficiency”. In fact, TAA Deficiency is completely fictional, but the students were not told this information; instead, they were asked whether they wished to provide a cheek swab for assessing their risk of developing the disease. Half of the students were told that if they ever developed TAA Deficiency, then the treatment would involve them taking a two-week course of pills. Of this group, 52% agreed to provide the diagnostic cheek swab. The other half of students learned the treatment would involve taking the pills for the rest of their lives. Of this group, only 21% agreed to the swab. These findings demonstrate a common pattern seen in other studies within and beyond the context of healthcare. That is, people are especially resistant to hearing feedback when they believe it could oblige them to do something difficult or unpleasant. It’s not me, it’s you… Although ignorance is bliss, it isn’t always possible to ignore or avoid critical feedback entirely. In many situations, we instead need to find other ways to protect against ego-bruising. One of the other handy tools in our self-deception toolbox is misdirection: focusing attention away from our flaws. For example, when we hear that we have performed worse than other people, our common reaction is to point to those people’s shortcomings and away from our own. “She may achieve more than me” – you might argue – “but I have more friends, and a better personality too.” It isn’t unusual to exaggerate our own admirable qualities and our rivals’ flaws, of course, but research shows that we do this far more when we learn that our rivals have outperformed us. And although it might sound spiteful, this can be a highly effective way of maintaining and validating our positive self-regard in the face of failure. Perhaps the most apt person to discredit when faced with difficult feedback is the person who provides it. As Harvard academics Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen astutely observed in their book Thanks for the Feedback, “When we give feedback, we notice that the receiver isn’t good at receiving it. When we receive feedback, we notice that the giver isn’t good at giving it.” In this spirit, when a critical reviewer recently informed one of us that our research paper would have been “better with more effert” (sic), it was highly tempting to note the critic’s poor spelling, and surmise that they were just incompetent. Who would trust the judgment of someone who can’t even spell? Reacting this way wouldn’t push us to improve the paper, of course, but it would certainly be far easier and would numb the pain. Discrediting the feedback-giver is not always enough, though, and the next step might be to actively blame them for our failures. In fact, the way we blame feedback-givers can sometimes uncover our most unpalatable of prejudices. In a study conducted at the University of Waterloo in Canada, students reported the grades they had received in various courses, and rated the quality of the teachers who gave them those grades. The results showed that students who performed poorly tended to minimise their loss of face by blaming their teachers: the lower the grades they received, the more they judged the teaching as low-quality. But crucially, unlike their high-performing classmates, the poorly performing students were especially critical of teachers who were female. In their search for ways to discredit their teachers, these students apparently discovered that discriminatory sexist attitudes can be an effective tool of blame. ‘Emotional armour’ It seems that even the most useful feedback can bring out our worst sides. But are these defensive reactions to feedback inevitable, or can we avoid them? It stands to reason that if we could, then we would often be far better equipped to reach our goals. After all, feedback is one of the strongest influences on our development, yet we can only ever benefit from advice that we listen to. The trouble is that none of our options really seem very appealing: failing to reach our goals makes us feel bad, but so does hearing critique that could help us to achieve those goals. If we are so afraid of damaging our self-esteem, though, then perhaps the solution to this dilemma is to reflect on why we feel so positively about ourselves in the first place. Indeed, research suggests that people are more open to receiving diagnostic medical feedback – such as by getting tested for the fictional TAA Deficiency – if they first think about the positive traits they most value in themselves, and remember past occasions when they demonstrated those traits. This finding fits with the broader, perhaps predictable, picture that people who already experience high self-esteem are generally better than their less-assured counterparts at seeking feedback from others. So if we want to be more receptive to unwanted news, it might help to put on some emotional armour beforehand, ensuring that our positive self-regard can stay intact regardless of whether the news is ultimately good or bad. In fact, maybe another part of the problem is that we allow ourselves to treat feedback as unwanted in the first place. Classic psychological studies on persuasion show that people can easily trick themselves into thinking they enjoyed an unpleasant task, if they only believe they actively chose to do it. Could something similar work with feedback? Can we convince ourselves to accept advice merely by believing that we chose to receive it? Some support for this idea comes from American research in which participants estimated the years in which various historical events occurred. The more accurate their answers were, the more money they won. Each participant then answered the same questions for a second time, but not until they were offered feedback about the answers that other people had given. Sometimes this feedback was free, and sometimes it would cost a few dollars from their winnings if they chose to accept it. Unsurprisingly, people were more likely to accept free advice than costly advice. But participants were much more likely to take the feedback on board – by shifting their estimates toward what other people thought – when they had paid for it. In other words, these results suggest that people feel a stronger sense of obligation to act upon advice when they feel they have invested resources in receiving it. If we actively seek and invest ourselves in receiving honest feedback, then, and if we bolster our positive identities in anticipation of how bad it might feel, we may find ourselves ready to hear and accept the advice that we most need. Perhaps there are even ways to train ourselves to recognise our knee-jerk reactions whenever we have them, so that we can resist concluding that everyone else, rather than us, is wrong. Whichever mental precautions we take, though, reaping the benefits of challenging feedback will always be tough. Science may offer advice on how to do this better, but ultimately, we are all free to take it or leave it. Robert Nash is a psychologist at Aston University, UK. He is @DrRobNash on Twitter.

risk appetite,The coast overwhelmed with otters,2024-09-15,2020-08-19,Lesley Evans Ogden,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200818-the-canadian-sea-otter-rescue-plan-that-worked-too-well,"Sea otters were locally extinct in British Columbian waters in Canada, until a plane containing a romp of otters arrived and set off a population boom – with unintended consequences. Otters do not usually fly. But if sea otter elders in Checleset Bay told floating bedtime stories to modern day pups, they might tell of their ancestors’ bizarre flying adventure. Beginning in 1969, sea otters from Amchitka and Prince William Sound in Alaska were packed onto planes and flown on a long journey south. Canadian and US biologists had a plan – one they didn’t discuss with First Nations. Sea otter biologists hoped these otters would start a new colony in the forest-fringed waters of Checleset Bay, British Columbia. Otters were not entirely new on this section of windswept Pacific coast, but prior to these transplants the last sea otter seen in Checleset Bay was in 1929, just before it was shot. It wasn’t just this remote British Columbian bay where sea otters disappeared. Prized for their luxurious warm pelts, sea otters along vast stretches of the north Pacific Rim were decimated by the European fur trade of the 18th and 19th centuries. Historic population sizes, like the otters themselves, are fuzzy. But global estimates suggest sea otters numbered 150,000-300,000 in the early 1700s. By 1911, when an international treaty afforded the creatures some protection, they had shrunk to around 2,000. Now, the original Alaskan otters released into British Columbia waters have grown from a population of 89 to more than 7,000. In fact, the reintroduction of these early romps of otters has arguably been too successful, bringing a number of unintended consequences for British Columbia’s coastal First Nations. Tipping the balance As otter populations have grown – first slowly, now apace – other species they feed upon have been driven to scarcity, including the crabs, clams, abalone and shellfish that coastal First Nations communities formerly relied on. Rebounding otters are now so abundant that on some sections of British Columbian coast they are exhausting their own food supplies. That food squeeze lowers the survival of pups, driving pioneering males to seek food elsewhere. Females track behind causing the sea otter population to spread out and recolonise available habitat, explains Jenn Burt, a marine ecologist at Simon Fraser University who has been studying sea otters alongside First Nations collaborators. You might also like: Otter pressure is being felt most keenly by the Kyuquot/Checkleset First Nations who live at the epicentre of otter abundance: the site of their initial reintroduction. Before the otters returned, clams of many sizes and species were abundant on local beaches, recalls Saqᵂistl Hilda Hanson, an Elder of the Kyuquot/Checkleset Nation. “It was the best clam beach that ever was,” she said at a research workshop in 2018. Now that sea otters have returned, the clam cupboard is bare. Such traditional knowledge is supported by scientific data. Within one year of otter arrival at previously unoccupied sites on the Central Coast of British Columbia, territory of the Heiltsuk and Wuikinuxv First Nations, numbers of large sea urchins plummeted, a trend also seen from surveys on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Otter return has seen abalone numbers crash too, at some sites declining 16-fold, with similar trends for sea cucumbers in Alaska. For coastal First Nations in remote places like Kyuquot – at least five hours travelling time by dirt road, highway and boat from the nearest town – this has a huge impact. For these remote communities, “the supply of local shellfish is the grocery store – and has been forever”, says Burt. The loss of clams, sea urchins, crabs and other edible species easily harvested from the beaches year-round is felt acutely. It contributes, she says, to “a huge shift in food security and health”. Diving deep  Plenty is known about sea otter ecology. Iconic sleek swimmers, they bob on the waves by floating on their backs like humans lolling in a pool. One of the few marine mammals to use tools, sea otters pry loose and crack open hard-shelled prey like mussels using rocks like hammers and chisels underwater and on their bellies. These predators often feature in ecology students’ first lessons about keystone species and the waterfall of effects triggered by their extinction from communities – knowledge that emerged only after British Columbia’s otter reintroductions, and something scientists call an ecological cascade. But though sea otters have been the darlings of many a scientific study, there’s something most sea otter research has neglected: their coexistence with the humans that, pre-fur-trade, shared their habitat for thousands of years. This is an imbalance that First Nations knowledge holders and Elders, and a team of scientists led by Burt during her doctoral studies, are seeking to redress. To navigate the profound ecological shift from too few to what some argue is too many otters, their research took a human-centred look at solutions for smoothing the waters. To do that, they first had to understand the long history of otters on the British Columbian coast, and these mercurial animals’ relationship with humans. Otters are voracious shellfish eaters. And for at least 10,000 years, long before colonisation, British Columbia’s coastal First Nations harvested shellfish and managed otter populations too. University of Victoria archaeologist Iain McKechnie and his collaborators have gleaned evidence supporting this linked history from ancient coastal settlement sites. Looking within middens – ancient rubbish heaps – at the quantities of sea otter bones relative to those of other animals harvested by First Nations, they examined trends over time to estimate the abundance of otters. Geochemical information from the otter bones, with clues from stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, revealed the otters’ diets of the distant past. Chemical analysis revealed consistent diets over 5,000-plus years. That, suggests McKechnie, means otters were well fed and eating the things they liked to eat for centuries, until the fur trade upset the balance. In pre-colonial times, McKechnie’s work suggests, otters in coastal British Columbia never reached such high densities that competition drove them to look for new things to eat, like fish. That contrasts with what is happening with some modern-day otters, like those in California’s Monterey Bay and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. A consistent diet over time, says McKechnie, suggests that people coexisting with otters “were actively hunting and managing their landscapes”. Before European colonisation of the British Columbia coast, Burt’s research collaborator Wii-tsts-koom Anne Mack, Hereditary and elected Chief of Toquaht Nation, explains that for the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation, otter fur robes were a status symbol. “That’s how they would distinguish the chiefs,” Mack says. For the Haida, another Pacific coastal First Nation, head chiefs wore and lined beds with otter fur too, says Haida matriarch and scholar Kii’iljuus Barb Wilson. Long before the fur trade accelerated and led to some 99% of the animals being wiped out, sea otters were a culturally and economically important resource. First Nations developed multiple ways of managing sea otters, their co-competitors for shellfish. Beyond hunting otters for pelts in boats with paddles specially designed to quietly slip through kelp, they also defended the shoreline. It was the job of one family to dissuade hungry otters that attempted to rob shellfish, says Hup In Yook Tom Happynook, Huu-ay-aht Hereditary Whaling Chief of the Nuu-chah-nulth Nation. “My grandfather used to say that to deter the sea otters from coming onto the beach, they would kill a couple of them and anchor them… so that the sea otters that were coming in would see their cousins had been killed,” says Happynook. “Prior to colonialism being put upon us through the Fisheries Act and the Indian Act, our Hereditary Leaders had control over specific territories,” says Wilson. Controlling the area came with the responsibility for looking after everything in the territory. “That included the people, because people are very much a part of what is the ecosystem,” she says. Clam gardens – watery raised beds along the coast that created sheltered waters for shellfish cultivation – also had stone walls perhaps just high enough to impede otters climbing in for a feast. Department and Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) sea otter biologist Linda Nichol explains that while a river otter “can scoot around on the land quite well”, the hind paws of sea otters have “elongated to create flippers so they are quite awkward on land”. Nichol grew up around the Strait of Georgia, the protected narrow stretch of Pacific between Vancouver and Vancouver Island. She was a young child when sea otters were reintroduced to Checleset Bay. Checleset Bay otter numbers didn’t immediately take off. At first they struggled to adapt. By 1977, the original 89 had dipped down to 70. Somehow, just as sleeping otters cling to kelp, their population hung on and then began to grow. Similar translocations of Alaskan otters to the Washington and Oregon coast were not as successful. Colonies of otters in Oregon eventually blinked out, with sea otters in that state now found only in aquaria. On the island shores of Haida Gwaii , some 300km north-west of Checleset Bay, otters have been absent for a century but in recent years there have been periodic sightings of solitary otter males cruising by. With local reliance on shellfish, there is strong motivation to seek sea otter management solutions before more arrive along with their voracious appetites. As Burt’s collaborative study notes, First Nations were never consulted prior to British Columbia’s Checleset Bay sea otter reintroductions. “In that era there was a real recognition of major declines in species… and an overarching desire, where possible, to turn those things around,” says Nichol, who joined DFO in 2001 as part of a group monitoring otter recovery. Acknowledging the reintroduction era as one of disconnection with indigenous people, at that time, “a full grasp of the ecosystem shift that results from sea otters was also not yet well recognised”, she says. Smoothing the waters This story of sea otter conservation is part of a legacy of colonial-style conservation, says Anne Salomon, a socio-ecological systems researcher at Simon Fraser University, and originator of a broader Coastal Voices multimedia project, working with Burt and multiple First Nations. Protecting nature from people by treating humans and nature as separate rather than integrated, she elaborates, prioritises the well-being of an endangered species at the cost of impoverishing indigenous people who coexisted successfully with otters for millennia before Europeans arrived, historically managing numbers so that they, like the otters, could benefit from the shellfish bounty of the shores. Through Salomon and Burt’s research collaboration, combining indigenous knowledge and Western science, they are aiming to chart a middle ground, broadening the conversation surrounding sea otter recovery, says Salomon, “to one that focuses on social-ecological resilience and boldly addresses issues of equity, justice, and inclusivity”. To launch their more recent examination of otter-human interactions in British Columbia, Salomon and Wilson, her early partner on the project, wanted to gain the blessing of Hereditary Chief Councils of the Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida and Heiltsuk First Nations. Arriving in the massive room to present their research idea for review by assembled First Nation leaders, Salomon remembers feeling intimidated by the responsibility of forging positive relationships across cultures, the success of the project hanging in the balance. Wilson recalls turning to her to whisper “I’m so scared,” and Salomon whispering back “at least you’re First Nations!” The Hereditary Chiefs did give their blessing for the research to proceed. That affirmation led to the group’s 2014 workshop bringing together archaeologists, scientists, leaders and representatives from 19 First Nations across British Columbia and Alaska to discuss otter, shellfish, kelp and humans interactions and brainstorm coexistence solutions. Discussing the past, present and future, the researchers then surveyed attitudes and ideas of adults aged 19-96 in one Alaskan and one British Columbian community, places with contrasting timelines of rebounding otter coexistence. The people of the Kyuquot/Chekleset First Nations, living where biologists had introduced otters in the 1970s, had the least favourable view of the otters. “I feel like sea otters have more rights than I do,” says Skil Hiilans Allan Davidson, Hereditary Chief of the Haida Nation, one of Burt and Salomon’s coauthors. But in the Sugpiaq villages of Port Graham and Nanwalek, attitudes towards sea otters, which re-established there naturally in the 1950s, were more neutral or even positive. Though attitudes differed depending upon time since otter arrival, solutions suggested for improved coexistence converged on a desire for valuing indigenous knowledge, increasing indigenous authority and governance, and shared learning between indigenous communities around resource decision-making. The Sugpiaq people already hunt limited numbers of sea otters under a waiver to the US Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972) permitting hunting for processing and fashioning into handicrafts. But in Canada, despite otters reaching an abundance where the Species at Risk Act technically permits a First Nations licence to hunt otters for food, social or ceremonial purposes, a tense relationship between Canada’s Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and coastal First Nations has thus far not led to sanctioned sea otter hunting. That, this new research argues, needs to change, with First Nations rights to non-wasteful sea otter hunting part of new path forward. “First Nations are essentially in a never-ending battle of trying to assert their indigenous rights to manage resources,” says Burt. Though British Columbia was the first Canadian province to sign the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) into law in 2019, it has yet to be endorsed at a national level. “Each time we want to have one of the things we did pre-history… we have to go to court, and it’s dragged on for decades,” says Wilson. Canada has enacted blanket laws like the Fisheries Act and Indian Act that generically undermines rights of indigenous peoples to resource sovereignty on traditional territories. Yet in regaining the recognition of resource rights and sovereignty, “each nation has to go separately”, says Wilson. “It’s like having a bully at school.” Swimming forward Though a return to their once widespread global distribution is still not secured, in its ability to come back, the sea otter is a remarkable story of resilience, says Angela Doroff, scientist with the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s sea otter specialist group. Sea otters have some special traits that have made a comeback possible. These, she says, include “its diversity of prey, its ability to learn and share learning”. Shared learning, it appears, benefits otters and humans alike. From the beginning of the project, “we have all been willing to learn from each other and trust each other,” says Salomon. That positive relationship fostered between First Nations and Western scientists around study design, focus, and implementation, “is not typically done in science or resource management,” argues Salomon. “It ought to be. It needs to be,” she says. Towards more harmonious sea otter-First Nations coexistence, Wilson sees collaborations between scientists and indigenous communities as “the kind of outside the box [solutions] that we have to do”. From a purely species-driven ecological perspective, the sea otter boom along the British Columbian coast might seem like a simple success story. Otters were locally extinct. Now they are thriving and recolonising. But setting aside that narrow, colonialist conservation lens, a more complex picture emerges. The story of rebounding otters, notes Burt, “is a narrative where the costs and benefits differ depending on what perspective you come from”. With First Nations increasingly leading research efforts, the next chapter of the story could benefit from a new view: that the humans that have lived alongside otters for millennia are an important thread not separate from, but woven into the rich fabric of Pacific coast ecosystems. -- The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

risk appetite,F1 Q&A: Your questions answered before Japanese GP,2024-09-15,2024-04-02,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/68707568,"Red Bull's Max Verstappen is top of the drivers' championship but his lead has been cut to four points following his retirement in Australia.  As Formula 1 heads to the iconic Suzuka circuit for the Japanese Grand Prix this weekend,  BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions. Is Toto Wolff's position under scrutiny? Third year the car has underperformed drastically, no improvement in sight, top driver leaving. Andrew: Over the past couple of years since Mercedes started struggling in Formula 1, reports that Toto Wolff's position might be under threat have periodically emerged. These misunderstand Wolff's position at Mercedes, where he is chief executive officer and team principal at the F1 team and director of Mercedes motorsport. Wolff is a one-third owner of the team. Mercedes itself and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos company also own one-third each. So he can't be sacked in the same way as a football manager might be. How to follow the Japanese Grand Prix on the BBC  After the Australian Grand Prix, when it became clear that Mercedes were still struggling to understand their car, Wolff was asked whether he felt he was still the right person to lead the team. He said: ""As a co-owner of this business, I need to make sure my contribution is positive and creative. I would be the first one to say if somebody has a better idea, tell me, because I am interested to turn this team around as quickly as possible.  ""We have a physics problem and not a philosophical or organisational problem. Because we haven't taken a dumb pill since 2021. It's just we don't understand some of the behaviours of the car that in the past we would have always understood."" Sam: Daniel Ricciardo's form doesn't look good enough to get a Red Bull seat. Yuki Tsunoda looks unlikely too. Who gets the seat if Max Verstappen or Sergio Perez goes? Andrew: At the moment, neither Ricciardo nor Tsunoda are likely to get a Red Bull seat in 2025 if either Verstappen or Perez leave. Ricciardo has been out-performed by Tsunoda since he returned to F1 midway through last season - it looks at the moment as if the Australian has yet to recover the form he previously showed at Red Bull and Renault before his dip after joining McLaren.  And Ricciardo is at risk of being dropped before too long this season and being replaced at RB by reserve driver Liam Lawson, who impressed when he stood in for Ricciardo last season. And Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko does not rate Tsunoda, who was forced on him by engine partner Honda. Some inside RB say that is unfair, and that Tsunoda has been performing at an elite level so far this season. But Marko remains to be convinced. That being the case, the contenders for any vacant Red Bull seat are the same ones as those for any other vacant seat at a top team - with Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz at the top of the list of potentials. Peter Gilmour: Is F1 becoming a closed shop for new drivers? Could there be a type of promotion/relegation with the drivers from F2? Andrew: No, it's not. Oliver Bearman's performance in Saudi Arabia has made it extremely likely that he will get a seat in F1 next year. And Mercedes are nurturing their 17-year-old protege Andrea Kimi Antonelli for a move to F1, perhaps as early as next year. If young drivers are good enough, they will get an F1 opportunity. There is no appetite for a formal promotion-relegation of drivers from F2. That's not how driver selection works. It's not a league system. David Dunford: With the cost cap restricting teams in funding, improvements and reliability of cars, should there not be a better way to allow teams to catch up? Andrew: The bosses of F1 would argue that the cost cap and the other systems in place to try to level the field need to be given time to work. Remember that as well as the budget cap, there is a sliding scales of restrictions on aerodynamic research, with the most successful teams permitted the least and the least successful the most. This has only been in place since 2021 and it will inevitably take time to have an effect. The field spread has come down dramatically in that period - from 2.4 seconds between the fastest and slowest cars on average in qualifying in 2020 to 1.4secs last year. David Irvine: Is the DRS automatic or is it controlled by the drivers? Has there ever been a penalty for using it incorrectly and are drivers monitored? Andrew: The DRS (drag-reduction system) overtaking aid is driver-operated. He presses a button on the steering wheel when he crosses the line that marks the start of a zone where it may be used. It only works if the car is within the requisite one second of the car in front. It shuts automatically when he hits the brakes. Do the Germans always win?

risk appetite,The mega-dam crowdfunded by a judge,2024-09-15,2018-10-29,By Abid Hussain,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45968574,"Cash-poor Pakistan is crowdfunding a drive to collect almost $17bn from its citizens, officials, businesses and stars in order to build two massive dams to help counter a future water crisis.  One of the dams would be among the biggest in the world. But is the project for real or is it a monumental folly, as some are calling it? If it's ever built, the dam at Diamer-Bhasha in the north-west would have a generating capacity of 4,500MW and stand 272m (892ft) high, making it the world's sixth tallest dam. Located near the Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat, it would block off a huge valley system on the upper reaches of the Indus river. The dam has been talked about for more than a decade, but plans to begin construction were given fresh impetus this summer not by water experts or ministers - but by Pakistan's top judge, Chief Justice Saqib Nisar. Following a report predicting severe water shortages in the country by 2025, he set up a fund to raise $14bn to build the mega-dam in Diamerg, and $2.5bn to build an 800MW dam in Mohmand, about 120km (75 miles) to the south-west.  ""It is possible that we will get more money than the required amount,"" said the judge.  Justice Nisar became the first donor, contributing roughly $8,000 to the fund. Many others have since followed suit. These include various branches of the military, which have donated a whopping $7.3m. Businesses, officials, sports stars, school pupils and other ordinary people are among those who have also stumped up cash.  Almost every day there's a press release from the Supreme Court with news of different individuals and institutions meeting the chief justice and donating to the fund. Many have cases pending in court, which has raised suspicions they may be trying to influence the judiciary.  There are many donors who appear glad to have contributed, but not all agree. Marium Zia Khan, an Islamabad resident, told the BBC she would not contribute to the fund.  ""While I understand water scarcity merits urgent attention... crowdfunding mega infrastructure projects such as a dam is a flawed idea.""  Critics have been warned they may be tried for treason if they make fun of the fund.  But the pro-dam lobby is free to express its opinion - and there's an air of hysteria about the urgency to build more dams, with telethons and advertisements urging people to contribute as their patriotic duty. Last month Prime Minister Imran Khan joined in, delivering a special address in which he asked overseas Pakistanis to contribute $1,000 each to the dam fund. He also presided over a fundraising dinner in Karachi in September, where he managed to raise almost $6m.  ""I am the greatest fundraiser in the history of Pakistan,"" he said afterwards.  ""I assure you that we have to meet our target of 30bn rupees every year and we will meet more than our target as all Pakistanis have been mobilised today.""  But the reality has been rather different so far. Five months after the fund was established, contributions add up to just over $50m - a trickle compared with the vast sums it is estimated the two dams would cost.  This at a time when Pakistan is seeking loans from the IMF and other countries to stave off a balance of payments crisis and to service its debt. Danish Mustafa from King's College department of geography is not optimistic the dam will be built. ""I can't imagine this drive working. No country in the world has ever undertaken an infrastructure project which is almost 10% of its total GDP. You have to be semi-insane to want to do that,"" he said. In 2014, researchers at Oxford University published a study on 245 large dams built around the world from 1934-2007, and found mega-dams ""don't make economic sense"".  They singled out the Diamer-Bhasha Dam project as a case study for potential cost and construction overruns. If construction had started in 2010, the findings suggested, it wouldn't have been completed until 2027 - by which time the total cost could have ballooned to close to $30bn.  One of the authors of the report, Prof Bent Flyvbjerg, compared those seeking to build mega-dams to ""fools and reckless optimists"". He told The Ecologist journal in 2014 that such projects also ran the risk of the public being misled ""for private gain, fiscal or political, by painting overly positive prospects of an investment"".  Shams-ul-Mulk, former chairman of Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), firmly disagrees. ""Pakistan will face a drought-like situation if large dams are not constructed,"" he told the BBC. ""Those who oppose the construction of large dams are not aware of the looming water crisis in the country and don't want Pakistan to progress."" But this raises questions over whether Pakistan is actually a water-scarce country. A 2015 IMF report put total annual availability of water at 191 million acre feet (MAF), which it said would become insufficient by 2025 when demand is expected to rise to 274 MAF. Many say this is due to Pakistan's surge in population which has already tripled since 1970.  But experts point out that little or nothing has been done to ensure water is used more efficiently.  Hassan Abbas, a hydrology expert, says the solution for periodic shortages ""does not lie in another mega structure. It lies in improving our management practices."" This would require efficient irrigation - such as drip irrigation and paving of water-courses to reduce seepage - as well as steps to reduce water loss. Then there are the socio-economic and ecological costs of constructing mega structures on water courses, often with serious political implications. After signing a water treaty with India in 1960, Pakistan built two of the largest dams in the world, Tarbela and Mangla. The purpose was both to generate electricity and divert water for irrigation. While it improved the electricity situation in the country for some time, it gradually led to the desertification of millions of acres of land in the Indus Delta region of Sindh province.  Upriver, hundreds of villages were submerged and thousands were uprooted by the building of reservoirs. Compensation was promised and rehabilitation plans made, but locals are still waiting for a full and final settlement. Meanwhile, mudflows carried by the rivers created silt deposits at the dams, depleting their storage capacity. Other controversial dam projects have since been shelved, but many have gone ahead. None are on the scale of Diamer-Bhasha, which was floated as an idea in the early 2000s. But global financial institutes such as the World Bank have consistently refused to provide funding, citing the seismicity of the area and saying the dam would be controversial, since India claims ownership of Gilgit-Baltistan, its proposed location. Backers of the mega-dam argue it is not designed to divert water for irrigation and therefore there would have no negative impact on agriculture in Sindh.  But experts believe it will still hurt the Indus Delta region, where residents are already protesting against the building of the dam.  So why has Pakistan's top judge gone out of his way to promote this? The answer may lie in the huge appetite for irrigation water in Punjab, politically the country's most influential province and home to just under 60% of its population.  Pakistan has the world's largest canal irrigation system - and most of it ends up in Punjab, to the annoyance of other provinces. Or could it be there's an element of national pride that was piqued when international funding for the project was withheld. Either way, there are other ways of raising the huge sums of money required for dams. Simi Kamal, a geographer, says there is room for dams in Pakistan - but suggests water bonds as a ""more rational"" way of fundraising than charity donations. As an example she points to the $5bn Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which was funded in large part by this method. ""We should not be making speeches for or against dams, or make dams into idols or ideology,"" she told the BBC.  ""It is not that simple. The current clamour for dams and frenzied soundbites by (mostly) ill-informed people is quite immature and requires restraint until we have good science and a better knowledge base in place."""
risk appetite,The best and worst year of Humza Yousaf's career,2024-09-15,2023-12-31,By Philip Sim,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67787883,"In theory, it has been the best year of Humza Yousaf's career. He has ascended the pinnacle of Scottish politics, landing his dream job as first minister. But the circumstances have hardly been ideal. In fact it feels like almost everything else that could have gone wrong, has gone wrong. What happened in Scottish politics in 2023, and what does it all tell us about Humza Yousaf? In the space of 12 months, the SNP has changed leader and first minister, chief executive, president, Westminster leader, treasurer and communications chief. It has been a period of remarkable change for a party headed by the man who was meant to be the ""continuity candidate"". Nicola Sturgeon's resignation on 15 February came out of the blue for many, and the contest to replace her was a rapid, bruising and ultimately squeaky-tight affair. After a series of other allies ruled themselves out, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf was happy to be seen as carrying on her legacy - a sensible move in a party still loyal to its figurehead. But he came under sustained attack from his key rival, Kate Forbes, whose slogan was ""continuity won't cut it"" - a line that opposition leaders still quote back at Mr Yousaf. The once-slick party machine imploded during the contest, with communications chief Murray Foote and chief executive Peter Murrell quitting for misleading the public about membership figures. Worse was to come when Mr Murrell - husband of Ms Sturgeon - was arrested as a suspect in an ongoing police investigation into the funding and finances of the SNP. This involved the stunning sight of uniformed officers carrying stacks of boxes out of the party's HQ, and even erecting a blue forensic tent in the driveway of the former first minister. Then-treasurer Colin Beattie and Ms Sturgeon were arrested for questioning too - and like Mr Murrell, were released without charge pending further inquiries. Rather than savouring his narrow victory Mr Yousaf must have felt like the ceiling was falling in, as Operation Branchform overshadowed his every move. He resisted any temptation to distance himself from Ms Sturgeon though, describing her as ""the most impressive politician in Europe"". It remains to be seen how wise that was. But for all the loyalty in words, in deeds Mr Yousaf has been far less sentimental about his role as continuity candidate. He has shredded a series of policy commitments from the twilight of the Sturgeon era, with a ban on alcohol advertising and an expansion of Highly Protected Marine Areas being ditched outright. The National Care Service was reduced in scope considerably and has drifted off into the next term of parliament, as has the Deposit Return Scheme. Mr Yousaf initially stuck by Ms Sturgeon's commitment to challenge the UK government's veto of Holyrood gender reform legislation, but has now abandoned that too after the Court of Session ruled that the block was lawful. It is perhaps a sign of strength that Mr Yousaf felt able to bin so much of his predecessor's legacy. It briefly felt like he was clearing the decks to set out his own vision. But there was nothing strikingly new in his first programme for government. The bills announced had almost all been consulted on already, or announced by Ms Sturgeon previously.  If there was a Yousaf Doctrine in there, it was about trying to combine a business-friendly pro-growth approach with a big-government interventionist one. To get the economy motoring to raise funds for the rapid expansion of the social security safety net. That is easier said than done, and Mr Yousaf inherited a government in the midst of an inflation crisis, staring into a £1.5bn black hole in its finances. That led to a budget steeped in pragmatism, coupling tax rises with funding cuts. The social justice policies at the core of Mr Yousaf's leadership bid were prioritised, as was the health service he used to run, but otherwise the settlement has pleased few. The one thing he has retained is Ms Sturgeon's independence strategy - the old one, of seeking a mandate for a referendum via electoral wins, which ultimately failed to move the dial. Activists remain restless about the lack of clear direction. Mr Yousaf has perhaps been at his most first ministerial when dealing with intensely difficult circumstances, though. When his wife's parents were trapped in Gaza at the outset of war, he was broadly seen to have handled the situation well. He reached out to both the Jewish and Muslim communities, settled quickly on a position of personal principle, and articulated it well. Other leaders had a harder time - and the SNP illustrated this at Westminster by forcing a vote on a ceasefire which sparked a Labour rebellion and a rash of front-bench resignations. It was the party's most notable manoeuvre in the Commons for years. That stand-off with Labour will become the focus of Mr Yousaf's campaigning as SNP leader. Nicola Sturgeon completed Alex Salmond's project of supplanting Labour's place atop Scottish politics, conquering its electoral heartlands in the central belt and positioning the SNP as the anti-Tory vote. There are still plenty of opportunities for a constitutional spat with the Tories - the favourite pastime of both parties - given the ""muscular unionism"" of Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and the row with Lord David Cameron over foreign engagements. But with the sands threatening to shift at Westminster, Labour are part of the conversation again. Evidence of this came in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election, a comfortable gain for Labour. The 20-point swing puts numerous previously safe-looking SNP seats in danger. Mr Yousaf's response, at SNP conference days later, was a surprise announcement of a council tax freeze. It might be popular with struggling households, but the hastily-arranged move blindsided councils and sparked a furious row over the budget. How worried the first minister is about Labour is also evidenced by how savage his weekly exchanges with Anas Sarwar are at Holyrood. There is little love lost between two men who see each other as their key electoral rival. Within the SNP, Mr Yousaf has tried to run a more open government than Ms Sturgeon, who became known for controlling everything from within a tight inner circle. Mr Yousaf has sought to give his cabinet more agency, and is more tolerant of dissent from the back benches too.  That is perhaps partly a recognition of how narrow his margin of victory was, but also of a more inclusive approach than his predecessor.  It has, however, created a feeling that the party's famed iron discipline has begun to rust. Ms Forbes frequently contradicts him on policy, while fellow leadership contender Ash Regan has departed for Alba and SNP stalwart Fergus Ewing is facing suspension for breaking the whip. The trio are united in their opposition to the Bute House agreement with the Scottish Greens. However Mr Yousaf has displayed loyalty to his partners in government, standing up to defend minister Lorna Slater from a confidence vote. On the same theme he also displayed staunch support for an embattled colleague when Michael Matheson was embroiled in an almighty mess over the data roaming bill for his parliamentary iPad. There is a pragmatic side to this too - Mr Yousaf really doesn't need to be replacing his health secretary at a critical time of year for the NHS, and he needs to keep the Greens on side to sustain a majority in parliament. As bruising as 2023 has been, the trouble for Mr Yousaf is that there are still more things that can go wrong. The police investigation is yet to report back, with prosecutors working to decide whether there is sufficient evidence and a public interest to lay charges - the two-part test the Crown Office applies to every case. The row over the budget is still young, and the council tax freeze hangs in the balance.  For all that inflation has drifted gently down, many still feel their household finances are teetering. Leaders of all parties have detected an appetite for change. And they may get the chance before long, with a general election expected. The debate about exactly when has grown deeply tedious, but it is coming. The SNP is still in a dominant position in Scottish politics, but that makes it all the harder to make gains - and even a handful of losses will look like a shift in momentum. We have learned much about Humza Yousaf's character and leadership through the adversity he has faced in 2023. He may wish for a 2024 where he can do more to shape events, rather than risk being a leader who is swept along by them."
risk appetite,How to set up shop in China,2024-09-15,2014-02-10,Euan McKirdy,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140210-how-to-set-up-shop-in-china,"Flourishing in China BBC Capital takes you to the Middle Kingdom for insight on how to succeed... Coming this week: Navigating China’s Silicon Valley How to get hired for top jobs in China The business world is looking east for new opportunities, even as China’s stellar economic performance begins to slow. But setting up shop in China is not as simple as hanging your hat in Hangzou: a truism underlined by expensive mistakes from retail giants Kraft and supermarket Tesco. A complex market and myriad regulations continue to confound even the most experienced China specialists. But there are ways to access the world’s biggest consumer market—so long as you watch out for the pitfalls.   Foot in the door   When foreign managers want to start a Chinese business unit, their first port of call is often a Joint Venture (JV), a partnership with a Chinese company. This can offer the inside-track on the local market, an established office infrastructure plus on-the-ground knowledge of the labyrinthine governmental regulations and red tape that may be encountered. In short, the right JV takes away many of the headaches associated with arriving in the country ‘blind.’ Principal Financial Group, a global financial company and parent of asset manager Principal Global Investors set up its JV in 2005. The entity, CCB Principal Asset Management, is partnered with the world’s second-largest bank by market value, the China Construction Bank (CCB). Principal offers mutual funds and asset management services to individuals and corporations in China through CCB. For companies eager to establish a foothold in the country, there are a number of other ways to build market presence, including an offshore – or fly-in — strategy. In addition to, or sometimes as an alternative to JVs, companies can also set up representative offices, which are owned by the overseas company but not able to generate revenue in China. Setting up a WOFE –a wholly owned foreign enterprise – is a mechanism that’s also gaining popularity and starting to become more feasible. But this structure, essentially going it alone, remains unproven for companies in the financial sector, said Andrea Muller, Chief Executive, Asia of Principal Global Investors. For the time-being, therefore, a WOFE is perceived as higher risk for foreign firms. On the ground However a company sets up in China, there is no substitute for having your own company’s people in the country. “It’s a mistake to focus on offshoring and not having people on the ground,” said Muller’s colleague Zeid Ayer, special assistant general manager at CCB Principal (the name of the JV between Principal and CCB) who is based in Beijing. “It’s key, especially in a country like China, to establish those relationships.” That’s in large part because contact with the regulators when it comes to key market events and developments make “being there” crucial to “understanding local markets better, investor appetite, which products work best”, Ayer said. Some of the most strikingly unfamiliar territory for overseas business people in China involves meeting new partners. Chinese business culture is social: foreign partners are often expected to eat heartily and drink heavily as part of the business arrangement. And endless rounds of baijiu alcohol can seem like a daunting endurance test for those unfamiliar with Chinese social business conventions. Strict hierarchies can also lead to misunderstandings – there is often little of the directness foreigners might be accustomed to and a lack of deference towards a potential partner may swiftly end any talks, for example due to a lack of understanding of the concepts of guanxi or face.  Proceed with caution Given the country’s track record with issues like corruption – it scores a lowly 40 out of 100 on Transparency International’s Corruption Index . By sharp contrast Japan, the nation China leapt over to become the world’s second largest economy scores 74 and the US gets a mark of 73.International firms are warned to tread particularly carefully around supply chain-related issues and hiring under-qualified staff. As foreign direct investment has increased exponentially, so has the need for well-trained, internationally-minded managers. Training and keeping these employees is crucial for business growth but job-hopping and impromptu demands for higher wages are on the rise. “The business opportunities in China are enormous but experience shows us that [multinationals] need to keep their eyes wide open,” said Violet Ho, senior managing director at Kroll, a global risk consultancy. It’s critical for companies to establish a strong anti-corruption process starting with due diligence on third-party partners such as distributors, deal-brokers or suppliers, where there is a “clearly understood potential for fraud”, Ho said. That includes advertising agencies, travel agents or even event organisers — all suppliers that would typically be considered low risk in other countries for instances fraud or money laundering in most developed markets. Good taste Sensitivity to different consumer tastes is also crucial to survival, said Richard Barton, managing partner, Newgate Communications in Hong Kong. Barton said companies that try to shoehorn existing marketing strategies in to the Chinese market often find nothing but failure. “This has especially been true of the food and beverage sector, where tastes aren't just different nationally, but regionally and locally, too,” he said. Food manufacturer, Kraft failed to penetrate the Chinese cookie market, until it altered the size, shape and flavour of its Oreo cookies and made them less sweet. Other companies have spent significant sums developing locally relevant flavours: Frito-Lay, now sells crisps in ‘Fermented Beancurd’, ‘Numb and Spicy Hot Pot,’ ‘Cheese Lobster’ and ‘Hot & Sour Fish Soup flavours.’ While challenging, taking the time to get it right can be extremely lucrative. As the world’s second-largest economy China continues to develop and the rewards for securing an established presence as the country’s market – and spending power – are huge. Retail sales amounted to 16.88 trillion yuan, (around $2.77 trillion) according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics.  “The benefit [for us] of actually getting it right is the payoff in the future, to be part of the growing market, to be part of a growing middle class there,” said Principal Global Investors’ Muller.

risk appetite,Iran's digital start-ups signal changing times,2024-09-15,2015-10-11,Hossein Sharif,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34458898,"Western business people returning to Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal may be surprised to find plenty of entrepreneurial drive from a new generation of online start-ups, which have appeared despite years of international sanctions.  If Amazon chief Jeff Bezos were to go to Iran today, he would find a lot that looks very familiar.  Digikala is an Amazon-style Iranian company offering free, same-day delivery of digital gadgets. Set up by brothers Hamid and Saeed Mohammadi, it's the country's sixth most visited website, with a staff of 900 and about 850,000 visitors every day. ""Eight years ago, digital cameras were all the rage,"" says Hamid.  ""My brother and I were looking to buy one, but we couldn't find a single Farsi review online.""   They ended up buying a camera locally only to discover that the lens wasn't genuine. ""It got us thinking - what if there was a site where you could read all the reviews and reliably buy the product?"" That initial experience led to the creation of a company that combines an online retailing arm with a review site similar to CNet, the US technical review giant. ""We have our own studio and a 100-strong content team,"" says Hamid. ""They test the products and shoot and edit reviews for our Digikala TV.""  Digikala is Iran's biggest internet company In many ways Digikala has benefited from what Prof Nader Habibi, of Brandeis University, in the United States, calls the empty playground caused by sanctions ""Companies who rely on foreign trade and imports were harmed the most [by sanctions],"" he told the BBC.  ""But for domestic digital companies sanctions just kept out reputable brands like Amazon and Google. It actually gave them an opportunity to raise their market share."" In 2014, the World Startup Report, external, a US-based organisation that monitors new online businesses, valued Digikala at $150m (£100m).  Today, the company says it is worth more than $500m. Despite the damage that sanctions have done to the Iranian economy overall, Digikala has no shortage of customers willing to spend big money on items like top-of-the range smartphones. For Hamid, this is no contradiction. ""Iran has one of the youngest, most highly educated populations in the region,"" he says. ""For them, technology isn't a luxury. It's the fabric of their lives. They will get it, even if it is difficult to afford."" 1. Digikala, valued at $150m 2. Aparat Group, $30m 3. Cafe Bazaar, $20m Source: World Startup Report 2014 Digikala is just one of many internet companies that have sprung up in Iran, taking advantage of a huge spike in internet use over the past two years.   Another popular site is Cafe Bazaar, an Android app store that now has an 85% market share, serving Iranians Google could not reach because of sanctions.  Its bestselling list includes both the globally popular Clash of Clans and locally developed games such as The Bike, which sends up Tehran's notoriously risk-taking motorcyclists. The Bike is a parody game that makes fun of Tehran’s motorcyclists and their dangerous practices Takhfifan is a successful Iranian clone of Groupon, offering everything from discounted restaurant deals to spa days and theatre tickets.  On Fidibo, Iran's answer to online book retailer Kindle, recent bestsellers have included George Orwell's 1984, several books by Stephen Hawking, a biography of Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, and US President Barack Obama's autobiography, The Audacity of Hope.  And then there's Maman-Paz (meaning ""Cooked by a Mum""), which connects hungry office workers to housewives selling home-cooked meals. Mama Manijeh is one of many women selling their home-cooked meals to office workers via Iranian start-up Maman Paz The appearance of sites such as these means many Iranians now live their lives between two parallel worlds - the cyber-universe of gadgets, gaming and high-end consumerism, and the more familiar Iran of ultra-conservative clerics, public executions and anti-Western slogans.  The other official Iran is still very much in existence of course, but it no longer has sole control over the narrative, says sociologist Hossein Ghazian, a former adviser to ex-President Mohammad Khatami. ""In Iran you used to have the hegemony of a central official culture,"" he told the BBC.  ""Not any more."" Iran's National Internet Development Centre says internet penetration now stands at 73%, making Iran one of the biggest internet users in the Middle East.  Young Iranians in particular are so connected to the world, that they are now ""the least anti-Western oriented"" people in the region, says Prof Fawas Gerges, of the London School of Economics. It's a sign of how things are changing that many conservative politicians are now turning to social media to get their message across to the younger generation. Twitter and Facebook may still be blocked in Iran, but that doesn't stop the country's top brass, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, from regularly using both sites. The hashtags used the most by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in his 3,109 tweets. Analysed using Tweetchup.com ""The conservatives' use of these new platforms is not without consequence,"" says Hossein Ghazian.  ""In order to use them, they have to change themselves. They have to carve themselves and their message so that they can fit into this new world. It will subconsciously change them."" In a conservative, authoritarian country such as Iran, entrepreneurs are obviously taking risks and pushing boundaries by running Western-style online businesses.  In interviews they are careful to steer well away from politics, but there are signs that the tide is beginning to turn. ""When 4G first came, it was supposed to be forbidden,"" says Digikala's Hamid Mohammadi.  ""But now, increasing bandwidth is the government's top priority and 4G is everywhere. ""The internet,"" he pauses, ""...is doing its own thing.""  Iran country profile Will nuclear deal really change Iran?

risk appetite,Lords urge action on electric car 'misinformation',2024-09-15,2024-02-06,Esme Stallard,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68130432,"The government must do more to counter ""misinformation"" on electric vehicles published in parts of the UK press, a Lords enquiry has said. Despite the UK passing the milestone on Monday of 1m electric cars registered, growth of the sector has flatlined.  The Lords Climate Change Committee urged the government to build consumer confidence and push back against what it called mistruths on range and cost. The government did not comment on this but said £2bn was committed to EVs. Nearly a quarter of the UK's carbon emissions - responsible for climate change - are produced by road transport, according to the latest figures. Switching to electric vehicles could help to significantly reduce these emissions, but despite government and industry efforts only about 3% of cars are powered by electricity.  Baroness Parminter, chair of the committee, told the BBC that both government officials and other witnesses to the enquiry had reported reading disinformation on the subject in national newspapers. ""We have seen a concerted effort to scare people... we have seen articles saying that cars are catching fire - but had evidence that the fire risk is absolutely the same as [petrol and diesel] cars,"" she said.  The Lords committee did not single out any newspaper in particular. Testifying before the committee, Richard Bruce, Director of Transport Decarbonisation at the Department for Transport, conceded there was a problem. He said: ""I do think there has been an impact from a concerted campaign of misinformation over the last 14 months or so that has been pushing consistent myths about EVs that people absorb and which is reflected in their appetite [for purchasing EVs]. ""There is an anti-EV story in the papers almost every day. Sometimes there are many stories, almost all of which are based on misconceptions and mistruths, unfortunately."" Baroness Parminter said the government needed to step in and provide reliable information to consumers.  ""In the speech by the PM last year where he said getting to net zero was going to be hard… the message that the public got is that this was less of a priority, I don't need to worry about this now. But net zero is fast approaching and the sooner we do it the cheaper it will be,"" she added. The government has made available a list of common questions and answers on the transition to EVs, including battery range and chargepoint availability across the country. As well as tackling misinformation the committee also called on the government to unlock funding more quickly for local authorities to install charging infrastructure.  The Lords heard how local authorities had to wait eight months to have their applications processed for the On-street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS).  The number of public chargers also varies significantly across the country. In the north west of England there are just 31 public chargers per 100,000 population compared with 131 in London.  Cllr Darren Rodwell, transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: ""Councils will do what they can in partnership with the private sector to respond to growing demand and local priorities."" But he added: ""The best way of supporting the transition to net-zero emissions from local transport is for councils to be given long-term funding certainty."" A Department for Transport spokesperson told the BBC that this week: ""The first councils are starting to receive part of the £381m local electric vehicle infrastructure fund alongside new grants to install charge points in state schools and nurseries.""   The Lords did recognise the challenges that the government faced with falling tax revenues as the number of EVs grow and said road taxation will need to be ""fundamentally redesigned"". Currently EV owners are not required to pay excise duty, congestion charge and fuel duty. But Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of ZapMap, a UK EV mapping service, told the BBC that bringing in new taxes for EVs was too early as consumer confidence was still growing.  She offered an alternative solution: ""We need to up the taxes on the heavy polluting petrol and diesel cars. It is the heavy vehicles that cause the most damage."" Paris residents just voted to introduce higher parking charges for large SUV petrol and diesel vehicles as part of efforts to recoup public costs from more polluting modes of transport. "
risk appetite,Was this the week Israel and Hezbollah drew closer to war?,2024-09-15,2024-03-16,Mark Lowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68575413,"Since the start of the Israel-Gaza war, following the Hamas attack of 7 October, the overriding fear has been that the conflict could spill over into something even deadlier. The day after the Hamas assault, Lebanon's most powerful armed group Hezbollah fired guided rockets and shells into Israel in solidarity with Hamas, prompting Israeli drone and artillery retaliation.  Could Israel, traumatised and vulnerable, with a prime minister fighting for political survival, decide the threat from across its northern border in Lebanon needs to be neutralised?  The fear has been that Benjamin Netanyahu's government might be tempted into a second front in the war, against Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is intent on destroying the Jewish state. And if so, would it draw in Iran, Hezbollah's key patron in the region and sworn enemy of the US? This week Israel carried out more air strikes on the Bekaa valley, deep into Lebanon, taking the death toll in Lebanon since the start of the conflict to more than 240.  In retaliation, Hezbollah fired a barrage of 100 Katyusha rockets on northern Israel, its heaviest attack since the war began, with targets including Israeli army bases in the Golan Heights. At least 17 Israelis have been killed in attacks from Lebanon and Syria since October. The rockets this week prompted an angry post by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, addressed to the Defence Minister Yoav Gallant: ""The military is your responsibility. What are you waiting for? We have to start responding, attacking - war, now!"" Last month, Chief of Staff of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) Herzi Halevi said: ""We are now focusing on being prepared for war in the north."" For long, it seemed that the clashes on the border were carefully calibrated around unspoken red lines to avoid escalation into all-out war.  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has not called for it. Memories in Lebanon are still fresh of the disastrous 2006 war with Israel, which left more than 1,000 Lebanese dead. And Israel knows that Hezbollah's military capability is far greater than that of Hamas. A poll published in the country's Maariv newspaper last month showed that 71% of respondents favoured a large-scale military operation to drive Hezbollah back. Sarit Zehavi lives close to the Lebanese border and heads the Alma research centre, which specialises on the threat there. She says Hezbollah's aim is ""to drag Israel into war without actually initiating it"". But, she argues, Israel is not looking for all-out confrontation. ""Israel's interest is to avoid full scale war - but achieve an improved security situation, while damaging Hezbollah's brigades as much as possible. For Israel, it is about choosing the least worst option: we understand the capability of Hezbollah here and the cost of war."" She believes that Hezbollah's use of rockets, which have a longer range than anti-tank missiles used previously by the group, is evidence of a shift in the group's military tactics and capability.  ""Hezbollah takes into consideration the cost of a war, but they don't look into the near future - they look years ahead."" ""They have already gained by forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israelis,"" she adds -  about 60,000 Israelis living in communities close to the border have fled the fighting since October, the largest such displacement in Israeli history. Around 100,000 Lebanese residents have also been moved from the other side of the border. To allow for the evacuees to return, Israel wants to push Hezbollah's forces back beyond the Litani river, which marks a buffer zone of sorts between Beirut and the Israeli border.  As part of the agreement to end the 2006 war, the area south of the Litani was supposed to be clear of military presence except for that of the Lebanese army and UN forces - which Hezbollah has violated. That's been part of discussions with Amos Hochstein, the US Special Envoy, who has been repeatedly dispatched to the region to avert an escalation. But a deal on Hezbollah's withdrawal and disarmament remains elusive. So far, both Benjamin Netanyahu and Hezbollah appear to be holding back from the precipice. The Israeli army is already stretched in Gaza, without opening a new front - and a new wave of international tension.  And Hezbollah is in reactive mode, opting more for a lower-level war of attrition. But the real risk is miscalculation, and caving into competing pressures.  Mr Netanyahu is battered by the perception that he left his country vulnerable to the worst attack in its history, reviled by families of the hostages who want him to strike a deal to bring them back, and excoriated by the West over the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza.  The fear is that he may see expanding the fight in Lebanon as key to his political survival - and that Israel, in the wake of the 7 October attacks, would not countenance the continued threat on its northern front without taking military action.  Professor Hilal Khashan, from the American University in Beirut, believes Israel's relative restraint so far doesn't tell the true story. ""Netanyahu clearly wants war,"" he says, pointing to Israel's strikes on about 4,000 positions across Lebanon since October.  ""He is finished politically and when the war stops, he will have to face his reckoning,"" he says. ""I don't think he'll give a damn about what the US or Europe will think - he has made up his mind on Hezbollah."" A further, and potentially more serious, unknown would be the response from Iran, which relies on Hezbollah, its proxy in Lebanon, as a bulwark against Israel.  Since the Hamas attack, Tehran has flexed its muscles across the Middle East. Iran-backed groups have hit US military bases in Iraq and Syria, and Yemen's Houthi rebels, aligned with Iran, have launched countless strikes on ships in the Red Sea. It has so far stopped short of an unfettered war. But major Israeli strikes on Hezbollah could change Tehran's calculus. In Lebanon, there is little appetite for full conflict with Israel, particularly among religious groups that don't belong to the Shia branch of Islam to which Hezbollah belongs. ""Non-Shias are almost unanimously opposed, and want Hezbollah to disarm,"" says Professor Khashan.  But Shias are unhappy about the fighting too, he says. ""By and large, they don't want war either."" Hassan Nasrallah has said that he will not agree to a ceasefire with Israel before there is a truce in Gaza. He is reported to have told an Iranian military leader last month that he did not want Iran to get sucked into a war with Israel or the United States - and that in the case of a full offensive with Israel, Hezbollah would fight on its own.  Still fear stalks those living on either side of a perilous border.  ""Every night, I take the images of 7 October massacre with me to bed,"" says Sarit Zehavi, ""and every morning I wake and say 'ok, the terrorists didn't invade again last night'. It's an existential threat in the deepest possible way."""
risk appetite,Trapped in the middle of Venezuela's political battle,2024-09-15,2019-05-03,Will Grant,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-48030691,"Violence has once again broken out on the streets of Venezuela. But just what has happened to the country, politically and economically, to cause such anger and division? The sun hadn't yet risen but Venezuelans were wide awake. A little before ‪6am, Juan Guaidó went live via social media from outside La Carlota military base in Caracas to call the country to action. ‬ ""The moment is now,"" said the opposition leader, flanked by members of the security forces and his political mentor, Leopoldo López, who had evidently escaped from house arrest. ""I invite you to come out on to the streets. The first of May begins now,"" referring to a large anti-government demonstration planned for the following day.  It was a risky move. If this was indeed the ""final phase"" of his effort to oust President Maduro, Mr Guaidó would need more than the handful of troops around him. He'd need the entire country to react. And historically in Venezuela, such moments tend to result in bloodshed. In the end, it was neither one thing nor the other. The uprising didn't unseat Mr Maduro or necessarily weaken his grip on power. Thankfully, there wasn't the degree of deadly violence that many had expected at the start of the day - notwithstanding dozens injured by pellets and rubber bullets and the shocking images of protesters outside La Carlota being run over by an armoured car. Leopoldo López ended the day inside the Spanish Embassy in Caracas and Juan Guaidó insisted the uprising had not been a coup attempt but an act of ""peaceful rebellion"".  Whatever Mr Guaidó hoped the day would bring clearly didn't happen. Yet it was another sign that President Maduro can still expect moments of resistance and conflict from an opposition determined to see the back of him and a population exhausted with a collapsing economy and a lack of basic services.  Amid the political brinksmanship, I was reminded of that collective exhaustion at the status quo, specifically of a few precious hours, a few weeks before the latest crisis, when running water returned to a handful of homes in La Vega.  As the news spread around the sprawling shantytown in western Caracas, residents made their way down from distant corners to the fortunate few brick shacks - plastic bottles and buckets in hand - to fill up before it was shut off again.  One neighbour, Ramelia Silva, struggling to carry her load as she corralled her grandchildren up the steep hillsides, showed me water which was yellowish and smelled foul.  ""It's not fit for human consumption,"" Ramelia acknowledged. ""We should only use it for washing and in the bathroom."" However, in the middle of a water crisis, she said that just wasn't realistic. ""How long will it go on?"" she asked angrily. ""We can't keep living like this.""  La Vega has been without a dependable water supply for over a year, explains community leader, Jairo Perez. ""I have warned the government, I've sent reports to NGOs that we work with and I keep repeating: an epidemic is on its way. We're on the verge of a secondary public health epidemic because this water should not be consumed. A couple of days later, I put Ramelia's basic point to Mr Guaidó between parliamentary sessions at the National Assembly: how long before anything changes in Venezuela?  ""I hope very soon,"" was his reply, denying the opposition had either miscalculated or squandered its momentum.  Beyond his enigmatic remark, though, there was little sign of the dramatic twist to come. At that point, the idea of him commanding rebel troops in clashes with their loyalist counterparts seemed unlikely. But Venezuela, especially at present, specialises in the unexpected. After declaring himself president in January, Guaidó was immediately recognised by the United States and more than 50 other nations.  Washington extended its sanctions from the Maduro inner circle to the all-important energy industry. By early March, people in Guaidó's team spoke confidently of being close to victory, of having passed the halfway point in a three- or four-month process to reach the presidential palace, Miraflores. ""He'll be gone any day now,"" was their prevailing sentiment.  By mid-April, those same advisers had radically revised that view. They spoke instead in more conservative terms of ""something"" happening ""before the end of the year"".  It's still not clear if this latest uprising was the sum total of that ""something"" or if there is more to come. Given the story so far, most Venezuelans expect further drama ahead.  In essence, Guaidó has two options to taking power: via the streets or the military.  Or some kind of simultaneous combination of the two, the elusive ""civic-military pact"" which Maduro's predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez, so prided himself on.  At Guaidó rallies, his supporters still turn out and make their anti-Maduro feelings heard despite the passing of the weeks and months. But it's becoming increasingly tough for people to keep taking to the streets when they have so much else to deal with, as thousands of communities like La Vega struggle to overcome the challenges of daily life in Venezuela.  Then there are the threats and intimidation from radical pro-government motorbike gangs called ""colectivos"" - in essence, armed paramilitary groups - and many are understandably too frightened to risk participating in demonstrations. After scores of young demonstrators and some police officers were killed in clashes in 2014 and 2017, there's limited appetite for more pitched battles.  ""I'm not going,"" Carmela tells me at a kids' football match a few hours before another protest. She lives in La Candelaria, a part of the capital where ""everything is controlled by the colectivos: the supermarkets, the streets, everything.""  ""I'm too scared of them to protest,"" Carmela explains, unwilling to give her full name. ""They're capable of killing people who take part. I have a six-year-old boy and can't risk leaving him with no mother."" Beyond street protests the other main actor in the Venezuelan conflict is the military.  This wasn't the first time Guaidó made a direct plea to the Venezuelan military to switch sides.  At the height of the tension in late February, with a convoy of humanitarian aid poised at the border with Colombia, a few hundred soldiers did jump ship in a number of much-publicised defections.  Yet the vast majority of rank-and-file troops stayed loyal, as did the top brass. That happened again on this latest occasion and both times, it has undoubtedly been a disappointment to the opposition.  Furthermore, if recent Venezuelan history has taught anything, it's that the military is key to owning the keys to Miraflores. Without them, taking power is virtually impossible. So, if things reach a breaking point in Venezuela, always a difficult thing to measure, where would the military's ultimate loyalty lie? With Maduro personally, with the ""Bolivarian Revolution"" begun by Hugo Chávez or with the people calling for change? ""With Benjamin Franklin,"" quips economist and opposition deputy, Angel Alvarado, referring to the US founding father whose face appears on the $100 bill.  ""The army doesn't have any ideology. There are some soldiers whose heart is to the left or the right, of course. But I think on the whole the army just wants to maximise their profits."" In Venezuela, the military has control of many key sectors of the economy.  ""Food production, mining, the oil sector, agriculture, anywhere there is money and rents to be made, you will find the military,"" claims Alvarado. Maintaining that monopoly is paramount to them, he argues. ""The problem is not hyperinflation and it's not the humanitarian emergency,"" argues Alvarado. ""It's the collapse of the economy which started in 2007.""  He accuses Hugo Chávez of having indebted the country by billions of dollars which was only covered by a high oil price.  Once that price began to drop in 2009, and a policy of nationalisation and expropriation damaged crucial sectors like agriculture, the dependence on oil-exports worsened. Today, with far fewer dollars available for imports, the economic situation is unsustainable. ""I think we are in a tipping point right now,"" he says, and that after the electricity outage, oil production has dropped to about 500,000 barrels per day. With fewer countries to export Venezuela's oil to, Alvarado adds: ""I think Maduro is out of money.""  At a bar popular with Maduro loyalists in the town of Charallave, employees and union representatives of the state-owned cement company are sat at plastic tables drinking cold beer after work. The bar is one of the few with lights on, running off a generator during one of the town's scheduled power cuts.  The workers don't hold President Maduro responsible for the chaos, sticking to the party-line about sabotage of the electrical grid and co-ordinated attacks by Washington and Juan Guaidó.  ""We're being punished because we're not a servile government to US interests,"" said one member of the group. ""If a change comes it must be for better, not for worse. Not to allow the opposition to take everything we've built over the years,"" echoed another, amid clapping and shouts of ""Viva Maduro!"". Political loyalties aside, they're right to identify the clear international dimension to the situation in Venezuela.  Washington has repeatedly said that ""all options are on the table"" when it comes to Venezuela, including the military one. Barring the most radical, few welcome the idea of foreign troops on Venezuelan soil.   The US is putting the squeeze on three main socialist allies: Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. ""The Troika of Tyranny"" as National Security Advisor, John Bolton, has dubbed them. President Donald Trump has accused Cuba of placing troops into Venezuela, something robustly denied by Havana. Whatever happens next, Venezuela and Cuba know to expect nothing but hostility while Mr Trump is in the White House. In April, Venezuela's foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, called a news conference after a trip to several nations sympathetic to the Maduro government, including Turkey and Syria, where he heard from Bashar al-Assad about his experience of ""resistance"". And, in a very deliberate message to Washington, Mr Arreaza underlined that Venezuela ""will continue military-technical cooperation with Russia"".  With Russia vocally backing President Maduro at every turn, Venezuela is being drawn into a battle between the superpowers, a proxy conflict more reminiscent of the 1980s than 2019.   Before leaving La Vega, community leader Jairo Perez, took me to a vantage point high above the shantytown, pointing out each of the smaller neighbourhoods below by name.  He knows this poor district of Caracas intimately. It's where he grew up, where his family is and, as far as he's concerned, where he'll die.  Yet even long-standing residents like Jairo have never seen it like this. The shortages and dire needs of his community remind him of images he's only seen on television about post-conflict nations. ""We're like a country at war but there's no war,"" he reflects.  Not, at least, a conventional one."
risk appetite,Bouteflika's absence leaves Algeria pondering future,2024-09-15,2013-06-04,Aidan Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22727677,"Abdelaziz Bouteflika consolidated his own position as president, but power is spread between factions within the ruling elite It is not unusual for Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to disappear from view. The 76-year-old's health has been a source of rumour for years, and he has often gone weeks or months without making a public appearance. But his prolonged absence after being treated at a military hospital in Paris in late April for a ""mini-stroke"" has focused attention on whether Algeria might finally be exposed to profound change as power passes to a new generation. It also appears to have quashed recent speculation that Mr Bouteflika could stand for a fourth term next year, and triggered intense manoeuvrings over the expected succession. At the same time, however, the state has continued to operate, and observers say real political change, if it comes at all, may come slowly. ""We're not in an autocratic system but an authoritarian one, in which the president is just one element, and is far from having all powers concentrated in his hands,"" says Mohammed Hachemaoui, an Algerian political scientist currently at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ""So his absence doesn't put the functioning of this regime at risk."" Algeria is a key regional power - a youthful nation of 36 million that is a major exporter of oil and gas and has become an important ally of the West in the campaign to counter Islamist militancy. It has also remained relatively stable as leaders in its neighbours to the east - Tunisia, Libya and Egypt - were toppled in popular uprisings in 2011. Indeed, Algeria's ruling elite has proved strikingly resilient. The country is led by a man who fought in the war of independence against France and first became a minister in the year that war was won, 1962. The core of the elite has remained essentially intact ever since, through economic and political upheaval in the 1980s, a coup in 1992, and the subsequent conflict in which some 150,000 are believed to have died. Mr Bouteflika made himself into a symbol of Algeria's ability to overcome, or at least bury the memory of, the worst of that violence. The youthful foreign minister of a hopeful country in the 1960s and 70s, he returned as an elder statesman in 1999, granting amnesty to many of the Islamist insurgents still fighting the state. The latter part of his presidency has coincided with a dramatic rise in the price of oil, which allowed for generous public spending programmes and subsidies. Mr Bouteflika consolidated his position in relation to the military. But authority remained diffused within an opaque and factional elite, often referred to in French as ""Le Pouvoir"", in which unelected officials connected to the military and the intelligence services are the ultimate arbiters of power. In this system, as a 2009 despatch from the US embassy published by Wikileaks, external observed, officials from presidents to customs officers are ""designated"", rather than being selected transparently. That looks set to continue with Mr Bouteflika's eventual replacement. While the likely contenders are slightly younger, they are ""pure products of the system"", says Mr Hachemaoui. There has been a recent wave of protests against unemployment and corruption ""There will be a generational change, but it won't be a generational change that causes a change of regime. It's an illusion of change."" He adds that systemic corruption has made reform harder, and that the government bought itself a temporary reprieve by boosting handouts two years ago. Big challenges remain, especially if the price or quantity of the oil and gas that Algeria exports drops significantly. There are frequent demonstrations over failings in public services, and central and southern towns saw a series of protests over unemployment and corruption in earlier this year. But there appears to be little appetite ""for any kind of showdown"", says James McDougall, a modern history tutor and Algeria specialist at the UK's Oxford University.  ""I think there's a general dissatisfaction, disenchantment, disengagement from politics. ""There isn't this massive pent-up oppositional energy that there was in Tunisia or Egypt. That has lots and lots of places to express itself in Algeria - in the press, the parties, and in local politicking.""  Change in Algeria may be more subtle, he adds, as the men who monopolised power in the 1990s are replaced by leaders ""thinking about where to go, rather than about just holding on to things"". In the longer term, that could herald the possibility of real reform. ""We may be coming to the end of a slightly cynical formula the regime has used since the mid-90s -  the formula of pre-selecting the winner informally behind the scenes, but then allowing the election to be formally contested by also-rans or by other candidates,"" says Hugh Roberts, professor of North African and Middle Eastern history at Tufts University in the US. ""In which case the question of whether or not Algeria should finally move to genuinely free elections does begin to come onto the agenda. But I don't see it as sufficiently on the agenda at this point to enter into how Bouteflika's successor is chosen.""  Reaction to raid rooted in history Algeria: A hunger for stability?
