currency fluctuations,Is Zimbabwe zigzagging into further currency chaos?,2024-09-15,2024-05-05,Farai Sevenzo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clm3108jxxno,"Sylvia Dhliwayo, an expert at scaling the hurdles of Zimbabwe’s crisis-ridden economy and negotiating the many currencies at play, is upset. She works hard every day to send her four children to school. Waking up at 04:00 most mornings, she heads to the main market in Mbare in the capital, Harare, to buy maize, peanuts, doughnuts, eggs and buns to sell at her neighbourhood street stall. From tomatoes to avocados, pots to second-hand clothes, Mbare is a hub of commerce and the traders there set the prices, which change daily in the fluctuating economy. What has angered Ms Dhliwayo and other traders is the latest move by the government to introduce a new local currency. “They gave us no warning. We save and save their useless money and overnight the notes are worthless,” she tells me in exasperation. Known as the Zig, which stands for “Zimbabwe gold”, it was introduced a month ago and replaces the digital RTGS currency and cash “bond notes”. The move is supposed to help tackle inflation and hyperinflation - a disease that has plagued Zimbabwe for the last two decades. This led the government to abolish the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 and ever since, most people have been using the US dollar.  Just before the Zig was launched, I could buy a packet of peanuts from Ms Dhliwayo for $0.50 (£0.40) or Z$2,500 bond notes.  But when Reserve Bank Governor John Mushayavhanu gave Zimbabweans three weeks to exchange their bond notes, they lost what little value they had immediately - the bag of peanuts shot up to Z$40,000, though by then Ms Dhliwayo only accepted payment in US dollars. Much to Ms Dhliwayo’s further exasperation, she is still only trading in US dollars. Traders like to use the local currency to give customers change as there is a shortage of US coins. Supermarkets often opt to given change in lollipops. Ms Dhliwayo would use Zigs if there were any to be had - but it mostly exists digitally, and in a place where people can rarely charge their phones because of blackouts, it is cash that counts. “The new money is still not available, it’s only on people’s phones and in bank accounts. Everything, absolutely everything, is still in US dollars.” Mr Mushayavhanu struck a defiant attitude in early April when introducing the gold-backed currency, saying it was done on World Bank advice. “If you're going to blame me, you're actually blaming the World Bank,” he said, urging Zimbabweans fed up of seeing their money disappear from one day to the next to have patience. “Maybe they didn't advise us properly. And if they did not advise us properly, it's fine. Let's refine it.” But given that this is the sixth time the local currency has changed in 20 years, Zimbabweans’ lack of confidence is understandable. The Zimbabwe dollar, whose highest denomination at one time was Z$100 trillion, has morphed into bearer cheques, agro cheques, RTGS and bond notes. A local independent Sunday paper, The Standard, bemoaned the lack of publicity over the sudden currency change to Zigs as phone companies, supermarkets and public transport all ceased to accept the previous incarnation, bond notes, as legal tender. Tourists have found themselves unable to make payments by Visa as the uncertainty over the Zig’s true worth has rendered their cards unusable while the recalibration continues. “If the Zig doesn’t go the same way as the RTGS, bearer cheques, agro cheques and bond notes that came before it, then it would be a plus for Zimbabweans who have in the past seen their entire savings wiped out by inflation,” the paper’s editorial surmised. Yet you can see why businesses are reluctant to deal with it. A gardener working in southern Harare showed me on Friday morning that he was being offered 12.91 Zig for $1 on his phone bank account – though he thought the going price on the streets was 13.50 Zig to $1. A couple of hours later a second-hand clothes seller down the road said he was trading at 15 Zig for $1. For Maxwell Gombe, who makes a living selling old billion and trillion dollar notes - souvenirs of economic meltdown - to tourists visiting the nation’s splendour spots, it is business as usual. “US dollars for old notes… 500,000; billions; trillions,” he shouts though his loud hailer in Harare, where he buys the old notes to sell up in Victoria Falls. “They seem to like having a billion or a trillion dollar note in their purses or wallets. We buy them for $1 and sell them for five. If they’re drunk we can get $10  per note!” He laughs and walks away. In Mbare, US dollar traders use loud hailers to tout for business in torn notes. Only crisp notes are accepted here - so they buy damaged ones at a lower price. But black market foreign exchange dealers are finding themselves at the centre of a clampdown by the authorities, anxious to shore up the new currency that officially went into circulation this week. Ironically - as is the case with everyone who finds themselves on the wrong side of the law in this country - the more than 60 currency dealers arrested last week had to post bail in US dollars. Want a house? You must pay in American currency. School fees? US dollars. A colleague told me four of his grandchildren - ranging in age from around eight to 18 - have not been to school since January as the family cannot raise the money. A car? American currency, please. Rent? A new Zimbabwean passport? All American currency. And how is this possible? Most of the nation survives on remittances. Daughters and sons who have joined a massive brain drain and moved across the globe to work and transfer US dollars to struggling families. “It’s unbelievable. It’s as if we’re on a hamster wheel,” an economist, who asked not to be named, told me. “The same mistakes, another currency no-one knew about before its announcement. And yet the country has no productivity. “Even the gold they’ve pegged it to cannot be mined fast enough because most of it is being stolen,” he said, referring to allegations that large amounts of gold had been smuggled out of Zimbabwe by people with links to senior government officials. Even President Emmerson Mnangagwa has found himself embarrassed by the antics of relatives caught up in the scandal. “This is miracle money, printed and not made - and therefore useless,” said the economist, who once worked for the government. He explained that civil servants get paid part of their salary in US dollars and part in the local currency - if at all. “It’s been a struggle and a mess. Show me someone who’s been paid on time and I’ll buy you a whiskey,” he added. Many citizens, desperate to escape this mess, cross illegally into South Africa in search of an elusive economically sustainable future. Although there are two economic realities at play in Zimbabwe - in the wealthier northern suburbs of the capital, you will find shopping malls with Belgian chocolates, international wines and very large cheese burgers, where local currency is not needed. For everyone else, the Zig notes will become a reality. A local ice-cream seller told me he was given his first note by a customer on Friday afternoon. “I don’t understand Zigs yet but if I see them in circulation I’ll use them. There is no choice we don’t all have access to US dollars,” he said. But like Ms Dhliwayo, he is unhappy and has no faith in the notes retaining their value. The gardener agreed: “It’s like newsprint. It won’t last.” And some are making the inevitable jokes about how the name sums up this country’s zigzag economy. Others in Harare have taken to the vernacular and say Zig stands for “Zimbabwe i gehena”, meaning in Shona, “Zimbabwe is hell”.

currency fluctuations,Woman found with £2bn in Bitcoin convicted,2024-09-15,2024-03-20,By Liz Jackson & PA Media,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-68620253,"A former takeaway worker found with Bitcoin worth more than £2bn has been convicted at Southwark Crown Court of a crime linked to money laundering. Jian Wen, 42, from Hendon in north London, was involved in converting the currency into assets including multi-million-pound houses and jewellery. On Monday she was convicted of entering into or becoming concerned in a money laundering arrangement. The Met said the seizure is the largest of its kind in the UK. Although Wen was living in a flat above a Chinese restaurant in Leeds when she became involved in the criminal activity, her new lifestyle saw her move into a six-bedroom house in north London in 2017 which was rented for more than £17,000 per month. She posed as an employee of an international jewellery business and moved her son to the UK to attend private school, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. That same year, Wen tried to buy a string of expensive houses in London, but struggled to pass money-laundering checks and her claims she had earned millions legitimately mining Bitcoin were not believed. She later travelled abroad, buying jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds in Zurich, and purchasing properties in Dubai in 2019. Another suspect is thought to be behind the fraud but they remain at large. The Met said it carried out a large scale investigation as part of the case - searching several addresses, reviewing 48 electronic devices, and examining thousands of digital files including many which were translated from Mandarin. Det Ch Supt Jason Prins, whose team led the investigation, said the ""sheer scale"" of the operation ""demonstrates how international criminals seek to exploit cryptocurrency for illegal purposes"". ""This verdict and lengthy five-year investigation demonstrates that we'll leave no stone unturned in our pursuit to catch criminals who look to enjoy the proceeds of illicit funds - no matter how complex the case,"" he said. The CPS has obtained a freezing order from the High Court, while it carries out a civil recovery investigation that could lead to the forfeiture of the Bitcoin. The value of the Bitcoin was worth around £2bn at the time of initial estimates - but due to the fluctuation in the currency's value, it has since increased to around £3.4bn. CPS chief crown prosecutor Andrew Penhale said Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ""are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct"". He added this case ""illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters"". Wen is due to be sentenced on 10 May.

currency fluctuations,Trump tariff move pushes Turkish lira down,2024-09-15,2018-08-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45123607,"President Donald Trump has doubled US tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, as the precipitous fall of the Turkish lira accelerates.  In a tweet, Mr Trump said the currency was weak against ""our very strong dollar"", adding that ""US relations with Turkey are not good at this time"".  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech that the drop was part of a ""campaign"" led by foreign powers. Turkey also warned it would retaliate against the US tariffs move. ""The United States should know that the only result that such sanctions and pressure will bring... will be harming our relationship as allies,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. The two Nato members are at odds on a range of issues - how to fight the Islamic State group, Ankara's plans to buy Russian missile defence systems and how to punish the alleged plotters of a failed coup in Turkey in 2016. Most recently, President Trump issued sanctions on top Turkish officials over the ongoing detention of a US pastor who is facing terror and espionage charges in Turkey. In the past 24 hours, the lira has lost around 20% of its value. It had already fallen more than 40% in the past year. In a televised speech on Friday, President Erdogan called on citizens to exchange foreign currency and gold for lira, calling it an ""economic war"". ""This is a domestic and national struggle,"" he said, as the lira continued to fall. In a veiled attack on the US he added: ""Some countries have engaged in behaviour that protects coup plotters and knows no laws or justice."" ""Relations with countries who behave like this have reached a point beyond salvaging."" After he spoke, Mr Trump tweeted that aluminium tariffs ""with respect to Turkey"" would be raised to 20% and steel to 50%. The reaction from global currency markets to the rift caused the euro to slump to a 13-month low and pushed the dollar to a one-year high. The Turkish trade ministry responded that the additional tariffs were against the rules of the World Trade Organization. ""Turkey expects other member countries to abide by international rules,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding that the US remained an important trade partner. Analysis by Selin Girit, BBC News, Istanbul It has been a dramatic day in Turkey but the Turkish government has put on a brave face.  President Erdogan said: ""If they have dollars, we have our people, we have our right and we have Allah"" - rhetoric that goes down well with his supporters but not necessarily with international markets.  Some will adhere his call to exchange their dollars, euros or gold for Turkish lira but many others have started feeling the squeeze.  Interest rate hikes, which Mr Erdogan sees as the mother of all evils, are not very likely to happen.  President Erdogan may seek help from the IMF, following the example of Argentina, but that is not likely either as it would have strings attached, and would be frowned upon in Turkey.  There is a feeling that the quickest and most efficient step could be to ease the tensions with Washington. Shortly after Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Erdogan spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A statement from the Kremlin said the two leaders had discussed economic and trade ties. Officials from Mr Erdogan's office said the two men had ""expressed pleasure"" that relations between Turkey and Russia were progressing ""positively"" amid joint defence and energy projects. Friday's developments are the latest manifestation of growing differences between the two sides on a number of issues. Earlier this month, the White House hit Turkey's justice and interior ministers with sanctions over the country's ongoing detention of an American pastor. Turkey is accusing Andrew Brunson - who operates a small church in Izmir - of having links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for the failed coup. He had been held in prison for almost two years, but was recently moved to house arrest due to health issues. American evangelicals have rallied to his cause, triggering the recent reaction from the Trump White House. Turkish officials have been in Washington this week for talks on his release but these seemed to fall apart in recent days. Last month, Mr Trump took to Twitter to threaten sanctions on Turkey if Mr Brunson was not released. The US has also been refusing to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric and former Erdogan ally who has been living in the US state of Pennsylvania. Turkey accuses him of leading the attempted ""Gulenist"" coup. In addition, Turkish politicians are furious at American military support for Kurdish militia fighting the so-called Islamic State in northern Syria. Mr Trump's rejection of the Iran nuclear deal has also been a point of contention between the two nations. Half of Turkey's oil imports come from Iran. Therefore the re-imposition of US sanctions against Iran has been seen by economists as likely to harm the Turkish economy. Then there is the Incirlik Air Base, which Nato has used extensively in the fight against IS. There has been some domestic pressure on Mr Erdogan to close the base, and last week a group of pro-government Turkish lawyers filed charges against US soldiers stationed there. They request that a judge temporarily block all flights out of the base, and that arrest warrants be issued for the group of American officers, who they claim played a role in the coup attempt."
currency fluctuations,UK economy 'growing at muted rate',2024-09-15,2017-10-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41601454,"The UK economy grew at a muted rate in the third quarter of 2017 despite progress in the manufacturing sector, the British Chambers of Commerce says. The number of manufacturers reporting improved domestic sales and orders rose in the quarter to its highest level since early 2015, the BCC said.  Export sales and orders in the sector also improved. But in services, domestic sales and orders remained static, as did the sector's employment expectations. The BCC said its survey also showed the prevalence of recruitment difficulties facing UK businesses, which worsened further during the quarter.  Almost three-quarters of manufacturers reported difficulties hiring staff, and in services, the percentage rose to its highest since early 2016. BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall said: ""The uninspiring results we see in our third-quarter findings reflect the fact that political uncertainty, currency fluctuations and the vagaries of the Brexit process are continuing to weigh on business growth prospects. ""The chancellor's autumn Budget is a critical opportunity to demonstrate that the government stands ready to incentivise investment and support growth here at home.  ""While much of Westminster and Whitehall is distracted by Brexit, business needs action now on the home front. The solutions to some of the biggest issues currently facing our firms - including high up-front costs, a lack of incentive to invest, and a need for better infrastructure - are entirely within the power of the UK government to deliver."" The BCC also said that in the current economic climate, it seemed ""extraordinary"" that the Bank of England was considering raising interest rates. ""We'd caution against an earlier than required tightening in monetary policy, which could hit both business and consumer confidence and weaken overall UK growth,"" said BCC head of economics Suren Thiru. ""While interest rates need to rise at some point, it should be done slowly and timed to not harm the UK's growth prospects."" Buoyancy in the UK manufacturing sector is not universal at the moment, one company said. Andrew Varga, managing director of Seetru, a Bristol-based manufacturer of safety valves for industry, told the BBC's Today programme his firm was ""slightly more pessimistic"" than the BCC. ""We see some startling results. Despite the buoyant European economy, we see an accelerating reduction in order pull from Europe. Clearly uncertainty is having a really significant effect on customers' choices of which country they buy from, and they're not buying from the UK any more."" He added that the UK market was ""depressed"". ""Like-for-like sales are clearly down - down about 10%,"" he said. ""This is all due to [Brexit] uncertainty at the moment."" Clare Flynn Levy, founder and chief executive of financial behavioural analytics software firm Essentia Analytics, told the BBC that for her company ""life's a bit more optimistic"". ""But I'm not surprised to hear that the services sector is static, because there is a massive energy suck toward people decisions and mobility decisions that are caused by Brexit, and the uncertainty is just causing energy that would otherwise be devoted to selling and delivering services to clients to be pulled into scenario planning... so people are sort of frozen,"" she said."
currency fluctuations,Five pricey cities you can now afford,2024-09-15,2017-06-21,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20170605-living-in-cities-that-are-cheaper-than-ever,"With global forces and political influences in flux, certain destinations that have long been some of the world’s most expensive have recently seen a shift in cost of living. A rise in global nationalism paired with a worldwide drop in oil prices has brought about significant shifts in the global economy over the past year. As a result of these developments, certain destinations that have long been some of the world’s most expensive have recently seen a decrease in their cost of living. Whether due to international politics, export and import changes or currency swings, cities like London – which recently voted to depart the EU in the Brexit vote – have seen their ranking dramatically drop in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s annual Cost of Living Index. And, since local currency values have fallen against foreign currencies in most cases (and the rate of local inflation often rises sharply), it’s expats employed by foreign companies that are likely to see the most benefit in these cost-of-living changes. We talked to residents and expats living in these places to find out how the changes have affected them, and how to save the most money in these suddenly affordable destinations. London The 2016 Brexit vote in favour of Britain leaving the European Union had an immediate negative impact on the pound as compared to other currencies. So much so that London, long at the top of the cost-of-living index, dropped 18 places in just a year. International tourists have flocked to the country to snag deals on luxury goods and other shopping; one estimate said foreign spending has surged more than 36% year-on-year.  But since foreign currencies are stronger against the pound, the cost of imported goods have gone up in price, said Ian Wright, founder of international mover company MoverDB.com, adding that “or more sneakily, the size has been reduced”. (Though the company denies a Brexit association, Toblerone changed the shape of their chocolate bars shortly after the vote). Experts predict that important imports like fruits and vegetables will also likely rise around 8% as a result of Brexit. Still there are plenty of ways to live even more affordably – and finding good deals on housing is top of the list. Generally, living in south and east London is cheaper than the west or north. “London is really quite strange in that you can have council estates located right next to multi-million pound homes,” said Wright, originally from Canada.  Wright lives in Abbey Wood in southeast London, where he says a house can be rented from around £1,000 a month, or purchased for around £325,000. “While the area doesn't have a lot going on today, the ruins of the 12th-Century Lesnes Abbey and many parks and woods nearby can be wandered and enjoyed for free,” he said. Other affordable options include more centrally located Leyton near Olympic Park in east London, and East Ham just south of Leyton. East Croydon in south London is also being extensively redeveloped and will soon have a new shopping centre – but you can still find a rental from just £500 per month. While the UK in general has taken on something of an anti-immigrant mood, according to Wright, he assures that the capital is still very open and multicultural. “London has far fewer ethnic enclaves than cities in the US so you get expats and immigrants from all over the world living next to each other, which I think is one of the best things about the city,” he said. Beijing Many Chinese cities dropped more than 10 places in this year’s rankings, including Beijing which dropped 16 places. While the report didn’t speculate on causes, sources have attributed the drop to falling demand for Chinese exports and a decreased value of the yuan against the dollar. Much like in London, being able to live comfortably depends on how far from the city centre you’re willing to live: a one-bedroom in Tongzhou, 22km east of the city centre, rents for only RMB 2,500 per month. “But your best bet as a foreigner is finding a room a bit closer to the centre for around RMB 4,000, which you can pretty much do in the ‘cool’ parts of town near Sanlitun [9km northeast from the centre] and Gulou [5km north of the centre],” said Om Buffalo, an American who currently lives in Beijing. In general, south and west Beijing are cheaper than the north and east. Other ways to save money include taking the subway instead of taxis. “For medium to long-distance trips, taking a taxi in Beijing often takes longer and costs way more than the subway,” said Josh Ong, director of global marketing and communications at Beijing-based Cheetah Mobile. “It's a little daunting at first, especially during rush hour, but with a little research, you can learn your way around.” His other suggestion is to eat like a local, using dianping.com to find the places real Beijingers are dining. “Western food in Beijing comes at a premium, but there are amazing noodle shops and dumpling houses just around the corner from you.” Lagos Nigeria’s largest city also dropped 16 spots in the rankings, due to global dropping oil prices, one of the country’s primary exports. This may be helpful for foreign employees, but Hashim Zein, an ambassador for expat community InterNations and originally from the US, says that this may create additional security challenges as the related currency inflation has driven prices up for locals, which can lead to an increase in theft and related crimes. A little common sense goes a long way, however, say locals, and it shouldn’t stop anyone from living here. “I feel at home in Nigeria because of the attitude of the people here. A can-do spirit and resilience plus always time to make merry no matter what,” Zein said. Plus, the city knows how to have a good time. “There’s no party like a Lagos party – seven days a week!”     Lagos is separated into two major parts – the Mainland and Island (which is actually multiple islands, but is separated from the mainland by the Lagos Lagoon). Most expats live on the Island part, including the affluent Victoria Island neighbourhood, 17km south of the city centre and part of the larger Lekki peninsula; or equally high-end Ikoyi, an island neighbourhood, located 15km south of the city centre, built for British expats during colonial rule. Nearby Lekki Phase, a brand-new city still in development, is also just a few more kilometres further down the island. Those who work in manufacturing are more likely to need to be on the mainland, and Ilupeju (8km north of the centre) and Ikeja (15km north) are some of the best areas for expats, according to Zein, for their safety, more stable infrastructure and location close to many businesses. Mexico City Ranked 82 of 132 cities in 2017, Mexico City has always been relatively affordable – but also dropped nine places in the rankings this year. As the currency becomes weaker compared to foreign currency, inflation has risen and local prices have gone up slightly, including recently increased bus fares due to the gasolinazo, the higher gas prices that have been the source of city-wide protests. For that reason, it’s better to walk to the metro than take the bus, said Lauren Cocking, originally from London who writes a Mexico travel blog. And while she relies on public transportation over private transportation, she recommends Uber for late-night needs. “It is often cheaper than taxis and far safer than public transport, especially late at night.” It’s also easy to save money by shopping in the tianguis (local markets) than the big supermarkets. “The price difference is incredible,” Cocking said. “The food is my favourite part of life here.” She says that most expats flock to the neighbourhoods of Roma and Condesa, but those may not necessarily give a good representative feel for the city. “My recommendations would lean more towards underrated neighbourhoods like Narvarte or Del Valle [7.5km and 9km south of the city respectively],” she said. “They are more ‘local', residential areas, and not as at risk from earthquake damage. Same goes for neighbourhoods in the south of the city, such as Copilco and Coyoacán [15km and 12.5km south of the city].” “Coyoacán is a beautiful, colonial neighbourhood with more traditional houses and relaxing parks and quiet streets, and a bustling central plaza full of delicious street food and entertainment,” said Natalie B, a Mexico City native who works for local travel guide company My Local Cousin. “For those preferring a more traditional Mexican experience in a mostly residential setting, La Narvarte is a good option. This neighbourhood was built up in the 1940s through ‘70s and still has a lot of great original architecture, quiet streets and a family atmosphere.” Buenos Aires After London, Buenos Aires saw the greatest fall in the index, dropping 20 places due to Argentina’s economic volatility. Locals are used to these kind of price fluctuations though, says Madi Lang, an American who has lived in the city for 10 years and runs the Buenos Aires Cultural Concierge. “The economy is always pretty crazy,” she said. “They take it all in their stride – as long as there is beef for the grill.” Lola Black, a tango guide and an InterNations ambassador, describes the city as “urban, but effortlessly cool and Euro-Latin laid back”. To get the most of this vibe, expats should consider living in Puerto Madero, 4km southeast of the city centre, a clean, high-end part of the city close to the ocean, or historic San Telmo, 4km south of the centre (though safety is a higher concern here). Those in the city for its famous tango should live in centrally located Almagro, 6km west of downtown. “It's the perfect 'hood because it's super central. It’s close to the touristy/trendy area of Palermo and with excellent access to downtown,” Lang said. “Right in this area there are bars, restaurants, milongas (tango halls), live music joints and just real neighbourhood life.” Plenty of free activities and parks also make the city very affordable for entertainment. “The hundreds of plazas and parks are perfect for spending the afternoon drinking mate (our traditional tea drink), people watching and general relaxation,” Lang said. Her personal favourites are Plaza Vicente Lopez in Recoleta, the Rosedal Rode Garden in Parque 3 de Febrero and Parque Lezama in San Telmo.

currency fluctuations,A year in fake news in Africa,2024-09-15,2018-11-12,By Ashley Lime,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46127868,"The spread of fake news in Africa has been blamed for igniting ethnic violence, sowing confusion among voters and even causing currency fluctuations. As the BBC launches major new research into fake news in Africa, we break down five false stories that made a big impact on the continent in the past 12 months.  1. Nigerian presidential candidate 'endorsed by gay rights groups' When Atiku Abubakar was confirmed as a presidential candidate for the Nigerian elections in 2019, a fake Twitter account in the name of the opposition leader posted a message thanking the ""Association of Nigerian Gay Men (ANGAM)"" for its support.  In the post, ""Mr Abubakar"" writes that the first thing he would do if he were to become president would be to scrap the country's controversial anti-gay legislation, signed into law by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014. Homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in jail in Nigeria, while gay marriage and displays of same-sex affection are also banned. After originally being shared on Twitter on 14 October, the story was picked up by two Nigerian blogs. Then 12 days later, two prominent Nigerian newspapers, The Nation and the Vanguard, both published stories with a very similar theme.  They reported that an LGBT organisation called ""Diverse"" was also backing Mr Abubakar for president, considering him a truly ""liberal candidate"". A fake news story about a presidential candidate advocating for gay rights could be used to undermine them. Highly influential Muslim and Christian leaders in Nigeria, who were united in their support for the anti-gay legislation, could tell their followers not to vote for such a candidate. The Twitter account which was the source of the original story is not an official account for the politician Atiku Abubakar. This is his real account, verified with a blue tick by Twitter. There is also no evidence that the LGBT rights organisations quoted in the initial tweet, or the subsequent blogposts and newspaper articles, even exist. There are no official records of the organisations themselves, which would be illegal under Nigerian law anyway. And neither they nor their purported spokesperson (Spinky Victor Lee) existed online before the emergence of the first tweet in October, as detailed in this fact-check by the Agence France Press (AFP) news agency.  2. Top Kenya media personality shares fake praise CNN business presenter Richard Quest was in the Kenyan capital Nairobi in October filming for his TV show.  Former news anchor and media personality Julie Gichuru posted on her Twitter account on 25 October to discuss how much Mr Quest was apparently enjoying his time in Kenya.  She posted the following quote, attributing it to Mr Quest.  ""Nothing beats the service industry in Kenya... Here I am surrounded by giraffes while having breakfast! In a country declared by the World Bank as the Preferred Investment Destination in Africa, what else can I ask for? KENYA IS MAGICAL!"" Julie has over a million followers on her verified Twitter account and 600,000 on Instagram, so within minutes thousands of people had seen what she had posted and believed it to be true.  Many poked fun at her for falling for a hoax given her high profile and her long career in the media industry. The CNN journalist came across Julie's tweet and was quick to point out that he hadn't made any such statement. He replied to her original post. Ms Gichuru then had to go on Twitter to set the record straight to her followers, issuing a retraction and deleting her initial tweet. 3. Somalis 'pushed into shallow grave' in Ethiopia In July, the US-based Ethiopian Satellite Television (ESAT) station broadcast a video which it said showed ethnic Oromos in Ethiopia pushing the bodies of ethnic Somalis into a shallow grave.  It claimed that the footage was taken in Ethiopia's Oromia region, where there has been deadly violence between the two groups this year. The BBC's Afaan Oromo language service reported that the widespread circulation of the video on social media in Ethiopia resulted in deadly attacks on ethnic Oromo people living in neighbouring Djibouti and Somalia. Oromo refugees in neighbouring Djibouti told the BBC that they had been beaten and their shops looted because of the video. The same unverified video was first shared in Cameroon, some 3,000km (1,800 miles) west of Ethiopia, in June, when it was said to relate to the current conflict between Anglophone separatists and the government.  The version of the video which aired on ESAT TV without being verified had apparently also been doctored, with audio of what were supposedly Oromo youths chanting inserted on top of the video's original sound.  As soon as it realised the video was fake, ESAT removed it from its platforms and issued an official apology on its YouTube channel. There is no suggestion that ESAT TV doctored the video or broadcast it knowing it was fake. Correction 23 November: This article has been updated to make it clear that ESAT TV was not responsible for doctoring the footage, or that it knowingly broadcast a fake video. 4. South African President Jacob Zuma's ""resignation"" On 12 February, a correspondent for South Africa's national broadcaster SABC reported that then-President Jacob Zuma had agreed to resign. Citing ""authoritative sources"", Tshepo Ikaneng broke the story during a live report outside a high-level meeting of members from the ruling African National Congress (ANC), who were discussing his future. Another South African journalist uploaded the announcement on Twitter. Mr Zuma had been under immense pressure over multiple corruption scandals and had faced repeated calls from his party to step down. The country was waiting on news of his possible resignation. The South African rand, which had gained about 1% on the expectation that Mr Zuma would resign on 12 February, gave up some of its gains after the spokesman dismissed the SABC report. Mr Zuma's spokesperson came out to deny the reports, saying they were ""fake news"". But three days later, Mr Zuma resigned - this time for real. 5. Tanzanian leader 'backs polygamy to end prostitution' An article claiming Tanzanian President John Magufuli had told men to marry more than one wife as a way to end prostitution went viral.  It said that the president had addressed a ""conference of about 14,000 men"" telling them that ""out of approximately 70 million Tanzanians, 40 million are women and only 30 million are men."" This scarcity of men was leading to an increase in prostitution and adultery among women, the article claimed the president had said. The initial story published in the English language Zambia Observer website in February 2018 didn't create much of a stir. But it was only when it was published in Swahili, the national language of Tanzania, on a website called nipasheonline.com that the story really started to gain momentum. From there it was posted on the popular JamiiForums website, where it became a hot topic of discussion and spread to other news websites in Kenya, Zambia, South Africa and Ghana.   Tanzania's official government spokesperson condemned the story on Twitter in Swahili, saying the president never uttered such remarks and people should ignore them.  A fact-check by BBC Swahili exposed further reasons we know the article was untrue.  In the fake article, ""Mr Magufuli"" refers to a population of 70 million, with 10 million more women than men. But the latest UN estimates put the total population of Tanzania at just under 60 million, with no substantial gender disparity. The website where the fake article was posted may also have sounded familiar to readers of the prominent Tanzanian newspaper Nipashe.  But it has no connection to the real website for that newspaper, whose official home on the web is https://www.ippmedia.com/sw/nipashe.  This story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.

currency fluctuations,How shops are coping with a weaker pound,2024-09-15,2017-06-27,By Suzanne Bearne,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40352908,"""I really shop when the pound falls in value,"" says American Jian DeLeon. The 31-year-old editorial director at online US fashion website Highsnobiety is unsurprisingly passionate about clothes. He says his favourite luxury brands are now substantially cheaper in London.  ""Like anything from Comme Des Garcons. I got a jacket last time I was there for 40% less than I would have paid here,"" he says.  Before June last year, when the UK voted to leave the EU, he rarely went shopping on his regular work trips to the UK.  ""The littlest things from a pint at the pub to a short Uber ride were murder on my bank account because of the exchange rate.""  Now that some brands are significantly cheaper, he spends about $350 (£274; 310 euros) each time he comes, but thinks the favourable exchange rate means he saves around $100. ""It's easier for me to splurge and sometimes I do it too much for my own good,"" he confesses. Mr DeLeon isn't the only one indulging.  Just over a year on from the EU referendum, the pound is still around 16% lower against the dollar. The weakness has lured over a flock of international tourists hungry for high-end brands at relatively bargain prices.  Payments firm WorldPay says non-UK consumers' card spending at department stores rose by a fifth in the first three months of the year, while spending on electrical goods rose 22.7%.  US shoppers like Mr DeLeon have been amongst the biggest spenders, splashing out an extra 21.5% on their cards during the same period, it said. ""The extreme currency fluctuations encourages shoppers to buy more,"" says Honor Strachan, principal retail analyst at GlobalData.  ""They're getting more for their money."" But how do companies manage this kind of discrepancy; with precisely the same product priced significantly differently depending on where in the world it is bought? After all a boom in revenues in one market, can seriously dent demand in the markets international shoppers are coming from.  Many of the world's most famous brands — such as Burberry and Apple — simply raised their UK prices to try and make sure what they sold cost broadly the same across their international markets. But luxury footwear brand Crockett & Jones, which has 12 stores worldwide across locations including London, Paris and New York as well as global wholesale partners, says it has deliberately left prices unchanged.  ""The last thing we want to do is abuse our customer confidence and raise prices in the UK. ""We certainly don't increase our prices at a whim to take advantage of said currency fluctuations,"" says James Fox, export sales director at the firm.  Mr Fox believes that in the long term it's best to keep pricing simple. ""We strive to have a level playing field as and where we can.  ""We offer sterling, euro and dollar price lists, which gives our customers piece of mind that they are buying in their own currency at a level price to the potential competitors within their market."" He says generally any discrepancies tend to average out across currencies, and that re-pricing is only possible ""once or twice a year"" due to the upheaval it causes for the business overall. So is he concerned that the firm could be losing out financially? ""We are fortunate to be in a position that we have a few very strong 'Brexit proof' markets which underpin the company when the UK is trying its best to screw up international trade,"" says Mr Fox. By selling both through its own stores and through wholesalers the firm's risk is already spread out, he adds.  Crockett & Jones is not the only retailer which has kept prices steady.  Ray Clacher, executive vice-president at Trinity - owner of premium brands Gieves & Hawkes, Kent & Curwen and Cerruti 1881 - says non-EU tourists using either the US dollar or a currency that trades in line with the dollar, have driven up sales at its London stores. Nonetheless, these sales are still just a small percentage of Trinity's total revenue. ""We certainly have not adjusted our retail prices to reflect the influx of tourism, in fact, quite the opposite as we want to encourage more UK [sales],"" he says. However, he admits this strategy could change if costs continue to rise.  ""If inflation continues to rise and sterling continues to struggle against the euro and dollar, we will have no choice but to pass on the cost to our customers - but not at present,"" says Mr Clacher.

But it is also important not to be too greedy. Many US retailers that have come to the UK have simply swapped their dollar signs on their US price tags for pounds - betting that British consumers will be willing to pay a premium for their goods. Banana Republic is one such example. After eight years in the UK, it announced last year it would close all eight of its stores. The decision followed six consecutive quarters of falling sales.  ""They thought that because they were a big brand, they could demand higher prices. But UK consumers ""are savvier than that,"" says Ms Strachan. Yet for retailers doing a straight currency conversion from their local currency to the country where they are selling their goods also doesn't necessarily work.  ""Asos made a big thing about launching local websites with a straight currency conversion and it didn't work - local pricing didn't fit in line with competitors.  ""Brands need to look at who else is operating in that space, the wealth of consumers there, and what they're willing to pay, and then price accordingly using localised pricing structures,"" says Ms Strachan. Many firms, particularly larger brands such as Hermes also use currency hedging to protect themselves. This involves working with a bank to buy currency at the current rate to protect themselves against adverse future volatility. In the end, though Ms Strachan says a company's ability to cope with currency volatility comes down to how much people want to buy what they sell. ""If they still want it customers will buy it,"" she says."
currency fluctuations,World's most expensive cities revealed,2024-09-15,2019-03-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47617206,"Paris has come top of a ranking of the world's most expensive cities, alongside Hong Kong and Singapore. It's the first time three cities have shared the top spot in the 30-year history of the annual Economist Intelligence Unit survey. The French capital - ranked second most expensive last year - is one of four European cities in the top 10.  The survey compares the cost of 160 items, such as food, drink, transport, utility bills, and rent, in 133 cities. It then tracks whether prices have gone up or down by comparing them with the cost of living in New York, which is used as a benchmark. The annual index was designed to help companies calculate cost-of-living expenses for expatriates and business travellers. The Economist Intelligence Unit noted that costs in the cheapest cities were low by Western standards, partly because low wages limiting household spending are the norm there.  It also said a ""growing number of locations"" were becoming cheaper because of the impact of political or economic disruption, citing crisis-hit Caracas in Venezuela and war-torn Damascus in Syria, which are at the bottom of the list. ""There is a considerable element of risk in some of the world's cheapest cities,"" the report said, adding, ""Put simply, cheaper cities also tend to be less liveable."" Report author Roxana Slavcheva said Paris had been among the top 10 most expensive cities since 2003 and was ""extremely expensive"" to live in.  ""Only alcohol, transport and tobacco offer value for money compared with other European cities,"" she said.  The average cost of a woman's haircut, for example, costs $119.04 (£90) in Paris, compared with $73.97 in Zurich and $53.46 in Japanese city Osaka. ""European cities tend to have the highest costs in the household, personal care, recreation and entertainment categories - with Paris being a good representative in these categories - perhaps reflecting a greater premium on discretionary spending,"" Ms Slavcheva said.  1.

Caracas in Venezuela, where inflation neared 1,000,000% last year forcing the government to launch a new currency, was ranked the least expensive city in this year's survey.  The price of a cup of coffee in the capital Caracas doubled to 400 bolivars ($0.62; £0.50) in the space of only a week last December, according to Bloomberg.

currency fluctuations,The Tortoise and the Share,2024-09-15,2018-03-02,By Amol Rajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43230640,"I had the privilege of delivering this year's Bob Friend Lecture at the University of Kent at Canterbury. Bob was part of the original Sky News line up, described by Rupert Murdoch as a ""distinctive journalist and admired news broadcaster"".   I'm sorry to say I never met him, though of course I know a great deal about his reputation. I believe very strongly that we have obligations to the dead, not only to respect their memory and honour their contribution to our world, but also - if we can - to continue to learn from them, and to continue the good deeds and works that, were they still with us, they would be performing. That's one of my themes here. I believe in journalism, as Bob Friend did, and in honouring his memory by discussing this subject in front of a room full of potentially great journalists, I hope I can support the principle that journalism is a noble trade, maybe inspire a few to go into it, and above all prosecute an argument about the nature and future of journalism that I think deserves a hearing. Just before I outline that argument, let me say, a helluva lot of lectures about the future of journalism are given these days. Aside from this annual event, big recent lectures have been given by newspaper editors from Lionel Barber to Alan Rusbridger. There's the annual MacTaggart Lecture in Edinburgh, and the Cudlipp Lecture which James Harding is giving in March. My distinguished colleague Nick Robinson gave the inaugural Steve Hewlett Lecture last year. The challenge, then, is to be at least mildly original. So I'm going to take some of those people and some of their arguments on. In fact, my enemy today is conventional wisdom, or rather conventional wisdoms - specifically, the claim that new technology provides an existential threat to the news business. Doubtless it offers a threat; I just don't believe it's an existential one.  And I'm going to argue that some of the claims made by journalists about the threats to the news business - for instance, the whole idea of fake news - are in fact not only often gross errors of judgement, but a kind of displacement activity, an attempt to distract audiences from the true problems afflicting the trade, which lie closer to home. British journalists have been very good at blaming everyone but themselves. As Michael Jackson sang, in lyrics you guys are doubtless familiar with from Freshers Week, ""no message could have been any clearer: if you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make that change."" I'll then move on to what I think are indeed the biggest threats to my trade and some proposed solutions. Let me start, then, by attacking three myths about the current state, not to say plight, of journalism. My joining the BBC as the Corporation's first Media Editor in late 2016 coincided very closely with the election of Donald Trump and, with it, a sudden explosion in concerns about fake news. This was a case of correlation rather than causation, I can assure you.  Due to his relentless and ferocious attacks on the mainstream media, his courting of alternative forms of media - including his embrace of conspiracy theorists - and his elastic relationship with the truth, Trump very quickly became seen in much of the media as a terrifying foe.  This fear was radically accentuated when Sean Spicer, the entertaining former Press Secretary to Trump, launched what I call the Spicer Doctrine: the belief that it was the job of government to hold journalists to account.  In a White House press conference early in Trump's presidency, Spicer said: ""There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable. And I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable as well"". This inversion of the traditional relationship between journalism and government - in which it apparently becomes the task of those in power to scrutinise the scrutinisers - was added to the list of points made by those who said Trump was a mortal threat to journalism. It's important to note this idea became, for a brief flicker of history, something like a prevailing orthodoxy. When Trump tweeted a video of him seeming to wrestle a CNN reporter to the ground, not long after insulting that organisation in a very public manner, it became widely accepted that journalists were - literally - under attack as never before in the history of the modern West.  The Committee to Protect Journalists warned of ""a threat to press freedom"". Chris Wallace of Fox News said the President had ""engaged in the most direct, sustained assault on the free press in our history."" Joe Kahn of the New York Times bewailed ""an American President and his close allies who treat reporters as 'enemies of the people' - with no attribution to Stalin or Mao"". Yet these arguments were, on closer inspection, the exact opposite of the truth. Donald Trump isn't the enemy of the media. He's a potential saviour of the media.  It's largely thanks to Donald Trump that record numbers of people in the English-speaking world are viewing, listening to, or reading the news. And, crucially, that record numbers are paying for it. All media - left, right, mainstream, alternative, digital, print - have benefited from a Trump bump.  In the three weeks after his election, the New York Times sold 132,000 digital subscriptions - a tenfold increase on the usual rate. They have been engaged in a truly wonderful, almost nostalgic newspaper war with The Washington Post, whose business model is also humming thanks to Trump, where the two papers are vying to out-scoop each other with a series of brilliant stories. It's been riveting - and readers are the winners. Just this month, in fact, the New York Times announced an extra 157,000 digital subscribers for the fourth quarter of last year, with subscription revenues passing $1bn for the first time. Obviously that was the result of a team effort; but if, at a push, you had to give credit to one person for this exponential expansion, it wouldn't be Dean Baquet, the Executive Editor. It would be Donald J Trump.  As for television, virtually every American news network is up on its ratings, from Fox to MSNBC and of course CNN, which had its most watched year ever in 2016. Why? Two words. Donald Trump. And ad-funded, traffic hungry websites from Buzzfeed to Mail Online to The Independent have found nothing drives traffic like this President. He is - as he often boasts himself - good business.  And for obvious reasons. The Trump Presidency is not only one of the most astonishing facts of modern history, it is also one of the most astonishing stories of modern history - a gift that keeps on giving, and giving. And giving.  Also in February, Twitter, which is essentially just a news stream, posted a profit for the first time. There are complex and structural reasons for this of course, but I know from speaking to them that senior executives at Twitter are delighted, to put it mildly, that this President spends his twilight hours on the platform. Every news organisation in the world has been boosted editorially by his remarkable ascent, and unless they are run by idiots, each of those organisations has found this presidency to be a commercial boon too. Next time you hear the idea of Trump's ""war with the media"", remember, then,  that you're hearing a self-serving phrase which is essentially nonsense.  This isn't a war. It's a marriage of convenience. Closely associated with the ascent of Trump is the phenomenon of fake news. Of course, when Trump uses that term, he's just referring to news that he doesn't like. The Russia investigation is fake news, the fake news media can't be trusted, and so on. There is, however, a genuine and relatively new phenomenon which warrants the label fake news - and that is deliberate lies told for political or commercial purposes transmitted around the world through social media.  This material should be distinguished from the false news - that is, lies and propaganda - that has been circulating in media for years, for instance through the vile practices of the late sexual predator Max Clifford. Britain's tabloid press, for instance, has knowingly been publishing lies for decades, also for commercial gain. Freddie Starr never ate the hamster, as Clifford claimed. For those of you too young or innocent to get that reference, it refers to a famous newspaper front page headline. For those of you too young or innocent to know what a newspaper front page is, I give up.  The recent phenomenon of fake news is different to the ancient phenomenon of false news through its deployment of digital technology. This technology incentivises massive audiences: the bigger the audience, the more money can be received from selling ads around those fake news stories. And that's the in-glorious issue with fake news: because it's made up, it's sensational; and because it's sensational, people want to share it. Compared to fake news, the truth is boring. It would have been amazing if the Pope or Denzel Washington had backed Trump. Somewhat boringly, they didn't. But here's the thing about fake news. Whisper it, but it's not actually that widespread a phenomenon.  Yes, foreign actors used bots - those automated bits of software that feign human characteristics - to sow discord and disinformation. But in terms of what we know, fake accounts are a tiny, tiny fraction of the total amount of information available online. For instance, Facebook has said that it thinks the number of fake accounts on its platform are around 3 per cent of the total, and the number of duplicate accounts could be around 10 per cent. Depending on how many fake accounts are duplicated, that could add up to a very sizeable number. But as a proportion of the overall total, it is, while significant, far from overwhelming - and the company and its community are getting better at discovering and eliminating such accounts.  What we know about fake news is that it spikes dramatically around big news events. In a tight election, the use of bots to amplify some messages, or sow confusion, could certainly make a difference. And Trump's election and the Brexit referendum were tight elections. But as of yet, we do not have anything approaching conclusive evidence that these democratic events were tipped by fake news. So, seen in its proper context, fake news is nothing new - though the capacity for disinformation and lies to reach hundreds of millions of people is, I accept, a recent and worrying development. Similarly, we still know very little about the true extent of fake news; what we do know suggests it is a small proportion of the total information on the biggest social media platforms, and that it spikes around irregular events. Nobody has suggested the Pope backed Trump for a while. But the principal reason to be sceptical - though not dismissive - about fake news is that so many of those who bang on about it have an incentive to inflate the threat. For ambitious politicians, it creates a chance to show themselves to be digitally savvy, and deeply concerned about the rise of new technology. For top ranking politicians, fake news and disinformation online can offer an excuse to cover their own failings. I had the privilege last year of interviewing Hillary Clinton on The One Show on BBC One. She was noble and honest enough to say that blame for her loss to Trump lay principally with her - but it was clear from talking to her, and will be clear to anyone who reads the book, that she puts a lot of weight on the claim that fake news was a key factor in his victory. It wasn't. It may have had an influence on some voters, but it wasn't Facebook wot won it for the President. I sometimes get the impression that even technology companies don't mind talking about fake news, because it gives them the opportunity to flaunt their social consciences, and even distract from other social obligations, such as paying tax. But the people who most relentlessly bang on about fake news are also the people who have the biggest incentive to show they can be trusted. And that is - though I hate the phrase, implying as it does mediocrity - the often loathed mainstream media of which I am part. Obviously if you work for the BBC, or The Times, or Channel 4 News, or CNN, when you give coverage to fake news, you hope the audience will see that you are different and that you will be flattered by comparison. If some news is fake, then presumably some isn't, and we the aforementioned great media brands deal in Truth... that's their message. Let me repeat that there is a new threat from the viral spread of disinformation online. But its effects are still unclear; false news is far from new; what we do know about fake news suggest that it is limited and spikes around big news events; and the key point is that most of those who talk about fake news have a very great incentive in inflating the threat. The third myth that I want to debunk is the notion that people won't pay for news online. I accept completely that most people under the age of 30 have grown up in a news environment where they expect, and are given, high-quality news for free. I also accept that a very major reason for this in Britain is the existence of the BBC website. But what I don't accept is that when these people grow up - when you guys grow up - and come to have a bit of money, and maybe realise you need to be well informed to get by, you won't pay for news. Because the fast accumulating evidence points in one direction: if it's good enough, people will pay for content.  It's worth saying that around a decade ago, it was absolutely the prevailing view that content online had to be free. The Guardian was perhaps the most militant proponent of this view. Its then Editor, Alan Rusbridger, championed 'open' journalism, using that most loaded term to imply that when people charged for content, they were part of a 'closed' system, rather than just trying to run viable businesses.  When Rupert Murdoch said he was going to ask people to pay for content, many said he was mad. His argument was: quality costs; if you want quality, you have to pay for it; if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys; and that readers would pay for journalism if it was good enough.  I'm here to tell you that Rupert was right, and those who championed the free model were wrong. Now, thank goodness, people are coming together in their millions to restore the link between top calibre journalism, and paying for that.  I mentioned the New York Times' recent, excellent numbers. Perhaps many of you in this room have a subscription to Spotify. Or to Netflix, which has built a committed audience of over 100 million subscribers in just a few years - mostly, by the way, by using other people's content. Public support for the licence fee of the BBC remains high for now. And look elsewhere, too: the Financial Times is approaching a million subscribers. And if you include digital subscribers, The Times recently overtook The Daily Telegraph.  This brings us to a key point. People will pay - but they will obviously only pay if they place a high value on the journalism - i.e. if it's good enough to justify parting with cash. I used to think that the only way to encourage payment was to specialise; indeed, there was a strong case for believing, a few years ago, that the future of journalism is specialism. Specialism - being a magazine dedicated to fishing, or a website dedicated to the hedge fund industry, or a fortnightly satirical magazine like Private Eye, for example - allows you to focus your editorial energies in one domain, target a particular industry, chase advertisers with a unique focus, and distinguish yourself from the great rump of journalism now available online. But it turns out people are now willing to pay not just for specialism, but for general news too, if it's good enough - for instance, that of The Times. When the facts change, I change my mind. So I've updated my view. Now I think the future of journalism isn't just specialism; it's also generalism, or general news, that has special qualities, and obtains unique standards. This brings me neatly to the question of the economics of the industry, and the first of the three major areas of concern for my trade that I would like, with your permission, to briefly discuss. So far I have addressed what I believe to be three myths about journalism - that Donald Trump is a mortal threat, that fake news is consuming the whole ecosystem in which we live, and that people won't pay for news online. If these are the mythical threats, what are the real ones? I want to split them into three categories: economic, sociological and editorial.  I hope I have demonstrated that there is now clear evidence that people will pay for news, both specialist and general, provided it is good enough. Over the past decade, a toxic combination of scepticism toward this view, groupthink and sheer myopia has prompted many organisations to conclude that, if revenues directly from the audience couldn't be relied on, then it would have to come from advertising. It's extremely important that people in this room realise that there is nothing original about the dependence of news media on advertising for a majority of revenues. As recently as the 1990s, which I'm conscious is when many of you were born, august titles such as the Financial Times got some 80 per cent of income from classified and display advertising, with only 20 per cent coming from cover price revenue. It's no wonder, then, that the people running news organisations today, many of whom were just beginning their careers back then, thought it reasonable to rely on digital advertising for income. But relying on advertising online is almost always a disastrous strategy.  There are two main reasons for this. The first is that it necessarily distorts your editorial values. If you give away your content for free, you become desperate for traffic; and the way to generate traffic is to go relentlessly down-market. This temptation has proved too much for many titles. The Independent, which was in print a high-minded title, today has a very different flavour, on social media at least. That might, by the way, be why it's very much profitable. Other websites from BuzzFeed to Mail Online do some very fine journalism; but it is often paid for by clickbait and trash. I know too well how chasing clicks, not least through tweaking SEO, distorts editorial priorities. At the end of my first week on The Independent website, I once had just one article left to publish. I was desperately short of numbers on the traffic front, and it would have spoilt my weekend if I didn't hit my target. Alas the only piece I had left to publish was by Andreas Whittam Smith, the founding Editor of the paper. He was a great journalist but not a big mover of traffic, and this piece was about the need for greater transparency in the House of Lords and civil service - not the sort of salacious, traffic-generating subject you'd see in the Mail's Sidebar of Shame. Desperate for traffic, I looked at what was at the top of Google News. I saw that One Direction had just released an album in Canada. So I put a headline on Andreas's piece that said: 'All the evidence points in one direction: we need reform of our institutions now'.  It was the most read piece on independent.co.uk that month. I love the idea of all these teenage girls in Canada looking up the latest song by Harry Styles and Zayn Malik, and instead coming across an essay by the founder of The Independent on restructuring the Treasury... Suffice to say, tweaking headlines in this fashion ain't what I went into journalism to do. The second reason not to rely on advertising, is that in practice it means relying on the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, and when it comes to publishers generating traffic via Facebook, it turns out he is a fickle friend. In January, he announced huge changes to Facebook that would prioritise ""meaningful interactions"" - i.e. stuff from friends and family - over information from news publishers. Already this has had a dramatic impact on the traffic, and therefore the bottom line, of many publishers.  In recent months BuzzFeed, Mashable, and Mic, three websites dependent on viral energy for their business models, have either announced layoffs or surprisingly low valuations. All commercial models are dependent, obviously, on external forces and market conditions. That does not mean it is ok or smart to fund journalism by relying on the algorithms that Zuckerberg and his team tweak on a daily basis. On the contrary, it is much safer to ask readers to pay. If you can get them to do so, you make them - and not the advertisers - your most important customer. You can collect commercially valuable data about them too. Above all, you are liberated from the vicissitudes of the social media world, whose constant upheaval will never provide as sturdy a basis for top quality work as money direct from your audience.  Media organisations have always been funded by a combination of audience revenue and advertising. The evidence is abundantly clear and growing: in the digital age, you cannot rely on the latter. Not only are Facebook and Google gobbling up ever more digital ad revenue; they are also liable to change on a whim. Luckily, however, the evidence is also abundantly clear and growing that - if you provide a service that is good enough and unique enough - readers will pay for digital output.  This of course means that some platforms will die out. The future for local newspapers is unrelentingly grim. Many television channels will become irrelevant or redundant as streaming takes over. The whole process is Darwinian. But that could prompt a new generation of hacks to produce ever greater work - and take pride, rather than feel guilt, in asking the audience to fund it.  Ah yes, the new generation. In a moment, I am going to examine some of the editorial failings of the news industry. But before I look at why so many journalists have missed the big stories in recent years, I want to focus on one particular cause of those editorial failings in detail - and that is the composition of the news industry itself.   Much of what I am arguing tonight is, I hope, an antidote to the feeling of crisis that has been the background noise of my own journalistic career. I think for reasons you've just heard there are plenty of reasons to be hopeful, and some of the supposed threats are mere phantoms. But I do think there is one reason to panic, one existential threat, one crisis that is engulfing the trade.  That is the astonishing - and growing - disconnect between journalism and the lives of poor people around Britain. Journalism today feels more like the preserve of the moneyed and metropolitan middle-classes than ever before. I think the problem has got markedly worse in my time in the business. And I think we need very urgent remedies.  As I wrote on my BBC blog in December, the most shocking thing I discovered in my first year in broadcasting is the absence of poor people. There are many reasons for this, plenty of them manifested at the societal level. Indeed the capture of journalism by the relatively wealthy is a symptom of much deeper ills in our society. My own view is that the most neglected reason for it is that the poor have no lobby in broadcasting.  Other disenfranchised groups have highly effective and energised lobbying operations. Those campaigning for greater gender equality and equal pay at the BBC, for instance, have sought and received an audience with the Director-General. Champions of ethnic minority representation include Lenny Henry and Simon Albury, the former boss of the Royal Television Society. As for regional devolution, the voice of MPs and local politicians from around the country has been heard loud and clear in, for instance, the BBC's expansion into Salford, or the calls for Channel 4 to move out of London.  But the poor have no lobby in broadcasting. One reason for this is that they are hard to define. The greatest sociologists in Britain struggle to define class, knowing there's more to it than economic capital, and that the rapid changes in the nature of work and wages means old language about the working-class are no longer valid. You can define being poor or working-class through current circumstances, or family, or to some extent even geography. Another reasons the poor have no lobby is that, being an amorphous group, they are hard to see. If I look at any newsroom in Britain, I can immediately tell you how many people are from an ethnic minority, what the gender split is, and how young or old the place is. What I can't tell you is how many people have a dad who worked in the mines, or a mum who didn't finish school, or grew up in a council state, or were on free school meals at a school where less than half of pupils went on to university. These two related problems - a lack of easy definition, and categorical invisibility - should not, however, be an excuse to ignore the disconnect between journalism and the people it should serve. Lest there be any confusion, let me be clear, I'm not pretending to be some sort of proletarian hero myself here: I live in Islington, went to a good state school, and my parents were immigrants who simply wouldn't let their sons be wasters. I know what it's like to be skint, believe me, but I'm not any more.  My concern is that the crisis of trust in newspapers is directly related to the fact that most people don't feel journalists look, sound, think, or feel like them in the way they used to. The gradual decline of Britain's tabloid newspapers accentuates this. Of course the tabloids have done some awful things, and coarsened our culture; but in their heyday they were tribunes of the poor. The Mirror of my hero, Hugh Cudlipp, carried a slogan below its masthead: ""Forward with the People"". I just can't think of many British media organisations that espouse that philosophy now. Similarly, local papers made journalism a reasonably remunerated trade for those from poorer backgrounds around the country. But no more, for the most part. When the Grenfell Tower horror unfolded, there was huge anger among residents about the media coverage. And yes, there were conspiracy theories floating around. I reported from the foot of Grenfell, which even now stands as a sickening, ashen monument to human suffering and political and social failure. I have to say that when residents said to me, again and again and again, that the media don't speak for them, precisely because they don't relate to them, and because they don't cover their lives until it's too late and the pictures make good telly, well, I think they weren't completely wrong.  There is a crisis of trust in the news industry, and with it a crisis of relevance, and until the sociological make-up of the industry changes to reflect the people we serve, journalism will stagger from failure to failure. This is most urgent, and most existential, at the BBC, where staff are twice as likely to be privately educated as the rest of the population.  This failure of representation is, I think, the main reason that, taken as a whole, journalists have missed many, if not all, of the big stories of the past decade.  I hope that in what I have done so far I have made clear that, it seems to me, journalists have a tendency to blame everyone but themselves. It's President Trump's fault, because he's launched an assault on CNN. It's other politicians' fault, because they won't come on our shows any more, knowing they can use social media to circumvent pesky journalistic questioning. It's other legislators' fault, for suggesting new regulation that would cripple a centuries-old commitment to press freedom. It's Mark Zuckerberg and the tech giants' fault, because they're taking all our advertising dollars and now not even referring people to our websites.  And best of all, it's the audiences' fault! They're not paying for quality any more, and they're too distracted by better offers from elsewhere, like watching sport or eating ice creams or raising families.  Well, to this litany of cowardice, this catalogue of doom, this pathetic poltroonery, I say quite simply: enough is enough.  Stop blaming everyone else for the failures of modern journalism, and take a look in the mirror. Because the evidence suggests that the greatest enemy facing this noble trade is closer to home. The renaissance and renewal in modern journalism that we should all desperately want will only happen when journalists confront, and vanquish, the enemy within. The fact is, with very few exceptions, the vast majority of journalists have missed most of the big stories of the past decade. Of course, I must include myself in this. We didn't see the financial crash coming. We were taken aback by the 2010 result and the formation of a Coalition. We didn't see the nationalist surge in the Scottish referendum, the 2015 Conservative majority, the Corbyn surge in 2017 - or, perhaps most remarkably, the actual possibility of Brexit. (Though the BBC did give due weight to the possibility of a victory for Leave). And of course, like many American journalists, we were shocked by the election of Trump. In terms of my own scorecard, I did better on Brexit and Trump, but I still got the majority wrong.  As I say, there are exceptions to all these cases, but taken as a whole, the profession of British journalism was caught unawares by every single one of these seismic events. To miss one huge story would be, perhaps forgivable - two less so; but all of these, in the space of a few short years? I am, as I say, hugely culpable myself: as Editor of The Independent, I looked at the 2015 election too much through the prism of a hung parliament that every poll suggested likely, but which didn't accord with the result.  So I don't for a minute absolve myself from blame for this. But we have to look at what is going on here, and why. Given most of the events I've just referred to are political, and to give some focus to my argument, I'm going to suggest where political journalism may have been led astray. Without wanting to make this section of my lecture feel like a stroll through Caveat City, I should say again that when I criticise political coverage, I am including myself among the guilty men and women; and, moreover, there are some truly outstanding political journalists in Britain, many of them my colleagues at the BBC. Why might it be that political journalism has been caught so unawares by all these stories? One reason, undoubtedly, is the utter tyranny of opinion polls. I cannot emphasise enough to you the extent to which, through the 2010 and 2015 election, the news agenda was hijacked - utterly hijacked - by opinion polls. All my conversation with senior politicians and leading political journalists started from a premise set by the opinion polls. And this despite the fact that the opinion polls have been caught with their pants down time and time and time again.  I'd really encourage you to search on YouTube for ""Christopher Hitchens opinion poll racket"". There, my hero, the late, great polemicist can be seen more than 25 years ago discussing a cover piece he wrote for Harper's magazine with the headline 'Voting in the Passive Voice: What Polling has done to American Democracy'. That, he says, is about ""how the opinion poll racket"" has tried to be a substitute for democracy"" - and how lazy journalists use opinion polls - many of them rigged, by the way - to generate news, instead of going out and finding real news. Opinion polls are a snapshot rather than a forecast, but they give journalists the chance to inject drama and narrative in the often remorseless drift of political life. Broadly speaking, I think political journalism in this country is in danger of being too much Westminster, and not enough Whitehall. That is, it's so caught up in the fast sport of party politics, the slow business of government struggles to get a hearing. At the Independent, I gave Oliver Wright, our brilliant Whitehall Editor, an Inside Whitehall column for this very reason. There are many journalists who cover policy and government superbly, of course. I think Chris Cook of Newsnight is outstanding.  Then there is the revolving door between journalism and politics. I don't by this mean the great many journalists of all persuasions, including BBC staff, who end up in politics. I mean the tendency of senior political journalists to cross the rubicon, to become special advisers or Directors of Communication. You can of course understand why this should happen; they have the requisite skill and contacts, and I for one do understand the frustration, as a journalist, of feeling like at times you're stuck outside throwing rocks in, rather than in the room, making the decisions. But this revolving door just can't help but create the sort of clientism that substitutes propaganda for proper scrutiny.  All pack journalism is inherently dangerous. I'm told by some senior political journalists that the fabled lobby, the pack of Westminster journalists, doesn't exist any more, though I keep seeing evidence to the contrary. Pack journalism encourages groupthink, and strikes me as belonging to the age before social media. In the Palace of Westminster it is particularly hard not to be captured by various factions within politics, or to go along with what other journalists in the pack - the lobby - have determined to be the news. This means it takes real guts to strike out on your own and say, ""hang on: everyone seems to be doing this story, but I don't think it actually amounts to much - and the real story is elsewhere"". The demands of rapacious social media, combined with the groupthink inherent in all pack journalism, makes covering politics highly prone to what, in my view, are errors of judgement. Let me re-iterate that I'm not talking about specific individuals here, but give you a couple of examples.  First, Moggmentum. I'm sure you all know who Jacob Rees-Mogg is. Last year, especially through what has become known as silly season, there was a burgeoning industry in speculation over whether this idiosyncratic and intelligent backbencher was a future leadership contender for the Tories. I read article after article after article about how he was the grassroots' favourite, and various Tories were coming together to plot his takeover, lest Theresa May fall.  But who does such speculation benefit, other than Jacob Rees-Mogg? And is there actually any substance to the story? It is of course one of those self-perpetuating things. Once the story starts to gather, if you excuse the pun, momentum, it does have the effect of inflating Rees-Mogg's reputation, and making him seem more plausible. But do ordinary members of the public really care about personalities in politics as much as journalists do? Runners and riders stories always seem to reflect the interest of hacks and pundits rather than audiences at home.  Or take an example from America. The mad boosterism around Oprah Winfrey is their version of the same thing. After her speech at the Golden Globes there was an explosion of chat online about whether she might run for President. Does that mean it should be covered as news? Hell no! But did CNN cover it as news? Hell yes! One of their reports carried the headline: ""Sources: Oprah Winfrey 'actively thinking' about running for president"". Where to begin with this? I spend weekday evenings 'actively thinking' about becoming a reggae producer, or eating Nutella straight from the jar. That doesn't mean it's going to happen. The fact that this speculation was coming nearly a year before the mid-terms of Trump's first term was no barrier to the idle speculation. And if you actually read the story, it contained sentences such as: ""One source emphasised that Winfrey has not made up her mind about running""... and ""For now, it's all just talk"". Er, you don't say.  But the pièce de résistance came out last July. I was on a stag do in the south of France, munching brie and drinking rum sharpeners next to a swimming pool. Suddenly my phone exploded with alerts from news organisations that I follow, including the Telegraph. And what was this remarkable news story? It was Theresa May saying that she would carry on until 2022. As the Telegraph story put it, the Prime Minister's spokesman said she's no quitter and wouldn't be standing down after Brexit happens in March 2019. A follow-up story, by the way, said that Jacob Rees-Mogg had offered the Prime Minister his support.  I have to say, even now I struggle to contain my anger at this alleged news story. First of all, it's a ridiculous question, because how on earth can she possibly know what the situation is going to be in 2022. I barely know what's going to happen next week, let alone next year. What with all the fluctuations in History between last summer and 2022, four and a half years, the idea that Theresa May can accurately predict her own state of mind is ludicrous. The next thing is, what's she supposed to say? If the Prime Minister, or indeed her spokesman, had said, no, she won't be staying on until 2022 because it's generally felt that she's lost the confidence of her party already, that would have been a much bigger story. So here's some advice for young journalists: if you ask a question to which an honest answer is impossible, don't treat the less than honest answer as a great revelation. And finally, there's the simple fact that we just don't seem to learn from history. Through the Brexit campaign, David Cameron said that if Brexit happened, he would stay on as Prime Minister. He did that because he knew that if he said he would step down, it would change the narrative of the referendum and, quite understandably, journalists would run with a different story - just as they did when he said, going into the 2015 election, that it would be his last as Prime Minister. So during Brexit he said he would carry on. After Brexit, he left. That should have taught us that you can't always believe Prime Ministers when they answer this question. And yet still my stag do was interrupted by the frenetic excitement among journalists who thought they'd landed a big story. All this speaks to a deep problem within journalism, which is the editorial judgements and interests of those who cover certain professions are often terrible. Amid the endless brilliant coverage, they often miss the real story. Not because they're stupid, but for reasons I have suggested: they subscribe to a pack mentality; they have a - quite reasonable - impulse toward drama and narrative and conflict; their interests do not reflect those of most of the public; they're part of a revolving door between journalism and the professions they cover - whether in politics, education, health or wherever - driven in part by the explosive growth in the PR industry. But there is one reason why all of these tendencies are getting worse. And as I turn now to my concluding remarks, in which I shall propose some solutions to the problems I have outlined, I want to suggest that the defining qualities of modern journalism points to a way out of the difficulty the trade has found in.  The defining qualities of modern journalism are its scale, its sociability and its speed. And that is why I want to finish by re-introducing you to the parable of the Tortoise and the Share.  Forgive my indulgence for a minute, but it's worth saying that I really believe in the power of parable, and as journalists I think we all should. Another hero of mine, with whom I often disagree, was Isaiah Berlin. He wrote a notorious essay called The Hedgehog and the Fox, about the two kinds of intellectual. Hedgehogs knew mostly about just one thing, and saw the world through that prism. Foxes knew about plenty of things, and drew on multiple sources and schools of thought. Though Berlin later said that he was being mildly ironic, people always asked him if he was a hedgehog or a fox. The truth is, he was a hedgehog about being a fox: his one big idea was that there was no one big idea. Similarly I'm sure many of you know the story of the Hare and the Tortoise, or the Tortoise and the Hare. This fable by Aesop has many interpretations, few of them as simple as commonly thought. But there is one key lesson, summarised to generations of children as ""slow and steady wins the race"". I think modern journalism should be less hare, and more tortoise.  We are living through - and you guys are inheriting - the Great Acceleration: a period in History in which, thanks to technology, everything is speeding up. Journalism hasn't escaped this revolution; in fact, it has both reflected and contributed to it. But I think the paradox and predicament of our trade is that, as the world speeds up, journalism needs to slow down.  I still haven't seen the recent film about The Washington Post, called simply The Post. I wonder if any of you have seen All the Presidents Men, about Watergate; or Spotlight, about the work of the Boston Globe; or Attacking the Devil, about the thalidomide scandal that Harry Evans and The Sunday Times so brilliantly exposed. All of these films obviously ooze an irresistible nostalgia, and having grown up on, and in, newspapers, I enjoyed them. But something about watching them as a newspaper Editor, as I then was, hurt me too. That was the realisation that while I was scrambling relentlessly to get a newspaper out, juggling several full-time jobs, and trying to manage a digital turnaround, the people doing the journalism I revered had one fundamental resource that I didn't. Time. Did you know that the thalidomide scandal exposed by The Sunday Times, one of the signature newspaper investigations in the English language of the 20th Century, unfolded over a decade? All of the great investigations in journalistic history have taken time to land. Even more recently, The Times' brilliant work on alleged sexual harassment at Oxfam emerged from a 10-month courtship of an anxious source by Chief Reporter Sean O'Neill.  And yet the advent of 24-hr news and the internet - both of them, by the way, exceptionally recent phenomena when you consider the grand sweep of journalistic history - has created an impulse toward relentless, breathless stories; towards roiling oceans of information in which, inevitably, poor judgements are made. And all of this is exacerbated and intensified by the social media driven, dopamine-fuelled desire to make stuff go viral.  There is nothing wrong with going viral; on the contrary, it's an admirable achievement, provided it's done in the right way, for the right reasons. Another hero of mine, George Orwell, wrote in his seminal essay Why I Write, ""My initial concern is to get a hearing"". All journalists want to be read, and that's completely reasonable. But the danger is that the pursuit of virality - in other words, clickbait - distorts our editorial values, making us prize being read widely above getting the story right. That's why I contrast the tortoise - who was slow and steady, and had a clear sense of his goal - not just with the hare, whose slapdash and speedy approach was his undoing, but with the 'share', because I fear the speed of social media, which allows journalists to reach vast audiences in seconds, is corroding the soul of journalism.  Without a recrudescence in the ancient virtues of journalism, digital technology, which ought to elevate us, will enervate instead.  Obviously, I am not trying to militate against the journalistic impulse to get a story first, or to be on the scene of a crime or major event before your rivals. Breaking stories and scoops is our lifeblood. We should always want to be first, so long as we're right, and the impulse to get fresh top lines on a story, and so push it on, is a noble one. But for many journalists, being liberated from the need to cover every story as it breaks will free up more time to focus on the stories that most matter.  Clearly, specialist publications such as Private Eye have the huge advantage in being fortnightly, and not covering breaking news. But that doesn't stop them breaking news stories. Together with a unique wit, it's the quality of the journalism that has driven the magazine to record circulation.  Or take The Times. I really think one of the most neglected innovations of recent years was the decision by that publication to move to four editions a day. As Emma Tucker, the Deputy Editor, told me on Radio 4's The Media Show last week, that has freed up tremendous resources to focus on big stories, because they recognise that they just can't compete when it comes to breaking news 24/7.  On which point, by the way, I'm not getting paid for this lecture, obviously - but if there were one favour I were to humbly ask of all of you, it's that you immediately subscribe to The Media Show podcast - and, if you don't think I'm a waste of space, or in fact even if you do, you rate and review it. Just search online for The Media Show podcast, and click on subscribe. Ladies and gentleman, so far I have given you description aplenty. Let me finish on a positive note by giving you prescription instead. I started by saying I would finish with some solutions for the undoubted difficulty journalism faces. Let me cluster them according to the three areas of concern: editorial, demographic, and economic - in reverse order. Editorially, British journalism has historically got a huge amount right, and continues to even today. But I think four simple steps worth taking immediately are: 1/ First, a radical shift to context, to the underlying trends and complex ideas behind the news. This is more likely to take place in what you might call the broadsheet end of the market, I'll grant. So be it. I think deep analysis of why events are happening should be considered as worthwhile as descriptions of what is happening. Pockets of British journalism are doing this of course. I want to see a mentality in which Editors say, what are the 5 or 6 huge trends that are going to change how we live - from AI and graphene, to the rise of China and the data economy, to people living for much longer. And then for their best reporters to be unleashed on those stories. 2/ A shameless embrace of the principle that it is better to be right and second than first and wrong; and a recognition that committing to the former will sometimes lead you to look slow on the uptake. There is a culture war going on, in which the idea of absolute truth has been denigrated. Only by shamelessly fighting for truth can the reputation of journalists be restored. That's why initiatives like Channel 4's Fact Check, the BBC's Reality Check, and other fact-checking services are hugely welcome. They should be given greater prominence. 3/ Related to this, I think we need to make immediate and unforgiving statistical correction one of the aims of broadcast journalism. The peerless Mark Damazer, former Radio 4 Controller, has suggested having statistical experts on standby after broadcast interviews, to check whether claims made on air are correct. Far too often, these checking mechanisms are too slow, or arise in places far from the original interview, for instance, on websites or social media an hour later. But one of the key reasons for loss of trust in the media is the ludicrous abuse of statistics. If independent arbiters with the authority and expertise of, for instance, psephologist Professor John Curtice, were on standby, falsehoods could immediately be debunked, and trust regained.  4/ Speak for and with the poor, rather than to or at them. I know this sounds hopelessly vague. But one of the main reasons for the breakdown in trust between journalism and the public is that capture by middle-class professionals that I mentioned. I take it as a moral duty, being a journalist, to consider myself a tribune for the poor - not because I am a class warrior or proletarian hero - but rather because I know too well how disconnected they feel with our trade, how that rift is widening, and the social consequences of journalism losing touch with millions of people. That means commissioning brilliant programmes, essays, reports and features about the lives of millions of people in poor and provincial Britain - and telling their stories in compelling ways that give them a voice and don't patronise them. This will be much more likely to happen if we change the composition - the demographics - of the trade. I have argued that this is one of the most urgent problems we face. It is one so serious that I think we should consider positive discrimination, in the best sense of that phrase. I should say at this point that, in principle, I am against positive discrimination. It engenders suspicion and resentment, and often demotes merit as a criterion for promotion. But sometimes particular situations are so urgently in need of remedy, and the public cost of not acting, is so high, that positive discrimination goes from being a bad to good idea. Positive discrimination by class is very hard, for the reasons I mentioned: class is hard to describe, and it shifts in a way that, for instance, gender and ethnicity do not. There are also very impressive apprenticeship schemes already in place in many institutions, not least the BBC. But, short of quotas, I would consider positive discrimination toward working-class journalists from outside of London a valuable option for the BBC, when promoting or hiring on and off-air journalists. And though I don't know much about any lobbying organisations within broadcasting set up to help kids from poorer backgrounds, I hope any such efforts can be improved. As for the economics, Simon Fox, the Trinity Mirror CEO, told me on The Media Show last week that there are two models in journalism now: scale, and specialism. As I have argued, I believe the scale model is inherently vulnerable, because it depends on advertising that cannot be relied on, puts publishers at the behest of social media giants, and potentially distorts editorial values. Further to this, there is now exhilarating evidence that, if you produce journalism that is unique and of outstanding quality, and you make it easy for them to pay online, they will do so. So if you're not in the fortunate position of being funded by a licence fee, have the balls to charge, and take pride in it rather than feeling guilt. You know, I'm part of the generation that missed out on the supposed Golden Age. Not for me the hot clanging metal and inky glory of the old Fleet Street, nor the public broadcaster awash with cash, where you could get paid the salaries of yore for presenting the News, at a time when the salaries of yore went a lot further. I work extremely hard, not because I get paid so much - though I do get paid very well - but rather because I love it. Journalism, in that hackneyed phrase you often find in university prospectuses, is a state of mind rather than a career choice. Technology has made this trade much more sociable, and much more partisan - just as it was in the coffee houses of the 18th century where the trade really got going. But it has also made it much more fast. It is absolutely imperative, when breaking a story, to be first if you can; but scoops, while vital, are not all we do. And as an approach to journalism, the impulse to be fast, and to be shared among our friends, can too often distract us from the higher callings of our profession, which is to apply scrutiny to power, find truth where it is hidden, and enlighten our culture.  ""Slow and steady wins the race"" was never meant to sound galvanising. But it was meant to point to a deeper truth - and truth is our currency. As the sprint of the hare was his undoing, and the dopamine-fuelled thrill of the share is ours, so the enduring wisdom of the tortoise should be our inspiration. It's all a matter of time, my friends. Journalism today, and tomorrow, will be at its best when it re-learns the habits inherited from yesterday. That re-learning is my task as well as yours, and I commend it to the University of Kent. ""The Tortoise and the Share - or, How to Save Journalism (from Itself)"" was The Bob Friend Lecture 2018 at the University of Kent at Canterbury on 22nd February, 2018.  If you're interested in issues such as these, please follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and also please subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4. I'm grateful for all constructive feedback. Thanks."
currency fluctuations,Shares fall as new Covid strain spooks investors,2024-09-15,2020-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55391397,"Shares in London dropped and the pound lost ground after several EU countries closed their borders to the UK, which has reported a new variant of coronavirus. London's FTSE 100 index fell as much as 3%, before recovering slightly and ending 1.7% lower, as travel firms and others saw big declines. The main German market fell 2.8%, while in France the key bourse dropped 2.4%. US markets were more mixed, amid relief over progress on a virus aid package. After falling in opening trade, the Dow ended the day up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.4%. The Nasdaq fell 0.1%. Earlier, the pound fell more than 1% against the euro and dropped 1.6% against the dollar. Travel curbs hit airline stocks, with British Airways' owner IAG sinking nearly 8% and EasyJet tumbling 7.2%. Aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce was also badly hit, falling more than 3%. The rout was replicated on other European markets. Air France-KLM shares dropped 4%, while planemaker Airbus was down roughly 3%. ""Investors' rosy expectations for 2021 have suddenly vanished,"" said Kazuhiko Saito, chief analyst at commodities broker Fujitomi Co. As well as renewed concern about Covid-19 cases, UK investors were reacting to another missed deadline in trade talks with the EU.  London and Brussels are trying to reach a trade deal before the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December.     The talks are set to continue on Monday between negotiators. The stalled negotiations have been partly responsible for the pound fluctuating over recent weeks. Optimism that a deal would be struck had triggered a four-day winning streak for sterling, pushing it back up to just under $1.36 before it reversed course again.  Earlier on Monday, the pound fell towards $1.32, with the dollar also being buoyed after a $900bn (£660bn) plan to help the US economy weather the coronavirus pandemic was agreed. However, the pound later regained some of those losses, rising above $1.33. ""The US got its stimulus package through, but it seems that was largely priced in and investors are more concerned with the new strain of Covid-19,"" said Craig Erlam, analyst at Oanda trading group. European nations have begun to impose travel bans on the UK after it reported a more-infectious and ""out of control"" coronavirus variant over the weekend. Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium are all halting flights.  On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced a new tier four level of restrictions for London and South East England.   ""The lockdown news and the stalemate on Brexit is keeping the market nervous,"" National Australia Bank's senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee later after France closed its border with the UK for 48 hours. One major sticking point in the Brexit talks is access to the UK's water for fishing. While the fishing industry accounts for just 0.1% of gross domestic product, (GDP)  it is of high political significance. If a trade agreement is not reached by the end of the month, British firms will revert to trading with the EU under rules established by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This will mean imports and exports to the EU would be subject to WTO-negotiated tariffs, essentially a tax on goods.  Currency experts have warned that the pound could fall to $1.25 by the middle of next year if no trade agreement is agreed."
currency fluctuations,Reality Check: Is the fall in the pound boosting exports?,2024-09-15,2017-11-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41268585," In the build-up to and aftermath of the EU referendum, in June 2016, the pound fell by an average of 20% against other currencies.   Companies selling their products abroad were expected to be the winners of this depreciation because their goods would become cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers. So has there been a boost in exports driven by the weak pound? The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says yes. It found the growth in the amount of physical goods being exported by the UK manufacturing sector rose sharply after the referendum, with growth hitting a peak of 9.7% in March 2017. Of course, exporters can't react immediately to currency fluctuations, so you would expect to see a lag effect. The ONS statistics show businesses are not only selling more abroad - partly, but not solely by dropping prices - but they are also making more money from each product they sell abroad, by cutting prices by less than the drop in sterling and taking extra profit when converting the price paid abroad back into pounds. How does the ONS know this? The line shows the year-on-year increase in the volume of export sales (ie the number of physical goods). The increase in sales has been calculated by holding prices constant.  In other words, it shows how many extra units are getting out of UK factory gates had sterling's value not changed. This means, according to the ONS's analysis, the weaker pound has boosted export competitiveness. But despite rising exports and profits, something else is going on. The UK's trade deficit - that's the difference between what we import and export - still persists . The gap is now £2.9bn - ie we spend £2.9bn more on imports than we make by selling goods and services abroad. That's because imports are also rising and they're rising faster than exports. This may seem odd because the fall in the pound should have made imports more expensive. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says UK imports are continuing to rise because companies have limited options. ""As a household or a firm you have to take the price hit as there's little room for substitution,"" he says. ""Clothing, for example, relies heavily on imports."" When it comes to manufacturing, many businesses rely on imports for components, such as the car industry. Once assembled in the UK, these products are then exported abroad.  This means that the competitiveness boost the falling pound gives to exporters could be partially, or even wholly, offset by higher import prices.   Whether this trend of faster growth in exports can be sustained will probably rely more on the outcome of Brexit negotiations than any further fluctuations in the currency markets. Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex, says future trade performance will ultimately come down to business confidence. ""The uncertainty over Brexit may slow down firms' ability to adjust to the currency environment,"" he says. ""If the future is uncertain, the returns to making an adjustment are less clear and so people tend to postpone doing so."" Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter"
currency fluctuations,UK economy 'growing at muted rate',2024-09-15,2017-10-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41601454,"The UK economy grew at a muted rate in the third quarter of 2017 despite progress in the manufacturing sector, the British Chambers of Commerce says. The number of manufacturers reporting improved domestic sales and orders rose in the quarter to its highest level since early 2015, the BCC said.  Export sales and orders in the sector also improved. But in services, domestic sales and orders remained static, as did the sector's employment expectations. The BCC said its survey also showed the prevalence of recruitment difficulties facing UK businesses, which worsened further during the quarter.  Almost three-quarters of manufacturers reported difficulties hiring staff, and in services, the percentage rose to its highest since early 2016. BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall said: ""The uninspiring results we see in our third-quarter findings reflect the fact that political uncertainty, currency fluctuations and the vagaries of the Brexit process are continuing to weigh on business growth prospects. ""The chancellor's autumn Budget is a critical opportunity to demonstrate that the government stands ready to incentivise investment and support growth here at home.  ""While much of Westminster and Whitehall is distracted by Brexit, business needs action now on the home front. The solutions to some of the biggest issues currently facing our firms - including high up-front costs, a lack of incentive to invest, and a need for better infrastructure - are entirely within the power of the UK government to deliver."" The BCC also said that in the current economic climate, it seemed ""extraordinary"" that the Bank of England was considering raising interest rates. ""We'd caution against an earlier than required tightening in monetary policy, which could hit both business and consumer confidence and weaken overall UK growth,"" said BCC head of economics Suren Thiru. ""While interest rates need to rise at some point, it should be done slowly and timed to not harm the UK's growth prospects."" Buoyancy in the UK manufacturing sector is not universal at the moment, one company said. Andrew Varga, managing director of Seetru, a Bristol-based manufacturer of safety valves for industry, told the BBC's Today programme his firm was ""slightly more pessimistic"" than the BCC. ""We see some startling results. Despite the buoyant European economy, we see an accelerating reduction in order pull from Europe. Clearly uncertainty is having a really significant effect on customers' choices of which country they buy from, and they're not buying from the UK any more."" He added that the UK market was ""depressed"". ""Like-for-like sales are clearly down - down about 10%,"" he said. ""This is all due to [Brexit] uncertainty at the moment."" Clare Flynn Levy, founder and chief executive of financial behavioural analytics software firm Essentia Analytics, told the BBC that for her company ""life's a bit more optimistic"". ""But I'm not surprised to hear that the services sector is static, because there is a massive energy suck toward people decisions and mobility decisions that are caused by Brexit, and the uncertainty is just causing energy that would otherwise be devoted to selling and delivering services to clients to be pulled into scenario planning... so people are sort of frozen,"" she said."
currency fluctuations,Trump tariff move pushes Turkish lira down,2024-09-15,2018-08-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45123607,"President Donald Trump has doubled US tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, as the precipitous fall of the Turkish lira accelerates.  In a tweet, Mr Trump said the currency was weak against ""our very strong dollar"", adding that ""US relations with Turkey are not good at this time"".  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech that the drop was part of a ""campaign"" led by foreign powers. Turkey also warned it would retaliate against the US tariffs move. ""The United States should know that the only result that such sanctions and pressure will bring... will be harming our relationship as allies,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. The two Nato members are at odds on a range of issues - how to fight the Islamic State group, Ankara's plans to buy Russian missile defence systems and how to punish the alleged plotters of a failed coup in Turkey in 2016. Most recently, President Trump issued sanctions on top Turkish officials over the ongoing detention of a US pastor who is facing terror and espionage charges in Turkey. In the past 24 hours, the lira has lost around 20% of its value. It had already fallen more than 40% in the past year. In a televised speech on Friday, President Erdogan called on citizens to exchange foreign currency and gold for lira, calling it an ""economic war"". ""This is a domestic and national struggle,"" he said, as the lira continued to fall. In a veiled attack on the US he added: ""Some countries have engaged in behaviour that protects coup plotters and knows no laws or justice."" ""Relations with countries who behave like this have reached a point beyond salvaging."" After he spoke, Mr Trump tweeted that aluminium tariffs ""with respect to Turkey"" would be raised to 20% and steel to 50%. The reaction from global currency markets to the rift caused the euro to slump to a 13-month low and pushed the dollar to a one-year high. The Turkish trade ministry responded that the additional tariffs were against the rules of the World Trade Organization. ""Turkey expects other member countries to abide by international rules,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding that the US remained an important trade partner. Analysis by Selin Girit, BBC News, Istanbul It has been a dramatic day in Turkey but the Turkish government has put on a brave face.  President Erdogan said: ""If they have dollars, we have our people, we have our right and we have Allah"" - rhetoric that goes down well with his supporters but not necessarily with international markets.  Some will adhere his call to exchange their dollars, euros or gold for Turkish lira but many others have started feeling the squeeze.  Interest rate hikes, which Mr Erdogan sees as the mother of all evils, are not very likely to happen.  President Erdogan may seek help from the IMF, following the example of Argentina, but that is not likely either as it would have strings attached, and would be frowned upon in Turkey.  There is a feeling that the quickest and most efficient step could be to ease the tensions with Washington. Shortly after Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Erdogan spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A statement from the Kremlin said the two leaders had discussed economic and trade ties. Officials from Mr Erdogan's office said the two men had ""expressed pleasure"" that relations between Turkey and Russia were progressing ""positively"" amid joint defence and energy projects. Friday's developments are the latest manifestation of growing differences between the two sides on a number of issues. Earlier this month, the White House hit Turkey's justice and interior ministers with sanctions over the country's ongoing detention of an American pastor. Turkey is accusing Andrew Brunson - who operates a small church in Izmir - of having links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for the failed coup. He had been held in prison for almost two years, but was recently moved to house arrest due to health issues. American evangelicals have rallied to his cause, triggering the recent reaction from the Trump White House. Turkish officials have been in Washington this week for talks on his release but these seemed to fall apart in recent days. Last month, Mr Trump took to Twitter to threaten sanctions on Turkey if Mr Brunson was not released. The US has also been refusing to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric and former Erdogan ally who has been living in the US state of Pennsylvania. Turkey accuses him of leading the attempted ""Gulenist"" coup. In addition, Turkish politicians are furious at American military support for Kurdish militia fighting the so-called Islamic State in northern Syria. Mr Trump's rejection of the Iran nuclear deal has also been a point of contention between the two nations. Half of Turkey's oil imports come from Iran. Therefore the re-imposition of US sanctions against Iran has been seen by economists as likely to harm the Turkish economy. Then there is the Incirlik Air Base, which Nato has used extensively in the fight against IS. There has been some domestic pressure on Mr Erdogan to close the base, and last week a group of pro-government Turkish lawyers filed charges against US soldiers stationed there. They request that a judge temporarily block all flights out of the base, and that arrest warrants be issued for the group of American officers, who they claim played a role in the coup attempt."
currency fluctuations,"Government purchase of wine increases by £26,000",2024-09-15,2021-07-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57848267,"The government's wine cellars were topped up to the tune of £73,000 last year - an increase of £26,000 on the year before, latest figures reveal. The wine cellar - run by the Foreign Office - stores alcohol to be served at government events and receptions. Since 2011, the cellar has been funded by the sale of high-value wines and payments from government departments. The government said the spending rise ""reflects the fluctuations in currency rates and the needs of the cellar"". In a written statement to Parliament to accompany the latest review of the cellar, the Foreign Office described it as ""self-funding"".  The extensive collection, made up of tens of thousands of bottles, is kept under a grand central London mansion, Lancaster House, which is owned by the Queen but leased to the government. There were no sales of wines in the financial year to 2020 - something the government attributes to the pandemic.  But it said other government departments added £23,220 to the year's overall receipts through payments for wines provided at departmental functions. While spending increased, the volume of wine consumed between 2019 and 2020 fell 17.5% compared to the year before.  Almost three-quarters of the purchased wine and over half of the wine consumed was English. Both of these figures represented an increase from 2018-19."
currency fluctuations,'I was arrested for trying to confront cryptocrash boss',2024-09-15,2022-05-23,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61552030,"The sudden collapse of two popular digital coins in early May shocked investors and wiped $400bn (£318bn) from the value of many other cryptocurrencies, including the biggest, Bitcoin. All over the world, people who lost their life savings are now appealing for help. One desperate man was even arrested after visiting the home of the elusive businessman at the centre of the ""cryptocrash"". He told BBC News his life was in tatters. In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, fortunes can be made and lost rapidly - but the May 2022 cryptocrash has been particularly devastating for one man in South Korea. ""I felt like I was going to die,"" the cryptocurrency streamer known as Chancers says. ""I lost a lot of money in a short period of time. Around $2.4m (£1.9m) of my cryptocurrency was wiped out."" Chancers has been investing in cryptocurrencies since 2017, and says he became wealthy in the past five years as the value of Bitcoin and other digital coins rose. ""Here in Korea I was in the top 1% in terms of my finances. But thanks to the crash, I'm now in trouble,"" he told BBC News. Chancers invested $800,000 of his money in a digital token called Terra Luna at the worst possible time. Terra Luna came to prominence in December 2021, when the value of each coin started rising - from $5 to a high of $116 in April this year. Like many people, Chancers made a big bet on the coin rising further. But then suddenly, on 9 May, it collapsed, losing 99% of its value in just 48 hours. Now, each Terra Luna coin is worth less than $0.0002, or two-hundredths of a cent. Terra Luna's fall began when its sister cryptocurrency, TerraUSD, suddenly lost value, experts say. TerraUSD is a so-called ""stablecoin"" a cryptocurrency token supposed to avoid major fluctuations in value. The companies behind stablecoins try to ensure they remain in parity with assets such as the US dollar - with one token equalling $1, for example. But when TerraUSD's value plummeted, a panicked sell-off began and Terra Luna - algorithmically linked to TerraUSD - simultaneously nosedived. The rest of the cryptocurrency world watched the implosion in horror and pulled billions of dollars out of other digital currencies. At the centre of the chaos is Do Kwon, a notoriously news-media shy man who invented the Terra system both coins were built on. Thousands of people turned to the 30-year-old on social media, looking for answers and for a plan to rescue the situation. But in his desperation Chancers decided to go a step further. Angry with the lack of communication from Mr Kwon, he searched online and found the crypto millionaire's home address in Seoul. ""I wanted to ask him about his plans for Luna. I suffered a huge loss and wanted to talk to him directly,"" Chancers says. So the streamer travelled across his home city and knocked on Mr Kwon's door.  He also decided to share the potential confrontation with his viewers and streamed the event to about 100 people watching his online AfreecaTV channel. He was disappointed when Mr Kwon's wife answered the door and she said her husband was out. Worse was to come, as the police were alerted and he was arrested. Local media captured the moment he arrived at Seoul's Seongdong Police Station for questioning. ""I surrendered myself to the police station twice,"" Chancers says. ""I didn't trespass on Do Kwon's property - but according to Korean law, it's illegal to just go there and try to talk. I didn't know."" Chancers says he will most likely face a fine and a criminal record that could make his life difficult.  ""It's so hard,"" he says. ""I lost a lot of money and now I'm being investigated by the police. I originally served as a civil servant in Korea - but if I am convicted of this case, I may not be able to return to the civil service again.  ""In Korean culture, the problem itself is not important but rather the fact that it caused a scandal. I even had to apologise publicly as a sinner. I had no idea this would be so big. It's very sad."" Chancers regrets trying to speak directly to Mr Kwon but says cryptocurrency bosses are not being held accountable for failed projects that affect so many people. Nearly 250,000 people had invested in the Terra coins, it is estimated. Chancers accuses Mr Kwon of not communicating publicly enough during and since the collapse of the coins. He now describes them as a ""scam"". Mr Kwon says neither he nor his company has made any money from the collapse of the Terra coins. On Friday, South Korean police said they were investigating his business, Terraform Labs, with local news outlets reporting the Financial and Securities Crime Joint Investigation Team was focusing on the coins' downfall. Before starting Terra, in 2020, Mr Kwon was reportedly behind another failed cryptocurrency coin, Basis Cash. A week before Terra's demise, he told a YouTube crypto channel: ""95% [of coins] are going to die - but there's also entertainment in watching companies die too.""  Just before his $60bn creation began to implode, he tweeted to his nearly one million followers on Twitter: ""I love chaos."" Over the next three days, in a flurry of tweets, he launched plan after plan to rescue the coins, urging the Terra community to ""hang tight"" and ""stay strong"". But on 13 May, he conceded the rescue had failed, tweeting: ""I am heartbroken about the pain my invention has brought on all of you."" Now, Mr Kwon has devised a controversial plan to resurrect the Terra Luna coin. But prominent figures in the cryptocurrency community have criticised his approach. Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of crypto exchange company Binance, described Mr Kwon's plan as ""wishful thinking"". Billy Markus, co-founder of popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin, was also scathing, tweeting: ""My recommendation is to stop trying to bring in new victims to fund the previous victims and leave the space forever."" Neither Mr Kwon nor Terraform Labs responded to requests for comment. Additional reporting by BBC Korean"
currency fluctuations,Arsenal fan token posts broke advertising rules,2024-09-15,2021-12-22,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59730984,"A web page and a Facebook post by Arsenal football club promoting crypto-based fan tokens broke advertising rules, a watchdog has ruled. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) argued the club had ""failed to illustrate the risk of the investment"". It ruled ""the ads must not appear again in the form complained about"". Arsenal said it would seek an independent review of the ruling, adding that the club had provided information on the financial risks. Several top-tier football clubs offer fan tokens.  But critics, including some supporters' groups, suggest that clubs who promote crypto fan tokens are encouraging people to engage in the risky, and largely unregulated, world of cryptocurrency investment. The ASA ruled against two promotions of Arsenal's fan tokens ($AFC). The first breach, according to the watchdog, focused on content on Arsenal's official website - in particular a page posted on 6 August 2021 with the title '$AFC Fan Token: Everything you need to know'. The second breach was a Facebook post on the club's official page, posted on 12 August 2021, which read: '$AFC is now live' and asked fans: ""What song do you want to hear when we win? Download the Socios app to get your token and vote"".  In its ruling, the ASA investigated three issues concerning the post and website text, arguing they were: In addition, it said the Facebook post ""did not make clear the 'token' was a crypto-asset, which could only be obtained by opening an account and exchanging with another cryptocurrency which had to be purchased"". The watchdog found that both the website and the Facebook post broke its rules: ""The ads must not appear again in the form complained about,"" it stated. In future, the club must make it clear that fan tokens are crypto-assets and ""that the value of investments in crypto-assets was variable and crypto-assets were unregulated"", the ruling continued. Arsenal football club told the BBC: ""We take our responsibilities with regard to marketing to our fans very seriously. ""We carefully considered the communications to fans regarding our promotions and provided information regarding financial risks."" The Club said it would be seeking ""an independent review of the ASA's ruling to seek greater clarity on the ASA's current position"".  In defending its marketing to the ASA, Arsenal argued the website did include the warning that fans ""could lose some or all of their money invested"".  It said the marketing material stated: ""We advise you to spend only what you can afford and seek independent financial advice if required."" The Club argued the fan tokens were not promoted as an investment and they did not encourage the trading of tokens. Arsenal is the first club whose fan token marketing is judged to have breached advertising standards by the watchdog. It is one of a number of clubs to have joined forces with a company called Socios, which offers fan tokens through its app. Socios told the BBC's Tech Tent podcast it has sold $270m-300m worth of coins through its app, but declined to reveal how much money goes directly to clubs it works with. Responding to the recent ASA ruling, Socios said: ""We welcome Arsenal's call for an independent review. This is a fast-moving area and clarity is needed to ensure all companies can adhere to the latest guidelines."" Clubs say that by collecting fan tokens, supporters can influence the running of the club - suggesting the more tokens fans collect, the more say they might have. But with the exception of free non-tradeable fan tokens given to club members, fans have to use a crypto-currency called Chiliz ($CHZ) to buy and sell tokens. So far, across the five major European leagues, 24 clubs have launched or are considering launching fan tokens, including eight Premier League sides. Some clubs also sell digital collectibles, known as NFTs (non-fungible tokens). In September, French firm Sorare, which sells football trading cards in the form of NFTs, raised $680m (£498m) in funding. However, some supporters groups are wary. In August, the Arsenal Supporters Trust said the club should make it clear that crypto-currency is an ""unregulated activity"" and was risky. Tim Payton, a board member of the Trust told the BBC that ""clubs should not be allowed to use football's popularity to push an inherently high-risk product"". The Trust believes government and the football authorities should look into partnerships between clubs and crypto-currency companies. Mr Payton said if they are to continue, then a greater effort must be made to ensure that all marketing materials ""inform all fans of the downside involved in buying tokens"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says monitoring crypto-assets, like Bitcoin, is a ""red-alert priority"" and it is concerned that many ads fail to fully convey the risks of investing. Guy Parker, the authority's, chief executive told the BBC crypto-assets were ""poorly understood by the public"" and were mostly unregulated, and not backed by financial compensations schemes. His message to consumers was ""think very carefully before you buy. Do you understand crypto-assets well enough?  Can you afford to lose what you've spent?"" The watchdog says it plans to issue guidance on crypto-asset marketing in the new year, and will continue to publishing rulings on ads for NFTs, crypto-currencies and fan tokens in the interim."
currency fluctuations,Business leaders call for reassurance,2024-09-15,2017-06-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40216641,"Politicians must act fast to reassure businesses in the wake of the election result, according to business leaders. The result is a ""serious moment for the UK economy"", the CBI business lobby group said, and called for politicians to form a ""functioning government"". British Chamber of Commerce bosses also called for a ""workable administration"" to build confidence. The Institute of Directors demanded a focus on preparing for Brexit talks and to move away from political ""rhetoric"". And the manufacturing organisation, the EEF, said it wanted a ""careful rethink"" on Britain's Brexit negotiation strategy. All business groups were keen to stress that uncertainty is the worst outcome for its members, who are struggling to come to terms with what shape the new hung parliament will take. Individual companies and chief executives have been more muted, but Aston Martin said the uncertainly could lead to a fall in investment in the UK by the luxury car maker. Aston Martin chief executive Andy Palmer said: ""We cannot stress strongly enough the need for rapid and decisive policy direction to ensure that business can continue to invest for the long term growth and ensure the global competitiveness of the British economy,""  The firm has recently invested heavily in a new factory in St Athan, Wales. Organisations representing thousands of UK businesses echoed Mr Palmer's message. CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn warned: ""The priority must be for politicians to get their house in order and form a functioning government, reassure the markets and protect our resilient economy.  ""Politicians must act responsibly, putting the interests of the country first and showing the world that the UK remains a safe destination for business. It's time to put the economy back to the top of the agenda. Pounds falls but shares rise Hung Parliament: What happens next? Election results live updates Election 2017: At a glance Election catches investors off guard ""For the next government, the need and opportunity to deliver an open, competitive and fair post-Brexit economy that works for everyone across all our nations and regions has never been more important."" Markets reacted to the news of the hung parliament by pushing the value of the pound lower, although the FTSE 100 share index opened higher. Martin GIlbert, chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management told the BBC's Today programme: ""I don't think any of us know what to make of the result. ""The City will be hoping for a slightly softer tone and possibly a softer tone from Europe now that the really the negotiators don't have a mandate to negotiate a hard Brexit."" Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), agreed that a new government must be formed quickly. ""After two long years of elections, referenda and wider uncertainty, many businesses were doing their best to ignore the noise of politics - up until today,"" he said.  ""The electorate's split decision generates further uncertainty for business communities, who are already grappling with currency fluctuations, rising costs, and the potential impacts of Brexit.  ""The formation of a workable administration that can give voters and businesses confidence around economic management must be the immediate priority."" Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said businesses had been ""thrown into political limbo"". ""The majority of British business will be waiting to see whether a stable government can be formed in short order. ""If the Conservatives govern as a minority, they must recognise that they have not earned a mandate to implement their manifesto in full. ""Now is the time to move on from the rhetoric of the election campaign and focus on preparing for Brexit talks."" Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: ""The Brexit negotiating strategy requires a careful rethink. ""Industry should be at the table, alongside whatever administration is formed, to help ensure we have the right negotiating position, which is something that's been sadly lacking until now.  ""The main parties have championed an industrial strategy for Britain and this must not be a casualty of the political turmoil."""
currency fluctuations,What Brexit means for half-term holiday plans,2024-09-15,2019-10-13,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49974027,"Holiday company adverts are still urging you to whisk your family off on a European city break during the half-term holiday. Yet the minds of many potential holidaymakers are somewhat scrambled by Brexit. The government's planned exit day is 31 October - the Thursday in the middle of some schools' autumn break. The concern is neatly summed up on the message board of parental chat room Mumsnet, where one post says: ""I don't want to spend lots of money then stress the entire holiday about travelling back."" In reply, some say they still plan to travel - including one who had delayed their trip from March owing to the original planned Brexit date - while others say they will stay at home. Operators on the UK's European Consumer Centre says they are receiving questions from callers about their rights every day. So what do you need to think about, assuming - in line with the government's, but not necessarily Parliament's, intention - that the UK leaves on 31 October with or without an agreement with the EU? Getting the most from your pounds when changing them into euros feels like a matter of timing - but nobody can tell you when is the best moment to exchange. This graph shows how sterling has been faring against the euro. One certainty is that the worst rates are given to those who leave it to the last minute and use a bureau de change at the airport or train and ferry terminals. Currency experts say the pound may slip in value if an exit without a UK-EU withdrawal deal looks likely, but will rise in value if an agreement can be struck. At the moment, holidaymakers can exchange at close to the same rate as they would have got at the start of the summer holidays and the same time last year. Changing £100 during most of last week would have got you just over €111, some €1.46 less than 31 October 2018, and €1.63 more than on 31 July this year, according to figures compiled for the BBC by exchange company Equals. That rate improved by the end of the week. Sterling's fluctuation during the past five years means you would have got €4.95 less in August last year, but €32.65 more in July 2015.  If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then using a UK bank card to pay for things in the EU after 31 October could become more expensive owing to extra cross-border bank charges. Travellers are much more likely to visit Europe than elsewhere, owing to the cost, the distance and the simplicity. Anyone on holiday abroad after 31 October needs to check that they have six months validity left on their passport and that it is no more than 10 years old. That is relevant when visiting most countries in Europe - the full list is here. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there is no deal. You will continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. It is probably already too late to renew a passport in the normal manner in time - it usually takes three weeks. Instead, there is a quicker, premium service that is more expensive. No visa will be needed for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer. When arriving at a passport control after 31 October, the government advises that holidaymakers have proof of a return or onward ticket, be able to show that you have enough money for the trip (but must declare cash of £10,000 or more), and be prepared to queue in a different channel to the EU one you may be used to. You may also have to wait for longer. When family members have had accidents or fallen ill, UK holidaymakers in the EU have been using their EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) to access free medical treatment. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, it is likely that the EHIC will be invalid. If there is a deal or an agreement after a no-deal Brexit, then its validity, or otherwise, would be contained in the text.  Specifically for those travelling to Spain, a healthcare deal has already been struck so any UK tourists travelling there, after a no-deal scenario, would still be covered as before. Separate deals have also been agreed with Portugal and the Irish Republic which, immediately after any exit, will accept a passport from UK tourists to ensure they can receive healthcare as before. Whatever the outcome, people travelling soon after 31 October are being advised by the government to ensure they have appropriate travel insurance. That means a policy that would cover them not only for accidents, but also for any pre-existing health issues (which may require a specialist policy). This could be a major issue for people who, for example, need kidney dialysis. The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel, and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal, whatever the manner of the UK's exit. Some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run in a no-deal scenario. There is a chance of disruption on some roads while still in the UK if there is a no-deal Brexit. There are plans in place for lorries if they are delayed on their way through ports, but any spillover could affect holidaymakers. Insurers say that refunds or alternative arrangements for Brexit-related cancellations will be the responsibility of travel or credit and debit card providers first, and only after that could people with policies that include travel disruption cover make a claim. Anyone driving their own vehicle after 31 October if there is no deal will need a GB sticker on it and also a ""green card"". This is actually a document made of green paper from your insurer which has proof of insurance on it. Those towing a trailer or caravan will need two. Generally, it takes one month to receive a green card, so it may be difficult for some people to receive one in time if they leave an application any later. All motorists - either taking their own vehicle or hiring one - may need an International Driving Permit (IDP) when driving in some, but not all, EU countries (you can check if you need one on the Post Office website) in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The extra expense - an IDP costs £5.50 - may be mitigated by the opportunity to buy some duty-free alcohol or tobacco on the way back in a no-deal scenario.  The ""roam like at home"" rules are expected to end after a no-deal Brexit. Again, if there is a deal, it will need to be included in any agreement. The current rules, in place since June 2017, mean there are no extra charges for making or receiving calls and using data from your domestic allowance while in the EU. If it no longer applies, using a mobile or tablet on holiday after 31 October could, in theory, get more expensive. In practice, competitive pressures mean that the big network operators say they have no plans to return to roaming charges, whatever happens. Even if you have an EU Pet Passport, this would no longer be valid if the UK leaves without a deal. However, anyone travelling to the EU before 31 October and returning after that date can use their pet passport, the government has said. Anyone travelling out after 31 October, for example at Christmas, in the case of no-deal would need to ensure pets meet all the requirements of animals from a so-called unlisted country to travel.  It takes about four months to complete all these requirements necessary for pet travel. If there is an agreement, or an extension to the UK's membership, then the pet passport should still be accepted. "
currency fluctuations,What ancient Rome may teach on post-Brexit tourism,2024-09-15,2020-01-30,By Carly Silver,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51279876,"UK Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan has probably not previously been compared to ancient Roman writer Pliny the Younger. But they have one major thing in common - they have both called for people to take more domestic holidays. Ms Morgan, who since her recent elevation to the House of Lords is now formally known as Baroness Morgan of Cotes, remains the government minister ultimately responsible for promoting British tourism. And even before she took up the job in 2017 she was urging more Britons to consider taking so-called ""staycations"". Back in 2016, she went as far as driving a steam train to promote English Tourism Week. She said at the time: ""Tourism isn't just about people visiting our country from overseas, it is also about us visiting the wonderful attractions on our own doorstep."" This would have been music to the ears of Roman writer Pliny the Younger (AD61-113). He once wrote: ""Though we often take long journeys, and cross the seas to examine curiosities, we neglect them when they lie beneath our very eye."" Pliny, who was also a lawyer and imperial magistrate, added that Romans should examine the ""objects of interest in our city, and near to it, which we have not even heard of"". As the UK is about to exit the European Union, Brexit appears to already be having an impact on the UK tourism sector. While more Britons are choosing to go on domestic holidays, at the same time visitor numbers from mainland Europe have fallen. What can be done to regain travellers from Europe? Is the staycation market going to continue to boom? And are there any other parallels from ancient history? Patricia Yates, director of official tourism agency Visit Britain, says that visitor numbers from Europe are down 3% over the past two years. ""The fall has been due to the uncertainly [over Brexit],"" she says. ""People [across Europe] have been concerned about a lot of practicalities - will the flights still go ahead? Can I still use my health card? Will my ID still be accepted? ""What we need to do is make sure we tell people in Europe, who are thinking of coming to Britain, that we are still open and we are still welcoming. And we are building up to a big campaign launch in that regard, very much people focused, to get across that sense of welcoming."" Overall visitor numbers are still rising, however, thanks to travellers from the US and China. In total, Visit Britain predicts that the number of overseas visits to the UK will rise in 2020 to 39.7 million, the highest ever, and up 2.9% on 2019. However, these figures could take a hit if the coronavirus outbreak continues in China. The number of domestic overnight holidays in Britain also rose 4% to a record 48.9 million from January to September 2019, compared with the same period a year earlier. Chris Greenwood, a senior insights manager at Visit Scotland, says that Brexit concerns have definitely boosted domestic tourist numbers. ""Scotland is seeing a resurgence in the staycationer,"" he says. ""It is highly encouraging to see so many more Scots exploring what is right here on their doorstep. ""Uncertainty around Brexit, and currency fluctuations, have undoubtedly been contributing factors for holidaymakers who decided to travel closer to home."" A survey last year from hotel chain Travelodge also found that Brexit was a big reason why more Britons were holidaying within the UK instead of going abroad. Its poll of 1,500 people found that 12% more were planning a domestic holiday than in 2018. And more than half said that Brexit was the reason. Back in the time of ancient Rome they obviously didn't have Brexit, or budget airlines, or the chance to enjoy long delays while waiting for Eurostar trains at Gare du Nord in Paris. But with the Romans building well-paved roads and way stations (like ancient motorway service stations) across their empire, organised long-distance travel became feasible for the curious and well-heeled. And a travel industry built up. Some Roman commentators were unhappy with this though, and wanted people to stay within the borders of today's Italy to prevent them being corrupted by foreign influence. Others were not impressed with people from other parts of the empire travelling to the Italian peninsula. In his Third Satire, the first Century AD poet Juvenal constructed a xenophobic narrator named Umbricius who complains about the number of Greeks in Rome, and Syrian influence. Meanwhile in Tacitus's Annals, the Roman historian said that politician Aulus Caecina Severus wanted to prohibit women from venturing beyond ""the boundaries of Italy"" for fear they would develop masculine traits. Domestic tourism in Ancient Rome did in fact flourish, with the wealthy flocking every summer to their villas along the Bay of Naples. The poor also trekked to the seaside, but holed up in less salubrious tenement blocks. And the ancient city of Pompeii was a hotspot for travellers, unfortunate pun intended. The Romans also helped to develop tourism in the UK, turning the healing springs at the town of Aquae Sulis (today's Bath) into an attraction for travellers. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Cath Poucher, a UK tourism marketer, says that while Brexit has fuelled a rise in UK staycations, many Britons have ""a genuine pride in their country, and a desire to explore it"". Mike Bugsgang, a veteran travel industry expert, adds that Visit Britain will have to work hard if the UK is to regain the trust of European holidaymakers. ""Research has indicated that there is a perception in certain EU countries, notably Germany, that Britain is not as welcoming to overseas visitors as it was pre-Brexit,"" he says. ""On the upside, Euro 2020 matches including the final in England this summer will certainly provide a welcome boost for inbound and domestic tourism."" Yet Mr Bugsgang adds that not every Briton wants a staycation whatever complications Brexit brings. ""As always, domestic tourism will be under pressure from the outbound holidays sector, with a recent survey by Travelzoo showing that despite Brexit, consumers are positive about their finances and want to travel to new destinations overseas.""

currency fluctuations,Amazon slides on Christmas sales slowdown,2024-09-15,2018-10-25,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45986319,"A disappointing sales forecast for the Christmas season sent Amazon shares sliding on Thursday night. The online giant said it expected year-on-year sales growth of 10% to 20% for the three months to 31 December. That would be a marked slowdown from the 29% jump in sales for the most recent quarter to $56.6bn. Amazon also made record profits of $2.9bn in the period, compared with $256m last year. That marked a fourth consecutive quarter of more than $1bn in profit for the Seattle-based company and came despite a 21% rise in operating expenses. Added costs came from investment in its Prime membership scheme, offering home delivery from Whole Foods stores and creating more original content for Amazon Prime Video. The profit surge has been partly driven by divisions outside its extensive retail operation. Revenue from AWS, its cloud services business, increased 46% year-on-year to nearly $6.7bn for the quarter to 30 September.  ""Other"" revenue - a category that primarily includes the firm's advertising business - jumped 122% to almost $2.5bn. Retail remains the firm's biggest source of revenue, with the strongest growth in North America.  But it is facing increasing competition, as other retailers - including low cost giants such as Walmart - focus on online sales. Online sales in the third quarter totalled more than $29bn, 10% higher than from last year.  Amazon's physical retail locations - most of them associated with the Whole Foods grocery chain the firm acquired last year - brought in about $4.2bn. Amazon expects sales in the fourth quarter between of $66.5bn and $72.5bn.  On a call with analysts, executives blamed the somewhat modest Christmas season forecast on factors such as currency fluctuations.  They also said comparisons were complicated by changes to the business, such as the acquisition of Whole Foods. Chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said consumer demand remained healthy: ""We're very bullish on the fourth quarter - we'll just have to see where revenue comes in."" After ending 7% higher, shares fell almost 8% in after-hours trading in New York. Amazon stock has jumped nearly 40% this year. The underlying strengths of Amazon's business remain, despite the disappointing forecast, said equity analyst George Salmon of Hargreaves Lansdown. He added that the high expectations for the company had raised the share price to levels where swings were to be expected. Neil Saunders at GlobalData Retail said the retail landscape had been shifting: ""There is more online competition in online retail than there has ever been, and that competition is more effective than it has ever been."""
currency fluctuations,Samsung sees profit jump amid global chip shortage,2024-09-15,2022-01-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59904658,"Technology giant Samsung Electronics has said it expects to post a 52% jump in profit for the last three months of 2021, amid the global chip shortage. The world's biggest memory chip maker estimates that it made 13.8tn won ($11.5bn; £8.5bn) in the period. That would be its highest fourth quarter operating profit in four years. The company's earnings were boosted by strong demand for server memory chips and higher profit margins in its chip contract manufacturing business. “Samsung is well placed to profit from the record-breaking demand for PCs and electronics,” technology analyst Sam Reynolds told the BBC. He also highlighted that the firm had benefited from currency fluctuations: ""The Korean won continues to depreciate, making Korea's exports more attractive on the global market."" However, the estimated profit was lower than the 15.2tn won predicted by many analysts. Samsung's spending on such things as employees' bonuses and marketing for its smartphone business were seen as reasons for it missing the market forecast. In recent months, the global shortage of semiconductors has been causing major disruptions for manufacturers, from carmakers that have had to suspend production to Apple warning that iPhone shipments would be delayed. Investors are also watching the company's chip manufacturing operation in Xi'an, central China. The city has been in lockdown since 23 December due to a coronavirus outbreak. Samsung said last week that it would ""temporarily adjust operations"" at its sites in Xi'an but gave no further details of how the measures could impact the production of microchips. In November, Samsung announced that it had chosen a site close to the US city of Taylor in Texas for its new $17bn computer chip plant. The plant is expected to be operational by the second half of 2024. It is the South Korean electronics giant's biggest-ever US investment. Shares in Samsung Electronics were trading around 1.8% higher in Seoul on Friday."
currency fluctuations,World's most expensive cities revealed,2024-09-15,2019-03-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47617206,"Paris has come top of a ranking of the world's most expensive cities, alongside Hong Kong and Singapore. It's the first time three cities have shared the top spot in the 30-year history of the annual Economist Intelligence Unit survey. The French capital - ranked second most expensive last year - is one of four European cities in the top 10.  The survey compares the cost of 160 items, such as food, drink, transport, utility bills, and rent, in 133 cities. It then tracks whether prices have gone up or down by comparing them with the cost of living in New York, which is used as a benchmark. The annual index was designed to help companies calculate cost-of-living expenses for expatriates and business travellers. The Economist Intelligence Unit noted that costs in the cheapest cities were low by Western standards, partly because low wages limiting household spending are the norm there.  It also said a ""growing number of locations"" were becoming cheaper because of the impact of political or economic disruption, citing crisis-hit Caracas in Venezuela and war-torn Damascus in Syria, which are at the bottom of the list. ""There is a considerable element of risk in some of the world's cheapest cities,"" the report said, adding, ""Put simply, cheaper cities also tend to be less liveable."" Report author Roxana Slavcheva said Paris had been among the top 10 most expensive cities since 2003 and was ""extremely expensive"" to live in.  ""Only alcohol, transport and tobacco offer value for money compared with other European cities,"" she said.  The average cost of a woman's haircut, for example, costs $119.04 (£90) in Paris, compared with $73.97 in Zurich and $53.46 in Japanese city Osaka. ""European cities tend to have the highest costs in the household, personal care, recreation and entertainment categories - with Paris being a good representative in these categories - perhaps reflecting a greater premium on discretionary spending,"" Ms Slavcheva said.  1. Singapore (Singapore) 1. Paris (France)  1. Hong Kong (China) 4. Zurich (Switzerland) 5. Geneva (Switzerland) 5. Osaka (Japan) 7. Seoul (South Korea) 7. Copenhagen (Denmark) 7. New York (US) 10. Tel Aviv (Israel) 10. Los Angeles (US) Inflation and volatile currency fluctuations helped drive changes in this year's ranking, with places like Argentina, Brazil, Turkey and Venezuela all seeing a sharp fall in their cost of living ranking.  Caracas in Venezuela, where inflation neared 1,000,000% last year forcing the government to launch a new currency, was ranked the least expensive city in this year's survey.  The price of a cup of coffee in the capital Caracas doubled to 400 bolivars ($0.62; £0.50) in the space of only a week last December, according to Bloomberg. Damascus in Syria was ranked the world's second cheapest city.  1. Caracas (Venezuela) 2. Damascus (Syria) 3. Tashkent (Uzbekistan) 4. Almaty (Kazakhstan) 5. Bangalore (India) 6.

currency fluctuations,Football fans spending millions on crypto-tokens,2024-09-15,2021-12-10,By Joe Tidy and Edwin Lane,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59596267,"Football clubs have potentially made hundreds of millions of pounds selling controversial crypto ""fan tokens"". Analysis commissioned by BBC News estimates more than £262m ($350m) has been spent on the virtual currencies. Some of the tokens are marketed as offering real-world perks to the buyer. But critics say these perks are insignificant - one offered the chance to vote for songs to be played in stadiums - and clubs have insufficient protection for supporters. So far, across the five major European leagues 24 different clubs have launched or are considering fan tokens, including eight Premier League sides. Most offer tokens akin to a club-specific crypto-currency - virtual coins can be bought and sold and their value rise and fall depending on supply and demand.  Some clubs, such as Manchester City, also sell digital collectibles known as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).  Most of the clubs offering fan tokens have signed up to a company called Socios that organises the initial sale and subsequent trading of the virtual coins - but other platforms, including Binance and Bitci, are growing too. Socios told BBC News it had sold $270m-300m worth of coins through its app. It would not say how much money goes directly to clubs. Buyers must first convert their money into the company's own crypto-currency, Chiliz. The research, by crypto-analysts Protos, suggests many buyers are speculatively trading their tokens like other crypto-currencies in an attempt to make money. But the value of many fan tokens had decreased since they were initially sold by the clubs. BBC News asked every Premier League team and some major European sides about their plans for, and views on, the new trend. Only one was happy to comment. A Brighton and Hove Albion spokesman said: ""We have not sold these products and have no plans to enter these markets."" Since crypto-currency products are based on a public ledger, known as the blockchain, Protos was able to determine: ""Fan tokens are being traded more actively than you'd expect for this type of fan-engagement product,"" Protos director of news David Canellis said. ""Generally, small crypto-currencies like these fan tokens can be incredibly volatile due to the small amount of people who want to trade them.  ""Speculators know this, so I would consider much of the trade in fan-token markets to be powered purely by speculators seeking short-term profits."" Socios disputed the claim that many of its users were speculators, saying that the ""vast majority"" held tokens to engage with their clubs, with ""most holding just a few tokens"". Another criticism of the current system is clubs hold on to the vast majority of tokens, rather than selling them to fans, which distorts the market.  The value of tokens held by the top 13 clubs together exceeds $1.9bn - but individual buyers currently hold only $376m worth.  On average, clubs control 80% of their fan tokens' supply. ""Clubs themselves must balance not selling too much at once"" Mr Canellis said. ""If they sell too much at once, they run the risk of crashing the price.  ""We can clearly see this happening with the Lazio, FC Porto, Santos FC, and Manchester City sales."" Some fan groups are also worried about exploitation. ""My knowledge of the crypto market is sketchy to say the least - and I'm probably representative of a large number of run-of-the-mill football supporters who are not traders on the crypto market,"" Sue Watson, who chairs the West Ham United Supporters Trust, told the BBC News's Tech Tent podcast. ""It's not regulated, it's not secure and I question what protection clubs have in place for their supporters."" The Socios app has club-token information organised like other crypto marketplaces, with price fluctuations displayed and prominent buy and sell buttons. But Max Rabinovitch, from Socios, said the system was designed to reward fans who held on to tokens rather than trading them.  Offers such as ""permanent 5% discounts in the digital shop, possibilities to win tickets"" were more important to fans than making ""five or ten bucks"" selling their tokens, he said. ""There's no value to be had from trading,"" Mr Rabinovitch said. ""If you want to gather up loyalty points for a team, if you want to vote for the team, you always have that token to use.  ""The entire point is buy it and hold it.""  The benefits offered to token holders are decided by the clubs.  But Mr Rabinovitch said he wants clubs to offer more meaningful perks than votes on minor issues such as ""what song should we play in the stadium as the players walk out"".  Another way clubs are getting into crypto products is through NFTs or Non-fungible Tokens.  Manchester City, Rangers and Juventus have all issued official NFTs, with some spending tens of thousands on these unique digital images and videos with built in code representing owenrship.  One, millionaire NFT collector Mike Bousis, said he had spent about $40,000 on five of these. ""When I saw the release of Manchester City NFTs, I had to have it,"" Mr Bousis said.  ""I always liked Man City - I like the team, their flash and pizzazz - and I thought it was a cool thing to buy and to have.  ""I own it - it's mine, I can display it anywhere I like - and it's a piece of art."" The National Basketball Association (NBA), in the US, was one of the first sports organisations to sell NFTs, offering video clips of basketball games. But Protos research shows the value of these TopShot NFTs has dropped by 90% since early 2021. Companies such as Sorare are also offering collectable and playable football-player cards as NFTs These are increasing in popularity, with $142m spent by fans since their launch, in April 2019, Protos data shows. And sale prices have stayed steady all year. But football writer Martin Calladine said supporters should be cautious about investing in NFTs - and fan tokens. ""The thing about crypto-currency is it's unregulated,"" he said. ""It's the only product being endorsed in football which has no legal oversight. ""Don't buy into it because you sense that it could be a way of making money.  ""Some people are going to be making a lot of money out of it - but it almost certainly isn't going to be the average football fan on the street."""
currency fluctuations,Turbulence in economy class,2024-09-15,2019-09-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49824745,"It would be a small irony if, amid unprecedented political turbulence and incompetence, the UK government successfully repatriated 150,000 holiday-makers from the collapsed Thomas Cook travel firm, and without too much hassle. We're much more attuned to fiasco. And there's plenty that can go wrong in hiring a fleet of planes from scratch, and transporting up to 17,000 people per day. If Chris Grayling were still transport secretary, what would the chances be of him contracting an airline without any planes? Day one, and the joint effort with the travel industry had 95% of those who had been scheduled to come home actually doing so - even though some were landing at the wrong airport. Signs of that apparent initial success for Project Matterhorn quickly turned attention to the loss of 9,000 jobs in Britain, and more than that again overseas, whose work depended on Thomas Cook custom. It turned also to the cost for flight-only passengers of finding a ticket that could get them home, finding that prices were soaring. They can keep rising even as they search and decide. And of course, it turned to the pay and bonuses of senior executives while the travel company traversed turbulent times and eventually crashed. Well, here are a few thoughts, many of them contrarian in nature. You'd expect little else, right? On that executive pay, £8m in pay and bonuses for the chief executive over the past five years looks like the going rate for a company of this size. You might say the ""going rate"" is obscene. And compared with pay for cabin crew and others working unsociable hours, in cramped unhealthy aluminium tubes, and putting up with the rudeness of tanked-up British holiday-makers, then you'd have a point. It's neither my role nor inclination to defend executive pay, least of all in a company that's gone under.   But much of these bonuses are usually paid in shares, which executives are, usually, not allowed to cash in for several years after they've been ""earned"".  These long-term incentive plans are intended to encourage bosses to think, well, long-term. So if these millions in bonuses were tied up in Thomas Cook shares, then they're worthless now. On profiteering rivals, anyone who books an airline ticket online these days expects to find search engine software that digs out the lowest price and offers a wide range of choice.  That has worked pretty well for the customer. If you don't believe me, book a British rail ticket now: compare and contrast.  It's that same software that is causing prices to soar.  Surge pricing is a feature of airline, hotel and Uber booking.  If demand surges and supply falls, the algorithm kicks in and prices can go berserk. There may be means by which the algorithms' inflationary effect can be capped.  But according to Skyscanner, the Edinburgh air ticket search company that knows a thing or two about this end of the industry, such spikes tend to be short lived. Prices quickly adjust back down. Yes, they'll probably be higher than they were. But if a large chunk of capacity has just been taken out of the air, by an airline going bust, then the laws of supply and demand mean you'll be paying at least some more. And that brings us to the opportunity that comes form Thomas Cook's collapse.  It's clear that it had failed to adjust to changes in its marketplace, not least the move to online booking, and to personalised itineraries, with declining demand for conventional package holidays. One of its rivals, Tui, claims to have hedged against that, and against currency fluctuations that did so much damage to Thomas Cook, by vertically integrating. That is, it owns many of the hotels and cruise ships, rather than contracting with foreign-owned providers.  It still has to staff and fuel them in foreign currencies, and it faces headwinds from the Boeing 737 Max grounding and from Brexit uncertainty. But in a statement to reassure investors on Tuesday, Tui was keen to distance itself from the Thomas Cook way of doing things. Its share price rose. So did the market valuation of Jet2, Ryanair, and IAG, owner of British Airways. Why? Because of that opportunity. Thomas Cook's failure does not mean the British have stopped wanting to go on foreign holidays. Not only were 150,000 Thomas Cook customers overseas when the company went bust, but a million or so more were booked for future holidays. And while they may have lost deposits and worse, these people still want a holiday to look forward to. Many more will book closer to the next holiday season. So the airlines and other travel companies that can grab market share have a big opportunity.  You can safely bet they're hard at work on exploiting it. For airlines, the rebound may be subdued.  For the past couple of years, there has been over-capacity in the lower-cost segment of the European market. The departure of Thomas Cook relieves some of the pressure on Ryanair and its ilk. For those successful in grabbing market share in this people-intensive industry, they will need to recruit skilled travel industry workers, from cabin crew to booking agents to foreign hoteliers. It's clearly very tough to lose one's job. And the evidence we're seeing is that Thomas Cook had a dedicated workforce, who deserved better. But in a tight labour market, there are much worse circumstances in which to be forced into the search for a new job. Not every sector can be so confident. While some see the demise of Thomas Cook as a victim of Brexit, others see it as an early sign of the corporate clear-out that comes with an economic downturn. If so, others will follow in other sectors. The harsh, sometimes brutal Darwinism of the marketplace will take the weak, goes the orthodoxy. It will clear space for growth of the more nimble, innovative and lucky. It may also re-shape the job market for those whose skills are aligned and adaptable to the future demands of fast-changing technology."
currency fluctuations,Facebook won't rule out digital currency launch without US approval,2024-09-15,2019-07-23,By Dave Lee,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49092713,"Facebook is facing immense pressure from US regulators over its plans to launch a digital currency, Libra, in association with more than 20 partners including Visa, MasterCard and Uber. As well as co-creating the Libra currency, Facebook plans, on its own, to offer its own digital wallet, called Calibra. Like a physical wallet with cash, Calibra will store a users’ Libra, and make it possible to engage in transactions with other wallets. Libra has the potential, lawmakers say, to dramatically disrupt the global banking industry - a digital currency that can cross borders, without the wild price fluctuations and illegal connotations of Bitcoin and its ilk.  Which is why David Marcus, the Facebook executive of its currency project, was brought in front of two US congressional committees last week to answer concerns. “I want to be clear,” Mr Marcus said in his opening statement to US lawmakers. ""Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals."" But what exactly did that mean? A pledge not to launch anywhere without US approval, or just a pledge not to launch in the US? Almost a week later, it’s difficult to get a clear answer from Facebook about whether it feels it needs US lawmakers on board in order for Libra to go ahead.  Midway through last Wednesdays’ hearing, the second two hour-long session, I dropped the company a note seeking clarification.  “If the US doesn't give approval, but Facebook gets approval elsewhere in the world, will Libra’s launch go ahead in those places?” I asked. A spokeswoman replied, telling me: ""David [Marcus] committed that Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals. This is Facebook’s commitment. We will be offering Libra through Calibra. Calibra will only launch in jurisdictions in which we have approval to launch.” That didn’t quite answer the question on whether the Libra project would still go ahead if the US didn’t approve, or if Calibra - the part which Facebook will run on its own - would be available in other countries, if not the US. So I tried again. ""If the US is yet to approve Libra/Calibra, but country X does, will Facebook launch Calibra in country X?” The spokeswoman said she wouldn’t comment on a hypothetical scenario. Fine. I tried again. ""Is it Facebook’s position, today, that in the absence of US regulatory approval, it intends to launch Libra in other markets, subject to local regulators’ approval?” “Nothing more to share on this,” the spokeswoman said. It’s hard to stay out of the weeds on this one. Technically, Facebook isn’t in charge of the Libra Association, and so can’t be solely responsible for its actions. But when I tried to reach the other partners on the project to get their view, most directed me back. “Facebook is spearheading [leading],” said one rep from a payments company. “You need to talk to them.” Facebook’s spokeswoman confirmed to me that when Mr Marcus made his commitments to Congress, he was referring specifically to Calibra, the wallet, rather than the wider Libra currency. A spokeswoman for the Libra Association said on Tuesday it would only launch when it had ""addressed applicable regulatory issues and received appropriate approvals"". But that likely won’t be enough for US lawmakers concerned about the impact the project could have on the dollar. ""Mr Marcus was very clear that Facebook 'would not launch until all concerns are addressed' and I believe he is a man of his word,” senator Mark Warner, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in an email to BBC News. ""With Libra backed by the US dollar and dollar-denominated securities, its launch will have very real consequences - and poses very legitimate stability and soundness concerns - for the US, even if Facebook chose not to launch it in the US.  ""I appreciate Facebook engaging policymakers on this front and fully expect them to adhere to Mr Marcus’s commitment not to launch Libra - full stop - unless and until the concerns of regulators are addressed.” There could, however, be little the US can do - the Libra Association will be headquartered in Switzerland. On Tuesday, a Facebook spokeswoman reiterated the view that it would seek approval in the jurisdictions it operates. ""Engaging with regulators, policymakers, and experts is critical to Libra’s success,” the spokeswoman said. ""This was the whole reason that Facebook along with other members of the Libra Association shared our plans early. The time between now and launch is designed to be an open, collaborative process. We will take the time to get this right.” But, again, neither Facebook, nor a spokeswoman for the Libra Association itself, would be drawn on what would happen elsewhere if the US feels Libra should not go ahead.  _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

currency fluctuations,Brexit clash on impact of no-deal tariffs,2024-09-15,2020-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-55293187,"Scottish ministers have clashed on the impact of tariffs on goods introduced in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It comes after the UK government's Scotland Office minister David Duguid said tariffs would ""not necessarily be the end of the world"". However, the Scottish government's Europe Secretary Mike Russell described such a scenario as a ""disaster"". UK and EU leaders have agreed to continue Brexit talks in the hope of reaching a deal. However the prime minister has said that a no-deal outcome is ""very, very likely"". Speaking on the BBC's Politics Scotland programme, David Duguid said there would still be access to the EU market with no deal ""on Australia terms"". ""We talk about financial tariffs, we talk about non-tariff barriers, these are all the things we're trying to avoid with a free trade agreement. ""It doesn't stop exports, it doesn't stop trade. Nobody wants to have to experience tariff barriers if we don't have to. The effect of those tariffs are overstated."" When asked whether a no-deal Brexit could result in food shortages, as reported in the Sunday Times, Mr Duguid said there had been ""scaremongering"" around the issue. He said he would ""not guarantee anything hypothetical"" but there ""would not be the shortages reported"". ""You may not get the specific shape of pasta you like,"" he added. However, Mike Russell responded to the comments by saying any dismissal of the impact of tariffs was ""nonsense"". He said: ""Tariffs on lamb, for example - a big issue in Scotland - would be 60%. That's not currency fluctuation, that's disaster."" Mr Russell highlighted that the Scottish government had not been able to carry out a proposed expansion of the port at Stranraer in preparation for leaving the EU because the UK government would not agree to fund it. He said: ""All the arrangements we have made are to meet worst case scenario. The reality is we are doing everything we can to avoid disaster foisted upon us but we cannot do everything.  ""There should be a pause on this."" Asked whether the SNP would support a last-minute deal put before MPs at Westminster, Mr Russell said: ""We will look at what is put in front of any parliament"". He added: ""But I think it would be pretty unlikely that they would be bringing anything which we could do anything other than say 'this will be a disaster'. """
currency fluctuations,Why is the US dollar falling?,2024-09-15,2017-08-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40853840,"The US dollar, long a symbol of American economic might, has fallen steadily this year.  The value of the dollar index, which tracks the dollar against six major global currencies, has fallen about 10% since January.  It pushed lower on Friday, even as demand for other safe-haven assets - typically a category that includes the US dollar - rose amid sabre-rattling between the US and North Korea.  The dollar, which surged in 2014 as the US economy gained strength, is hardly in danger territory. The index is running just a bit lower than it was a year ago. But key US economic data was weaker last year. So what's behind this year's decline? In some ways, this is a good news story, driven by a better economy in Europe. The euro lost ground against the dollar in 2014, when central bankers adopted a stimulus program, while the US started to move away from stimulus policies. Now, as the Eurozone economy improves and the European Central Bank eyes an end to the stimulus, the currencies are starting to move closer together. The election of pro-EU Emmanuel Macron in France in June contributed to confidence in the Euro. The Euro's gain is the dollar's loss. A Euro is now worth more than $1.17, up more than 10 cents since the end of last year. But this isn't just a European story. The dollar has lost ground against many other currencies, including the Japanese Yen, the Mexican peso and the Swedish Krona. Even the British pound, which plunged after the Brexit vote, has regained some of its power against the dollar in recent months. (It's now valued at about $1.30, up from $1.22 in March.) ""This type of broad based decline shows you that it's really people moving away from the dollar, rather than just moving towards these other currencies,"" says Sameer Samana, a global quantitative and technical strategist at Wells Fargo based in St. Louis, Missouri. One reason? Donald Trump. Analysts trace the dollar's surge in the final months of 2016 to his win, which fuelled expectations of tax cuts or infrastructure investment - spending expected to drive demand for the dollar. Now they say the retreat shows traders recalculating, as Mr Trump's economic agenda stalls. An ongoing investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign has cast a shadow over his administration. And alarm over Mr Trump's erratic statements and foreign policy clashes - including with North Korea this week - has also increased. ""If people feel like there's greater political uncertainty ... they kind of vote with their dollar,"" says Mr Samana says.  Rising interest rates are traditionally linked to stronger currencies, since higher rates attract investment. The US central bank has raised interest rates four times since December 2015, and conventional wisdom calls for another in December. But Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said recently that even supposing future hikes, interest rates are likely to remain historically low for some time. The steady ascent of Janet Yellen IMF cuts forecasts for US economic growth US markets are rising - so why are some people worried? Her caution in part reflects American economic growth that remains humdrum, with inflation and wage growth lagging.  ""What's going on now is an expectation that the Fed will continue to be relatively loose in its monetary policy, while the [European Central Bank] starts to tighten,"" says Jeffry Frieden, a professor of government at Harvard University and the author of ""Currency Politics"". ""That is roughly analogous to saying there are expectations that the US will not grow as rapidly as anticipated."" It's tough to know where the dollar is headed next, since at the moment it's neither strongly over- or under-valued, says Jeffrey Frankel, a professor of economics at the Harvard Kennedy School.  Richard Marston, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, says he doesn't read too much into the decline, pointing to US stocks over the same period, which soared to new records. ""It's not a question of confidence in the US and the US government because that would also affect the equity markets,"" he says.  But Mr Frieden says he thinks there is a risk of a free-fall, given disarray in Washington and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve. Ms Yellen's term ends in February and it's not clear whom Mr Trump will name to replace her. ""If [the dollar] started really declining in a continual way that seems not to be just random or small fluctuations ... that would indicate a real loss of confidence in the US economy, a real loss of confidence in the US government,"" says Mr Frieden.  ""That would be a very bad thing and that would be something that the government had to respond to."" Mr Frankel says he used to predict the dollar would lose its status as an international currency, because of rising national debt and other factors. But that forecast was confounded when investors flocked to the dollar during the economic turmoil of 2008 - even though America was the source of many of the problems. ""I finally stopped making that prediction and I'm not ready to switch back,"" he says. ""I think the dollar is still - in some ways even more so - the number one international currency."" Mr Trump isn't worried either.  In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mr Trump said he liked a dollar that's ""not too strong"". ""Frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar,"" he said. As an official presidential position, it was a radical statement, since for US consumers - who buy a lot from overseas - a weaker dollar means reduced spending power. The same is true for US manufacturers who rely on parts produced abroad. ""The weaker the dollar is, the poorer Americans are on average,"" says Mr Frieden. ""That's not just rhetoric. That's the reality."" But Mr Trump's pro-business administration has focused on reinvigorating US manufacturing and exports, which become cheaper and therefore more competitive globally if the dollar weakens. US firms with global operations also get a boost to their bottom line, as the business overseas becomes more valuable. (That effect contributed to the stock market's rise this year.) Eventually, economic theory predicts a cycle, as more expensive foreign goods increase prices and inflation in the US, prompting the Fed to raise rates - which ultimately boosts the dollar.  ""As a tourist, of course I want the dollar to be as strong as possible,"" says Mr Marston. ""As someone who watches the American economy, it's good news."""
currency fluctuations,Scottish exporters cautious over fall in the pound,2024-09-15,2022-09-27,By Magnus Bennett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63038136,"This week's dramatic fall in the value of the pound might seem to be a boon for Scotland's exporters, so why are many firms reacting cautiously to the news? Leonard Russell describes the record low hit by the pound against the dollar on Monday as ""disturbing"". He ought to be delighted at sterling's relative weakness against the dollar and the euro because his company, Broxburn-based Ian Macleod Distillers, exports spirits such as Glengoyne, Tamdhu and Edinburgh Gin around the world. But his response is rather muted. ""Obviously the weak pound will be good for exports and, as somebody in the whisky and gin market, that is welcome,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. ""The low value of the pound is going to help exports and will help us absorb some of the very large cost-inflationary pressures we are about to suffer from, particularly energy.""  But Mr Russell says his company will have to put its prices up to cover increased costs. ""We are paying people more because of inflation, so our labour costs are going up and our energy costs are going up,"" he explains.  ""Malted barley is made by germinating barley, so there's quite a large energy input into the cost of our barley, which is also going to increase.  ""That means we will have to increase our prices for exports, but then the weakness of the pound will negate that for some of our customers overseas.  ""I don't know how much we are going to have to put prices up by because we haven't got a proper cost for energy next year."" The Scotch Whisky Association, which found that exports of whisky grew by 19%, to £4.5bn, in 2021, is also taking a cautious approach to the weak pound. The industry body argues that it ""looks at the pressures facing the economy in the round, not just through the lens of the current currency fluctuation"".  A spokesman adds: ""The pound is only one part of the story, with the industry facing increasing energy, supply chain and distribution costs.  ""A recent survey of the industry found that 57% of distillers have seen energy costs increase by more than 10% in the last year, with nearly a third (29%) seeing their energy costs double.  ""Nearly 40% of businesses reported shipping costs doubling in the last 12 months, with 43% also reporting supply chain cost rises of more than 50%.""  Gary Wilkinson, whose Dunfermline-based company Wilkinson Golf offers foreign visitors golf tours around the UK and Ireland, tells BBC Radio Scotland that ""on balance"", the stronger dollar is good for business - given that many of his clients are based in the US. ""I think it is a positive message that it is great value to travel to Scotland.  ""I think we have got a chance to try and attract more business that wouldn't normally come. There will be more inquiries from America and it is down to us to convert these into bookings.  ""However, the net effect is much the same - what the Americans are saving in the exchange rate is offset really by the amount of increase in input prices across the board - the prices we pay for golf courses, for hotel accommodation, car rental and so on."" Meanwhile, Scottish Engineering chief executive Paul Sheerin says there is ""more caution than optimism"" in his industry over the tumbling pound. He points out that many firms will have concerns about substantial rising input costs, particularly where materials are derived from petrochemicals such as plastics and coatings, or where market rates for imported items used for manufacturing are often set in dollars, such as steels and alloys. ""There are also many Scottish companies who won't benefit from the weakness in the pound because they manufacture products here, which are then passed on to other parties in the UK before being exported,"" he says. Mairi Spowage, director of the Fraser of Allander economic institute, adds: ""Given the pound has been devalued against the euro and the dollar, it will make our goods and services seem cheaper by comparison abroad.  ""But you have to remember that a lot of the things that go into goods produced for export has been imported, so it can make it more expensive for exporters to produce."""
currency fluctuations,Stock markets and pound rise ahead of Brexit deal,2024-09-15,2020-12-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55433657,"UK stock markets have closed for the Christmas break in an upbeat mood. The FTSE 250 jumped 1.15% to 20,531, hours before the Brexit trade deal with the EU was announced. But the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up just 0.01% at 6,502 as traders waited for confirmation of the deal to emerge. Market positivity will give a seasonal boost to investors, including the millions who have a financial stake in stock markets through their pensions. The pound was up, showing a gain of about 0.7% against the dollar to touch $1.36 before falling back slightly. It also gained 0.5% against the euro, rising to €1.1136. Across Europe, shares were also on the rise, although the key Frankfurt stock market was closed. Asian markets closed positively with Japan's Nikkei gaining 0.54%, while markets in Australia, South Korea and Singapore also saw modest rises. Sterling has always been the most reliable of Brexit trade deal sentiment - the pound rose against the US dollar yesterday and continued that rise this morning.  It started the week worth $1.34, dropped to $1.32 as hopes of a deal faded, and this morning climbed to $1.36.  The stock market reaction today has been muted - the FTSE 100 was barely changed this morning, but much of the reaction to the looming deal took place yesterday.  The FTSE 250, a stock market index that is regarded as more representative of the UK economy, climbed nearly 2% on Wednesday.  Lloyds Bank, which investors have come to see as a bellwether of sentiment towards a trade deal, rose 7% yesterday and another 6% this morning. An agreement on fishing rights has been the main stumbling block of the trade talks as an end-of-year deadline looms. The pound has seen plenty of volatility in recent weeks as negotiations between UK and European ministers have stalled and deadlines missed. Last week, it had hit a two-year high above $1.36. The British currency had surged almost 1% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak in what has been a roller-coaster ride. ""Sentiment improved after headlines started appearing that the United Kingdom and European Union have finally reached a provisional Brexit trade agreement."" said Jeffrey Halley at foreign exchange firm Oanda. If your reaction to ""market movements"" is that you are not directly affected because you do not invest money, think again. You are likely to be one of the millions of people with a pension - either privately or through work - who have their savings invested by pension schemes. As much as £600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest their money to help it grow. But that means the value of your savings pot is influenced by the performance of the investments. So rises or falls in shares can affect your pension and effectively your savings, which is why you are affected by major market movements. However, it's worth bearing in mind that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet, so short-term market fluctuations are not something to panic about. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.  ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term,"" she adds. ""It's important to bear in mind that investors have lived through major ups and downs in the past and come out the other side."""
currency fluctuations,Reality Check: Has Iran's economy benefited from the nuclear deal?,2024-09-15,2018-05-03,By Amir Paivar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43975498,"The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers - the US, Russia, China, the UK, France and Germany - lifted international sanctions on Iran's economy, including those on oil, trade and banking sectors.  In exchange, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to abandon the agreement and will make a decision on 12 May about whether to reintroduce sanctions from his country.  So, as that deadline draws nearer, Reality Check examines how Iran's economy has fared since the nuclear accord came into effect. Iran's economy was in a deep recession in the years before the nuclear agreement. But the International Monetary Fund reported that the real GDP of Iran grew 12.5% in the first year following the implementation of the deal.  Growth has fallen since then, and the IMF estimates the economy will grow at 4% this year, which is healthy but below the 8% target Iran had for the five years following the deal.  That initial boost was almost all thanks to the hike in oil exports.  Sanctions on Iran's energy sector halved the country's oil exports, to around 1.1 million barrels per day in 2013. Now Iran exports almost 2.5 million barrels daily. Iran's non-oil exports in the year to March 2018 reached $47bn (£34.5bn) which is almost $5bn more than the year before the nuclear agreement. According to Iran's ministry of agriculture, the export of ""signature items"" such as pistachio nuts stood at $1.1bn in the same period, slightly lower than the previous year.  But Iran's agricultural exports, including pistachios and saffron, are more affected by the country's drought, rather than sanctions or trade relations.  Following the nuclear agreement, the US lifted a ban on Iranian luxury items such as carpets and caviar. Sanctions cut exports of Iranian carpets to the US - its biggest market - by 30% . Iran's trade with the European Union has increased significantly thanks to the lifting of sanctions but China, South Korea and Turkey remain Iran's top three trading partners. In 2012, the rial lost almost two-thirds of its value against the dollar because of sanctions and domestic mismanagement of the currency market. The sanctions limited Iran's oil revenues and its access to the global banking system. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani promised the nation that following the nuclear deal ""you will not see the exchange rate go up every hour"".  Mr Rouhani managed to deliver on that promise by keeping the Iranian currency stable for almost four years. But in late 2017, when President Trump refused to certify the nuclear deal to Congress, the rial started to fall again. The rial has lost almost half of its value against the dollar since last September. Many Iranians have been buying hard foreign currency to hedge against the possible future collapse of the nuclear deal, the return of sanctions and a fresh currency crash.  It was reported that some $30bn of capital left Iran in the first quarter of 2018, mostly to neighbouring countries and the Caucasus.   The Iranian government has since launched a crackdown on the foreign exchange market, banning exchange offices from selling hard currency and introducing limits (at $12,000) on cash possession - all in a bid to rescue the rial.  Analysis by BBC Persian of figures from the Central Bank of Iran shows that household budgets (the value of all the goods and services used by a household) have fallen in real terms from $14,800 in 2007-08 to $12,515 in 2016-17. Household budgets declined steadily for seven years until 2014-15 when the nuclear deal was struck and increased slightly the following year. The analysis also shows that Iran's middle class has been hit the hardest in the past decade. While the average household budget has fallen 15%, the figure is 20% for middle-class families. Experts blame a combination of domestic mismanagement of the economy and international sanctions for the fall in household budgets. Most of the post-nuclear deal boom came from increased oil revenues that go directly into the government coffers and that takes time to trickle down into people's pockets.

currency fluctuations,EU aid pledge to cover 'no deal' Brexit,2024-09-15,2018-08-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-45022029,"Fears Wales could lose millions of pounds of aid under a ""no deal"" Brexit have been reduced by UK ministers extending a pledge on the cash, the public spending watchdog has said. The Treasury has promised to underwrite the ""structural funds"" until the end of the 2014-20 EU budget period. The previous guarantee only applied to schemes signed-off when Brexit is due to take place in March 2019. The Wales Audit Office (WAO) said that could have put some schemes at risk. Wales currently qualifies for £2.1bn of aid to boost economic performance, infrastructure such as roads and the skills of the population.  The WAO report, Managing the impact of Brexit on EU Structural Funds, said Wales had stood to lose £21m for every 1% of the cash not committed before Brexit. Assistant Auditor General Anthony Barrett said there were still ""matters of detail to resolve"" but ""the risk of Wales losing out on EU funding in a no deal scenario has been reduced with the UK government deciding recently to extend its guarantee"". Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams, a member of the Commons Brexit select committee, called the move ""the very least the British Government must do to mitigate the uncertainty Welsh sectors are facing"" as ""no deal is not and never will be a viable option"". ""It is high time the prime minister stopped pandering to the right-wing of her Tory party and ruled it out completely,"" he said. The WAO calls on the Welsh Government, and its department managing EU aid, the Wales European Funding Office (WEFO) to focus on issues including how best to use the expertise WEFO has built up in the future. The report also says Wales could receive £132m more EU cash than had been expected, because of a drop in the value of the pound in relation to the Euro at the start of the funding period. Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones warned last December it would be unacceptable if EU aid is replaced by a Westminster-run system after Brexit. UK ministers are working on a shared prosperity fund to replace the EU funds."
currency fluctuations,Africa's richest woman 'ripped off her country',2024-09-15,2020-01-19,By BBC Panorama,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51128950,"Leaked documents reveal how Africa's richest woman made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and corruption. Isabel dos Santos got access to lucrative deals involving land, oil, diamonds and telecoms when her father was president of Angola, a southern African country rich in natural resources. The documents show how she and her husband were allowed to buy valuable state assets in a series of suspicious deals. Ms Dos Santos says the allegations against her are entirely false and that there is a politically motivated witch-hunt by the Angolan government. The former president's daughter has made the UK her home and owns expensive properties in central London. She is already under criminal investigation by the authorities in Angola for corruption and her assets in the country have been frozen. Now BBC Panorama has been given access to more than 700,000 leaked documents about the billionaire's business empire. Most were obtained by the Platform to Protect Whistle-blowers in Africa and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). They've been investigated by 37 media organisations including the Guardian and Portugal's Expresso newspaper. Andrew Feinstein, the head of Corruption Watch, says the documents show how Ms Dos Santos exploited her country at the expense of ordinary Angolans. ""Every time she appears on the cover of some glossy magazine somewhere in the world, every time that she hosts one of her glamorous parties in the south of France, she is doing so by trampling on the aspirations of the citizens of Angola."" The ICIJ have called the documents the Luanda Leaks. One of the most suspicious deals was run from London through a UK subsidiary of the Angolan state oil company Sonangol. Ms Dos Santos had been put in charge of the struggling Sonangol in 2016, thanks to a presidential decree from her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who kept a tight grip on his country for the 38 years he was in power. But when he retired as president in September 2017 her position was soon under threat, even though his hand-picked successor came from the same party. Ms Dos Santos was sacked two months later. Many Angolans have been surprised at the way that President João Lourenço has gone after the business interests of his predecessor's family. The leaked documents show that as she left Sonangol, Ms Dos Santos approved $58m of suspicious payments to a consultancy company in Dubai called Matter Business Solutions. She says she has no financial interest in Matter, but the leaked documents reveal it was run by her business manager and owned by a friend. Panorama understands that Matter sent more than 50 invoices to Sonangol in London on the day that she was fired. Ms Dos Santos appears to have approved payments to her friend's company after she was sacked. Although some consultancy work had been carried out by Matter, there's very little detail on the invoices to justify such large bills.  One asks for €472,196 for unspecified expenses - another asks for $928,517 for unspecified legal services. Two of the invoices - each for €676,339.97  - are for exactly the same work on the same date and Ms Dos Santos signed them both off anyway. Lawyers for Matter Business Solutions say it was brought in to help restructure the oil industry in Angola, and that the invoices were for work that had already been carried out by other consultancy companies it had hired.  ""Regarding the invoices related with expenses, it is common for consultancy companies to add expenses to invoices as a general item. This is often due to those expenses involving large amounts of paperwork... Matter can produce documentary evidence to confirm all expenses incurred."" Ms Dos Santos's lawyers said her actions with regard to the Matter payments were entirely lawful and that she had not authorised payments after she had been dismissed from Sonangol. They said: ""All invoices paid were in relation to services contracted and agreed between the two parties, under a contract that was approved with the full knowledge and approval of the Sonangol Board of Directors."" The ICIJ and Panorama have also uncovered new details about the business deals that made Ms Dos Santos rich. Much of her fortune is based on her ownership of a stake in the Portuguese energy company Galp, which one of her companies bought from Sonangol in 2006.  The documents show it only had to pay 15% of the price upfront and that the remaining €63m ($70m) was turned into a low-interest loan from Sonangol. Under the generous terms of the loan, her debt to the Angolan people didn't have to be repaid for 11 years. Her stake in Galp is now worth more than €750m. Ms Dos Santos's company did offer to repay the Sonangol loan in 2017. The repayment offer should have been rejected because it didn't include almost €9m of interest owing.  But Ms Dos Santos was in charge of Sonangol at the time and she accepted the money as full payment of her own debt. She was fired six days later and the payment was returned by the new Sonangol management. Ms Dos Santos says she initiated the purchase of the stake in Galp, and that Sonangol made money from the deal as well. ""There's absolutely no wrongdoing in any of those transactions. This investment is the investment that in history has generated the most benefit for the national oil company and all the contracts that were drafted are perfectly legal contracts, there are no wrongdoings.""  Her lawyers say the repayment offer in 2017 covered what Sonangol had indicated was owed. It's a similar story in the diamond industry. Ms Dos Santos's husband, Sindika Dokolo, signed a one-sided agreement in 2012 with Angolan state diamond company Sodiam. They were supposed to be 50-50 partners in a deal to buy a stake in the Swiss luxury jeweller De Grisogono. But it was funded by the state company. The documents show that 18 months after the deal, Sodiam had put $79m into the partnership, while Mr Dokolo had only invested $4m. Sodiam also awarded him a €5m success fee for brokering the deal, so he didn't have to use any of his own money. The diamond deal gets even worse for the Angolan people. The documents reveal how Sodiam borrowed all the cash from a private bank in which Ms Dos Santos is the biggest shareholder. Sodiam has to pay 9% interest and the loan was guaranteed by a presidential decree from her father, so Ms Dos Santos's bank cannot lose out. Bravo da Rosa, the new chief executive of Sodiam, told Panorama that the Angolan people hadn't got a single dollar back from the deal: ""In the end, when we have finished paying back this loan, Sodiam will have lost more than $200m."" The former president also gave Ms Dos Santos's husband the right to buy some of Angola's raw diamonds. Source: Forbes magazine and others Read more: Africa's richest woman eyes Angolan presidency The Angolan government says the diamonds were sold at a knockdown price and sources have told Panorama that almost $1bn may have been lost.  Ms Dos Santos told the BBC she couldn't comment because she was not a shareholder of De Grisogono. But the leaked documents show that she is described as a shareholder of De Grisogono by her own financial advisers. Mr Dokolo did put in some money later. His lawyers say he invested $115m and that the takeover of De Grisogono was his idea. They say his company paid above the market rate for the raw diamonds. The leaked documents also reveal how Ms Dos Santos bought land from the state in September 2017. Once again she only had to pay a small up-front fee. Her company bought a square kilometre of prime beachfront land in the capital Luanda with the help of presidential decrees signed by her father. The contract says the land was worth $96m, but the documents show her company paid only 5% of that after agreeing to invest the rest in the development. Panorama traced some of the ordinary Angolans who were evicted to make way for the Futungo development. They've been moved from the Luandan seafront to an isolated housing development 30 miles (50km) from the capital. Teresa Vissapa lost her business to Ms Dos Santos' development and is now struggling to bring up her seven children. She said: ""I only ask God to make her think a little more about our situation. Maybe she doesn't even know it, but we are suffering."" Ms Dos Santos declined to comment on the Futungo development. But it was not the only land deal involving Ms Dos Santos that displaced the local population. About 500 families were evicted from another stretch of the Luandan seafront after Isabel dos Santos got involved in another major redevelopment project. The families are now living in desperate conditions next to an open sewer. Some of their shacks are flooded with sewage whenever the tide rises. Ms Dos Santos says there weren't any evictions linked to her project and that her companies were never paid because the development was cancelled.  The billionaire has also made big profits from the telecoms industry in Angola. She acquired a 25% stake in the country's biggest mobile phone provider, Unitel. It was granted a telecoms licence by her father in 1999 and she bought her stake the following year from a high ranking government official. Unitel has already paid her $1bn in dividends and her stake is worth another $1bn. But that's not the only way she got cash from the private company. She arranged for Unitel to lend €350m to a new company she set up, called Unitel International Holdings. The company name was misleading because it wasn't connected to Unitel and Ms Dos Santos was the owner.  The documents show Ms Dos Santos signed off on the loans as both lender and borrower, which is a blatant conflict of interest. Ms Dos Santos denied that the loans were corrupt. She said: ""This loan had both directors' approval and shareholders' approval, and it's a loan that will generate, and has generated, benefit for Unitel."" Her lawyers say the loans protected Unitel from currency fluctuations. Most of the companies involved in the dodgy deals were overseen by accountants working for the financial services company, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC). It's made millions providing auditing, consultancy and tax advice to her companies.  But PWC has terminated its relationship with the billionaire and her family, after Panorama questioned the way the company had assisted Ms Dos Santos in the deals that had made her rich. PWC says it is holding an inquiry into the ""very serious and concerning allegations"". Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, told Panorama that PWC had given legitimacy to Ms Dos Santos and her companies. ""PWC, if not facilitating the corruption, are providing a veneer of respectability that makes what's happening acceptable or more acceptable than it might otherwise be. ""So if I was at PWC I'd be conducting a pretty thorough audit of what decisions were made, and in hindsight actually: 'Did we make the wrong decision to accept this business and should we have reported what we had been presented with?'"" PWC says it strives to maintain the highest professional standards and has set expectations for consistent ethical behaviour across its global network. ""In response to the very serious and concerning allegations that have been raised, we immediately initiated an investigation and are working to thoroughly evaluate the facts and conclude our inquiry.   ""We will not hesitate to take appropriate actions to ensure that we always stand for the very highest standards of behaviour, wherever we operate in the world.""

currency fluctuations,China's central bank raises rates,2024-09-15,2017-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42348260,"China's central bank has followed the US Federal Reserve by raising interest rates, in a move that has surprised economists. The People's Bank of China lifted its 7-day and 28-day reverse repurchase agreements by 5 basis points. This essentially represents a modest rise to borrowing costs and is the first rate hike since March.  Beijing is attempting to limit the flow of capital out of the country without harming economic growth.  In addition to short-term borrowing rates, China also increased rates on its one-year medium-term lending facility by 5 basis points. China described the move as a ""normal market reaction"" to steps taken by the Federal Reserve. The US central bank raised rates by 0.25% on Wednesday, its third rate rise this year.  The Fed said the move, which was widely expected, underscored ""solid"" gains in the US economy. The decision to raise the cost of borrowing takes the Fed farther away from the ultra-low rates it put in place during the financial crisis to boost economic activity. Against that backdrop, China is attempting to limit capital flowing out of the country in search of stronger returns.  But Bank of Communications analyst Chen Ji told Reuters the rate raise was too small to have much meaningful impact.  ""(It) doesn't really impact borrowing costs, and fluctuations of this level are very normal in the interbank market,"" he said. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also raised its base rate after the US hike. Hong Kong tracks Fed rate moves because its currency is pegged to the US dollar."
currency fluctuations,Many UK banks stop sale of Qatari riyals,2024-09-15,2017-06-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40454386,"A number of UK High Street banks have stopped trading in Qatari riyals. Individual customers at Barclays, RBS, Lloyds Banking Group and Tesco Bank cannot currently buy or sell riyals. Qatar is isolated by its neighbours, who accuse it of backing terrorism. Its central bank says it will guarantee all transactions for customers inside and outside the country. It also told the Reuters news agency that all banks and foreign exchange companies are committed to trading riyals as usual. In early June, Qatar's Gulf neighbours Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt ceased air, sea and land links with the country, which has been accused of funding terrorism. Qatar denies the claim.  The cutting of diplomatic ties by Qatar's neighbours has prompted wide fluctuations in the value of the country's currency. A spokeswoman for Barclays said: ""In common with other banks, Barclays' high street foreign exchange service is supplied by a third party, which has stopped providing the Qatari riyal. ""Unfortunately, we are therefore currently unable to buy the Riyal from or sell it to our retail customers."" A spokeswoman for Lloyds Banking Group also said that a ""third-party supplier"" which carries out its foreign exchange service had ceased trading Qatar riyals from 21 June.  She said: ""This currency is no longer available for sale or buy-back across our high street banks including Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and Halifax."" HSBC was unavailable for comment on its current position. Reuters reported that the Post Office had stopped buying and selling the currency earlier this month.  Currency supplier Travelex said trading in riyals had been suspended in some markets due to ""business challenges"". But it added: ""Travelex is pleased to announce it has resumed purchasing Qatar riyal globally."""
currency fluctuations,You say you want a resolution...?,2024-09-15,2019-01-02,By Jamie Robertson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46522608,"New Year's Resolutions are, like rules, meant to be broken. Last year, about one in five people came up with some sort of resolve on 1 January, according to a poll by YouGov. However, separately it has also been claimed that most of us will have given up on them by 10 January. While most of those may be along the lines of ""I will never, ever mix Moscow Mules and Old Freebottom's Black Ale again"", many will actually be concerned with work and how we spend our money. So before we take the plunge, let's have a look at the options, starting with the most drastic. If you're miserable and you hate the people you work with, then the answer's probably yes.  In fact there's never been a better time to look for something new. There are more job vacancies around than there have been at any time this century, 2.8 for every 100 jobs in existence, and unemployment is the lowest it's been in percentage terms since 1975. Justin Urquhart-Stewart is the co-founder of Seven Investment Management and regularly tours schools and universities advising on personal finance and careers in the financial services. He has this advice: ""Polish up your CV. As well as qualifications and business experience put in any work you do in the community. Businesses are increasingly having to report on their corporate social responsibility and if you do things like helping out in your local school, that's a point in your favour."" Coincidentally, the new year could be the moment to ask for a pay rise.  Corinne Mills, managing director at Personal Career Management, says you need to time a request for a raise around three or four months before the end of your employer's financial year.  ""That way,"" she says, ""they can budget it in to the next year. If you do it too late even if they want to give you the money they simply may not be able to. ""The other thing is to know your market rate. Go online and type in 'Salary Guide' and look at how much you are meant to be paid. Or look at adverts for similar positions or talk to a head hunter. ""The third thing to remember is you must have a proper conversation about this and draw up a list of all your achievements from the last year. Don't just tag it on to a meeting or do it in a chance encounter. Have a longer conversation about your career development, and let them know that you are committed."" Almost certainly yes. Mr Urquhart-Stewart says: ""The only way to save is to do it immediately after your pay cheque comes in. That way you can't get your hands on it and spend it on the shopping. So set up a direct debit on payday. Put it into a tax wrapper like an Isa (individual savings account), so the income and the growth are tax-free."" The returns on savings at the moment are less than breathtaking. The best instant access account currently on the market, according to Moneysupermarket.com is Marcus, a retail bank owned by Goldman Sachs which is offering an interest rate of 1.5%.  The stock market has been even worse. If you had put money in the FTSE 100 index of top shares at the beginning of last year and reinvested the income from the dividends, by mid-December you would have lost 7.5%. But Mr Urquhart-Stewart says: ""You have to invest for the long term. If your granny had given you £100 when you were a child, and you had put it into the stock market, 70 years later with all the income reinvested it would be worth £190,000."" Probably. It has been estimated that people touch their phones 2,617 times a day. So it's not hard to see how this may be a problem at work, and probably at home too.  Ms Mills says it's her personal resolution to cut down the time she spends on social media: ""It's so addictive. You can find yourself losing time at work and also it can be very emotional, getting yourself worked up with what's online, so it's not good for your general wellbeing."" There are (ironically) apps that can help you. Moment is an app that claims it can help people ""gain an hour back each day by following simple strategies designed to help them re-imagine their relationship with their phone"". AppDetox gets you to lock your apps, and then pesters you with annoying reminders when you break the locks, while Forest ties phone abstinence into a commitment to plant trees both virtual and real. If you don't like gyms, definitely not. You won't keep it up and you'll waste your money. The easiest way to start feeling marginally more healthy is on your way to the office. Get off the bus or underground, out of your car and walk or cycle. Once you're there, see if you can stand at your desk, rather than sit, and if you're really ambitious get a treadmill desk so you can walk as you work.  But there's more to fitness than developing a six-pack, as Ms Mills explains: ""There is a new emphasis at work on wellbeing and mental health, so it's not just about gym membership but doing things to improve your mental state: walking, yoga, meditation or even joining a choir."" Definitely. The law allows you 5.6 weeks holiday (including bank holidays) a year but we seem to be reluctant to use it all. A British Airways survey found more than half of the working population don't use all their holiday allowance, and more than a third of UK workers are afraid to take a two-week holiday in case their colleagues think they're a bit of a skiver. ""There are times in your life when work can be so engaging and exciting you do miss holidays,"" says Ms Mills. ""But is it healthy? Of course it isn't. You need more. You need a personal life and time off. Again, it's to do with wellbeing."" On a more practical note, Mr Urquhart-Stewart says: ""Book the time off before anyone else, and put the holiday money aside early.  ""The other golden rule of holidays is the week you decide to go abroad the pound will decide to crash. So buy some foreign exchange early in the new year and then regularly over the following months. That way you smooth out the currency fluctuations."""
currency fluctuations,Walmart rises despite Flipkart hit,2024-09-15,2018-10-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45881961,"Walmart is asking Wall Street to wait for profit growth as it battles to retain its place as the world's largest retailer. The US discount chain has been buying up smaller companies, investing in India and spending on new technology. But the investments come at a cost. On Tuesday, the firm warned that profits per share would decline slightly next year, largely because of losses at its Indian e-commerce unit Flipkart. Despite the caution, the firm's shares rose by nearly 2%, offering a vote of confidence in Walmart's efforts to remake its business. Executives outlined plans to investors at an annual meeting on Tuesday. They said they were looking at everything from introducing more robots to cut costs to expanding revenue by monetising customer data. In its stores, Walmart is expanding offerings in categories with strong sales, such as wine and toys. Online, executives said they wanted to improve services such as same-day delivery and increase the number of products available. ""I like the direction we're heading, but it's not going to happen overnight,"" said Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart's US e-commerce unit. Walmart has already been on a shopping spree, purchasing online shopping site Jet.com, as well as brands such as Bonobos and Bare Necessities to strengthen its digital muscle. It spent $16bn (£12.1bn) this year to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce company. Executives said they believed that Flipkart will turn profitable eventually, but conceded that the investment, as well as others it is making, would be costly in the short-term. ""We want to be positioned to have a business that's large and growing for the long term,"" said chief executive Doug McMillon.  ""I'm trying to balance short-term and long-term but if you force me to choose, I'd lean long-term."" The firm expects sales to increase by at least 3% in its next financial year, excluding fluctuations due to currency changes. In the US, the firm expects sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, helped by a 35% surge in online shopping. However, profits are expected to decline in the low single digits. The firm's estimate includes Flipkart, but not other changes, such as tax rates. Executives said a healthy US economy had helped power sales, but they were preparing for the possibility that consumers will pull back. The firm is also facing rising labour and delivery costs, as well as new US tariffs on Chinese imports. Executives said the firm was committed to remaining the ""low price leader"" and had been in intense talks with suppliers in an effort to avoid raising prices."
currency fluctuations,Scottish exporters cautious over fall in the pound,2024-09-15,2022-09-27,By Magnus Bennett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63038136,"This week's dramatic fall in the value of the pound might seem to be a boon for Scotland's exporters, so why are many firms reacting cautiously to the news? Leonard Russell describes the record low hit by the pound against the dollar on Monday as ""disturbing"". He ought to be delighted at sterling's relative weakness against the dollar and the euro because his company, Broxburn-based Ian Macleod Distillers, exports spirits such as Glengoyne, Tamdhu and Edinburgh Gin around the world. But his response is rather muted. ""Obviously the weak pound will be good for exports and, as somebody in the whisky and gin market, that is welcome,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. ""The low value of the pound is going to help exports and will help us absorb some of the very large cost-inflationary pressures we are about to suffer from, particularly energy.""  But Mr Russell says his company will have to put its prices up to cover increased costs. ""We are paying people more because of inflation, so our labour costs are going up and our energy costs are going up,"" he explains.  ""Malted barley is made by germinating barley, so there's quite a large energy input into the cost of our barley, which is also going to increase.  ""That means we will have to increase our prices for exports, but then the weakness of the pound will negate that for some of our customers overseas.  ""I don't know how much we are going to have to put prices up by because we haven't got a proper cost for energy next year."" The Scotch Whisky Association, which found that exports of whisky grew by 19%, to £4.5bn, in 2021, is also taking a cautious approach to the weak pound. The industry body argues that it ""looks at the pressures facing the economy in the round, not just through the lens of the current currency fluctuation"".  A spokesman adds: ""The pound is only one part of the story, with the industry facing increasing energy, supply chain and distribution costs.  ""A recent survey of the industry found that 57% of distillers have seen energy costs increase by more than 10% in the last year, with nearly a third (29%) seeing their energy costs double.  ""Nearly 40% of businesses reported shipping costs doubling in the last 12 months, with 43% also reporting supply chain cost rises of more than 50%.""  Gary Wilkinson, whose Dunfermline-based company Wilkinson Golf offers foreign visitors golf tours around the UK and Ireland, tells BBC Radio Scotland that ""on balance"", the stronger dollar is good for business - given that many of his clients are based in the US. ""I think it is a positive message that it is great value to travel to Scotland.  ""I think we have got a chance to try and attract more business that wouldn't normally come. There will be more inquiries from America and it is down to us to convert these into bookings.  ""However, the net effect is much the same - what the Americans are saving in the exchange rate is offset really by the amount of increase in input prices across the board - the prices we pay for golf courses, for hotel accommodation, car rental and so on."" Meanwhile, Scottish Engineering chief executive Paul Sheerin says there is ""more caution than optimism"" in his industry over the tumbling pound. He points out that many firms will have concerns about substantial rising input costs, particularly where materials are derived from petrochemicals such as plastics and coatings, or where market rates for imported items used for manufacturing are often set in dollars, such as steels and alloys. ""There are also many Scottish companies who won't benefit from the weakness in the pound because they manufacture products here, which are then passed on to other parties in the UK before being exported,"" he says. Mairi Spowage, director of the Fraser of Allander economic institute, adds: ""Given the pound has been devalued against the euro and the dollar, it will make our goods and services seem cheaper by comparison abroad.  ""But you have to remember that a lot of the things that go into goods produced for export has been imported, so it can make it more expensive for exporters to produce."""
currency fluctuations,Facebook plans to launch crypto-currency,2024-09-15,2019-05-23,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48383460,"Facebook is finalising plans to launch its own crypto-currency next year. It is planning to set up a digital payments system in about a dozen countries by the first quarter of 2020. The social media giant wants to start testing its crypto-currency, which has been referred to internally as GlobalCoin, by the end of this year. Facebook is expected to outline plans in more detail this summer, and has already spoken to Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Founder Mark Zuckerberg met Mr Carney last month to discuss the opportunities and risks involved in launching a crypto-currency. Facebook has also sought advice on operational and regulatory issues from officials at the US Treasury. The firm is also in talks with money transfer firms including Western Union as it looks for cheaper and faster ways for people without a bank account to send and receive money. Facebook wants to create a digital currency that provides affordable and secure ways of making payments, regardless of whether users have a bank account. The social networking site, which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, is hoping to disrupt existing networks by breaking down financial barriers, competing with banks and reducing consumer costs. Nicknamed Project Libra, Facebook's plans for a digital currency network were first reported last December.  The project will see it join forces with banks and brokers that will enable people to change dollars and other international currencies into its digital coins. A small group of co-founders are expected to launch the Swiss-based association in the coming weeks. Facebook is also reportedly in talks with a number of online merchants to accept the currency as payment in return for lower transaction fees. Virtual currencies can be used to pay for things in the real world, such as a hotel room, food or even a house. Digital tokens are held in online wallets, and can be sent anonymously between users. Crypto-currencies run on blockchain technology. A blockchain is a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. This information is stored chronologically, can be viewed by a community of users, and is not usually managed by a central authority such as a bank or a government. The concept was designed to ensure security and anonymity for users, by preventing tampering or hijacking of the network. Facebook has come under fire in recent years over its handling of users' personal data, and regulators are likely to examine the launch closely. Earlier this month, the US Senate and Banking committee wrote an open letter to Mr Zuckerberg questioning how the currency will work, what consumer protection will be offered and how data will be secured. Facebook has also discussed the process of identity checks and how to reduce money laundering risks with the US Treasury. It is believed that Facebook and its partners want to prevent wild swings in the coin's value by pegging it to a basket of established currencies, including the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen. It's not the first time Facebook has dabbled in digital currencies.  A decade ago, it created Facebook Credits, a virtual currency that enabled people to purchase items in apps on the social networking site. However, Facebook ended the project after less than two years after it failed to gain traction.  The company will also have to navigate a myriad of regulations in the countries it wants to launch in. India, a rumoured target for Facebook, has recently clamped down on digital currencies. However, the biggest test is likely to be whether people will trust the social networking giant enough to start changing their cash for the digital coin. Facebook is in the initial phase of engaging with governments, central banks and regulators, and insiders admit that launching any crypto currency network by the start of next year is ambitious. Facebook, Western Union and the Bank of England declined to comment. The biggest attraction of digital currencies to banks and big firms is the technology that underpins them. Blockchain technology can help to slash the time and cost of sending money across borders by bypassing banking networks. Lord King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned two decades ago that central banks could become ""irrelevant"" if people started to use digital currencies as pounds and pennies are used today. Blockchain expert David Gerard said that Facebook would gain access to valuable spending data by creating its own payment system. However, he questioned why the social media giant needed to mint its own crypto-currency to harvest that data. Instead, he said, Facebook could create a platform like PayPal, which allows users to transfer traditional currencies.  Crypto-currencies are vulnerable to fluctuations in value, which Gerard said could create a barrier to the success of Facebook's so-called GlobalCoin. ""Normal people don't want to deal with a currency that's going up and down all the time,"" he explained. But Garrick Hileman, a researcher at London School of Economics, said the GlobalCoin project could be one of the most significant events in the short history of crypto-currencies. Conservatively, he estimated that around 30 million people use crypto-currencies today. That compares to Facebook's 2.4 billion monthly users."
currency fluctuations,"No cash, no bread, no KFC amid new Zimbabwe crisis",2024-09-15,2018-10-12,By Andrew Harding,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45822166,"A deepening unease is settling over Zimbabwe as the country's fragile local currency loses value at an alarming speed, prices soar, local and foreign businesses close their doors, and people wonder whether their savings are about to be wiped out once again, as they were during the economic collapse and spectacular hyperinflation that tore through the country a decade ago. ""We are suffering. Inflation is too much. Every minute, every hour, every day, the prices are just changing,"" said a wholesale trader who did not want to give his name.  KFC has closed its local outlets citing ""these difficult times,"" while supermarkets have been rationing some items, and mining companies and other key exporters are complaining about a lack of access to foreign exchange reserves. ""I'm very worried. It's going to be just like 2008. Or maybe worse,"" said Grace Chitambara, a nurse waiting in her car in a mile-long queue for petrol in the capital, Harare.  Concern is rising - along with prices - following a series of unexpected government announcements regarding plans for a new 2% tax on money transfers, and for possible changes to a controversial local currency which had been pegged, one-to-one, to the US dollar. Fuel imports stopped abruptly, trading has been badly affected, and many businesses have stopped accepting the local bond notes - known here as Zollars or Zim bollars - which black marketeers are now valuing at four, or even five, to the US dollar. ""There's no need to panic,"" insisted Energy Mutodi, deputy information minister with the governing Zanu-PF.  ""What we're seeing is simply the result of speculative behaviour. People started to hoard. But this should normalise in the next few days. Zimbabweans need to know they are safe under Zanu-PF. The government is committed to reforms, so we need people to really be patient."" Almost a year after former President Robert Mugabe was ousted following a military coup, Zimbabwe's government - led by his former party Zanu-PF - is still trying to dig its way out of an economic hole caused by years of reckless spending, corruption, policy uncertainty and sluggish exports.  ""It's a pretty big hole. We're suffering the effects of many, many years of misgovernance. We've been living beyond our means and it has come to a crunch,"" said economist Ashok Chakravarti.  Zimbabwe's new finance minister has recently won some international support for his attempts to chart a path towards financial stability - a path that involves significant spending cuts and privatisation, alongside plans for the foreign debt repayments necessary to unlock new international loans.  But many here remember how their savings were seized by the government in 2008, and worry about the extent to which Zanu-PF is willing, or able, to tackle entrenched corruption.  ""It's a complete dog's breakfast - a man-made dog's breakfast,"" fumed opposition MDC Alliance MP Tendai Biti, a former finance minister in Zimbabwe's short-lived unity government, who points to the disputed election that kept Zanu-PF in power. ""People have no confidence in this regime. You can rig an election - as they did on 30th July 2018 - but you can't rig an economy, you can't rig a supermarket or a gas station. So, we have a fundamental crisis of legitimacy. Ordinary men and women are suffering because of self-induced policy distortions. It's madness. This is a basket case."" In 2009, Zimbabwe scrapped its own by-then-worthless currency and relied instead of a range of foreign currencies until 2016, when the bond note was added to the mix, amid deep concerns that it would be used to hide more corruption and unchecked government spending. No-one here underestimates the size of the mess that Mr Mugabe left behind in Zimbabwe, or the deep divisions within Zanu-PF, or the scale of the challenge ahead, but some analysts believe that the new cabinet is, slowly and erratically, making some of the right steps.   ""There's an enormous deficit of trust - a lack of confidence,"" Mr Chakravarti acknowledged.  But he believes the government must be given more time, and that the sharp fluctuations in the value of the local bond are inevitable, and perhaps necessary. ""We have to accept there will be a currency adjustment. Prices for a lot of non-essential items, in particular, are going to increase. We have tough times ahead. But governments do turn a new leaf and I think they should be given a chance to show what they can do. Things can change. The turnaround can be quite quick."""
currency fluctuations,Africa's richest woman 'ripped off her country',2024-09-15,2020-01-19,By BBC Panorama,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51128950,"Leaked documents reveal how Africa's richest woman made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and corruption. Isabel dos Santos got access to lucrative deals involving land, oil, diamonds and telecoms when her father was president of Angola, a southern African country rich in natural resources. The documents show how she and her husband were allowed to buy valuable state assets in a series of suspicious deals. Ms Dos Santos says the allegations against her are entirely false and that there is a politically motivated witch-hunt by the Angolan government. The former president's daughter has made the UK her home and owns expensive properties in central London. She is already under criminal investigation by the authorities in Angola for corruption and her assets in the country have been frozen. Now BBC Panorama has been given access to more than 700,000 leaked documents about the billionaire's business empire. Most were obtained by the Platform to Protect Whistle-blowers in Africa and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). They've been investigated by 37 media organisations including the Guardian and Portugal's Expresso newspaper. Andrew Feinstein, the head of Corruption Watch, says the documents show how Ms Dos Santos exploited her country at the expense of ordinary Angolans. ""Every time she appears on the cover of some glossy magazine somewhere in the world, every time that she hosts one of her glamorous parties in the south of France, she is doing so by trampling on the aspirations of the citizens of Angola."" The ICIJ have called the documents the Luanda Leaks. One of the most suspicious deals was run from London through a UK subsidiary of the Angolan state oil company Sonangol. Ms Dos Santos had been put in charge of the struggling Sonangol in 2016, thanks to a presidential decree from her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who kept a tight grip on his country for the 38 years he was in power. But when he retired as president in September 2017 her position was soon under threat, even though his hand-picked successor came from the same party. Ms Dos Santos was sacked two months later. Many Angolans have been surprised at the way that President João Lourenço has gone after the business interests of his predecessor's family. The leaked documents show that as she left Sonangol, Ms Dos Santos approved $58m of suspicious payments to a consultancy company in Dubai called Matter Business Solutions. She says she has no financial interest in Matter, but the leaked documents reveal it was run by her business manager and owned by a friend. Panorama understands that Matter sent more than 50 invoices to Sonangol in London on the day that she was fired. Ms Dos Santos appears to have approved payments to her friend's company after she was sacked. Although some consultancy work had been carried out by Matter, there's very little detail on the invoices to justify such large bills.  One asks for €472,196 for unspecified expenses - another asks for $928,517 for unspecified legal services. Two of the invoices - each for €676,339.97  - are for exactly the same work on the same date and Ms Dos Santos signed them both off anyway. Lawyers for Matter Business Solutions say it was brought in to help restructure the oil industry in Angola, and that the invoices were for work that had already been carried out by other consultancy companies it had hired.  ""Regarding the invoices related with expenses, it is common for consultancy companies to add expenses to invoices as a general item. This is often due to those expenses involving large amounts of paperwork... Matter can produce documentary evidence to confirm all expenses incurred."" Ms Dos Santos's lawyers said her actions with regard to the Matter payments were entirely lawful and that she had not authorised payments after she had been dismissed from Sonangol. They said: ""All invoices paid were in relation to services contracted and agreed between the two parties, under a contract that was approved with the full knowledge and approval of the Sonangol Board of Directors."" The ICIJ and Panorama have also uncovered new details about the business deals that made Ms Dos Santos rich. Much of her fortune is based on her ownership of a stake in the Portuguese energy company Galp, which one of her companies bought from Sonangol in 2006.  The documents show it only had to pay 15% of the price upfront and that the remaining €63m ($70m) was turned into a low-interest loan from Sonangol. Under the generous terms of the loan, her debt to the Angolan people didn't have to be repaid for 11 years. Her stake in Galp is now worth more than €750m. Ms Dos Santos's company did offer to repay the Sonangol loan in 2017. The repayment offer should have been rejected because it didn't include almost €9m of interest owing.  But Ms Dos Santos was in charge of Sonangol at the time and she accepted the money as full payment of her own debt. She was fired six days later and the payment was returned by the new Sonangol management. Ms Dos Santos says she initiated the purchase of the stake in Galp, and that Sonangol made money from the deal as well. ""There's absolutely no wrongdoing in any of those transactions. This investment is the investment that in history has generated the most benefit for the national oil company and all the contracts that were drafted are perfectly legal contracts, there are no wrongdoings.""  Her lawyers say the repayment offer in 2017 covered what Sonangol had indicated was owed. It's a similar story in the diamond industry. Ms Dos Santos's husband, Sindika Dokolo, signed a one-sided agreement in 2012 with Angolan state diamond company Sodiam. They were supposed to be 50-50 partners in a deal to buy a stake in the Swiss luxury jeweller De Grisogono. But it was funded by the state company. The documents show that 18 months after the deal, Sodiam had put $79m into the partnership, while Mr Dokolo had only invested $4m. Sodiam also awarded him a €5m success fee for brokering the deal, so he didn't have to use any of his own money. The diamond deal gets even worse for the Angolan people. The documents reveal how Sodiam borrowed all the cash from a private bank in which Ms Dos Santos is the biggest shareholder. Sodiam has to pay 9% interest and the loan was guaranteed by a presidential decree from her father, so Ms Dos Santos's bank cannot lose out. Bravo da Rosa, the new chief executive of Sodiam, told Panorama that the Angolan people hadn't got a single dollar back from the deal: ""In the end, when we have finished paying back this loan, Sodiam will have lost more than $200m."" The former president also gave Ms Dos Santos's husband the right to buy some of Angola's raw diamonds. Source: Forbes magazine and others Read more: Africa's richest woman eyes Angolan presidency The Angolan government says the diamonds were sold at a knockdown price and sources have told Panorama that almost $1bn may have been lost.  Ms Dos Santos told the BBC she couldn't comment because she was not a shareholder of De Grisogono. But the leaked documents show that she is described as a shareholder of De Grisogono by her own financial advisers. Mr Dokolo did put in some money later. His lawyers say he invested $115m and that the takeover of De Grisogono was his idea. They say his company paid above the market rate for the raw diamonds. The leaked documents also reveal how Ms Dos Santos bought land from the state in September 2017. Once again she only had to pay a small up-front fee. Her company bought a square kilometre of prime beachfront land in the capital Luanda with the help of presidential decrees signed by her father. The contract says the land was worth $96m, but the documents show her company paid only 5% of that after agreeing to invest the rest in the development. Panorama traced some of the ordinary Angolans who were evicted to make way for the Futungo development. They've been moved from the Luandan seafront to an isolated housing development 30 miles (50km) from the capital. Teresa Vissapa lost her business to Ms Dos Santos' development and is now struggling to bring up her seven children. She said: ""I only ask God to make her think a little more about our situation. Maybe she doesn't even know it, but we are suffering."" Ms Dos Santos declined to comment on the Futungo development. But it was not the only land deal involving Ms Dos Santos that displaced the local population. About 500 families were evicted from another stretch of the Luandan seafront after Isabel dos Santos got involved in another major redevelopment project. The families are now living in desperate conditions next to an open sewer. Some of their shacks are flooded with sewage whenever the tide rises. Ms Dos Santos says there weren't any evictions linked to her project and that her companies were never paid because the development was cancelled.  The billionaire has also made big profits from the telecoms industry in Angola. She acquired a 25% stake in the country's biggest mobile phone provider, Unitel. It was granted a telecoms licence by her father in 1999 and she bought her stake the following year from a high ranking government official. Unitel has already paid her $1bn in dividends and her stake is worth another $1bn. But that's not the only way she got cash from the private company. She arranged for Unitel to lend €350m to a new company she set up, called Unitel International Holdings. The company name was misleading because it wasn't connected to Unitel and Ms Dos Santos was the owner.  The documents show Ms Dos Santos signed off on the loans as both lender and borrower, which is a blatant conflict of interest. Ms Dos Santos denied that the loans were corrupt. She said: ""This loan had both directors' approval and shareholders' approval, and it's a loan that will generate, and has generated, benefit for Unitel."" Her lawyers say the loans protected Unitel from currency fluctuations. Most of the companies involved in the dodgy deals were overseen by accountants working for the financial services company, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC). It's made millions providing auditing, consultancy and tax advice to her companies.  But PWC has terminated its relationship with the billionaire and her family, after Panorama questioned the way the company had assisted Ms Dos Santos in the deals that had made her rich. PWC says it is holding an inquiry into the ""very serious and concerning allegations"". Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, told Panorama that PWC had given legitimacy to Ms Dos Santos and her companies. ""PWC, if not facilitating the corruption, are providing a veneer of respectability that makes what's happening acceptable or more acceptable than it might otherwise be. ""So if I was at PWC I'd be conducting a pretty thorough audit of what decisions were made, and in hindsight actually: 'Did we make the wrong decision to accept this business and should we have reported what we had been presented with?'"" PWC says it strives to maintain the highest professional standards and has set expectations for consistent ethical behaviour across its global network. ""In response to the very serious and concerning allegations that have been raised, we immediately initiated an investigation and are working to thoroughly evaluate the facts and conclude our inquiry.   ""We will not hesitate to take appropriate actions to ensure that we always stand for the very highest standards of behaviour, wherever we operate in the world.""

currency fluctuations,Crime gangs 'will try to exploit Brexit changes',2024-09-15,2019-09-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-49733348,"There is a risk of organised crime expanding in Northern Ireland after Brexit, a new report has said. The Organised Crime Task Force (OCTF) has warned the gangs could seek to exploit any new tariffs or other arrangements. In its annual report, it said the no-deal scenario would lead to ""potential new criminal markets for previously legitimate commodities"". But the group stressed it could counter any new threats that developed. Claire Archbold, director of safer communities at the Department of Justice said: ""None of us know on what terms the UK will leave the EU but we do know that wherever there is a border, organised crime will try to exploit it.""  She said the task force was agile and could adapt to changes in organised crime, whether they be currency fluctuations or Brexit. The task force, which includes the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), An Garda Síochána (Irish police), the Department of Justice and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, revealed a number of successes against organised crime gangs in 2018/19. Its members recovered about £1.4 million of criminal assets through confiscation orders and seized one million cigarettes, 9.2kg of class A drugs and 36.5 kg of cannabis. They believe they frustrated, disrupted or dismantled 72 organised crime groups. The report also revealed 59 potential victims of modern slavery were identified and referred to a national scheme for assistance. PSNI Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said vulnerable people were being brought into Northern Ireland with promises of well-paid work.  ""When they get here, what they find is their access to their bank accounts is controlled by the traffickers,"" he said. ""Their travel documents are taken by the traffickers. ""They may not even know exactly where they are in the country. In some cases they may not even know what country they are in."" Trafficked people were made more vulnerable by not speaking English, he added. ""They're being made to work for what may well be a legitimate pay but they're not getting that pay,"" he said. ""The pay is going to the traffickers.""  The task force also reported that cyber-related fraud was a major growth area."
currency fluctuations,Arsenal fan token posts broke advertising rules,2024-09-15,2021-12-22,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59730984,"A web page and a Facebook post by Arsenal football club promoting crypto-based fan tokens broke advertising rules, a watchdog has ruled. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) argued the club had ""failed to illustrate the risk of the investment"". It ruled ""the ads must not appear again in the form complained about"". Arsenal said it would seek an independent review of the ruling, adding that the club had provided information on the financial risks. Several top-tier football clubs offer fan tokens.  But critics, including some supporters' groups, suggest that clubs who promote crypto fan tokens are encouraging people to engage in the risky, and largely unregulated, world of cryptocurrency investment. The ASA ruled against two promotions of Arsenal's fan tokens ($AFC). The first breach, according to the watchdog, focused on content on Arsenal's official website - in particular a page posted on 6 August 2021 with the title '$AFC Fan Token: Everything you need to know'. The second breach was a Facebook post on the club's official page, posted on 12 August 2021, which read: '$AFC is now live' and asked fans: ""What song do you want to hear when we win? Download the Socios app to get your token and vote"".  In its ruling, the ASA investigated three issues concerning the post and website text, arguing they were: In addition, it said the Facebook post ""did not make clear the 'token' was a crypto-asset, which could only be obtained by opening an account and exchanging with another cryptocurrency which had to be purchased"". The watchdog found that both the website and the Facebook post broke its rules: ""The ads must not appear again in the form complained about,"" it stated. In future, the club must make it clear that fan tokens are crypto-assets and ""that the value of investments in crypto-assets was variable and crypto-assets were unregulated"", the ruling continued. Arsenal football club told the BBC: ""We take our responsibilities with regard to marketing to our fans very seriously. ""We carefully considered the communications to fans regarding our promotions and provided information regarding financial risks."" The Club said it would be seeking ""an independent review of the ASA's ruling to seek greater clarity on the ASA's current position"".  In defending its marketing to the ASA, Arsenal argued the website did include the warning that fans ""could lose some or all of their money invested"".  It said the marketing material stated: ""We advise you to spend only what you can afford and seek independent financial advice if required."" The Club argued the fan tokens were not promoted as an investment and they did not encourage the trading of tokens. Arsenal is the first club whose fan token marketing is judged to have breached advertising standards by the watchdog. It is one of a number of clubs to have joined forces with a company called Socios, which offers fan tokens through its app. Socios told the BBC's Tech Tent podcast it has sold $270m-300m worth of coins through its app, but declined to reveal how much money goes directly to clubs it works with. Responding to the recent ASA ruling, Socios said: ""We welcome Arsenal's call for an independent review. This is a fast-moving area and clarity is needed to ensure all companies can adhere to the latest guidelines."" Clubs say that by collecting fan tokens, supporters can influence the running of the club - suggesting the more tokens fans collect, the more say they might have. But with the exception of free non-tradeable fan tokens given to club members, fans have to use a crypto-currency called Chiliz ($CHZ) to buy and sell tokens. So far, across the five major European leagues, 24 clubs have launched or are considering launching fan tokens, including eight Premier League sides. Some clubs also sell digital collectibles, known as NFTs (non-fungible tokens). In September, French firm Sorare, which sells football trading cards in the form of NFTs, raised $680m (£498m) in funding. However, some supporters groups are wary. In August, the Arsenal Supporters Trust said the club should make it clear that crypto-currency is an ""unregulated activity"" and was risky. Tim Payton, a board member of the Trust told the BBC that ""clubs should not be allowed to use football's popularity to push an inherently high-risk product"". The Trust believes government and the football authorities should look into partnerships between clubs and crypto-currency companies. Mr Payton said if they are to continue, then a greater effort must be made to ensure that all marketing materials ""inform all fans of the downside involved in buying tokens"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says monitoring crypto-assets, like Bitcoin, is a ""red-alert priority"" and it is concerned that many ads fail to fully convey the risks of investing. Guy Parker, the authority's, chief executive told the BBC crypto-assets were ""poorly understood by the public"" and were mostly unregulated, and not backed by financial compensations schemes. His message to consumers was ""think very carefully before you buy. Do you understand crypto-assets well enough?  Can you afford to lose what you've spent?"" The watchdog says it plans to issue guidance on crypto-asset marketing in the new year, and will continue to publishing rulings on ads for NFTs, crypto-currencies and fan tokens in the interim."
currency fluctuations,Business leaders call for reassurance,2024-09-15,2017-06-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40216641,"Politicians must act fast to reassure businesses in the wake of the election result, according to business leaders. The result is a ""serious moment for the UK economy"", the CBI business lobby group said, and called for politicians to form a ""functioning government"". British Chamber of Commerce bosses also called for a ""workable administration"" to build confidence. The Institute of Directors demanded a focus on preparing for Brexit talks and to move away from political ""rhetoric"". And the manufacturing organisation, the EEF, said it wanted a ""careful rethink"" on Britain's Brexit negotiation strategy. All business groups were keen to stress that uncertainty is the worst outcome for its members, who are struggling to come to terms with what shape the new hung parliament will take. Individual companies and chief executives have been more muted, but Aston Martin said the uncertainly could lead to a fall in investment in the UK by the luxury car maker. Aston Martin chief executive Andy Palmer said: ""We cannot stress strongly enough the need for rapid and decisive policy direction to ensure that business can continue to invest for the long term growth and ensure the global competitiveness of the British economy,""  The firm has recently invested heavily in a new factory in St Athan, Wales. Organisations representing thousands of UK businesses echoed Mr Palmer's message. CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn warned: ""The priority must be for politicians to get their house in order and form a functioning government, reassure the markets and protect our resilient economy.  ""Politicians must act responsibly, putting the interests of the country first and showing the world that the UK remains a safe destination for business. It's time to put the economy back to the top of the agenda. Pounds falls but shares rise Hung Parliament: What happens next? Election results live updates Election 2017: At a glance Election catches investors off guard ""For the next government, the need and opportunity to deliver an open, competitive and fair post-Brexit economy that works for everyone across all our nations and regions has never been more important."" Markets reacted to the news of the hung parliament by pushing the value of the pound lower, although the FTSE 100 share index opened higher. Martin GIlbert, chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management told the BBC's Today programme: ""I don't think any of us know what to make of the result. ""The City will be hoping for a slightly softer tone and possibly a softer tone from Europe now that the really the negotiators don't have a mandate to negotiate a hard Brexit."" Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), agreed that a new government must be formed quickly. ""After two long years of elections, referenda and wider uncertainty, many businesses were doing their best to ignore the noise of politics - up until today,"" he said.  ""The electorate's split decision generates further uncertainty for business communities, who are already grappling with currency fluctuations, rising costs, and the potential impacts of Brexit.  ""The formation of a workable administration that can give voters and businesses confidence around economic management must be the immediate priority."" Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said businesses had been ""thrown into political limbo"". ""The majority of British business will be waiting to see whether a stable government can be formed in short order. ""If the Conservatives govern as a minority, they must recognise that they have not earned a mandate to implement their manifesto in full. ""Now is the time to move on from the rhetoric of the election campaign and focus on preparing for Brexit talks."" Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: ""The Brexit negotiating strategy requires a careful rethink. ""Industry should be at the table, alongside whatever administration is formed, to help ensure we have the right negotiating position, which is something that's been sadly lacking until now.  ""The main parties have championed an industrial strategy for Britain and this must not be a casualty of the political turmoil."""
currency fluctuations,Is the honeymoon period over for Brazil's Bolsonaro?,2024-09-15,2019-04-10,By Katy Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47865386,"Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election last October on a platform of change.  He said he would deliver a safer Brazil to appease those worried about rising violence, an economic turnaround after several years of crisis and - perhaps most central to his campaign - an end to old-style corrupt politics which have seen dozens of high-ranking politicians, including a former president, jailed.  For millions of Brazilians fed up with the status quo, the gun-loving former army officer was the only man for the top job despite sexist, racist and a homophobic remarks he made during the campaign. While 100 days in office may not be long enough to judge the president's performance, some of his erstwhile supporters are now expressing doubts about his ability to lead the largest democracy in Latin America.  And among his detractors, there is definitely a feeling of ""I told you so"" after his first months were beset by a series of problems.  Late last month, the president caused outrage by suggesting the armed forces commemorate the start of military rule 55 years ago. His anti-corruption image has been tainted by allegations that his son Flavio was involved in financial scandals and death squads.  And then of course, there was that awkward time during carnival when he posted a video on Twitter of a sex act performed by two men at a street party that he felt was bringing the reputation of the country down.  He has now got the lowest approval rating recorded by a first-time president in the initial 100 days in power since the country returned to democracy in the 1980s. ""The feeling is that the situation is worse than it was before the elections,"" says Rafael Alcadipani, an associate professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. ""Everyone wanted change in society but the commander-in-chief hasn't shown himself to be capable of delivering any type of change.""  ""He's failed to show Brazilians confidence in his plan for government,"" says Roberta Braga, associate director at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Centre in Washington DC. ""He's losing a lot of support. It clearly takes time to implement these very complex reforms but Brazilians expected a lot from him.""  One of Mr Bolsonaro's campaign commitments was to bring down violence by making it easier for people to own guns. Within a couple of weeks of being sworn in, he had loosened regulations to make it easier to keep guns at home.  This was music to the ears of people like gun club member Natasha Imata, whom I met at LAAD Expo, Latin America's largest security and defence show in Rio de Janeiro last week.  But despite his swift action on gun ownership, Ms Imata thinks that the new president is ""not focussed on security"".  Her husband Vitor agrees. ""His whole campaign was focussed on helping Brazilians but that's not happened. It's been a weak start,"" he says. Brazil's stock market and currency soared after Mr Bolsonaro's election in what some dubbed the ""Bullsonaro wave"". But since he took over power on 1 January, signals have been more mixed.  While many in the industry point to a strong economic team led by market-friendly economy minister Paulo Guedes, unemployment levels have remained stubbornly high.  There is also a reluctant acceptance that the government may not be able to push through much-needed reforms such as pension cuts as easily as it had hoped. ""We have serious doubts about the capacity of the government to continue to do these reforms,"" says Andre Perfeito, chief economist at Necton brokerage in São Paulo. ""Bolsonaro's main promise was pension reform. And he's not doing the political job to deliver that."" Others though, are more upbeat.  Walter Maciel is the CEO of independent asset management company AZ Quest: ""Most of the old political leaders were not re-elected and went home. There is a major renovation in congress, a new government that was elected by people who desired a huge change, not only in the way the country was led but also in the way that politics was done.""  ""So you have a lot of new people coming in, many of them coming in without any political experience. Of course there's some kind of externality and undesired volatility but it's part of the learning process,"" Mr Maciel says.   Government worker Gabriel Moraes voted for Jair Bolsonaro but says he would not do so again. He thinks the president needs to be more statesman-like and has so far failed.  ""As a head of state, any message he sends out is a reflection of society today,"" Mr Moraes argues. ""Life in civil society isn't like an army barracks. Sure there has to be order and discipline but there have to be principles, rules and respect too."" But his cousin Alessandra Guadelupe Regondi disagrees. A big fan of President Bolsonaro, she says he represents something very different, something that Brazil needs. With a military background in her family, Ms Regondi warmed to the politician during the campaign.  His promises of cutting ministries in the government and making it more efficient, for example, appealed to her and she has even got a photo of the two of them together, in pride of place on her bookshelf in the living room.  Ms Regondi does not see any problem with the president's social media habit. ""It helps him get closer to the people,"" she argues.  ""Leaders were always from the same parties,"" she says. ""He's a new hope, like Donald Trump was. He went against everything - and still won."" "
currency fluctuations,'Meghan Markle' tops Google name searches,2024-09-15,2018-12-12,By Jen Copestake,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46520958,"""Meghan Markle"" was the most searched-for person's name for the second year running on Google's UK search service. But the Duchess of Sussex came second to the overall winner of the most queried term - ""World Cup"" - in the company's search trends review for 2018. ""Royal wedding"" and ""royal baby"" were the top two news event trends.  The duchess announced her first pregnancy in October while on tour with Prince Harry in Australia. Of course, there were two royal weddings this year: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May; and Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank in October, which may have added to the overall figures. ""Roxanne Pallett"" the former Emmerdale actor who courted controversy on Celebrity Big Brother after accusing housemate Ryan Thomas of punching her, came second in most-searched-for celebrities. Pallett ended up quitting her radio show on York-based Minster FM over the fallout from the incident, calling herself ""the most hated girl in Britain"". Celebrities who struggled with substance abuse took the third and fourth spots: ""Demi Lovato"", who had an apparent overdose, and ""Ant McPartlin"", who had well-documented struggles with rehab and recovery.  McPartlin took time off from his TV presenting roles including ITV's I'm a Celebrity - which was the top trending TV Show - after crashing his car while under the influence of alcohol. Despite being the most watched television drama last year, ""Bodyguard"" was pipped to the post by ""Killing Eve"" - numbers three and two respectively in the television category. Marvel's superhero film Black Panther was the fourth top trending overall query as well as being the most searched for movie title. It was the studio's first film to focus on Africa and feature a predominantly black cast. Black Panther was also one of the highest grossing movies of the year, taking more than $1bn (£800m) worldwide. Among the more prosaic searches in the ""How To...?"" list were ""How to bleed radiators?"" at number eight and ""How to put lights on a Christmas tree?"" at number nine. Perhaps reflecting wider privacy concerns on social media, ""How to delete Instagram?"" and ""How to delete Facebook?"" were fifth and sixth on the list.  Jeremy Clarkson's return to prime-time TV with a classic moment on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" made it into the most searched trends.  The show introduced an ""Ask the Host"" lifeline to its Phone a Friend, 50/50 and Ask The Audience options. Clarkson gave a confident answer to ""What is an Ibex?"" leading to a flurry of searches for the wild goat.  Unfortunately he said it was a deer and lost his contestant £15,000. Finishing ahead of this gaffe ""What is Bitcoin?"" topped the list of quizzical searches. Considering the wild price fluctuations and opaque nature of how the crypto-currency works, it does not come as a surprise. Heads were also scratched over ""What is GDPR"" the new European Union legislation on data protection which made second spot on the What is? list."
currency fluctuations,Business requests for Brexit help 'surges',2024-09-15,2019-09-25,By Andrew Black,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49811759,"Scotland's main economic development agency says there has been a huge surge in requests from businesses asking for help to get ready for Brexit. Scottish Enterprise said visits to a website offering firms help with the cost of Brexit had risen by 386%. The agency said requests for advice about currency changes and access to suppliers were also common. Linda Murray, head of strategy services, urged companies to ""plan for the worst and hope for the best"". Ms Murray told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the advice Scottish Enterprise was giving businesses had not changed. ""It's been uncertain all the way through for quite a long time now so our advice to business (is) to, I guess, plan for the worst and hope for the best. ""We're definitely in a place where we think no preparation you do in advance is wasted."" Ms Murray said the advice website set up to help businesses saw a 386% increase in use during September - rising from 3,000 visitors in July to 27,500 visitors this month. She said companies were most concerned about: Scottish Enterprise also said: Start Up Drinks Lab is one of the many Scottish companies trying to expand in Europe, while trying to deal with several possible Brexit scenarios. The Port Glasgow-based firm was set up in June last year by Hannah Fisher and Craig Strachan, after they spotted demand for a firm that could bottle craft drinks such as soda, beer and mixers, in small batches. Ms Fisher said an early concern had been access to EU-funded support for Scottish businesses. She added: ""The biggest impact we've seen is a shortage in glass. ""We're a glass bottle facility so that's quite a large factor for us. ""People are stockpiling for glass, which means the smaller buyers like Craig and I don't get priority and often have to purchase where we can."" Ms Fisher added: ""In terms of a no-deal Brexit - the best thing we can do is prepare for all options."" She said the company was also trying to expand to EU countries such as Germany and Belgium. Ms Fisher added: ""What we're looking at doing is potentially franchising the model. ""That is where operating in the EU may become either a good or a bad thing, versus what it is just now.""

currency fluctuations,Many UK banks stop sale of Qatari riyals,2024-09-15,2017-06-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40454386,"A number of UK High Street banks have stopped trading in Qatari riyals. Individual customers at Barclays, RBS, Lloyds Banking Group and Tesco Bank cannot currently buy or sell riyals. Qatar is isolated by its neighbours, who accuse it of backing terrorism. Its central bank says it will guarantee all transactions for customers inside and outside the country. It also told the Reuters news agency that all banks and foreign exchange companies are committed to trading riyals as usual. In early June, Qatar's Gulf neighbours Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt ceased air, sea and land links with the country, which has been accused of funding terrorism. Qatar denies the claim.  The cutting of diplomatic ties by Qatar's neighbours has prompted wide fluctuations in the value of the country's currency. A spokeswoman for Barclays said: ""In common with other banks, Barclays' high street foreign exchange service is supplied by a third party, which has stopped providing the Qatari riyal. ""Unfortunately, we are therefore currently unable to buy the Riyal from or sell it to our retail customers."" A spokeswoman for Lloyds Banking Group also said that a ""third-party supplier"" which carries out its foreign exchange service had ceased trading Qatar riyals from 21 June.  She said: ""This currency is no longer available for sale or buy-back across our high street banks including Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and Halifax."" HSBC was unavailable for comment on its current position. Reuters reported that the Post Office had stopped buying and selling the currency earlier this month.  Currency supplier Travelex said trading in riyals had been suspended in some markets due to ""business challenges"". But it added: ""Travelex is pleased to announce it has resumed purchasing Qatar riyal globally."""
currency fluctuations,You say you want a resolution...?,2024-09-15,2019-01-02,By Jamie Robertson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46522608,"New Year's Resolutions are, like rules, meant to be broken. Last year, about one in five people came up with some sort of resolve on 1 January, according to a poll by YouGov. However, separately it has also been claimed that most of us will have given up on them by 10 January. While most of those may be along the lines of ""I will never, ever mix Moscow Mules and Old Freebottom's Black Ale again"", many will actually be concerned with work and how we spend our money. So before we take the plunge, let's have a look at the options, starting with the most drastic. If you're miserable and you hate the people you work with, then the answer's probably yes.  In fact there's never been a better time to look for something new. There are more job vacancies around than there have been at any time this century, 2.8 for every 100 jobs in existence, and unemployment is the lowest it's been in percentage terms since 1975. Justin Urquhart-Stewart is the co-founder of Seven Investment Management and regularly tours schools and universities advising on personal finance and careers in the financial services. He has this advice: ""Polish up your CV. As well as qualifications and business experience put in any work you do in the community. Businesses are increasingly having to report on their corporate social responsibility and if you do things like helping out in your local school, that's a point in your favour."" Coincidentally, the new year could be the moment to ask for a pay rise.  Corinne Mills, managing director at Personal Career Management, says you need to time a request for a raise around three or four months before the end of your employer's financial year.  ""That way,"" she says, ""they can budget it in to the next year. If you do it too late even if they want to give you the money they simply may not be able to. ""The other thing is to know your market rate. Go online and type in 'Salary Guide' and look at how much you are meant to be paid. Or look at adverts for similar positions or talk to a head hunter. ""The third thing to remember is you must have a proper conversation about this and draw up a list of all your achievements from the last year. Don't just tag it on to a meeting or do it in a chance encounter. Have a longer conversation about your career development, and let them know that you are committed."" Almost certainly yes. Mr Urquhart-Stewart says: ""The only way to save is to do it immediately after your pay cheque comes in. That way you can't get your hands on it and spend it on the shopping. So set up a direct debit on payday. Put it into a tax wrapper like an Isa (individual savings account), so the income and the growth are tax-free."" The returns on savings at the moment are less than breathtaking. The best instant access account currently on the market, according to Moneysupermarket.com is Marcus, a retail bank owned by Goldman Sachs which is offering an interest rate of 1.5%.  The stock market has been even worse. If you had put money in the FTSE 100 index of top shares at the beginning of last year and reinvested the income from the dividends, by mid-December you would have lost 7.5%. But Mr Urquhart-Stewart says: ""You have to invest for the long term. If your granny had given you £100 when you were a child, and you had put it into the stock market, 70 years later with all the income reinvested it would be worth £190,000."" Probably. It has been estimated that people touch their phones 2,617 times a day. So it's not hard to see how this may be a problem at work, and probably at home too.  Ms Mills says it's her personal resolution to cut down the time she spends on social media: ""It's so addictive. You can find yourself losing time at work and also it can be very emotional, getting yourself worked up with what's online, so it's not good for your general wellbeing."" There are (ironically) apps that can help you. Moment is an app that claims it can help people ""gain an hour back each day by following simple strategies designed to help them re-imagine their relationship with their phone"". AppDetox gets you to lock your apps, and then pesters you with annoying reminders when you break the locks, while Forest ties phone abstinence into a commitment to plant trees both virtual and real. If you don't like gyms, definitely not. You won't keep it up and you'll waste your money. The easiest way to start feeling marginally more healthy is on your way to the office. Get off the bus or underground, out of your car and walk or cycle. Once you're there, see if you can stand at your desk, rather than sit, and if you're really ambitious get a treadmill desk so you can walk as you work.  But there's more to fitness than developing a six-pack, as Ms Mills explains: ""There is a new emphasis at work on wellbeing and mental health, so it's not just about gym membership but doing things to improve your mental state: walking, yoga, meditation or even joining a choir."" Definitely. The law allows you 5.6 weeks holiday (including bank holidays) a year but we seem to be reluctant to use it all. A British Airways survey found more than half of the working population don't use all their holiday allowance, and more than a third of UK workers are afraid to take a two-week holiday in case their colleagues think they're a bit of a skiver. ""There are times in your life when work can be so engaging and exciting you do miss holidays,"" says Ms Mills. ""But is it healthy? Of course it isn't. You need more. You need a personal life and time off. Again, it's to do with wellbeing."" On a more practical note, Mr Urquhart-Stewart says: ""Book the time off before anyone else, and put the holiday money aside early.  ""The other golden rule of holidays is the week you decide to go abroad the pound will decide to crash. So buy some foreign exchange early in the new year and then regularly over the following months. That way you smooth out the currency fluctuations."""
currency fluctuations,Walmart rises despite Flipkart hit,2024-09-15,2018-10-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45881961,"Walmart is asking Wall Street to wait for profit growth as it battles to retain its place as the world's largest retailer. The US discount chain has been buying up smaller companies, investing in India and spending on new technology. But the investments come at a cost. On Tuesday, the firm warned that profits per share would decline slightly next year, largely because of losses at its Indian e-commerce unit Flipkart. Despite the caution, the firm's shares rose by nearly 2%, offering a vote of confidence in Walmart's efforts to remake its business. Executives outlined plans to investors at an annual meeting on Tuesday. They said they were looking at everything from introducing more robots to cut costs to expanding revenue by monetising customer data. In its stores, Walmart is expanding offerings in categories with strong sales, such as wine and toys. Online, executives said they wanted to improve services such as same-day delivery and increase the number of products available. ""I like the direction we're heading, but it's not going to happen overnight,"" said Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart's US e-commerce unit. Walmart has already been on a shopping spree, purchasing online shopping site Jet.com, as well as brands such as Bonobos and Bare Necessities to strengthen its digital muscle. It spent $16bn (£12.1bn) this year to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce company. Executives said they believed that Flipkart will turn profitable eventually, but conceded that the investment, as well as others it is making, would be costly in the short-term. ""We want to be positioned to have a business that's large and growing for the long term,"" said chief executive Doug McMillon.  ""I'm trying to balance short-term and long-term but if you force me to choose, I'd lean long-term."" The firm expects sales to increase by at least 3% in its next financial year, excluding fluctuations due to currency changes. In the US, the firm expects sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, helped by a 35% surge in online shopping. However, profits are expected to decline in the low single digits. The firm's estimate includes Flipkart, but not other changes, such as tax rates. Executives said a healthy US economy had helped power sales, but they were preparing for the possibility that consumers will pull back. The firm is also facing rising labour and delivery costs, as well as new US tariffs on Chinese imports. Executives said the firm was committed to remaining the ""low price leader"" and had been in intense talks with suppliers in an effort to avoid raising prices."
currency fluctuations,Are we taming offshore finance?,2024-09-15,2017-11-05,By Gary Kitchener,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41877924,"The offshore finance industry puts trillions of dollars worldwide beyond the taxman's reach. Bringing it to heel is like taming a cat; not just a normal moggy - a thankless task in itself - but a Cheshire Cat: nebulous, hard to pin down, disappearing and reappearing when it likes. No-one can actually agree on what a tax haven is. Or even on the name: one person's tax haven is another's ""offshore financial centre"".  No-one can agree on how many there are. Nor on exactly how much money is stashed offshore. No statistics are fully reliable.  And this suits those who operate in offshore finance, from the owner of the wealth to the lawyer or accountant middlemen who manage the funds, to the often sun-kissed beaches of the jurisdictions where they are secluded or pass through. The industry's key word is privacy. Or secrecy - a word it doesn't like so much. One adage cited by the taxation author and expert Nicholas Shaxson sums it up: ""Those who know don't talk. And those who talk don't know.""  But do we really not know how much is stashed offshore? A report this September,  co-authored by the economist Gabriel Zucman, estimates about 10% of global GDP - the way we measure the size of the world's economy - is held offshore, about $7.8tn (£6tn). The Boston Consulting Group reported it last year at about $10tn. If you are thinking, wow, that's bigger than Japan's economy, you'd be right. But if you want a real wow, try $36tn - the estimate offered by James Henry, author of the book Blood Bankers. That's twice as big as the US economy. But no-one really knows. And here's another wow. Remember the slogan ""we are the 99%"" coined by the Occupy movement to lambast the top 1% of the population for their disproportionate share of wealth? Well, the Zucman report says 80% of all offshore cash is owned by 0.1% of the richest households, with 50% held by the top 0.01%. So if you read this and are thinking, if you can't beat them... quite frankly, it's unlikely you will ever join them. The management fees for the ordinary person will probably far outstrip the gains. As Nicholas Shaxson told BBC Panorama: ""At the very lowest end you'll have the middle classes doing little bits and pieces. But the large majority of what's going on, this is a game for rich people."" Surely we know some of how this works? The systems have a ring of familiarity - double taxation; tax inversion; trusts; shell companies etc. It's just we don't usually know who's in the schemes and what they are getting out of them. The basic essence is rerouting money in one location where you don't like the taxation rules to another location - one that is stable and reliable - where there aren't as many, or any. For example, if you want to protect your assets to stave off creditors, stick them in an offshore shell company. Hey presto, much harder to get at. Want to hide ownership of a property? Put it in a trust. This is not illegal. There are many other schemes, legal, illegal and sometimes ethically debatable. But even within these categories there are many variables on what actually constitutes The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. After all, in the film with that name the ugly arguably wasn't as bad as the bad, and the good was hardly perfect. True to their Cheshire Cat-like origins, offshore financial centres (OFCs) do not always appear where one might expect them. That's because offshore, sorry to confuse you, is also onshore. This makes it impossible to pin down the global number of OFCs. It could be 50, 70 or more and new ones come and go. The US and UK are arguably two of the biggest OFCs. For example, setting up shell firms is easy in some US states, like Delaware. And it's widely known that the City of London acts as the facilitating hub for Crown dependencies and overseas territories that channel trillions of offshore dollars. The smaller, often island, nations are what Nicholas Shaxson calls ""captured states"". He told Panorama: ""These places don't have a very deep pool of experienced people. They're just people who say, well we trust the accountants, we trust the lawyers to tell us what's best for our island and we'll do it."" So how does offshore defend itself? Well, the jurisdictions say it's wrong to think there are banks in OFCs sitting on pots of gold - the money is simply being reinvested by companies - and that if there were no OFCs there would be no constraint on the tax rates governments might levy.  OFCs, they say, simply pump cash around the globe and the new transparency rules put in place over the past decade have severely limited tax evasion. It's certainly wrong to lump all the OFCs together. Some are better regulated than others. Down at the murkier end, dealings in Panama were exposed by leaks last year. But Bermuda's Bob Richards offered a stout defence of its financial services in an interview with Panorama carried out while he was still finance minister, citing a taxation system that had been in place for more than 100 years and adding that if other nations were losing out on tax they should sort their own systems out. Bermuda, he says, has fully signed up to an international agreement that allows for the automatic transfer of tax information within governments and such a jurisdiction ""cannot be a tax haven"". And Appleby, the financial services firm involved in these latest leaks, made the case for OFCs back in 2009, in the wake of the global crash. It said there was ""no evidence OFCs played any role in the economic crisis"",  OFCs were ""neither the source of - nor the destination for - criminal proceeds"" and that OFCs ""protect people victimised by crime, corruption, or persecution by shielding them from venal governments"".  Of the latest leaks, the company said: ""Many of the questions raise matters where - on any view - there is plainly no conceivable wrongdoing on the part of Appleby whatsoever."" OFCs say there are no secrets, just privacy. But Gerard Ryle, of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which oversaw this huge leak of financial documents, known as the Paradise Papers, dismisses this. ""The only product that the offshore world sells is secrecy and when you take away secrecy they don't have a product anymore,"" he told the BBC. ""Where you have secrecy, you have the potential for wrongdoing."" Whatever term you prefer, the elusive nature of offshore makes it hard to root out wrongdoing. You could start an investigation into one firm or individual and be shuttled around from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, company to company, turning up a whole tranche of names on documents that are linked to no real owner, sometimes no real person, and lead absolutely nowhere.  You're probably also thinking, we've now had an awful lot of these financial leaks, haven't they changed anything? Spin backwards to April 2016. The Panama Papers have just come out. Iceland's PM Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson has resigned after the leaks showed he owned an offshore company with his wife. Thousands are demonstrating in Reykjavik to vent anger at their politicians. Some estimates put the protest numbers at 6% of the whole Icelandic population. That's like if 19 million people turned up to a protest in the US today. But then travel over to Elektrostal, two hours east of Moscow. Resident Nadezhda is haranguing BBC reporter Steve Rosenberg. ""All these 'investigations' are a waste of time and money. We know what you're up to. They're trying to rub Putin's face in the dirt,"" she says. It kind of depends on where you are. In the West, at least, people are questioning what high-net-worth individuals and multinationals can get away with. Is it right that they can use loopholes to keep more of their cash? Or should it go to governments to spend on their people? To be fair, governments have been tracking stashed cash since the 2008 global meltdown, independent of any financial leaks, although their talk has usually been tougher than their action. Secrecy is now harder to achieve, transparency is greater. So-called country-by-country reporting, requiring multinationals to break down how they operate in different nations, has widened and public registries of companies have increased. Even Russia brought in a law requiring the disclosure of offshore assets. The result? Since the law came in three years ago, dozens of the super-rich have given up Russian residency to avoid it.  There are also OFC blacklists mooted but, as Nicholas Shaxson says, the big players will make sure their operations are not on it and it will weed out only the minnows. The offshore firms will ""recalibrate"", he says. ""When legislation changes, you will have this ecosystem kind of readjusting and the money will shift to other places."" And wealth holders will readjust too. Pump cash into diamonds and artworks maybe? Or just go and actually live somewhere that charges low tax. What makes this a vicious circle is that many governments are fully prepared to sanction offshore finance. Indeed, many people in government use it, as these leaks show. And there is one thing we do know. If the super wealthy don't pay the taxes, the money has to come from everyone else. Which to many may sound a bit mad, but as the Cheshire Cat says: ""We're all mad here"". The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with  corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries. The BBC does not know the identity of the source.

currency fluctuations,'Scorching-hot hacked computer burned my hand',2024-09-15,2020-05-29,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52834378,"Bullets rained down from all angles but Abdelrhman Badr kept calm.  Suddenly an enemy burst through a window. Abdelrhman swung round to face the soldier and save his team. He lined up his sights for a fatal shot and squeezed the trigger but… his screen went black.  His computer had silently and suddenly shut itself down without warning. Abdelrhman was confused. The game he was playing had never caused problems before.  He reached down and looked inside his computer, which he liked to leave open and on display in his bedroom. Instinctively he touched one of the components, swore and pulled his hand back. The graphics card was so hot it had burned his fingers. The 18-year-old from Sheffield hadn't realised it yet, but this minor injury was caused by crypto-jacking. Crypto-jacking is the unauthorised and illegal use of someone's computer to collect Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.  There are estimated to be more than 47 million crypto-currency users around the world, although it is difficult to be sure because of their anonymity. Users collect virtual coins by a complex process called ""mining"" which puts computers through a series of mathematical problems. In a crypto-jacking operation, hackers fool victims into downloading a malicious file that surreptitiously forces their computers to mine for this money and send it back to the criminals who can spend it on crypto-currency marketplaces or turn it into mainstream cash. Crypto-jacking attacks increase a victim's electricity bill and can not only slow down infected computers but potentially cause irreparable damage to hardware. Last week, at least a dozen supercomputers across Europe had to be shut down after hackers targeted them with crypto-jacking attacks. Abdelrhman Badr has no idea how hackers got into his system. He thinks he must have accidentally downloaded the malware three weeks before he burned his hand, when he started noticing strange things happening to his computer. ""Whenever I put my PC to sleep the screens would go blank but I could still hear the fans running and when I came back to it, it would just open up to the main desktop with none of the usual login page or anything,"" he says. ""My computer wasn't actually going to sleep at all."" Even when he burned his hand, he didn't at first consider he was the victim of a hack. It was actually a mistake that led to his discovery. ""I was playing around with a program that monitors computer activity and everything looked normal but I accidentally left it on overnight,"" he recalls. ""When I next checked I found that my computer had been sending loads of information back to a strange website I've never visited or heard of."" The website was set up to collect the crypto-currency Monero. .  ""I was shocked and also a bit embarrassed as I take pride in keeping my PC safe. It's really frustrating to know that there could be a program running without me knowing and some guy secretly mining crypto, destroying my hardware and stealing my electricity."" There could be hundreds, or even thousands of victims like Abdelrhman, who are unwittingly lining the digital wallet of this hacker or hackers.  ""Crypto-jacking attacks are becoming more sophisticated, using techniques to hide their behaviour,"" says Alex Hinchliffe, a threat intelligence analyst at Palo Alto Networks. ""Cyber-criminals look for as many victims' systems as possible. The more systems, whether it be PCs, servers, cloud services, mobile and other smart devices the better, as more mining can be achieved in a relatively benign and unobtrusive manner."" Experts say the threat of crypto-jacking rises and falls with the fluctuating price of crypto-currencies. According to research from Palo Alto Networks, the attacks are currently on the rise. ""It's not as profitable as it used to be for hackers so crypto-miners are showing up in the weirdest places on the internet to maximise the number of victims. Sometimes we find them hidden inside the code of free programs, for example,"" adds Ryan Kalember from Proofpoint, another information security company. Security specialists say computer users should be vigilant and look out for changes to their computers, such as a slowing down of performance, or changed settings. It's also a good idea to install some security software and do regular virus scans."
currency fluctuations,How rhythm rules our lives,2024-09-15,2023-05-27,Nina Kraus,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230526-how-rhythm-shapes-our-lives,"Rhythm plays an important role in how we perceive and connect with the world around us, even playing a role in our social lives and health. My husband reads to me every night before we go to sleep. We deliberately choose books that are familiar – oft-read children's classics make frequent appearances – so I do not worry about missing something important when I drift off. I have noticed that after some time – it can be as little as a few minutes if I am especially tired – the meanings of the words are gradually eclipsed by the sounds. I begin to hear sounds and rhythms instead of words and story. The waxing and waning of the accents and stress patterns become a calming, lulling, treasured experience that soothes and resets me after a long day. Why do we care about rhythm? It connects us to the world. It plays a role in listening, in language, in understanding speech in noisy places, in walking, and even in our feelings toward one another. Rhythm is much more than a component of music. We experience the rhythmic changes of the seasons. Some of us have menstrual cycles. We have circadian rhythms – daily cycles of mental and physical peaks and troughs. Frogs croak rhythmically to attract mates and change their rhythm to signal aggression. Tides, 17-year cicadas, lunar phases, perigees, and apogees are other naturally occurring rhythms. Human-made rhythms include the built world – street grids, traffic lights, crop fields, mowed designs in baseball diamond outfields, the backsplash behind the kitchen counter, spatial patterns in geometric visual artforms. Music and rhythm are rooted in every known culture. What parent does not use rhythmic rocking to soothe a crying baby? The repetitive sounds and silences that comprise rhythmic patterns make dancing possible, aid in the memory and reproduction of music, and facilitate group singing, playing, or drumming. Rhythm has been used for millennia to tie societal members together – the chants of a religious order or the cadence calls of military ranks are just two examples. Poetic works thousands of years ago, such as those of Homer, were chanted or sung with rhythm serving a mnemonic function. Repetitive or complex work engenders rhythmic accompaniment, in some cases to break the monotony, in others to actually help you perform the work better.   Workers performing hard labour such as rock breaking chant to keep their sledgehammers swinging in rhythm. Postal workers in Ghana hand-cancel stamps with a distinct rhythm. Rug weavers in Iran use chants with a complex musical structure to communicate weaving patterns to their co-weavers. All musical systems and styles have organisational rhythmic motifs. Indeed, the very universality of rhythm is a strong argument for the existence of biological processes governing the perception and production of rhythm. Rhythms in the brain have been called out as a basis for consciousness itself.   Language probably does not immediately come to mind when we think of rhythm. You might have had a high school literature class where you learned about prosodic feet – iambs, trochees, and anapests. But outside the context of poetry, we rarely think about speech having a particular rhythm. After all, we are likely to say ""Oy Bill – you ready yet?"". Not, ""Hey there Bill,/do you think/it is now/time to go?"" so that it conforms to dactylic tetrameter. What about rhythm and reading? Here, too, we are unlikely to associate rhythm to reading unless we are reading poetry.   In fact, rhythm is a necessary ingredient of linguistic communication itself.   Rhythm can be viewed through the lens of shorter and longer time scales. Speech has phoneme, syllable-, word-, and sentence-length rhythmic units, each unfolding at their own rate. We understand that speech comes in different sized units – the sound an individual letter makes, the phoneme, at one extreme, and the slowly rising and falling loudness and pitch contours that unfold over the course of a sentence or group of thoughts on the other. This latter one is the night time reading rhythm I fall asleep to. These entwined elements of speech constitute rhythms that must be sorted by our sound minds. We can try to focus on the slow parts of speech (say, the fluctuating pitch of the voice) and ignore the fast (the vowel and consonant sounds that convey the meaning of the words) or vice versa. But this is usually not possible and rarely desirable. This temporal hierarchy is at work in music too. Music is a mix of slow phrases, steady beats, sustained notes, rapidly changing notes, trills, and drum crashes. Entwined temporal structures are in environmental sounds as well – when walking through the woods, we simultaneously hear slow footsteps, the unfolding crunch of leaves underfoot, and the rapid snap of a twig. Much as sound units come in different lengths, brain rhythms come in different speeds. Subcortical structures are equipped for microsecond timing while the cortex is better suited to integrating sounds over a longer time scale. Brain rhythms can be measured both when at rest and when performing an activity. When listening to speech, there are fast brain rhythms that entrain to the fast phonemes, the near instantaneous consonant sounds. Middle-range rhythms in the brain track the rate of syllables. Slower brain rhythms correspond to the slow oscillations of phrases and sentences. Similar nested brain patterns are active when listening to music. Imagine a metronome ticking at about 144 beats per minute (bpm). Popular songs in this range include Blondie's ""Call Me"", the Beatles' ""Back in the USSR"", and the Rolling Stones' ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"". It's a fast, allegro rate. Measured another way, these songs have about a half second between their beats. If we play a conga drum by itself at this rate and record brain waves to it, we will see neural activity repeating every half second (boom, boom, boom, boom, or ""one, two, three, four""). But what does the brain do if you listen to the conga drumming along to a song that matches this beat? The brain produces a new rhythm. In addition to a response peak every half second (where musically speaking the ""ones"" are), you see another, smaller peak halfway in between (1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and; ""FLEW in FROM mi-AM- i BEACH""). The brain has worked out the strong/weak pairs comprising the song's meter. This tells us the brain entrains and reinforces both explicit and implied rhythms in the music. This extra rhythm in the brain wave does not occur when the song is deliberately misaligned with the conga beat. A similar example of the brain creating a beat comes from Brainvolts alum Kimi Lee, who found that the fundamental frequency of an identical speech sound is enhanced when it occurs on the ""one"" in a four-beat sequence. The sound mind's response to a drumbeat is deeply shaped by its aural context. Rhythmic organisation operates automatically when we listen to sound. If our rhythmic expectations are violated, our brains behave in a different manner because of our inherent internal sense of rhythm. Rhythm Intelligences Imagine the familiar rhythm ""Shave and a haircut, two bits"" and tap it out on a table with your finger. Did you tap seven times? Now imagine it again and tap your foot to it. Did you tap seven times again? Or fewer? For me, when I tap my finger on a table, I tap to every note (ignoring the rests). When I tap my foot or snap my finger along to music, I typically tap or snap to the beat (or pulse) of the song, not every note. When I tap my finger on the table, hitting the ""sounds"" and ignoring the ""silences,"" I am tapping out the rhythmic pattern – I am keeping track of how long or short each note is and where the pauses occur. When I tap my foot, I tap four times, to the underlying beat or pulse (see the rhythm pattern below), which in this example includes a silent beat. Music has both a pulse and a rhythm pattern, notated by time signature and note/rest durations, respectively. Before I began studying rhythm, if you had asked me about the skills involved in tapping out rhythmic patterns versus tapping out the beat, I would have said, ""You're probably either good at both or not so good at either."" If someone can tap to a beat, she can also tap out a rhythm pattern, right? Wrong. There are multiple rhythmic intelligences. You cannot predict how someone will perform one rhythm task by how they perform a different rhythm task. This was first noticed in extreme cases where a person with brain damage could be impaired in one sort of rhythmic ability but not another. We have since learned these distinctions are fundamental to how the system works: we see dissociations between rhythm skills in all of us, confirming the idea that ""rhythm"" is not an all-or-nothing ability, and more intriguingly, our proficiency executing one type of rhythm or another bears on our language skills. Both beat-keeping and rhythm-pattern skills predict language development and reading ability. However, only rhythm-pattern ability has a bearing on understanding speech in noise, as we will see in a moment. Brain Rhythms Rhythm pattern skills are associated with slower brain rhythms (seconds), while beat-keeping skills are associated with faster brain rhythms (milliseconds and microseconds). Phonemes, syllables, and sentences range from microsecond to millisecond to second timing, respectively. Brain rhythms can predict language development in infants and children. Brain rhythms can also determine a person's strengths and bottlenecks related to language and the ability to make sense of an auditory scene while listening in noise. Children who recognise differences in rhythm patterns and tap to a beat learn to read and spell more easily. Several beat-keeping skills are impaired in older children with dyslexia. My own team have found a link between beat keeping and language development in adolescents and in children as young as three years old. What is the connection between rhythm skills and what might appear to be unrelated skills like reading and writing? There really is rhythm in language, beyond the rhyming of poetry. It is inherently a part of pronunciation. Rhythm matters, even in single words. ""Record,"" ""contrast,"" ""project,"" and ""produce"" can be either nouns or verbs depending on which syllable is stressed. Running speech also has rhythm. A YouTube search for ""drumming to speech"" will uncover some nice examples – a personal favourite is the one with the scene from the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka movie. The video shows a drummer playing along to the rhythms of the dialogue between Willy and Grandpa Joe, so you cannot miss the rhythm in speech. Tabla player Zakir Hussain tells us his father taught him to speak using drum rhythms when he was a baby. In tabla, each finger is assigned a syllable, and playing the tabla is akin to speaking in phrases. In all languages there is a definite rhythmic aspect to spoken language, brought about by alterations in stress, duration, and pitch of the syllables. This was resoundingly brought home to me first-hand when Hussain accompanied me on the congas during a speech on rhythm and language. Quite simply, rhythm in speech tells us when important information starts and stops. Stressed syllables emerge at roughly regular intervals and, importantly, carry the majority of the information of speech. With an ongoing rhythmic flow, the listener is guided to the important features of the sentence by the expectancy rhythm sets up and, so primed, we understand the content of the spoken word better. With the understanding of spoken speech comes the ability, when learning to read, to make the necessary connections between the sounds of language and its written form. One of the greatest impediments to successful spoken-word communication is noise. The rhythm of speech helps us. This is because the rhythm in speech helps us fill in the gaps when noise causes us to miss a few words. Just as a rhythm pattern evolves over the course of a measure of music, running speech evolves over time and thus is suited for a slower scale of auditory processing. The strong and weak stresses, phrases, and boundaries of language are relevant to the whole spoken sequence. The ability to reproduce rhythm patterns seems to draw on the same skills required for forming the auditory scenes that comprise hearing speech that is barely audible above noise. Hearing speech in noise can be partly predicted by one's ability to tap out rhythm patterns. And the better you are at navigating rhythms – and musicians of any stripe (not just drummers) fall into this category – the more you can capitalise on the rhythmic patterns in speech and eke out what was said despite the noise. Rhythm and socialisation How we feel about another person is conveyed by rhythm. Walkers synchronise their steps to aid communication. Social encounters with rhythm influence our attitudes. The extent to which a person synchronises with an experimenter affects the person's opinion of the likability of the experimenter. University students were instructed to tap along to a metronome while an experimenter was also tapping their finger nearby. When the experimenter tapped at the same rate, the rating given in response to ""how likeable was the experimenter?"" was higher. Likability aside, the mere presence of another person drumming along with a task will improve performance. Pre-school-age children asked to perform a rhythm synchronisation task perform it better if they are drumming along with another human than to an impersonal beat coming from a loudspeaker. Even in very young children, being (literally) ""in sync"" with another person engenders positive feelings toward them. In one study, an experimenter bounced 14-month-old children along to music either on the beat or intentionally off the beat. When the bouncing session was over, the baby was placed on the floor and the experimenter deliberately dropped an object and acted out needing help to pick it up. The babies who were bounced on-beat were much more likely to help the experimenter retrieve the object, having apparently formed a social bond, via rhythm, that prompted cooperation. The off-beat babies were less likely to help. Rhythmic synchrony had led to interpersonal synchrony. Along similar lines, the brain rhythms of musical performers and their audiences have been measured in concert settings. The brain rhythms tend to synchronise, and the more synchronisation between performer and listener, the more listeners report enjoying the performance. Music in general, and rhythm in particular, does an uncommonly good job fostering a sense of community. Indeed, music being played at negotiation sessions helps to smooth the conversations and leads to breakthroughs and compromises. Musicians Without Borders is used to form relationships in troubled regions around the world, to bring hope, comfort, and healing to diverse populations. The Resonance Project and the Jerusalem Youth Chorus, which are forming bonds between Israeli and Palestinian children, are other examples of using musical rhythm to overcome differences. The early days of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic were marked, in some European countries, by daily sessions of songs sung from balconies to connect with others at a time of isolation and to communicate appreciation and solidarity with health-care workers. Rhythm for health Traditional healers in all regions of the world have relied on rhythm as a primary force in their rituals and practice. Today, rhythm helps us exercise as we move to keep ourselves healthy. Therapists have long used our capacity to perceive sound patterns to strengthen communication skills. They rely on rhythm and the concepts of entrainment to a beat, violations of a beat, and pattern recognition as core features of their protocols, reminiscent of the scene in the Colin Firth film The King’s Speech, where King George VI overcame a stuttering problem by rhythmically singing his words. Rhythm capitalises on our sound minds' auditory-motor connection. First mentioned by the American Medical Association in 1914, music therapy was put to work helping wounded World War One soldiers recover from their injuries, including what we now call traumatic brain injury. Rhythm-based therapy has a growing status in recovery from concussion and other brain injuries, addressing both cognitive and emotional health. Rhythm is used to great effect to pace walking in individuals with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, for example. After all, walking is a rhythm. Numerous studies have found that other disorders that involve movement, such as aphasia, stuttering, difficulty with respiration, swallowing, and speaking, respond to music therapy. Therapy involving rhythm also has shown promise in addressing communication and social behaviour in people on the autism spectrum. Children who cannot otherwise speak can form words and sentences when accompanied by a clear rhythm. There are children on the autism spectrum who will not engage in a verbal conversation but will gladly carry on a rhythmic conversation with another person on drums. If I had a magic wand, I would make rhythm an indisputable part of language therapies through music and rhythm-based instruction. This would mean a closer alignment among fields of speech therapy, music, and music therapy. There are explicit rhythm-based training programmes which make synchronising to rhythm an explicit core exercise with the aim of improving timing in the brain. Some have been used to bolster language, reading, and communication skills, and do so with tasks that engage both the slow and fast sound processing circuits in the brain, thus drawing on multiple rhythm intelligences. Music with a regular and predictable rhythm can lead to states of enjoyment or emotional transcendence. Pythagoras viewed music as a gateway to the realm of the dead, at least judging from his supposed dying request that the monochord, an ancient one-stringed instrument, be played during his final moments. The music historian Ted Gioia has described Gregorian chants as ""so rich in overtones that you have the impression they are angels, not men."" Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart and I have discussed the calm yet alert and energised state that drone compositions – musical pieces consisting of sustained sounds produced by monochords or other instruments and manipulated in the studio to swell and build – can induce. We are working together to investigate the neurophysiological reaction to some of his drone compositions.  A while back, one of my sons got a hairline fracture in his foot. As he was not healing as fast as his physical therapist was hoping, he was assigned daily sessions with a bone vibrator. The idea behind vibration therapy is that if you cannot use your musculoskeletal system normally, for example due to an injury or osteoporosis, you miss out on the natural stimulation that occurs as your muscles imperceptibly relax and contract to maintain posture. This can lead to bone tissue atrophy. Imposing vibrations at around 30–50 Hz at the injury site simulates natural postural adjustments, stops the reabsorption of bone tissue, and promotes the bone growth that would ordinarily be achieved as part of typical day-to-day movement. It appears that low frequency vibrations spur activity in the stem cells that make cartilage, muscles, and bones. This process may also be useful for strength training in non-injured people.  It turns out the vibration rate of a cat purr is in the exact same range as used in vibration therapy for bone growth. Cats purr when they're happy, of course, but in what other circumstance do they purr? When they are injured. There is a hypothesis that cats purr as a mechanism to keep their bones and muscles stimulated and healthy and to restore their health when injured.

currency fluctuations,How to budget for living abroad,2024-09-15,2013-04-10,Roz Hopkins,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20130404-how-to-budget-for-living-abroad,"Dreaming of an overseas move can be so exciting that it is often hard to focus on the dreary matter of money – but some smart decisions and simple planning could save you thousands. Dreaming of
an overseas move can be so exciting that it is often hard to focus on the dreary
matter of money – but a few smart decisions and some simple planning could save
you thousands. Before you go Before you
do anything, think about how much it is going to cost to disentangle yourself
from your current financial obligations. Do you need to exit a mobile phone or
cable TV contract, cancel direct debits, wriggle out of a gym membership or
defer a magazine subscription? Add up those costs and set them aside in the
“never-seeing-that-money-again” column of your budget. 



 Next, take
a long, hard look at your belongings. Now is the perfect opportunity to shed
unwanted gifts and ill-conceived purchases; you do not want to be carting them
across the world and paying for the privilege. Shipping the contents of an
average two- or three-bedroom home from the London, England, to Toronto, Canada,
will cost in the order of £4,500 – so taking less will have a very tangible
impact on your budget. Also remember that moving costs will depend on whether
you choose sea freight, air freight or ground transportation. A useful resource
to find and compare movers worldwide is Intlmovers. While you
are in clear-out mode, consider some key facts about your new abode. What is the
weather like there? Do you really need your winter woollies? Similarly, what is
the electrical system of your new
country and will it support your existing appliances? If you know the
actual house you are moving into, get a copy of the floor plan – with
dimensions – so you can see which pieces of your furniture will or will not fit. How much is
a cup of coffee or a beer in your new country? Find the answer to that question
at global price comparison site wopri.com, and
you will have a decent gauge to start building the needed day-to-day budget.  Money matters Your first
big challenge will be getting a visa. Even if you are being sponsored by a
company or an individual, you could be liable for the cost of an immigration
lawyer. These can be expensive; in the US, expect to pay upwards of $5,000 in attorney’s
fees for visa processing, and the cost of the
visa itself usually ranges from $200 to $400. 



 The next priority
is to get your finances in order. You will need a bank account in your new country
and you will probably want to hang onto your existing one, too. But you might
find it difficult to set up a new account until you have suitable personal
identification in your new destination (such as a job or rental contract or social
security number in the US), so make sure you have a decent credit card with zero
foreign transaction fees to get you through the first few weeks.  Alternatively, speak to your current bank
about setting up an international
account. Most of the big banks offer these, and they allow you to access
your money wherever and whenever you need it.  A little more
complicated is the issue of transferring money to your new home. The more money
involved, the greater the issue, since money transfers are subject to the
vagaries of currency fluctuation. Forget about foreign exchange bureaus unless
you are talking about small change – the exchange rates are poor. Your bank
will likely give you a better rate, but beware transfer costs and commission
fees. If you are transferring anything over £5,000, look for a deal that
exempts you from fees. Small
amounts of money can be transferred via PayPal, which does not require a
minimum transfer amount, although transactions do incur a charge, currently set
at 3.9%. For transferring money to or from the UK, Moneysupermarket.com lists the best
transfer companies and deals. Also be aware that there may be a “receiving fee”
from your new financial institution.  For serious
money, your concern will be less with transfer fees and more with exchange
rates. In this case, it makes sense to use a foreign exchange broker or
understand the detail yourself by using a comparison site such as FX Compared. If you have
more advanced financial needs, such as managing an investment portfolio or an
ongoing requirement to pay tax in dual locations, seek out the services of a
financial planner for bespoke advice.  Moving costs Whether you
are planning to rent or buy your home, consider employing the services of a professional
who can advise you on the neighbourhoods that best meet your needs and can also
research properties, advise on rental or property values, attend inspections, submit
applications or bid at auctions on your behalf. Some relocation companies will
do everything, from moving the cat to finding a nanny to redirecting your mail.
Try NYC Navigator, London Relocation or Resettlement Services Australia, although
most major cities have companies with similar services.



 If you are planning
to rent, your initial outlay is likely to be a security deposit and at least one
month’s rent. However, in more competitive rental markets (such as New York
City or Melbourne) you might need to budget more, especially if you do not have
any local references.  The cost of
buying property will be
highly dependent on the destination, but nonetheless you should budget for the
usual additional expenses involved, including legal fees, taxes and insurance.
If you need a mortgage to finance your purchase, seek out the services of an
overseas mortgage advisor such as Homesgofast.com,
which can help you re-mortgage your current home, take out a new loan in your
current country or borrow abroad. As well as
buying new furniture, you will also need to budget for utilities – gas, water,
electricity and phone, as well as cable TV and wireless internet. And do not forget
about car, home and health insurance. Some countries have much better public
health systems than others and it is important to understand what is on offer in
order to make the right provisions for you and your family. An excellent
resource is the World Health Organization’s World Health Report 2000 which ranks
the world’s health systems on five key criteria relating to services. Top of
the list? France. Bottom of the list? Burma.  Schooling Parents
will likely have schooling high on their list of priorities. Consider whether
or not education
is free – in most places this will not be a problem, although there are
surprising inconsistencies in what free education means.  
Germany, for instance, provides free education to children for their entire
schooling period, while Switzerland offers eight years of elementary education.
Also consider whether the education on offer is of a standard that meets your
expectations. If not, and depending on the location, you might want to consider
international schooling, which provides mother tongue (usually English) education
for foreign nationals based on an international curriculum. Families with
younger children should research the options for pre-school and childcare, and
factor these into the budget.  When you get there When the
wheels have finally touched down on your tarmac of choice, it is time to start
re-establishing some of the things you dismantled earlier. Doubtless you will still
want the gym membership and magazine subscription. And
since you will be in a new place you might want to set aside a bit of cash for
social activities, perhaps joining a group or attending a course. 



 Finally, set
aside an “exploration budget”, which will allow you free, unfettered access to
your wallet for a few days while you orient yourself in your new place of
residence and see what it has to offer."
currency fluctuations,Lurking currency risks,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Andrea Murad,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130628-lurking-currency-risks,"Americans typically do not trade currencies, also called foreign exchange, while in other countries, individual investors are well-versed in currencies, said chartered financial analyst Ron Rimkus, director of Economics & Alternative Investments at the CFA Institute in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Asia, for instance, people speculate on currency by trading against central bank activity, which requires a strong degree of risk tolerance and sophistication. But whether they know it or not, American investors often carry plenty of hidden currency risk in their portfolios, such as through many popular mutual funds. Through shares in emerging market companies or US multinationals, like McDonald’s Corp or Apple Inc, American investors have more exposure to the dynamics of foreign economies than they realize. “[Investors] get a lot of exposure to currency indirectly by buying equities and bonds,” said Richard Levich, professor of finance and international business at New York University’s Stern School of Business In short, a weak currency helps its country’s stock market go up, but as the US Federal Reserve and other central banks begin to raise rates, there is a risk of market decline and changes in currency valuation. These could create the potential for individual investors to see more swings in their portfolios as multinationals deal with the ripple effect, which could include a stronger US dollar. That, in turn could cause companies to earn less money on their overseas business, said certified public accountant Ted Sarenski, chief executive officer and president of Blue Ocean Strategic Capital in Syracuse, New York. Weak revenue almost always leads to stock price declines. Consider the example of McDonald’s, which generates 65% of its income outside the US. Without protections against currency fluctuations, if the dollar is weak, every burger McDonald’s sells in euros generates more profit. On the flip side, if the dollar strengthens, each burger sold in euros would be worth less in dollars and the chain’s revenue — and earnings — would take a hit. In a recent corporate filing, McDonald’s said it expects its diluted earnings per share to move $0.25 if four of the five currencies from the US, United Kingdom, Australia, Eurozone or Canada move by 10% in the same direction. If the earnings per share decreased, this would likely cause a decline in share price, hurting investors who own either the individual stock or a mutual fund that counts McDonald’s shares among its holdings. A company like Apple, the maker of iPads and iPhones, exposes investors to currency fluctuation risks on two levels. The company does business overseas as well as produces products overseas. The real risk would be that the currency collapses in an area of the world where Apple and other firms like Google, Microsoft, Yum! Brands, Exxon Mobil and General Electric have substantial operations. Shares of these companies make up portions of many popular mutual funds and can sway stock indexes. If there’s a gradual rise in interest rates, such a company would be able to readjust its business to lessen the impact, said Sarenski. If there’s a sudden rise in interest rates and the currency collapses because of inflation — a less likely scenario — any longer term hedge for such scenarios would likely not help and overseas sales would be severely devalued. “People don’t think about the added level of risk from buying stock in a multinational corporation— there’s currency risk in each one of those,” said Sarenski. Indeed, companies comprising the Standard & Poor’s 500 index received 34% of their revenue from foreign sales in 2012, according to a Goldman Sachs report. “As the US dollar goes down in value, there’s an effect to the value of those investments” in US multinationals, Sarenski said. Investors can protect their portfolio against the stock market as a whole, and to some extent the currency risk inherent in owning shares in a multinational company, by diversifying into commodities and precious metals that traditionally move opposite the market, said Sarenski. Some mutual funds also have mechanisms to hedge 10% to 15% of the investments — those strategies are outlined in their prospectus, but that doesn’t mean the fund managers are actually employing the hedge. A mutual fund may use options to hedge a long position of a stock without using any leverage. An investor can find out if a mutual fund is utilizing a hedging strategy by reading the fund prospectus. Since about 2009, the start of the Great Recession in the US, currency rates have been fairly steady around the globe because the policies central banks around the world have been similar. But, increasingly, analysts and stock market watchers expect that to change.  "
currency fluctuations,Five pricey cities you can now afford,2024-09-15,2017-06-21,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20170605-living-in-cities-that-are-cheaper-than-ever,"With global forces and political influences in flux, certain destinations that have long been some of the world’s most expensive have recently seen a shift in cost of living. A rise in global nationalism paired with a worldwide drop in oil prices has brought about significant shifts in the global economy over the past year. As a result of these developments, certain destinations that have long been some of the world’s most expensive have recently seen a decrease in their cost of living. Whether due to international politics, export and import changes or currency swings, cities like London – which recently voted to depart the EU in the Brexit vote – have seen their ranking dramatically drop in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s annual Cost of Living Index. And, since local currency values have fallen against foreign currencies in most cases (and the rate of local inflation often rises sharply), it’s expats employed by foreign companies that are likely to see the most benefit in these cost-of-living changes. We talked to residents and expats living in these places to find out how the changes have affected them, and how to save the most money in these suddenly affordable destinations. London The 2016 Brexit vote in favour of Britain leaving the European Union had an immediate negative impact on the pound as compared to other currencies. So much so that London, long at the top of the cost-of-living index, dropped 18 places in just a year. International tourists have flocked to the country to snag deals on luxury goods and other shopping; one estimate said foreign spending has surged more than 36% year-on-year.  But since foreign currencies are stronger against the pound, the cost of imported goods have gone up in price, said Ian Wright, founder of international mover company MoverDB.com, adding that “or more sneakily, the size has been reduced”. (Though the company denies a Brexit association, Toblerone changed the shape of their chocolate bars shortly after the vote). Experts predict that important imports like fruits and vegetables will also likely rise around 8% as a result of Brexit. Still there are plenty of ways to live even more affordably – and finding good deals on housing is top of the list. Generally, living in south and east London is cheaper than the west or north. “London is really quite strange in that you can have council estates located right next to multi-million pound homes,” said Wright, originally from Canada.  Wright lives in Abbey Wood in southeast London, where he says a house can be rented from around £1,000 a month, or purchased for around £325,000. “While the area doesn't have a lot going on today, the ruins of the 12th-Century Lesnes Abbey and many parks and woods nearby can be wandered and enjoyed for free,” he said. Other affordable options include more centrally located Leyton near Olympic Park in east London, and East Ham just south of Leyton. East Croydon in south London is also being extensively redeveloped and will soon have a new shopping centre – but you can still find a rental from just £500 per month. While the UK in general has taken on something of an anti-immigrant mood, according to Wright, he assures that the capital is still very open and multicultural. “London has far fewer ethnic enclaves than cities in the US so you get expats and immigrants from all over the world living next to each other, which I think is one of the best things about the city,” he said. Beijing Many Chinese cities dropped more than 10 places in this year’s rankings, including Beijing which dropped 16 places. While the report didn’t speculate on causes, sources have attributed the drop to falling demand for Chinese exports and a decreased value of the yuan against the dollar. Much like in London, being able to live comfortably depends on how far from the city centre you’re willing to live: a one-bedroom in Tongzhou, 22km east of the city centre, rents for only RMB 2,500 per month. “But your best bet as a foreigner is finding a room a bit closer to the centre for around RMB 4,000, which you can pretty much do in the ‘cool’ parts of town near Sanlitun [9km northeast from the centre] and Gulou [5km north of the centre],” said Om Buffalo, an American who currently lives in Beijing. In general, south and west Beijing are cheaper than the north and east. Other ways to save money include taking the subway instead of taxis. “For medium to long-distance trips, taking a taxi in Beijing often takes longer and costs way more than the subway,” said Josh Ong, director of global marketing and communications at Beijing-based Cheetah Mobile. “It's a little daunting at first, especially during rush hour, but with a little research, you can learn your way around.” His other suggestion is to eat like a local, using dianping.com to find the places real Beijingers are dining. “Western food in Beijing comes at a premium, but there are amazing noodle shops and dumpling houses just around the corner from you.” Lagos Nigeria’s largest city also dropped 16 spots in the rankings, due to global dropping oil prices, one of the country’s primary exports. This may be helpful for foreign employees, but Hashim Zein, an ambassador for expat community InterNations and originally from the US, says that this may create additional security challenges as the related currency inflation has driven prices up for locals, which can lead to an increase in theft and related crimes. A little common sense goes a long way, however, say locals, and it shouldn’t stop anyone from living here. “I feel at home in Nigeria because of the attitude of the people here. A can-do spirit and resilience plus always time to make merry no matter what,” Zein said. Plus, the city knows how to have a good time. “There’s no party like a Lagos party – seven days a week!”     Lagos is separated into two major parts – the Mainland and Island (which is actually multiple islands, but is separated from the mainland by the Lagos Lagoon). Most expats live on the Island part, including the affluent Victoria Island neighbourhood, 17km south of the city centre and part of the larger Lekki peninsula; or equally high-end Ikoyi, an island neighbourhood, located 15km south of the city centre, built for British expats during colonial rule. Nearby Lekki Phase, a brand-new city still in development, is also just a few more kilometres further down the island. Those who work in manufacturing are more likely to need to be on the mainland, and Ilupeju (8km north of the centre) and Ikeja (15km north) are some of the best areas for expats, according to Zein, for their safety, more stable infrastructure and location close to many businesses. Mexico City Ranked 82 of 132 cities in 2017, Mexico City has always been relatively affordable – but also dropped nine places in the rankings this year. As the currency becomes weaker compared to foreign currency, inflation has risen and local prices have gone up slightly, including recently increased bus fares due to the gasolinazo, the higher gas prices that have been the source of city-wide protests. For that reason, it’s better to walk to the metro than take the bus, said Lauren Cocking, originally from London who writes a Mexico travel blog. And while she relies on public transportation over private transportation, she recommends Uber for late-night needs. “It is often cheaper than taxis and far safer than public transport, especially late at night.” It’s also easy to save money by shopping in the tianguis (local markets) than the big supermarkets. “The price difference is incredible,” Cocking said. “The food is my favourite part of life here.” She says that most expats flock to the neighbourhoods of Roma and Condesa, but those may not necessarily give a good representative feel for the city. “My recommendations would lean more towards underrated neighbourhoods like Narvarte or Del Valle [7.5km and 9km south of the city respectively],” she said. “They are more ‘local', residential areas, and not as at risk from earthquake damage. Same goes for neighbourhoods in the south of the city, such as Copilco and Coyoacán [15km and 12.5km south of the city].” “Coyoacán is a beautiful, colonial neighbourhood with more traditional houses and relaxing parks and quiet streets, and a bustling central plaza full of delicious street food and entertainment,” said Natalie B, a Mexico City native who works for local travel guide company My Local Cousin. “For those preferring a more traditional Mexican experience in a mostly residential setting, La Narvarte is a good option. This neighbourhood was built up in the 1940s through ‘70s and still has a lot of great original architecture, quiet streets and a family atmosphere.” Buenos Aires After London, Buenos Aires saw the greatest fall in the index, dropping 20 places due to Argentina’s economic volatility. Locals are used to these kind of price fluctuations though, says Madi Lang, an American who has lived in the city for 10 years and runs the Buenos Aires Cultural Concierge. “The economy is always pretty crazy,” she said. “They take it all in their stride – as long as there is beef for the grill.” Lola Black, a tango guide and an InterNations ambassador, describes the city as “urban, but effortlessly cool and Euro-Latin laid back”. To get the most of this vibe, expats should consider living in Puerto Madero, 4km southeast of the city centre, a clean, high-end part of the city close to the ocean, or historic San Telmo, 4km south of the centre (though safety is a higher concern here). Those in the city for its famous tango should live in centrally located Almagro, 6km west of downtown. “It's the perfect 'hood because it's super central. It’s close to the touristy/trendy area of Palermo and with excellent access to downtown,” Lang said. “Right in this area there are bars, restaurants, milongas (tango halls), live music joints and just real neighbourhood life.” Plenty of free activities and parks also make the city very affordable for entertainment. “The hundreds of plazas and parks are perfect for spending the afternoon drinking mate (our traditional tea drink), people watching and general relaxation,” Lang said. Her personal favourites are Plaza Vicente Lopez in Recoleta, the Rosedal Rode Garden in Parque 3 de Febrero and Parque Lezama in San Telmo.

currency fluctuations,Adidas says it plans to sell remaining Yeezy stock,2024-09-15,2024-02-01,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68163180,"Adidas plans to sell remaining stocks of Yeezy sneakers from its defunct partnership with Kanye West, for at least the price it cost to make them. The firm cut ties with the rapper and fashion designer, who is also known as Ye, in 2022 after he made a series of antisemitic comments on social media. But demand for Yeezy sneakers has not faded, as they remain hugely popular in the resale market. It comes after currency fluctuations cost the firm €1bn ($1.08bn; £850m). The German sportswear giant's finances were impacted last year by the discontinuation of the Yeezy business and as it cut prices to wholesalers to shrink stockpiles of goods, Adidas said in a statement. Despite facing significant headwinds, Adidas posted an operating profit of €268m in 2023 and said it expects to almost double that figure this year. ""The improvement is due to the better operating business of around €100 million and the decision to not write off €268 million of Yeezy inventory,"" the company's chief executive Bjørn Gulden said. Mr Gulden was brought in from rival sportswear firm Puma at the start of 2023 to drive the turnaround of the Adidas after the breakup with the Yeezy brand left it with unsold sneakers worth around €1.2bn. Even though the company sold some of its Yeezy stock last year net sales from the partnership were around €450m lower than in 2022. Adidas said it now planned to sell its remaining Yeezy stock for ""at least"" the cost of producing the goods, as it tries to recoup losses from the once-lucrative partnership.  However, the company's latest outlook still included a potential write-off of its remaining Yeezy items, which would cost the firm about €300m. Adidas also said it was hit by the devaluation of the Argentine Peso at the end of 2023. Argentina's new President Javier Milei devalued the country's currency by more than 50% in December as part of the ""economic shock therapy"" that he said the country needed. The firm also warned that its profits will continue to be hit by the devaluation this year. Adidas has been the maker of shirts for Argentina's national football team for decades. Last week, rival sportswear firm Puma also said Argentina's currency devaluation hit its financial results as the region was its biggest and fastest-growing market."
currency fluctuations,Stock markets rebound on Russia sanctions,2024-09-15,2022-02-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60518578,"Global markets soared on Friday as investor concerns eased about the severity of sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Coordinated Western sanctions against Russia have targeted its banks but left its energy sector largely untouched. After sharp falls on Thursday, stock markets in the UK and Europe jumped more than 3%. US exchanges also rose. Oil prices reversed early gains on Friday and fell by more than 2% but are still trading near seven-year highs. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - dropped below $98 a barrel. The share price gains followed weeks of declines, fuelled in part by concerns about Europe's most severe conflict since World War Two. While the sanctions against Russia include freezing bank assets and cutting off state-owned enterprises, they stopped short of disconnecting Russia from the Swift international banking system or targeting its oil and gas exports, which some analysts said had helped stock markets start to recover. ""It's not that the market is saying the war is good news. They were worried about the war and selling off, and now it's happened and paradoxically it's not as bad as the worst case scenario, at least not yet,"" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. The UK's FTSE 100 index rose 3.9%- the biggest daily gain since November 2020 when Pfizer announced a vaccine breakthrough - and stock markets in Germany and France closed more than 3.5% higher.  In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.5% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 2.2% and the Nasdaq climbed 1.6%, extending gains from Thursday. Markets in Asia also closed higher. The gains came despite fighting across Ukraine on Friday forced tens of thousands of people from their homes.  The US, UK and EU said Friday they would place sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, but China's foreign ministry also reported that Mr Putin might be willing to hold talks with Ukraine.  ""This is a very sentiment driven market right now, so if there is even a whisper that there might be willingness to talk, the market will rally and rally hard,"" said Ross Mayfield, a US-based investment strategy analyst at Baird investment bank.  ""That's not based on fundamentals. That's pure sentiment."" After the earlier global sell-off of shares, investors were also ""looking for bargains"", said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. Ms Foley told the BBC's Today programme there were many firms in emerging markets which export agricultural products and raw materials such as metals, so ""perhaps they're going to be doing well in this crisis, because other countries will be looking to buy their commodities from other markets that aren't Russian"". The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there have been concerns that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The high price of energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions, is one of the main factors currently driving up the cost of living for people in the UK. Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average fuel prices hit fresh record highs of 149.67p a litre for petrol, with diesel at 153.05p. Despite the fall on Friday, the AA predicted that petrol would hit 150p per litre over the weekend. There is a lag between crude oil and petrol price movements. Both motoring groups said the weak pound combined with crude oil prices would push up costs at the pump. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said ""sadly, more increases are on the way"" due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the pound weakening against the dollar, ""making wholesale fuel more expensive to buy for retailers in the UK"". Gas prices have seen big fluctuations since Russia's military action began. UK wholesale gas prices soared nearly 60% on Thursday but on Friday prices were down more than 18%. Russia is the second largest exporter of crude oil after Saudi Arabia. It is also the world's biggest exporter of natural gas. Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Concerns remain that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide.  Despite the inflation risk, analysts said the stock market rally reflects in part investor bets that uncertainty from the conflict will make central banks - in particular, the US Federal Reserve - move more cautiously to raise interest rates. Fear of aggressive action has been a major factor driving prices lower in recent weeks. ""With all of this uncertainty weighing, and part of that, the way high oil prices and high gas prices might weigh on consumer spending in the US, I think they'll be more hesitant,"" said Mr Mayfield of Baird."
currency fluctuations,Woman found with £2bn in Bitcoin convicted,2024-09-15,2024-03-20,By Liz Jackson & PA Media,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-68620253,"A former takeaway worker found with Bitcoin worth more than £2bn has been convicted at Southwark Crown Court of a crime linked to money laundering. Jian Wen, 42, from Hendon in north London, was involved in converting the currency into assets including multi-million-pound houses and jewellery. On Monday she was convicted of entering into or becoming concerned in a money laundering arrangement. The Met said the seizure is the largest of its kind in the UK. Although Wen was living in a flat above a Chinese restaurant in Leeds when she became involved in the criminal activity, her new lifestyle saw her move into a six-bedroom house in north London in 2017 which was rented for more than £17,000 per month. She posed as an employee of an international jewellery business and moved her son to the UK to attend private school, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. That same year, Wen tried to buy a string of expensive houses in London, but struggled to pass money-laundering checks and her claims she had earned millions legitimately mining Bitcoin were not believed. She later travelled abroad, buying jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds in Zurich, and purchasing properties in Dubai in 2019. Another suspect is thought to be behind the fraud but they remain at large. The Met said it carried out a large scale investigation as part of the case - searching several addresses, reviewing 48 electronic devices, and examining thousands of digital files including many which were translated from Mandarin. Det Ch Supt Jason Prins, whose team led the investigation, said the ""sheer scale"" of the operation ""demonstrates how international criminals seek to exploit cryptocurrency for illegal purposes"". ""This verdict and lengthy five-year investigation demonstrates that we'll leave no stone unturned in our pursuit to catch criminals who look to enjoy the proceeds of illicit funds - no matter how complex the case,"" he said. The CPS has obtained a freezing order from the High Court, while it carries out a civil recovery investigation that could lead to the forfeiture of the Bitcoin. The value of the Bitcoin was worth around £2bn at the time of initial estimates - but due to the fluctuation in the currency's value, it has since increased to around £3.4bn. CPS chief crown prosecutor Andrew Penhale said Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ""are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct"". He added this case ""illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters"". Wen is due to be sentenced on 10 May.

currency fluctuations,Why one of world’s poorest countries adopted Bitcoin,2024-09-15,2022-06-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61565485,"The Central African Republic's decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender came as a surprise to many, but the government argues that it will secure an independent financial future for the country, as the BBC's Damian Zane and Guy Bandolo report. The president seemed to be following the Elon Musk style of cryptic cryptocurrency tweets. Under the teasing heading ""More to follow"" CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadéra typed ""Vires in Numeris"" - a Latin motto meaning ""strength in numbers"" that has been associated with Bitcoin. Then came his nation's motto. This was shared with the world a month after the CAR became only the second country, following El Salvador, to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The mineral-rich nation is ranked as one of the poorest in the world - a situation complicated by a near-decade-long civil war which has devastated much of the country. The government has recruited the Russian mercenary Wagner group to help in its fight against rebels. The CAR's Bitcoin announcement left many scratching their heads and some wondering if it had more to do with a political shift away from France and towards Russia. There has certainly not been a sudden explosion in the capital, Bangui, of businesses such as shops or cafes accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment. According to an estimate from 2020, nine out of 10 Central Africans do not have access to the internet - a prerequisite for using Bitcoin. That, along with a patchy and unreliable electricity supply, led some to question whether the CAR was the right country to test the theory that cryptocurrencies were set to replace traditional forms of money. The initial decision, announced on 27 April, was accompanied by little explanation except that it would open up ""new opportunities for our country"". The ""more to follow"" that President Touadéra was referring to in his May tweet was the announcement of a project called Sango - named after one of the country's official languages. This ""visionary"" plan would create ""a fantastic opportunity for anyone who believes in crypto investing"", according to a government press release. However, the website that the press release encouraged people to visit to find out more is opaque to say the least. To go on an investor waiting list, the visitor is encouraged to sign up to receive a ""secret code"". The code provides access to a flashy slide presentation that declares that the CAR wants to build the ""first legal Crypto Hub recognized by a country's parliament, that welcomes businesses and attracts global crypto-enthusiasts"". Sango is a ""Crypto Island… the first island in the metaverse that is backed by reality"".  The people behind the presentation used a lot of ""big words"" but ""the document was not very clear on exactly what they want to do"", says Stone Atwine, a crypto-specialist who runs digital financial services company Eversend. Among the jargon seems to be a plan to allow people to invest in mining and other industries using Bitcoin and a promise that no income or corporation tax will be charged. Mr Atwine believes that this could have potential as ""a lot of cryptocurrency enthusiasts are looking for great places to build where things are legal"". The CAR has significant deposits of diamonds and gold, as well as other minerals, and Bitcoin is being seen as an easier way to attract investors to the country. ""Impenetrable bureaucracy keeps us stuck in systems that don't give us the ability to perform. The solution was to rethink our economic philosophy,"" President Touadéra said in reference to the Sango project. The plan cannot be faulted for its ambition but when it comes to cryptocurrency and ordinary Central Africans, more publicity  - and infrastructure - are clearly needed. ""I don't understand what cryptocurrency is,"" Edith Yambogaze, who sells cassava in Bangui, told the BBC. ""I have a smartphone, but I do not have good enough internet to be able to use cryptocurrency. Also, I do not trust cryptocurrency because there are people who do scams on the internet."" This scepticism seems to be matched by some in El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele promotes Bitcoin with a missionary zeal. ""El Salvador has had problems with the take-up of the Chivo Wallet,"" said Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, an academic at Warwick University specialising in cryptocurrencies. The Chivo Wallet is a government-developed app to make Bitcoin transactions easier, but recent research suggested that while there were a lot of downloads when it was launched last year, there have been virtually none in 2022. Some people told researchers that they did not trust Bitcoin. Backers of CAR's adoption of the cryptocurrency, however, are asking people to be patient. MP Jean Galvanis Ngassiyombo, who is on the National Assembly's economic, planning and finance commission, admitted that the technological infrastructure was not yet in place in the country. But he told the BBC that a fibre optic network would be installed by the end of next year which could give everyone internet access. The CAR has signed a deal with neighbouring Cameroon to share its fibre optic network in 2023. ""What the [Bitcoin] law did is anticipate that technology so, in fact, we can be ready when that technology is available to us,"" Mr Ngassiyombo said. He is a cryptocurrency investor himself and told the BBC how he gets regular updates about price fluctuations on his phone. ""I made money today,"" he laughed as he showed how the app works. It is argued that in a country where few people have bank accounts, the adoption of Bitcoin will help encourage savings and offer a safe place to store and transfer money.  But many are sceptical. Dr Viswanath-Natraj argues that while there are advantages, investor concern about the country's financial stability could in fact drive up interest rates and the volatility in the Bitcoin price could damage savings. The Cameroon-based Bank of Central African States (BEAC) oversees the CAR's currency, the CFA franc, which is backed by France and is shared by five other countries in the region. It was not happy when the law was passed. A damning letter sent in April from the bank's governor, Abbas Mahamat Tolli, to CAR's Finance Minister Hervé Ndoba said the Bitcoin law indicated that the country wanted to establish a currency that could compete with or replace the CFA. He urged CAR to scrap the law, saying it could affect financial stability in the region. The International Monetary Fund was also critical, saying that it raised ""major legal, transparency and economic policy challenges"", the financial news agency Bloomberg reported. Supporters of Bitcoin, which is hailed as a disruptive force that improves the lives of ordinary people, may not be surprised by the attitude of established economic institutions.   But the criticism and where it is coming from also indicates that the CAR's move may have political motives as well as economic ones. While France's involvement with the CFA and the fact that it is pegged to the euro ensures its stability, critics also see it as a form of neo-colonial control. They argue that it stymies economic independence and allows France, the former colonial power, to retain its influence. The Jeune Afrique journal has reported that some government ministers have a strategy of trying to break away from France. Despite the fears of the BEAC, it is highly unlikely that the CAR would give up the CFA ""as this would cause major economic disruption"", analyst Nathan Hayes from the Economist Intelligence Unit told the BBC. ""It's a populist announcement from the government, rather than a serious shift in monetary policy,"" he said. It could also signal a move towards Russia. After President Touadéra came to office in 2016, the country started shifting its strategic alliance from France. As part of this, mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group have been used to help fight rebel forces. There has been speculation that they are paid through the awarding of mining contracts but Bitcoin ""would be a way to circumvent any restrictions on payments if they wanted to move away from this in the future"", Mr Hayes said. But for the MP Mr Ngassiyombo, the move towards cryptocurrency has nothing to do with Russia. ""The way we conduct our business… depends on what the president of this country is trying to build for its own people."" And if the glossy Sango presentation is to be believed, he wants to create ""a digital future of endless possibilities""."
currency fluctuations,Inflation 'set to soar to 4% in 2017',2024-09-15,2016-11-02,Chris Johnston,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37838087,"UK inflation will quadruple to about 4% in the second half of next year and cut disposable income, a leading think tank has forecast. The rise in prices will ""accelerate rapidly"" during 2017 as the fall in sterling is passed on to consumers, according to the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR). The revised figure is sharply higher than the 3% it forecast in August. The economy also faces ""significant risks"" that could restrict growth.  ""Households have really got a choice. Do they spend less or do they start saving less?"" Dr Angus Armstrong, director of macroeconomics at NIESR, told the BBC's Today programme. He said given the savings ratio was at its lowest level since 2008, ""the most likely scenario is that they spend much less, hence the weaker [growth] forecast for next year."" Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose to 1% in September, up from 0.6% in August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said last month. That was the highest rate for nearly two years as the cost of clothes, petrol and hotel rooms increased. Inflation means inflation, but who wins? Q&A: Inflation explained The Bank of England is expected to raise its forecasts for inflation in its quarterly Inflation Report on Thursday. The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar and euro since the Brexit vote and NIESR expected sterling to remain at about $1.22 and €1.11 both this year and next. When should you start your Christmas shopping? Mystery of village's Chinese tourists solved Why are 1.4m 'checking in' to Standing Rock? The cost of a cuppa: Typhoo tea, which imports all its tea leaves, said the sharp fall in the pound meant it had no choice but to increase prices Marmite and Pot Noodles: Food manufacturer Unilever says the pound's drop forced it to raise the wholesale price of these and many of its other products, which some supermarkets have passed on to customers Wine: Online wine retailer Naked Wines said it would raise the cost of its wine by 5% from November because of increasing import costs linked to sterling Rising prices for clothes, hotel rooms and petrol drove the official rate of inflation to 1% in September, its highest level for almost two years Model trains: Hornby and Dapol have both said they've increased prices between 10 and 20% due to the higher cost of imports Apple has increased the prices of its laptop and desktop computers in the UK by hundreds of pounds citing currency fluctuations as one of the reasons Microsoft said some of its UK business service prices would go up by 22% in 2017, reflecting the pound's weakened value against the euro Simon Kirby, head of macroeconomic modelling and forecasting at NIESR, said the fall in sterling had been the most striking feature of the economic landscape since the EU referendum. ""This will pass through into consumer prices over the coming months and quarters,"" he said. ""While we expect this to be only a temporary phenomenon, it will nonetheless weigh on the purchasing power of consumers over the next couple of years."" The last time CPI inflation hit 4% was in 2011, before falling back over the last five years. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""NIESR is right to warn that households are about to endure a renewed period of falling living standards due to soaring inflation.  ""Fuel, food and technology prices already are rising in response to the weaker pound, and hefty price rises will be seen across the whole spectrum of consumer goods next year."" Apple has raised its UK prices following the slide in sterling Although the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is not likely to raise interest rates in response, according to Mr Tombs, he said that the fall in sterling meant the MPC had little room to manoeuvre. NIESR predicted that the economy would expand by 2% in 2016 - higher than its previous forecast of 1.7% - but would fall to just 1.4% growth next year. ""Rather than a significant change to our view of the future, this is largely due to revisions to historic data,"" it said.   Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said inflation hitting 4% would result in ""a major squeeze on consumer purchasing power"".  That could then make GDP growth of 1.4% in 2017 ""hard to achieve given the likely heightened uncertainties"" once the UK starts Brexit negotiations, he said. Lower growth along with uncertainty could affect hiring by companies, NIESR warned. It expected unemployment to peak at 5.6% next year, before gradually falling. The think tank also predicted that inflation would only return to the Bank of England's target of 2% in 2020.  NIESR is the UK's oldest independent economic research body and was founded in 1938.

currency fluctuations,Bitcoin: From buying a Bentley to losing it all,2024-09-15,2021-02-09,By Zoe Kleinman,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55996412,"Bitcoin has soared to trade at an eye-watering $48,000 (£34,820), following the news that Tesla has bought $1.5bn of the crypto-currency.  Enthusiasts will tell you it's the future of money - but investing in the notoriously volatile virtual currency can be a rollercoaster, and it's not without risk. The hunt for new coins, using powerful computers, is also causing a surge in energy demand - which is not so good for the environment. Here are some of your Bitcoin adventures. James Saye, tech consultant  I first invested in Bitcoin in 2017 - I was nervous about putting too much in, so I went for around £500. I cashed it in for £2,500 during one of its peaks, and had a great holiday in Iceland - the cash came in handy, Iceland is lovely but expensive. I bought in again in 2018 when the price was lower so I'm still in but I don't regret cashing out when I did. Heather Delaney, founder of Gallium Ventures I've been the silent crypto-investor. I put in £5 at the very beginning and I've built it slowly and steadily over time. I see it as a long-term strategy, meaning the rapid highs and lows are not ones that cause me anxiety - although ask me as I near my retirement and we shall see what I think then! Based on how much I have invested in Bitcoin over time versus what I see today, I have a 585.41% increase in my investment.  I've never cashed it out - but I have converted some to other currencies as the market has fluctuated. I know loads of people who have done exciting things with their investments but for me it's part of my pension plan. I know I'm not typical.  David Stubley, founder of 7 Elements cyber-security firm We had a client whose Bitcoin wallet was fraudulently accessed and all the money was transferred out of it. He had intended to use it as a deposit on a house. The man had been spooked by reports of fluctuations in the currency and decided to check his wallet. But he clicked on a fraudulent link, which led him to a phishing site, a complete clone of the real thing. He had 84 bitcoins, and the fraudsters transferred 83 of them. At the time, in 2017, they were worth $475,000. We tracked the payment on the blockchain [a kind of shared digital public ledger] - we could see it rolling across various wallets and finally it reached a wallet containing $15m of currency. While the final identity of the fraudsters could not be identified, we were able to have the wallets frozen, so at least denying access to the stolen funds. Our client was irate but philosophical. Today, that stolen Bitcoin would be worth £2.8m. Once it's gone, it really has gone. Javed Khan, independent trader  My Bitcoin journey didn't start as an investment. At first, it was a form of transferring money, I didn't have to wait for confirmation from banks and so on - it was convenient. In 2018, I noticed I'd make a transfer, leave some Bitcoin in my wallet and I'd see the prices go up - and before I knew it I was seeing profit, which surprised me. I had been telling my friends I was using it as a transfer tool, I hadn't thought about investing in it. In January 2020, I cashed in my Bitcoin profits and bought a Bentley in Dubai, where I now live. I sent a video from the showroom to my mum and she cried, she was really proud. I would only put in money that I could afford to lose. The most I've lost is the transaction fees - when the price drops I don't lose faith.  I think the best time to buy Bitcoin is when nobody's talking about it - wait for the hype to die down. Rohan Muscat, project manager and electrical engineer I became aware of Bitcoin in 2010, but being a bit of a hardware geek, I wanted to mine it. In late 2016 I bought a pair of graphics cards to mine, and at first I did pretty well with it. A start-up I'd done some consulting for gave me some Horizon State tokens (another form of crypto-currency) to pay part of my way, and in January 2017 those plus my mined assets were worth A$40,000 (£22,000). I decided to trade it a bit, and investigated bots while moving to bigger scale mining.  At first it paid for itself, but then it went downhill and was borderline break-even. My electricity bill shot up to A$500-A$600 a month, because the mining rig needed so much power. I ended up selling the mining gear, and I'm currently sitting on about A$2,000 in crypto.  I could have made more if I'd jumped in and out, but the emotions and risks in trading have burnt me, and I'd rather not take the risk.  Daniel Crocker, business owner  In 2012, I was doing an apprenticeship at an IT company. At lunchtime we used to chat about little ways of making money on the side. Nobody had really heard of Bitcoin but we decided to give it a go and we spent a few weeks on it.  It didn't last long, but luckily I kept hold of mine.  I traded them in last summer and got half the deposit for my house. I've still got a little bit but I'm just going to sit tight - it's not something I want to pin my future on.  I do know people who have gone in deep but I think I've been lucky enough already."
currency fluctuations,Stripe to ditch Bitcoin payment support,2024-09-15,2018-01-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42798935,"Stripe, the firm which helps more than 100,000 businesses do financial transactions online, is to scrap support for Bitcoin payments. It said Bitcoin users now saw the virtual currency largely as an ""asset"" to be traded, rather than something to make payments with. Fewer online merchants wanted to accept the cryptocurrency, it added.  Rising fees and longer transaction times as a result of price fluctuations also lessened its appeal, Stripe said. Customers of the US-based payments firm pay a fee to Stripe each time it processes a payment. Clients include Lyft, Deliveroo, Grab and Target. In 2014, it became the first major payments company to support Bitcoin payments. At the time Stripe said it hoped Bitcoin would become a way for people in places with low credit card penetration or prohibitively high credit card fees to do transactions online. But the virtual currency was now ""better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,"" it said.  There has been a huge surge of interest in the digital currency over the past year or so, driven largely by its rapid increase in price. But that demand has also led to huge swings in price, with Stripe saying the volatility meant the time needed to complete a sale had risen. ""By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it's for the 'wrong' amount,"" Stripe's product manager Tom Karlo said in his blog. Bitcoin transaction fees had also risen ""a great deal"" resulting in a decrease in demand from Stripe's customers to accept Bitcoin payments, he said. ""For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of US dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires,"" Mr Karlo wrote.  ""Because of this, we've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we've seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially."" Stripe said it would start winding down its support for Bitcoin immediately and would stop all transactions by 23 April. But it said its decision to end support for Bitcoin payments did not mean it was giving up on cryptocurrencies all together.  ""We're interested in what's happening with Lightning and other proposals to enable faster payments,"" Mr Karlo said. ""OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects."""
currency fluctuations,Apple hints at lower iPhone prices,2024-09-15,2019-01-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47047297,"Apple boss Tim Cook has hinted it could lower iPhone prices in some places in an attempt to boost falling sales. Revenue from the iPhone, responsible for most of the firm's profits, fell 15% in its latest financial quarter. Overall the firm's revenue was down 5% from a year ago to about $84.3bn (£64.5bn). The slowdown had been expected after the tech giant warned investors earlier this month that revenue would be about $84bn, lower than expected. The firm had blamed the issues partly on an economic slowdown in China. But chief executive Tim Cook said customers were also struggling with the firm's high prices. He said a strong dollar, which makes its products comparatively more expensive, had hurt its sales in emerging markets. At the moment, according to Apple's official website, an iPhone Xs with a 5.8in display costs from $999 (£763) in the US compared with £999 in the UK and 8,699 Yuan (£989) in China.  Mr Cook said the tech giant had started this month to re-price its phones to shield customers from the impact of currency fluctuations. ""What we have done in January in some locations and [for] some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year,"" he said. Still, executives said they expected the firm's challenges to continue. Apple predicted revenue for the three months to 31 March of $55bn-$59bn - suggesting a drop of at least 3.4% year-on-year. ""The macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to be there,"" Luca Maestri, the firm's chief financial officer, said. Apple's struggles are not unique. Global smart phone shipments contracted 5% in 2018, according to Canalys, a market analyst firm. But the firm's share price has dropped by around one third since October, amid investor concerns that buyer appetite for iPhones is weakening. Fears intensified after the firm said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sold each quarter. However, Apple shares gained more than 4% in after-hours trade on Tuesday, as the firm proved more resilient than expected. Quarterly sales revenue dropped by more than 25% in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, compared to the year before. Sales also slipped about 3% year-on-year in Europe. But in the Americas - the firm's single biggest region - sales were up almost 5%. Revenue from the services business also jumped 19% to a record $10.9bn in the quarter, which ended on the 31 December. It's Apple's worst performing quarter for years, but that's not to say investors won't be mildly relieved. After the firm's warning earlier this month that it would be posting earnings well below expectations for what is typically its blockbuster quarter, investors were well-prepared to see the drop in iPhone sales, and as a result, revenues overall. That bad news was balanced out - perhaps even cancelled out - by the good news on services.  A big increase compared to this time last year - 19% - and a very healthy gross margin of 62.8%.  Apple is transitioning, slowly, into a different kind of company that isn't so reliant on hardware, and these numbers show that so far that transition is going well.  With $245bn cash in hand, it can afford to splash out and make investors even happier with a major acquisition or two in the entertainment space (but then, I've been saying that for a while now!).  Mr Cook said he remained confident in the business, pointing to strong sales of iPad and Macs, as well as growth in its services division, which includes Apple Pay.  Overall profit in the quarter fell less than 1% to $19.97bn.  ""While it was disappointing to miss our revenue guidance, we manage Apple for the long term, and this quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide,""  he said."
currency fluctuations,Why Argentina is embracing cryptocurrency,2024-09-15,2022-04-21,By Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60912789,"In Argentina, there are traces everywhere of distrust and even trauma related to the economy. For Jerónimo Ferrer, a formative memory is of Argentina's crushing financial crisis at the end of the 1990 - when bank accounts were frozen and, almost overnight, people's savings evaporated.  He's not alone. One engineering student I spoke to keeps all his savings, in US dollars, at home because he fears that the banks will again devalue holdings overnight.  While many Argentinians are, by necessity, experts on the state of the economy - from the sky-high level of inflation to the current unofficial rate of exchange between the peso and the US dollar - Mr Ferrer has gone further than most.  Since 2019, he's run a walking tour called ""Our local crazy economy & Bitcoin tour of Buenos Aires"", where he explains to tourists the level of restrictions Argentines face, such as limits on foreign currency transactions, or bans on payments in instalments for international flights.  He also provides a primer on cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, and why he believes it is a valuable alternative to the volatile and highly-controlled Argentine peso.  ""When you have restrictions, you need tools for freedom,"" Mr Ferrer says.  For many crypto enthusiasts around the world, decentralised and digital currency is primarily about ideology or profit. But for many Argentines, it fills more basic needs.  ""I trust more mathematics and software than I trust politicians,"" Mr Ferrer explains. ""I think that Bitcoin for Argentinians should be a no-brainer."" There are other ways that the strong government intervention in the economy has helped cryptocurrency gain a footing in Argentina. For example, it's relatively cheap to run an energy-guzzling Bitcoin mining operation, because the cost of electricity is kept relatively low. Bitcoin mining is the process that creates new Bitcoin. It involves computers solving complicated maths problems. Solve the problem and you are awarded Bitcoin. It sounds simple but involves elaborate computer systems, requiring lots of electricity to run and cool them. The University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates that globally, the electricity used in Bitcoin mining to be around 137 terawatt hours per year. That's about the same as the annual use of some countries, like Norway or Poland. Producing that electricity will be contributing to global carbon dioxide emissions, but it is difficult to estimate how much. However, in Argentina such environmental issues are often eclipsed by financial concerns. For some early adopters of cryptocurrency in Argentina, even a relatively young and unpredictable currency is preferable to the extremely changeable peso.  More technology of business: Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, may also help to buffer against high inflation, since there's a finite amount of the currency that can be created.  Inflation, which measure how the cost of living changes over time, is an ever-present concern in Argentina. The year-on-year rate of inflation is staggering, at over 50%. ""In the pandemic, people noticed this situation, and to protect their money they chose to look for an asset that was limited,"" says María Mercedes Etchegoyen. Ms Etchegoyen is a lawyer specialising in intellectual property, as well as a member of the executive committee of the NGO Bitcoin Argentina. She helped start the community Cryptogirls to tap into the increased interest in cryptocurrency during the pandemic. So far, the government has taken a relaxed attitude to the cryptocurrency boo. ""In Argentina, there is no specific regulation on cryptocurrency,"" says Ms Etchegoyen. However, the Central Bank has been issuing warnings about crypto-based scams. It has acknowledged that the level of crypto use isn't high yet, but is growing rapidly and merits concern. Ms Etchegoyen is concerned about the uneven access to cryptocurrencies. So far it is the preserve of a minority - largely a young, male, tech-savvy, and relatively affluent population. It's tech workers, not farmers, who are being paid in Bitcoin.  ""Today it's not a technology that everyone can access,"" acknowledges blockchain consultant Lucia Lizardo. Yet efforts are underway to expand the reach of crypto - partly through financial products that offer a stepping stone between traditional and cryptocurrency.  Three Argentine start-ups now offer debit cards for crypto-based transactions. One of these companies, Lemon, was founded in a Patagonian town where 40% of shops accept Bitcoin. Some people in Argentina are also turning to ""stablecoins"", which are pegged to the US dollar and are therefore less prone to fluctuations in value. Of course, crypto will not provide a one-stop solution for Argentina's economic woes. And it brings its own problems of currency speculation, fraud, and its environmental impact.  Overall, though, ""I think this is like a revolution for young people,"" comments Ms Lizardo.  For Mr Ferrer, the need is clear. ""This is our money, and it's the only one that politicians can't destroy."""
currency fluctuations,Bank of England to consider digital money plan,2024-09-15,2021-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56799726,"The Bank of England and the Treasury have announced they are setting up a taskforce to explore the possibility of a central bank digital currency. The aim is to look at the risks and opportunities involved in creating a new kind of digital money. Issued by the Bank for use by households and businesses, it would exist alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them. No decision has been taken on whether to have such a currency in the UK. However, the government and the Bank want to ""engage widely with stakeholders"" on the benefits and practicalities of doing so. The taskforce will be jointly led by the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, Sir Jon Cunliffe, and the Treasury's director general of financial services, Katharine Braddick. The Bank has previously said it is interested in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) because ""this is a period of significant change in money and payments"". The use of cash in financial transactions has been steadily declining in recent years, while debit card payments have been on the rise. Use of credit cards and direct debits have also been increasing. The Bank also sees having its own digital currency as a way of ""avoiding the risks of new forms of private money creation"", including crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. ""If a CBDC were to be introduced, it would be denominated in pounds sterling, just like banknotes, so £10 of CBDC would always be worth the same as a £10 note,"" the Bank said. ""CBDC is sometimes thought of as equivalent to a digital banknote, although in some respects it may have as much in common with a bank deposit.  ""Any CBDC would be introduced alongside - rather than replacing - cash and bank deposits."" Enter Britcoin. The Bank of England has been pontificating about digital currencies for some time. Now it and the Treasury will seriously look into establishing an alternative digital currency to be used by households and businesses. The flotation of Coinbase and the stellar performance this year of various crypto-assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is the backdrop.  It would basically be a digital version of sterling, backed by the Bank of England, that could change the payments system, the plumbing of the financial system. It would not be a Bitcoin-style speculative asset with wild fluctuations in value. But there will be limited appeal for the fans of crypto, who invest precisely because of their scepticism about central banks.  Instead, the revolutionary thing here could be the direct relationship that ordinary citizens might have with the central bank, which cannot go bust. It could yield simple, direct means of stimulating the economy and even applying negative rates. Central banks would in theory know when and where every e-cash transaction occurred. China is already ahead in its digital yuan experiments. Part of the rationale is to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of financial innovation.  Most of the world's central banks are looking into the possibility of creating such a currency, but the only one already in existence is China's digital yuan, which is currently undergoing public testing. Among the objectives of the UK taskforce is monitoring international developments, ""to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of global innovation"". The Bank also announced the creation of a CDBC engagement forum and a technology forum, as well as a CBDC unit within the Bank itself, overseen by Sir Jon. No timetable was announced for the taskforce's operations."
currency fluctuations,"China won't act to devalue yuan, says Li",2024-09-15,2018-09-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45570241,"China has hit back at accusations that it is using its currency as a tool in the trade war with the US. At a forum in Tianjin, China's Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing will not actively weaken the yuan to boost exports. President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency to combat US tariffs.  Mr Li's comments come amid an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.  The Chinese premier also said at the World Economic Forum it was essential that the basic principles of ""multilateralism and free trade"" were upheld. The US has engaged in a protectionist agenda since Mr Trump took office in 2016, challenging the global system of free trade which has prevailed for decades. His accusation that China has manipulated the yuan raised concerns that the currency market could become the next front in the economic battle between the two countries.  ""The recent fluctuations in the [yuan] exchange rate have been seen by some as an intentional measure on the part of China. This is simply not true,"" Premier Li said.  ""Persistent depreciation of the [yuan] will only do more harm than good to our country. China will never go down the path of stimulating exports by devaluating its currency,"" he added.  This week, Washington raised the stakes by saying it would impose new tariffs on $200bn (£152.1bn) worth of Chinese goods from Monday. Beijing will hit back with new duties on $60bn of American imports. During his campaign for president, Mr Trump also called China a currency manipulator, but retracted those comments early last year."
currency fluctuations,Facebook reveals digital currency details,2024-09-15,2019-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48664253,"Social media giant Facebook has unveiled plans to launch a new digital currency, called Libra, next year. It said people would be able to make payments with the currency via its own apps, as well as on messaging service WhatsApp. Firms such as Uber and Visa are also likely to accept it in future, it said. But there have been concerns about how people's money and data will be protected, as well as over the potential volatility of the currency.  Facebook said Libra would be independently-managed and backed by real assets, and that paying with it would be as easy as texting.  It is the latest foray by a tech giant into the payments sector, after Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay - although none of those services are based on a crypto-currency. According to Facebook, from next year you will be able to buy Libra via its platforms and store it in a digital wallet called Calibra.  You can then send your Libra to other users, it said, ""as easily and instantly as you might send a text message"". ""In time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code, or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass."" It said transactions would be at ""low to no cost"", although the firm is expected to take a small commission on payments made through its platforms. It is a hugely ambitious - some might say megalomaniacal - project to create a new global currency.  But the message is that this is not some little side project that a small team at the firm's Menlo Park headquarters will try out for a few months before moving on to something else. This is both the future of Facebook and the future of money, an initiative which has seen an alliance of big players in payments such as Paypal and Visa, Silicon Valley players like Uber and Lyft and major venture capital firms. But there are still many questions about FaceCoin - or Libra as the firm wants us to call it. The principal one I keep coming back to is - why?  Facebook stressed Libra would be managed independently by a group of companies and charities - of which Facebook is just one - called the Libra Association. It said all the group's members were eventually likely to accept Libra, including:  Facebook also said it expected Libra would be bought and sold on currency markets in the future. Facebook said Libra was particularly aimed at the 1.7 billion adults worldwide who do not have a bank account.  It said the issue of being ""unbanked"" disproportionately affected people in developing countries, and in particular women.  However, while the social network says the currency will be global, apps and services that use Libra will need to be compliant with the regulatory regimes in the markets they operate.  While the currency already has the green light to launch in the US, it is unclear what will happen in places such as India, which has recently clamped down on digital currencies.  Reports in May suggested only about 12 markets would be ready for Libra by the time it has launched.  Facebook has faced questions from US politicians about how the currency will work, what consumer protection will be offered and how data will be secured. Other virtual-currencies such as Bitcoin have seen huge fluctuations in value, and have also been used to launder money.  Facebook meanwhile has been criticised for failing to protect its users' data in the past.  The social network hopes to prevent wild swings in the value of the currency by pegging it to a basket of well-known currencies, including the pound, US dollar, Japanese yen and euro.  Facebook also said its Calibra payments system would have strong protection to keep money and personal information safe.  It said Calibra would use the same verification and anti-fraud processes that banks and credit cards use, and would refund any money that was stolen.  This is not the first time Facebook has dabbled in digital currencies. A decade ago, it created Facebook Credits, a virtual currency that enabled people to purchase items in apps on the social networking site. However, Facebook ended the project after less than two years when it failed to gain traction. The biggest test is likely to be whether people will trust the social networking giant enough to start changing their cash for Libra. To build trust in the system, Facebook has been engaging with governments, central banks and regulators, including officials from the US Treasury and the Bank of England. "
currency fluctuations,The panics of the Fed,2024-09-15,2017-12-01,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42146214,"What do US central bankers do during a financial crisis? On a typical day, central bankers in the US spend their time monitoring bank activity and trying to understand economic data, adjusting interest rates to assist price stability and employment.  But every so often, the economy faces a financial panic that forces the Federal Reserve to take additional action. During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, that meant launching loan programs, brokering takeovers of faltering companies, and pumping trillions of dollars into the economy in a bid to stave off economic collapse.  The aggressive response marked a major shift. Remember - just a century earlier, the US didn't have a central bank at all. Here is a look at how the Fed's approach to financial crises has evolved. Panic of 1907 Panics flare when there is suddenly a rush of demand for cash - creating a credit crunch for banks and other financial institutions that have loaned out the money.  In the 1800s, without a central bank to monitor the money supply, such episodes were frequent. Even the regular harvest cycle could cause problems, since farmers needed cash all at once to pay their workers. Until the panic of 1907, however, the US was politically resistant to the idea of a central bank. That year - when cash was already tight - word spread about the failure of a financial gamble by prominent bankers.  Investors hurried to pull money from firms associated with the bankers, worried - not necessarily rationally - their own funds might be at risk. Without a central bank, a group of businessmen led by JP Morgan coordinated the response to the run, which included shoring up firms with money from the Treasury Department.  The panic stopped, but the economy took a severe hit anyway. In the aftermath, bankers and lawmakers concluded the US needed a federally-backed institution that would control the currency and serve as a lender of last resort to banks, forestalling future panics. Congress created the Federal Reserve in 1913. The Great Depression The Fed soon faced an episode that tested its ability to ward off problems.  In the late 1920s, a credit-fuelled stock market rally collapsed, and the economy entered a global recession, triggered in part by a move back to the gold standard. Thousands of banks collapsed, the unemployment rate topped 20%, and US GDP contracted by more than a third.  The Fed took some steps to try to address the crisis, but many economists say the institution should have gone further. They argue that officials were too concerned that more aggressive action would fuel risky, speculative behaviour. Some say not intervening to stop bank collapses was particularly harmful, since it led others to become cautious about lending and spending, further slowing economic activity. Eventually Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt entered the picture, creating new central banking powers, such as authority for broader lending programmes and a guarantee of most bank deposits. In some ways, however, it took the industrial boom spurred by World War II to really get the economy going again. A Meltdown Avoided On occasion, however, a lighter touch has appeared to be enough. In 1998, officials at Long Term Capital Management contacted the Federal Reserve.  The hedge fund, which counted Nobel laureates among its stars, had more than $100bn (£74.2bn) in assets, and enjoyed close ties with most major financial companies. But losses in Asian markets had brought it to the brink of failure. Worried about the consequences of a meltdown for other firms, the Fed convened a group of companies to arrange a bailout. Eventually 14 firms injected $3.6bn and took ownership stakes. The episode was resolved without bigger market problems and without using Fed funds.  But a decade later - as the US faced another crisis - some would cite it as an example of a missed opportunity when regulators should have imposed stricter rules for risky financial instruments. Financial crisis of 2007-2009 In 2007, US housing prices started to falter - a sign of cracks forming in the US economy, which would later be declared in recession.  The chair of the Fed was Ben Bernanke, a professor who had studied the Fed's response to the Great Depression and was determined to avoid its mistakes. The Fed put its traditional tools to use, slashing interest rates and injecting money into the economy with bond purchases. Then officials went further.  They convinced Congress to launch lending programmes, and engineered the takeover of failing firms, proving willing to take on bad assets to get deals done. And for the first time in decades they used the Fed's lender-of-last-resort powers to provide loans to financial companies that were not banks, including insurer AIG. The moves drew fierce backlash, and fuelled a political movement angry about a banker bailout. But supporters said it stopped financial problems from spurring a bigger recession. These days, with strong economic growth and low unemployment, the Fed has stopped or is reversing those programmes. Some analysts, however, joke that officials also want room to manoeuvre, as they are already anticipating the next panic. "
currency fluctuations,World's most expensive city to live in revealed,2024-09-15,2021-12-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59489259,"Tel Aviv has been named as the most expensive city in the world to live in, as soaring inflation and supply-chain problems push up prices globally. The Israeli city came top for the first time in a survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), climbing from fifth place last year and pushing Paris down to joint second with Singapore. Damascus, in war-torn Syria, retained its place as the cheapest in the world. The survey compares costs in US dollars for goods and services in 173 cities. The EIU said the data it collected in August and September showed that on average prices had risen 3.5% in local currency terms - the fastest inflation rate recorded over the past five years. Transport has seen the biggest price increases, with the cost of a litre of petrol up by 21% on average in the cities studied. Tel Aviv's climb to the top of the EIU's World Cost of Living rankings mainly reflected the soaring value of Israel's currency, the shekel, against the dollar. The local prices of around 10% of goods also increased significantly, especially for groceries. The survey found Tel Aviv was the second most expensive city for alcohol and transport, fifth for personal care items, and sixth for recreation. Tel Aviv's mayor, Ron Huldai, warned in an interview with the Haaretz newspaper that rising property prices - not included in the EIU's calculations - meant the city was heading towards an ""explosion"". ""Tel Aviv will become increasingly more expensive, just as the entire country is becoming more expensive,"" he said.  ""The fundamental problem is that in Israel there is no alternative metropolitan centre. In the United States, there is New York, Chicago, Miami and so on. In Britain, there's Greater London, Manchester and Liverpool. There you can move to another city if the cost of living is too onerous."" Last year, Paris, Zurich and Hong Kong shared joint first place in the EIU's survey. Zurich and Hong Kong were fourth and fifth this year, followed by New York, Geneva, Copenhagen, Los Angeles and Osaka. Tehran climbed the most in the rankings, jumping from 79th to 29th, as US economic sanctions continued to cause shortages of goods and rising import prices in Iran. The EIU said the rankings continued to be sensitive to shifts brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. ""Although most economies are now recovering as Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out, the world's major cities still experience frequent surges in cases, prompting renewed social restrictions. In many cities this has disrupted the supply of goods, leading to shortages and higher prices."" It added: ""Fluctuating consumer demand has also influenced purchasing habits, while investor confidence has affected currencies, further fuelling price rises."" The EIU said it expected price rises to moderate over the coming year as central banks cautiously increased interest rates to stem inflation. Source: EIU's World Cost of Living index"
currency fluctuations,How Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year,2024-09-15,2023-10-05,By Thomas Naadi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66947202,"Ghana - once touted as a trailblazing African economic success story - is facing an unprecedented financial crisis. This week, hundreds of protestors took to the streets in the capital Accra, calling on the governor of the Bank of Ghana and his two deputies to resign over the loss of about 60bn Ghanaian cedis ($5.2bn; £4.3bn) in the 2022 financial year. The demonstration, dubbed #OccupyBoG, was led by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) party. The protesters, dressed in red shirts, scarves and berets, chanted songs and held banners - some reading ""stop the looting, we are suffering"". The opposition claims the bank printed money illegally to lend to the government, leading to the depreciation of the currency and crippling inflation.  It has also criticised the bank for spending more than $762,000 on domestic and foreign travel, an 87% increase on the previous year, and $250m on a new office building. The opposition says these figures are recorded in an internal audit. The NDC has accused the central bank governor, Dr Ernest Addison, of recklessness and mismanagement. And while the bank has been accused of mismanagement in the past, a loss of this magnitude is unprecedented.  ""We have never seen anything like this in our history. If the Bank of Ghana wants to recover from this loss... it will take them more than 45 years,"" says economist Professor Godfred Bokpin, from the University of Ghana. The bank denies charges of mismanagement and says the losses were a result of a fluctuating exchange rate and because of non-payment of loans by state institutions. It also says the government's decision to borrow $700m from it and not pay it back in full has contributed to the crisis. The bank's governors have also been accused of fanning rampant inflation and economic hardship by their actions. ""The time when they were printing billions for the government, didn't they know that it will have repercussions?"" asks lawyer Martin Kepbu. Ghana is currently going through its worst economic crisis in a generation. Last year, the inflation rate hit a record high of 54% - and is still running at more than 40%. Multiple credit rating agencies have downgraded the nation, preventing it from borrowing money internationally. By September 2022, Ghana's total debt had surged to $55bn. This meant the government needed in excess of 70% of its income to service the debt, something it was unable to do. It subsequently defaulted on much of its debt payments.  The government was forced to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance. To secure a $3bn bailout earlier this year, the government had to agree to fulfil a number of requirements.  The most important of these was to reduce the nation's debt interest payments to a manageable level by 2028. This would leave them with enough funds to run the economy. To achieve this, Ghana's government began debt restructuring by renegotiating terms with its creditors, proposing lower interest rates on their loans and longer repayment terms to relieve pressure on public finances. However, some creditors refused to take part in this debt exchange programme. On 9 August the Bank of Ghana issued a statement saying the government had told it that it didn't have enough money to meet the IMF's requirements and consequently would not repay half of the $700m it had borrowed from the bank.  Instead the money would go towards the debt restructuring. It also said it would not pay any interest due to the bank.  The bank is the lender of last resort and experts say its status has been abused by the government, led by President Nana Akufo-Addo, and the rules of the bank have been broken. ""The Bank of Ghana Act is very clear that printing money or financing the government is limited to 5% of the previous year's fiscal revenue, which means that in principle supporting the government is not a crime but don't go beyond 5%,"" says Professor Bokpin.   The bank's officials are mandated by law to report to parliament if the 5% threshold is exceeded. A failure to report could lead to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. None of this means the Bank of Ghana has gone broke. It is not a commercial bank that has to make a profit, so the loss should not affect its routine operations and as the lender of last resort it can always create its own money.  But according to experts, the central bank's loss has significant ramifications. It undermines the moral authority of the bank to supervise Ghana's commercial banks. It also damages confidence in the country's financial system. Although other central banks around the world have faced similar challenges, the difference in Ghana is the amount of money lost compared with the size of the economy. In the UK, the Bank of England will be making a net loss of about $180bn over the next 10 years which will be funded by the UK government. But the size of the UK economy is in the trillions of dollars. Bright Simons, a Ghanaian social innovator and writer, says that the bank cannot compare its losses with those of other countries. ""Their attempt to deflect blame and point to losses by other central banks doesn't make sense as the scale of their losses far outstrips those of other peer banks.  ""A lot of the mess is down to the bank's accommodative stance on the government's loose fiscal policy,"" he says.  In other words, by creating money the bank has allowed the government to live beyond its means. A World Bank report last month estimated that 850,000 Ghanaians have drifted into poverty because of high inflation. Ghanaians' incomes have been eroded, affecting their purchasing power. The prices of food, fuels and utilities remain high, and many households are struggling to make ends meet. And on top of all that, the central bank is now under scrutiny from both within the country and the IMF.  Under the terms of the IMF loan, if the government demands more bailouts, the bank will have no choice but to refuse."
currency fluctuations,Man Utd will not pay dividend in 2023,2024-09-15,2022-12-08,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63912042,"Executive co-chairmen and directors Avram Glazer (left) and Joel Glazer (right) are considering selling Manchester United Manchester United have opted not to pay a semi-annual dividend to shareholders in the 2023 financial year, in response to the increased investment in Erik ten Hag's playing squad. The controversial dividends have been paid since 2015. In the last financial year, £33.6m was paid in dividends - mainly to the Glazer family. United are the only Premier League club to pay a dividend, which has been one source of anger among the club's fans.  The news was contained in United's first quarter financial results and comes just over a fortnight after the American family confirmed they were considering selling the club they have owned since 2005. In addition, the Old Trafford club confirmed it was amending its annual EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) forecast from £100m-£110m to £125m-£140m ""as a result of reduced player wage costs"". Evidently, a significant proportion of the £25m difference relates to Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo's contract, which was cancelled last month. Overall revenue for the period was £143.7m, an increase of 13.6% on the same quarter last year, with wages reducing by £6.2m despite a number of new signings in the summer, due to the 25% reduction on salaries triggered by the failure to qualify for this season's Champions League.  Whilst the club's US debt remains unchanged at $650m, the fluctuation in currency exchange rates means that was £577.4m on 30 September 2022, compared to £476.2m 12 months earlier. The news that dividends would not be paid has been welcomed by the Manchester United Supporters Trust, which added: ""Dividends should not be paid when the club is not achieving success on the pitch, challenging for top honours. ""That is rewarding failure and removes the incentive for the owners to ensure sufficient reinvestment of profits back into the club. ""Our view is that no further dividends should be paid while new investment and ownership remain unresolved.

currency fluctuations,Fact-checking Iran's presidential election,2024-09-15,2021-06-16,By Reality Check and BBC Monitoring,https://www.bbc.com/news/57485108,"Iranians will choose a new president on Friday, after three years of economic hardship under reimposed US sanctions and two government crackdowns on nationwide protests. After a selection process that saw many would-be candidates disqualified, seven approved candidates held three televised debates.  The man regarded as the favourite is hard-line cleric Ebrahim Raisi, head of Iran's judiciary.  We've looked at some claims made about his record, and others. Two candidates - moderate Abdolnaser Hemmati, a former central bank governor, and reformist former vice-president Mohsen Mehralizadeh (who dropped out on Wednesday)  - claimed Mr Raisi had: Mr Raisi replied no website or newspaper had been blocked or shut down since he had become judiciary chief, in March 2019. But the encrypted messaging and voice-call app Signal, known for its high security, was blocked in January, after a huge surge in downloads by Iranian users.  And Seda, a moderate weekly, was shut down in May 2019, after publishing an image of a US warship on its front cover and running an editorial about rising tensions between Tehran and Washington. Mr Raisi has been ""behind many moves that have tightened the space of online freedoms in Iran"", Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, said. ""His judiciary has been behind arrests of administrators of Telegram channels and Instagram users who post content about the rights of minorities, LGBTQ rights, or activism about mandatory hijab,"" she added.  The judiciary under Mr Raisi has also pursued the possibility of blocking or limiting access to Instagram, one of the only major social-media platforms still available to Iranians, according to Factnameh, an Iranian fact-checking service based outside the country. Mr Raisi also came in for criticism over the fate of those arrested when an increase in petrol prices sparked protests in towns and cities across Iran, in November 2019.  The unrest prompted a bloody crackdown by the security forces.  Amnesty International said more than 304 people had been killed, while a Reuters news agency report put the death toll at 1,500.  But the Iranian authorities dismissed both figures. Official figures have not been released but the spokesman for the Iranian parliament's national security committee said, at the time, about 7,000 had been arrested.  And in the final debate, Mr Mehralizadeh challenged Mr Raisi to ask Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to pardon the remaining detainees. Mr Raisi replied most ""have been pardoned by the supreme leader, except those who had relations with other countries or had a special issue"".  But he gave no figures and it is unclear whether he was referring to the protesters arrested and then freed or those who went on to face criminal proceedings. Mr Raisi also claimed the judiciary had temporarily released tens of thousands of prisoners, to reduce Covid transmission in prisons, adding: ""Nowhere else in the world has this been done.""    But India, Indonesia, Turkey and Iraq have also granted temporary release to prisoners during the pandemic.  Amnesty International says some of the Iranian protesters arrested have been granted pardons or temporary releases in the past year ""But the authorities have not provided any specific information about the number of people who remain detained... the charges they face or the status of their cases,"" according to Amnesty.  Last September, the human rights organisation said it had recorded the names and details of more than 500 protesters subjected to criminal investigations following the unrest.  Also in the final debate, Mr Mehralizadeh said Mr Raisi's campaign had held a large rally, on 9 June, with no social distancing or masks, in the city of Ahvaz, to ""show off"". Mr Raisi replied the gathering had received a relevant permit and followed official Covid protocols.  But after the debate, the body in charge of Iran's Covid response released a statement saying: Hard-line candidate Mohsen Rezaei, a former Revolutionary Guards chief, said Mr Hemmati had so devalued the Iranian currency, the rial, that ""the train of the revolution has turned into a scooter"".  Another candidate, hard-line MP Alireza Zakani, who dropped out in favour of Mr Raisi on Wednesday, accused Mr Hemmati of ""destroying the national currency"". But the rial has lost its value at various points during the past few years. And by July 2018, when Mr Hemmati became central-bank governor, its value against the US dollar was already plummeting.  ""Iran's currency had already begun to shed value because goods imports were becoming more expensive and a lot of export revenue was getting suppressed,"" Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said. And Mr Hemmati ""set up a centralised system for the country's currency market, making the purchase of foreign currency more reliable and transparent for Iranian companies"". The election of President Joe Biden also gave some hope US sanctions might be eased as part of efforts to revive the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal.  But the value of the currency, also affected by the coronavirus pandemic and oil-price fluctuations, still remains far below its level of three years ago.

currency fluctuations,Germania airline files for bankruptcy,2024-09-15,2019-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47127921,"Budget airline Germania has filed for bankruptcy and cancelled all of its flights with immediate effect. The Berlin-based airline, which flew to destinations across Europe, Africa and the Middle East, transported more than four million passengers a year. It blamed rising fuel prices and currency fluctuations as two factors. ""We ultimately failed to successfully complete our financing efforts to meet short-term liquidity needs,"" said managing director Karsten Balke. ""We very much regret that, as a consequence, we had no choice but to file for bankruptcy."" The company said that passengers who had booked flights as part of a package should contact their tour operator to make different arrangements, but added that people who booked directly with them were not entitled to a replacement flight. It is another blow to the German air industry after the country's second biggest carrier at the time, Air Berlin, filed for insolvency in August 2017. And it follows more recent problems among other budget carriers. On Monday, Ryanair posted its first quarterly loss since March 2014, when announcing a net loss of €19.6m (£17.2m) for the last three months of 2018. And last week, Norwegian Air announced that it wants to raise 3bn Norwegian kroner (£268m) through a rights issue to improve its finances. Other airlines like Wow and Flybe are looking for buyers."
currency fluctuations,Dating app Tinder swipes left on chief executive,2024-09-15,2022-08-03,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62402874,"Tinder chief executive Renate Nyborg is leaving the firm less than a year after becoming the boss of the dating app. Her exit was one of a number of management changes at Tinder announced by parent company Match Group. Tinder's plans to adopt new technology, including virtual currencies and metaverse-based dating, are also being reviewed in the strategic shake-up. The announcements came as Match reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street expectations. ""Today we're announcing the departure of Tinder CEO Renate Nyborg, and I have made some changes to the management team and structure that I am confident will help deliver Tinder's full potential,"" Match Group chief executive Bernard Kim said in a letter to shareholders. Mr Kim will take up the role vacated by Ms Nyborg while the company looks for a permanent chief executive for Tinder. ""I have loved every moment of the last two years, working with an I.N.C.R.E.D.I.B.L.E team on the magic of human connection,"" Ms Nyborg said in a LinkedIn post. The announcement also included the reorganisation of Tinder's top management team as well as a review of plans for rolling out new technology. ""After seeing mixed results from testing Tinder Coins, we've decided to take a step back and re-examine that initiative... we also intend to do more thinking about virtual goods,"" Mr Kim added. It came as Match - which also owns the dating apps OkCupid, Hinge and Plenty of Fish - said it expects sales in the three months to the end of September to be between $790m to $800m. That was well below Wall Street expectations and would mean the company would see no sales growth for the period. Mr Kim pointed to the impact of the pandemic on people's willingness to start using dating apps and currency fluctuations for the disappointing figures. ""While people have generally moved past lockdowns and entered a more normal way of life, their willingness to try online dating products for the first time hasn't yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,"" he said. Match Group shares fell by more than 20% in after-hours trade in New York on Tuesday. Ms Nyborg became Tinder's first female chief executive in September last year. Mr Kim was appointed as Match's chief executive in May after his predecessor Shar Dubey stepped down after just over two years in the role. You may also be interested in:"
currency fluctuations,Stripe to ditch Bitcoin payment support,2024-09-15,2018-01-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42798935,"Stripe, the firm which helps more than 100,000 businesses do financial transactions online, is to scrap support for Bitcoin payments. It said Bitcoin users now saw the virtual currency largely as an ""asset"" to be traded, rather than something to make payments with. Fewer online merchants wanted to accept the cryptocurrency, it added.  Rising fees and longer transaction times as a result of price fluctuations also lessened its appeal, Stripe said. Customers of the US-based payments firm pay a fee to Stripe each time it processes a payment. Clients include Lyft, Deliveroo, Grab and Target. In 2014, it became the first major payments company to support Bitcoin payments. At the time Stripe said it hoped Bitcoin would become a way for people in places with low credit card penetration or prohibitively high credit card fees to do transactions online. But the virtual currency was now ""better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,"" it said.  There has been a huge surge of interest in the digital currency over the past year or so, driven largely by its rapid increase in price. But that demand has also led to huge swings in price, with Stripe saying the volatility meant the time needed to complete a sale had risen. ""By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it's for the 'wrong' amount,"" Stripe's product manager Tom Karlo said in his blog. Bitcoin transaction fees had also risen ""a great deal"" resulting in a decrease in demand from Stripe's customers to accept Bitcoin payments, he said. ""For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of US dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires,"" Mr Karlo wrote.  ""Because of this, we've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we've seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially."" Stripe said it would start winding down its support for Bitcoin immediately and would stop all transactions by 23 April. But it said its decision to end support for Bitcoin payments did not mean it was giving up on cryptocurrencies all together.  ""We're interested in what's happening with Lightning and other proposals to enable faster payments,"" Mr Karlo said. ""OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects."""
currency fluctuations,Apple hints at lower iPhone prices,2024-09-15,2019-01-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47047297,"Apple boss Tim Cook has hinted it could lower iPhone prices in some places in an attempt to boost falling sales. Revenue from the iPhone, responsible for most of the firm's profits, fell 15% in its latest financial quarter. Overall the firm's revenue was down 5% from a year ago to about $84.3bn (£64.5bn). The slowdown had been expected after the tech giant warned investors earlier this month that revenue would be about $84bn, lower than expected. The firm had blamed the issues partly on an economic slowdown in China. But chief executive Tim Cook said customers were also struggling with the firm's high prices. He said a strong dollar, which makes its products comparatively more expensive, had hurt its sales in emerging markets. At the moment, according to Apple's official website, an iPhone Xs with a 5.8in display costs from $999 (£763) in the US compared with £999 in the UK and 8,699 Yuan (£989) in China.  Mr Cook said the tech giant had started this month to re-price its phones to shield customers from the impact of currency fluctuations. ""What we have done in January in some locations and [for] some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year,"" he said. Still, executives said they expected the firm's challenges to continue. Apple predicted revenue for the three months to 31 March of $55bn-$59bn - suggesting a drop of at least 3.4% year-on-year. ""The macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to be there,"" Luca Maestri, the firm's chief financial officer, said. Apple's struggles are not unique. Global smart phone shipments contracted 5% in 2018, according to Canalys, a market analyst firm. But the firm's share price has dropped by around one third since October, amid investor concerns that buyer appetite for iPhones is weakening. Fears intensified after the firm said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sold each quarter. However, Apple shares gained more than 4% in after-hours trade on Tuesday, as the firm proved more resilient than expected. Quarterly sales revenue dropped by more than 25% in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, compared to the year before. Sales also slipped about 3% year-on-year in Europe. But in the Americas - the firm's single biggest region - sales were up almost 5%. Revenue from the services business also jumped 19% to a record $10.9bn in the quarter, which ended on the 31 December. It's Apple's worst performing quarter for years, but that's not to say investors won't be mildly relieved. After the firm's warning earlier this month that it would be posting earnings well below expectations for what is typically its blockbuster quarter, investors were well-prepared to see the drop in iPhone sales, and as a result, revenues overall. That bad news was balanced out - perhaps even cancelled out - by the good news on services.  A big increase compared to this time last year - 19% - and a very healthy gross margin of 62.8%.  Apple is transitioning, slowly, into a different kind of company that isn't so reliant on hardware, and these numbers show that so far that transition is going well.  With $245bn cash in hand, it can afford to splash out and make investors even happier with a major acquisition or two in the entertainment space (but then, I've been saying that for a while now!).  Mr Cook said he remained confident in the business, pointing to strong sales of iPad and Macs, as well as growth in its services division, which includes Apple Pay.  Overall profit in the quarter fell less than 1% to $19.97bn.  ""While it was disappointing to miss our revenue guidance, we manage Apple for the long term, and this quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide,""  he said."
currency fluctuations,El Salvador divided over Bitcoin legal tender law,2024-09-15,2021-09-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58438525,"There is growing scepticism in El Salvador as the country prepares to be the first in the world to recognise Bitcoin as legal tender on 7 September.  The government has presented the measure as a way to boost economic development and jobs.  Polls suggest Salvadorians are not prepared for the move, and the World Bank has warned against its adoption.  Analysts say it is an ""attention-seeking move"" from an ""authoritative regime"".  Next week's landmark day follows a vote by lawmakers in June to legalise the crypto-currency.  Under the country's Bitcoin Law, businesses will be obliged to accept it or the US dollar, the country's other official currency, as payment. More than 200 new cash machines are being installed across El Salvador to enable dollars to be converted into Bitcoin. El Salvador's government is offering $30 (£22) in free bitcoins to encourage citizens to use its national wallet, which is accessed via an online app. El Salvador been divided by the move since it was announced.  Recent protests in the capital, San Salvador, have demonstrated a lack of confidence among citizens, many of whom are still unfamiliar with crypto-currency.  A survey by the Central American University (UCA) found that only 4.8% of the 1,281 asked understood what Bitcoin was and how it was used.  More than 68% of those questioned said they disagreed with using crypto-currency as a legal tender. More than two million Salvadorian workers in other countries send money to their families back home. Remittances make up around 20% of the country's GDP.  Those favouring the move have suggested that using Bitcoin could make sending money home cheaper.  However, others argue otherwise.  ""A recent academic paper showed the exchange costs may actually end up being even higher,"" warned crypto-analyst Glen Goodman.  ""It is also being imposed on small businesses against their wishes. According to a Chamber of Commerce survey, 82.5% of respondents do not want to receive remittances in Bitcoin, mainly because its price is so volatile and unpredictable. ""If it is not broken, it is fair to ask President [Nayib] Bukele why he is trying to fix it. I have not heard a convincing answer so far,"" added Mr Goodman.  Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says the country's poorest are likely to be the ones who benefit least from the move.  ""El Salvador is tiny, in terms of economy. This looks like nothing more than an attention-seeking move by the autocratic regime,"" he said.  ""Bitcoin is intrinsically bad as a means of payment since it is quite costly for small transactions."" Bitcoin, a virtual asset with no direct connection to the real economy, has experienced large fluctuations in value over the years. It fell sharply in May after a crackdown in China and a decision by Elon Musk's Tesla not to accept it as payment any more. However, it has since recovered, rising above $50,000 (£36,000) for the first time in three months in late August."
currency fluctuations,What's gone wrong for Apple?,2024-09-15,2018-11-21,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46281768,"Apple was once the, well, apple of Wall Street's eye. The first US company to achieve a trillion dollar market value, the tech giant boasted trend-setting products, a cash pile larger than the economy of some countries and consumers so loyal they would camp out overnight. But in recent weeks, the California firm has fallen sharply out of favour. Its share price has tumbled more than 20% since October, hurting other stocks and infecting the wider market. The firm's share price is now trading below $180, and remains up only about 2.3% for 2018. So what's taken the shine off Apple?  In September, Apple unveiled a new line-up of products but it isn't clear if that the excitement they generated is translating into sales.  The number of products Apple shifted was relatively flat in its most recent quarter and the firm's forecast of 0-5% year-on-year revenue growth for the holiday season - typically a time when families stock up on the latest gadgets - disappointed investors, triggering a steep market sell-off. Recent announcements of production cuts at some of the firm's suppliers - such as Lumentum - heightened the anxiety, even though such moves are notoriously difficult to interpret. Apple exacerbated matters with its decision to stop saying how many iPhones, iPads and other products it has sold each quarter, raising suspicions that it had something to hide.  ""The iPhone unit metrics being pulled ... was the straw that broke the camel's back on Apple's stock,"" said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities. In recent years, Apple has responded to a slowdown in smart phone sales by raising prices - a move that has helped the company enjoy record revenues, even while the industry generally contracts. But global and US growth is expected to slow, and recent data on consumer spending has been mixed.  With Apple demanding $750 for the cheapest of its new iPhones, it is at risk in the event of a slowdown. And its own sales forecasts have exacerbated those worries. ""Clearly the average selling price trend can't continue forever,"" said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA. ""I think the real concern out there for investors is how long can they keep this going."" Apple has identified its services business - which includes items such as ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store - as the next big growth driver. It aims to book $50bn in services revenue by 2020, drawing on its large user base. But investors generally still have a lot of questions. For example, Apple hasn't formally shared its plans for television and movies and its goals for breaking into the health industry also remain relatively obscure. Analysts will have to adjust to a business driven by smaller, regular payments, instead of big hardware hits, said Carolina Milanesi analyst at market research firm Creative Strategies. But Ms Milanesi thinks worries are premature, for now. ""If we know that sales for the iPhones are going to be either flat or down and then there's nothing else to compensate that, then of course there are reasons for concern but I think it's too early,"" she said. ""In a year's time, if we don't see the services business pick up in the way we expect, then I think the concerns could be legitimate."" The technology sector overall has been hit hard in recent weeks, as investors flee an industry that had driven market gains earlier in the year. However, until Apple's update to investors on 1 November, the turmoil left its shares relatively unscathed by comparison. Now the iPhone maker has also been infected by the market fears, of which there are plenty, including overly optimistic valuations, rising interest rates, currency fluctuation and US-China trade tensions. China, in particular, is a risk some are watching for Apple, since the Greater China region - which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan - is the source of about 20% of the firm's revenue.   It also relies on manufacturers there, though its products have been spared from tariffs so far. ""It's definitely a white knuckle period,"" said Mr Ives. But, he added, that he remains optimistic about Apple's fortunes over the longer term. ""This product cycle does not appear to be hitting the levels the bulls were hoping for,"" he said. ""But I don't believe that there is a broader change in the Apple story if we look out over the next two, three, four years."""
currency fluctuations,Why currency crash does not worry Turkey's Erdogan,2024-09-15,2021-12-03,By Ozge Ozdemir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59487912,"Turkey's national currency has plummeted 45% against the dollar this year and yet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doesn't seem all that bothered. The lira has flirted with record lows this week, but Turkey's long-time leader is pressing ahead with his ""economic war of independence"", backed up by low interest rates. So why is Mr Erdogan pushing a model that critics warn risks soaring inflation, higher unemployment and poverty, and what does it mean for Turks? The simple reason for the Turkish lira's collapse is his unorthodox economic policy of keeping interest rates low to boost Turkey's economic growth and export potential with a competitive currency. For many economists, if inflation goes up you control it by raising interest rates. But Mr Erdogan sees interest rates as ""an evil that make the rich richer and the poor poorer"". ""Everything is so expensive,"" Sevim Yildirim told the BBC at a local fruit market. ""It's impossible even to cook a main course for a family with these prices."" Annual inflation has surged above 21% in Turkey, but the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, overhauled by Mr Erdogan, has just lowered interest rates from 16% to 15%, the third cut this year.  Inflation is rising around the world, and central banks are talking about hiking interest rates. But not here, because Mr Erdogan believes ultimately inflation will fall. In the past two years he has sacked three central bank presidents and only this week replaced his finance minister. And so the lira continues to drop. Turkey's economy is heavily dependent upon imports for producing goods from foods to textiles, so the rise of the dollar against the lira has a direct impact on the price of consumer products. Take the tomato, a vital ingredient in Turkish cuisine. To grow tomatoes, producers need to buy imported fertilisers and gas. Tomato prices were up 75% in August, compared with the year before, according to the chamber of commerce in the south coast agricultural hub of Antalya. ""How can we make money out of this?"" asks Sadiye Kaleci, who farms grapes in Pamukova, a small town three hours' drive from Istanbul. ""We sell cheap, but buying costs are expensive,"" she complains, citing high costs of diesel, fertiliser and sulphur, which is thrown on the vines. Another farmer, Feride Tufan, complains the only way she can get by is by selling her assets: ""We can pay off our debt by selling our land and vineyards. But when we sell everything, we'll have nothing left."" The currency has become so volatile that prices are changing daily. Inflation for producers alone is up 50%. ""I've cut down on all my expenses,"" says Hakan Ayran, out shopping at a market. ""To pay the bills everybody eats less and nobody buys stuff.""  Supermarket employees post price hikes on social media, showing before and after labels for products. They range from margarine (above) and olive oil to tea, coffee, detergent and toilet paper. A bakery in Turkey's third city, Izmir, put up a sign explaining its higher prices by listing surging costs of ingredients such as flour, oil and sesame, signing off with the message: ""May God be with us."" Foreign currency debt is a problem for the private sector and most companies have found it is more profitable to hold products in storage rather than sell them, because of the lira's volatility and inflation. It all adds up to more poverty and a widening gap in income and wealth equality. Queues form outside petrol stations and outside local government offices offering cheap bread.  And opposition parties have called for snap elections and rallies. When the lira slumped 18% in one day on 23 November, there were small protests and dozens of arrests. But the most visible display of public dissent is among younger Turks on Twitter, Twitch live streams, TikTok videos and YouTube. ""I am not happy with this government at all. I cannot see a future for myself in this country,"" one young person told a reporter from a YouTube channel. One in five young people in Turkey is out of work; it is even worse among women. Turkey has the world's fourth highest rate of youth not in employment, education or training, according to the OECD. Turkey's youth compare their living standards with those in other countries and do not like what they see.  ""For a young person in the US or Europe, it's easy to buy an iPhone with their salary,"" says one 18-year-old. ""Even if I work for months and months, I cannot afford it. I don't deserve that."" This generation is poised to play an important role in politics in Turkey, ruled by Mr Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) since 2002. Almost nine million Turks born since the late 1990s will be eligible to vote in the next election in 2023 and that could spell trouble for the AKP. One video that went viral showed a mother praising President Erdogan to a reporter, while her eight-year-old son contradicted her, pointing out his poor handling of recent disasters. The ruling party's success was partly down to a flood of foreign funding after the 2008 financial crisis. But much of Turkey's economic growth came from government spending and lending that favoured the construction industry. As a result production continues to depend on imports and the economy is at the mercy of currency  fluctuations. Few hold out hope of Mr Erdogan's new economic model coming to the rescue of the Turkish lira.  Amid such uncertainty, economist Arda Tunca says all bets are off for what happens next. ""This is the first time we're using a model completely beyond economic theory. Even when there were crises we could guess what would happen. Now it's impossible,"" he said."
currency fluctuations,Six charts that explain Iran protests,2024-09-15,2018-01-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42553516,"The biggest anti-government protests in Iran for nearly a decade have been fuelled by rising discontent, in particular over the cost of living. Here are six charts that help explain the hardships faced by ordinary Iranians. Iran's economy was badly affected for several years by sanctions imposed by the international community over the country's nuclear programme.  Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 1.4% in 2015 - the year President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, agreed with world powers to limit Iran's sensitive nuclear activities. In 2016, after the deal was implemented and most sanctions were lifted, the economy bounced back sharply and GDP grew 12.3%, according to the Central Bank of Iran. Much of that growth was attributed to the oil and gas industry. Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said growth had begun to spread to the non-oil sector, and predicted that GDP would expand by 4.2% in the 2017/18 fiscal year. The recovery has nevertheless not been as significant as many Iranians hoped.  Analysts point to the fact that US sanctions on financial transactions with Iran have remained in place, which has deterred foreign companies from doing business there. And in October, US President Donald Trump refused to recertify the nuclear deal and called on Congress to consider restoring sanctions. Inflation has fluctuated greatly in Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979.  In 2013, the rate hit 31% as the economic sanctions reduced Iran's oil revenue and led to its currency, the rial, being devalued by more than 450%. Inflation has steadily decreased under Mr Rouhani. In 2016 it was 11%, according to the Central Bank of Iran. The World Bank expects inflation to remain below 12% over the next three years. Mr Rouhani has proposed a budget for the fiscal year starting in March 2018 that would see expenditure rise about 6% to $104bn. However, that would represent a cut in real terms at the current inflation rate. The official unemployment rate is 12.4%, but in some parts of the country it is more than 60%, according to Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli.  Young people - more than half of the population of 79.9 million is under 30 - are among the worst affected. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that 26.7% of 15-24 year olds are unemployed. Underemployment is also high - 12.4% - among 15-24 year olds, according to the ILO. The IMF has warned that despite the high economic growth rate, not enough jobs are being created to absorb the large number of people entering the labour market. Analysts say that is because most of the recovery can be attributed to the oil industry, which is not labour-intensive. Smartphones have played an important role in the current protests. People used the messaging app Telegram, which has millions of users in Iran, to organise protests and share videos and photographs taken with their phone cameras. When Telegram refused to suspend popular channels, the Iranian authorities blocked access to the app. In 2009, when millions of people took to the streets of Tehran to demand the re-run of a disputed presidential election, there were some 55m mobile subscriptions in Iran. However, only about 2% are believed to have been for smartphones. Today, there are more than 80m mobile subscriptions and 41% of households are estimated to have access to at least one smartphone. A recent investigation by BBC Persian found that on average, Iranians have become 15% poorer in real terms over the past decade. The World Bank says that poverty in Iran fell between 2009 and 2013 to about 8%, although it increased to 10.5% in 2014 - President Rouhani's first year in office.  It estimates that 8.2 million people were living on less than $5.50 per day in 2014. About 2%, or 196,000 people, were living on less than $1.90. Low-income families are dependent on a monthly cash transfer from the government worth about $13 that some 77 million Iranians receive. Mr Rouhani's draft budget would cut the payments by $5.3bn in total, which would reportedly affect 30 million people on higher incomes. He also proposed raising the price of petrol by 50%, from $0.30 per litre to $0.45. The consumption of bread, milk and red meat in Iranian households had decreased by between 30% and 50% over the past 10 years, according to BBC Persian.   With Iranians becoming poorer in real terms and the prices of many basic foodstuffs increasing by about 40% in the past year, many people simply cannot afford to buy as much food. A 50% rise in the price of eggs - the result of a nationwide hen shortage caused by an outbreak of bird flu - was reportedly a trigger for the protest in Mashhad, the first in the latest unrest which quickly spread across the country. BBC Persian service's Behrang Tajdin contributed to this story."
currency fluctuations,UK manufacturing 'sees stronger growth',2024-09-15,2017-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41831945,"British manufacturers reported stronger growth in October, driven by higher domestic demand and export orders. The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 56.3 last month, from 56 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. It was the fifteenth consecutive month of expansion for the sector, and will fuel debate over whether the economy is ready for an interest rate rise.  The news sent the pound to its highest against the dollar since early October. Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.331. The pound also rose 0.3% versus the euro to €1.143, marking its highest level against the eurozone currency since early June. ""UK manufacturing made an impressive start to the final quarter of 2017 as increased inflows of new work encouraged firms to ramp up production,"" said Rob Dobson, a senior economist at IHS Markit. The report said the UK domestic market was the prime source of new manufacturing orders. However, growth of the consumer goods sector fell to a seven-month low as new contracts eased. New export orders increased at a slightly slower pace as well, according to IHS Markit, due to the recent fluctuations in the pound sterling. More than 50% of manufacturers surveyed said they expected output to be higher in one year's time.  However, Duncan Brock, a director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, which compiled the survey with IHS, warned about rising commodity prices and competition for raw materials. Manufacturers, he said, faced an ""endless onslaught of inflationary pressures"" caused by rising commodity prices and competition for raw materials. He added that the PMI data ""should not lull anyone into a false sense of security, as the Brexit negotiations are still causing some jitters amongst clients""."
currency fluctuations,El Salvador makes Bitcoin legal tender,2024-09-15,2021-06-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57398274,"El Salvador has become the first country in the world to officially classify Bitcoin as legal currency. Congress approved President Nayib Bukele's proposal to embrace the cryptocurrency, with 62 out of 84 possible votes on Tuesday night. The president said the government had made history, and that the move would make it easier for Salvadoreans living abroad to send money home. Bitcoin will become legal tender, alongside the US dollar, in 90 days. The new law means every business must accept Bitcoin as legal tender for goods or services, unless it is unable to provide the technology needed to do the transaction. ""It will bring financial inclusion, investment, tourism, innovation and economic development for our country,"" President Bukele said in a tweet shortly before the vote. He has previously said the move will open up financial services to the 70% of Salvadoreans who do not have bank accounts. El Salvador's economy relies heavily on remittances, or money sent home from abroad, which make up around 20% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). More than two million Salvadoreans live outside the country, but they continue to keep close ties to their place of birth, sending back more than $4bn (£2.8bn) each year. On Twitter, some financial and legal observers described the law change as a remarkable accomplishment and a game changer, while others raised concerns about the cryptocurrency's volatility. Experts have warned it could also complicate matters with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where El Salvador is seeking a more than $1 billion programme. The Congress vote happened on the same day that former US President Donald Trump said he saw Bitcoin as a ""scam"". ""I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar,"" he told Fox Business.  He added that he wanted the dollar to be ""the currency of the world"". Bitcoin, a virtual asset with no direct connection to the real economy, has seen large fluctuations in value over the years.   Most of the world's central banks are looking into the possibility of creating their own digital currencies. In April, the Bank of England announced it was looking into creating a digital money that would exist alongside cash and bank deposits."
currency fluctuations,Prolific hacker ordered to pay back £922k,2024-09-15,2019-08-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-49450676,"A hacker who carried out cyber attacks on more than 100 companies has been ordered to pay back £922,978.14 of cryptocurrency. Grant West had been jailed for fraud after carrying out attacks on brands such as Sainsbury's, Uber and Argos. A police investigation, codename ""Operation Draba"", uncovered West's activity on the dark web under the moniker of ""Courvoisier"". The confiscation order was made during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court.  West, from Sheerness, Kent, used phishing email scams to obtain the financial data of tens of thousands of customers.  He would then sell this personal data in different market places on the dark web, convert the profit made from selling financial details online into cryptocurrency, and store these in multiple accounts. West, of Ashcroft Caravan Park, was jailed in May at Southwark Crown Court for 10 years and eight months. Detectives had discovered evidence of West conducting cyber attacks on the websites of 17 major firms. Following West's arrest, approximately £1m in cryptocurrency was seized from a number of his accounts. Taking currency fluctuations into account the currency is today valued at £922, 978.14. The cryptocurrency will now be sold and the victims will receive compensation. As well as financial data, he also sold cannabis which he shipped to customers, and ""how to"" guides instructing others how to carry out cyber attacks. West also regularly used stolen credit card details to pay for items for himself, including holidays, food, shopping and household goods. West admitted conspiracy to defraud, possession of criminal property, unauthorised modification of computer material and various drugs offences.

currency fluctuations,10 numbers that tell the story of Zimbabwe,2024-09-15,2017-11-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42013720,"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe resigned last year after almost four decades in power. Now, the country is approaching its first post-Mugabe election, with his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa the two front-runners in a field of 23 candidates. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now. Robert Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, was in power from independence in 1980 until he was ousted in November last year at the age of 93. His years in office, first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987, were marked by economic turmoil and the crushing of dissent.  Emmerson Mnangagwa is his successor - nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of political cunning. Once a Mugabe loyalist, he promises to revive the shattered economy and hopes to win elections on 30 July to legitimise his presidency. Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since a controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000.  The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production. As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold. Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008. The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1. More on post-Mugabe Zimbabwe: The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP - the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank. A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts.  Mr Mugabe always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates.  The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase to more than 72%, according to the World Bank. It also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty.  Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially. About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed. But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where about 41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day in 2013, World Bank data suggests. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly. The World Bank's modelled estimates, based on International Labour Organisation data, puts the figure as low as 5% in 2016, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claimed the jobless rate was as high as 90% last year. However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively seeking work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they ""view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers"". The CIA World Factbook estimates the rate was 95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known. Thanks to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with 89% of the adult population literate, according to World Bank data from 2014. Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64%. Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education, according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. More than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school.  Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016, according to UNAids. However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining.  According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved. Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of just under 61 years in 1986 to 44.1 years in 2003.   It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans. But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer, according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards. With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth. Written and produced by Lucy Rodgers."
currency fluctuations,Man Utd will not pay dividend in 2023,2024-09-15,2022-12-08,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63912042,"Executive co-chairmen and directors Avram Glazer (left) and Joel Glazer (right) are considering selling Manchester United Manchester United have opted not to pay a semi-annual dividend to shareholders in the 2023 financial year, in response to the increased investment in Erik ten Hag's playing squad. The controversial dividends have been paid since 2015. In the last financial year, £33.6m was paid in dividends - mainly to the Glazer family. United are the only Premier League club to pay a dividend, which has been one source of anger among the club's fans.  The news was contained in United's first quarter financial results and comes just over a fortnight after the American family confirmed they were considering selling the club they have owned since 2005. In addition, the Old Trafford club confirmed it was amending its annual EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) forecast from £100m-£110m to £125m-£140m ""as a result of reduced player wage costs"". Evidently, a significant proportion of the £25m difference relates to Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo's contract, which was cancelled last month. Overall revenue for the period was £143.7m, an increase of 13.6% on the same quarter last year, with wages reducing by £6.2m despite a number of new signings in the summer, due to the 25% reduction on salaries triggered by the failure to qualify for this season's Champions League.  Whilst the club's US debt remains unchanged at $650m, the fluctuation in currency exchange rates means that was £577.4m on 30 September 2022, compared to £476.2m 12 months earlier. The news that dividends would not be paid has been welcomed by the Manchester United Supporters Trust, which added: ""Dividends should not be paid when the club is not achieving success on the pitch, challenging for top honours. ""That is rewarding failure and removes the incentive for the owners to ensure sufficient reinvestment of profits back into the club. ""Our view is that no further dividends should be paid while new investment and ownership remain unresolved.

currency fluctuations,Six charts that explain Iran protests,2024-09-15,2018-01-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42553516,"The biggest anti-government protests in Iran for nearly a decade have been fuelled by rising discontent, in particular over the cost of living. Here are six charts that help explain the hardships faced by ordinary Iranians. Iran's economy was badly affected for several years by sanctions imposed by the international community over the country's nuclear programme.  Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 1.4% in 2015 - the year President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, agreed with world powers to limit Iran's sensitive nuclear activities. In 2016, after the deal was implemented and most sanctions were lifted, the economy bounced back sharply and GDP grew 12.3%, according to the Central Bank of Iran. Much of that growth was attributed to the oil and gas industry. Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said growth had begun to spread to the non-oil sector, and predicted that GDP would expand by 4.2% in the 2017/18 fiscal year. The recovery has nevertheless not been as significant as many Iranians hoped.  Analysts point to the fact that US sanctions on financial transactions with Iran have remained in place, which has deterred foreign companies from doing business there. And in October, US President Donald Trump refused to recertify the nuclear deal and called on Congress to consider restoring sanctions. Inflation has fluctuated greatly in Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979.  In 2013, the rate hit 31% as the economic sanctions reduced Iran's oil revenue and led to its currency, the rial, being devalued by more than 450%. Inflation has steadily decreased under Mr Rouhani. In 2016 it was 11%, according to the Central Bank of Iran. The World Bank expects inflation to remain below 12% over the next three years. Mr Rouhani has proposed a budget for the fiscal year starting in March 2018 that would see expenditure rise about 6% to $104bn. However, that would represent a cut in real terms at the current inflation rate. The official unemployment rate is 12.4%, but in some parts of the country it is more than 60%, according to Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli.  Young people - more than half of the population of 79.9 million is under 30 - are among the worst affected. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that 26.7% of 15-24 year olds are unemployed. Underemployment is also high - 12.4% - among 15-24 year olds, according to the ILO. The IMF has warned that despite the high economic growth rate, not enough jobs are being created to absorb the large number of people entering the labour market. Analysts say that is because most of the recovery can be attributed to the oil industry, which is not labour-intensive. Smartphones have played an important role in the current protests. People used the messaging app Telegram, which has millions of users in Iran, to organise protests and share videos and photographs taken with their phone cameras. When Telegram refused to suspend popular channels, the Iranian authorities blocked access to the app. In 2009, when millions of people took to the streets of Tehran to demand the re-run of a disputed presidential election, there were some 55m mobile subscriptions in Iran. However, only about 2% are believed to have been for smartphones. Today, there are more than 80m mobile subscriptions and 41% of households are estimated to have access to at least one smartphone. A recent investigation by BBC Persian found that on average, Iranians have become 15% poorer in real terms over the past decade. The World Bank says that poverty in Iran fell between 2009 and 2013 to about 8%, although it increased to 10.5% in 2014 - President Rouhani's first year in office.  It estimates that 8.2 million people were living on less than $5.50 per day in 2014. About 2%, or 196,000 people, were living on less than $1.90. Low-income families are dependent on a monthly cash transfer from the government worth about $13 that some 77 million Iranians receive. Mr Rouhani's draft budget would cut the payments by $5.3bn in total, which would reportedly affect 30 million people on higher incomes. He also proposed raising the price of petrol by 50%, from $0.30 per litre to $0.45. The consumption of bread, milk and red meat in Iranian households had decreased by between 30% and 50% over the past 10 years, according to BBC Persian.   With Iranians becoming poorer in real terms and the prices of many basic foodstuffs increasing by about 40% in the past year, many people simply cannot afford to buy as much food. A 50% rise in the price of eggs - the result of a nationwide hen shortage caused by an outbreak of bird flu - was reportedly a trigger for the protest in Mashhad, the first in the latest unrest which quickly spread across the country. BBC Persian service's Behrang Tajdin contributed to this story."
currency fluctuations,Is your friend’s Instagram profile a scam?,2024-09-15,2022-01-21,By Beatrice Pickup and Shari Vahl,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-60072911,"A woman who lost £1,200 when her Instagram account was hijacked said she feels ""violated"". Fraudsters managed to lure Nicole Reeves into the online scam in December by posing as one of her friends and promising her £5,000. Ms Reeves, 36, was persuaded to record a video of herself which was sent to her contacts and hand over the money, before being locked out of her account. Instagram has removed her profile and 50 others connected to the deception. Ms Reeves, who lives in Bristol, told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours: ""It's awful. I've never felt so violated in my entire life.  ""I just feel completely disgusted with myself for even letting it happen."" She had come across a video posted by her friend and former colleague Shaks, 27, who also lives in Bristol. In the video he explained how he had invested £500 and received £5,000 back. She messaged who she thought was her Shaks via Instagram, and he confirmed that it was true.  Ms Reeves was then instructed to contact a profile called Shanny_Powell1_ on Instagram.  She was told that she could benefit from fluctuations in currency and that if she invested £500 she would get £5,000 within an hour.  Having transferred the funds, she was told she had been chosen for a special bonus and would be receiving £20,000, but only if she could find some more money to pay for 'taxes'. In total, Ms Reeves transferred a total of £1,200 to an account in Jamaica using a money transfer website. She said: ""I kept thinking to myself, this is real, I've verified it, I've watched my friend in this video and I've spoken to him through Instagram on a message, so it's got to be real."" Ms Reeves then received a phone call from someone who claimed to be a manager.  He asked her to record a video of herself, to tell everyone how great the investment was and showing appreciation to 'Shanny Powell'.  She was told that she would receive the money once she had recorded the video.  Finally, she was persuaded to hand over her Apple ID, password, and then the one time passcode that appeared on her phone. She was told this was to prove her identity. ""Things started to happen in front of my face. Everything started going absolutely crazy,"" she said. ""Things were happening to my Instagram account which I was getting logged out of and I was locked out of my phone."" Ms Reeves never received any of the money promised.  The fraudsters took control of her Instagram account and used it to post messages promoting the fake investment to others.  They sent the video that she had recorded as a private message to many of her contacts.  Ms Reeves said that she and many of her family and friends reported the account to Instagram.  They received automatic messages which said: ""Due to the high volume of reports that we receive, our review team hasn't been able to review your report.  ""However, our technology has found that this account probably doesn't go against our community guidelines"". BBC You and Yours has contacted Instagram's parent company Meta about Ms Reeves hijacked account and it has been removed from Instagram.  The account Shanny_Powell1_ has also been removed, as have 50 others linked to this case. There are many accounts on Instagram using the name Shanny Powell and some of them will be genuine.  However, You and Yours found multiple accounts using variations of this name and promoting ways in which to make money fast.  It is likely that more than one person is behind the fraud, and that Shanny Powell is a false identity.  Ms Reeves discovered that her friend Shaks had also fallen victim to the scam, and it was not him that she had spoken to on Instagram.  ""I felt so guilty, I felt so bad. I just helped ruin someone's life,"" he said. ""If I'd had some common sense and realised that this woman's not right, I could have just put a stop to it and saved some other people from getting scammed.""  Shaks' hijacked account has also now been removed from Instagram.  A spokesperson for Meta said:""Fraudulent activity is banned on Instagram and we take strong action wherever possible to remove it, tackle scammers and protect people on the app.  ""We have taken action on multiple accounts and are continuing our investigations into this issue."" The company confirmed it has over 15,000 dedicated content reviewers, and uses a combination of proactive detection technology and reports from the community to find and remove content that violates its policies.  Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner, Mark Shelford, said that ""it's a horrific story that just outlines how sophisticated some of these scams are. ""It's so important for [Meta] to take responsibility for everything that happens on their platform, and that's why I'm a great supporter of the new Online Harms Bills going through parliament.""

currency fluctuations,Why currency crash does not worry Turkey's Erdogan,2024-09-15,2021-12-03,By Ozge Ozdemir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59487912,"Turkey's national currency has plummeted 45% against the dollar this year and yet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doesn't seem all that bothered. The lira has flirted with record lows this week, but Turkey's long-time leader is pressing ahead with his ""economic war of independence"", backed up by low interest rates. So why is Mr Erdogan pushing a model that critics warn risks soaring inflation, higher unemployment and poverty, and what does it mean for Turks? The simple reason for the Turkish lira's collapse is his unorthodox economic policy of keeping interest rates low to boost Turkey's economic growth and export potential with a competitive currency. For many economists, if inflation goes up you control it by raising interest rates. But Mr Erdogan sees interest rates as ""an evil that make the rich richer and the poor poorer"". ""Everything is so expensive,"" Sevim Yildirim told the BBC at a local fruit market. ""It's impossible even to cook a main course for a family with these prices."" Annual inflation has surged above 21% in Turkey, but the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, overhauled by Mr Erdogan, has just lowered interest rates from 16% to 15%, the third cut this year.  Inflation is rising around the world, and central banks are talking about hiking interest rates. But not here, because Mr Erdogan believes ultimately inflation will fall. In the past two years he has sacked three central bank presidents and only this week replaced his finance minister. And so the lira continues to drop. Turkey's economy is heavily dependent upon imports for producing goods from foods to textiles, so the rise of the dollar against the lira has a direct impact on the price of consumer products. Take the tomato, a vital ingredient in Turkish cuisine. To grow tomatoes, producers need to buy imported fertilisers and gas. Tomato prices were up 75% in August, compared with the year before, according to the chamber of commerce in the south coast agricultural hub of Antalya. ""How can we make money out of this?"" asks Sadiye Kaleci, who farms grapes in Pamukova, a small town three hours' drive from Istanbul. ""We sell cheap, but buying costs are expensive,"" she complains, citing high costs of diesel, fertiliser and sulphur, which is thrown on the vines. Another farmer, Feride Tufan, complains the only way she can get by is by selling her assets: ""We can pay off our debt by selling our land and vineyards. But when we sell everything, we'll have nothing left."" The currency has become so volatile that prices are changing daily. Inflation for producers alone is up 50%. ""I've cut down on all my expenses,"" says Hakan Ayran, out shopping at a market. ""To pay the bills everybody eats less and nobody buys stuff.""  Supermarket employees post price hikes on social media, showing before and after labels for products. They range from margarine (above) and olive oil to tea, coffee, detergent and toilet paper. A bakery in Turkey's third city, Izmir, put up a sign explaining its higher prices by listing surging costs of ingredients such as flour, oil and sesame, signing off with the message: ""May God be with us."" Foreign currency debt is a problem for the private sector and most companies have found it is more profitable to hold products in storage rather than sell them, because of the lira's volatility and inflation. It all adds up to more poverty and a widening gap in income and wealth equality. Queues form outside petrol stations and outside local government offices offering cheap bread.  And opposition parties have called for snap elections and rallies. When the lira slumped 18% in one day on 23 November, there were small protests and dozens of arrests. But the most visible display of public dissent is among younger Turks on Twitter, Twitch live streams, TikTok videos and YouTube. ""I am not happy with this government at all. I cannot see a future for myself in this country,"" one young person told a reporter from a YouTube channel. One in five young people in Turkey is out of work; it is even worse among women. Turkey has the world's fourth highest rate of youth not in employment, education or training, according to the OECD. Turkey's youth compare their living standards with those in other countries and do not like what they see.  ""For a young person in the US or Europe, it's easy to buy an iPhone with their salary,"" says one 18-year-old. ""Even if I work for months and months, I cannot afford it. I don't deserve that."" This generation is poised to play an important role in politics in Turkey, ruled by Mr Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) since 2002. Almost nine million Turks born since the late 1990s will be eligible to vote in the next election in 2023 and that could spell trouble for the AKP. One video that went viral showed a mother praising President Erdogan to a reporter, while her eight-year-old son contradicted her, pointing out his poor handling of recent disasters. The ruling party's success was partly down to a flood of foreign funding after the 2008 financial crisis. But much of Turkey's economic growth came from government spending and lending that favoured the construction industry. As a result production continues to depend on imports and the economy is at the mercy of currency  fluctuations. Few hold out hope of Mr Erdogan's new economic model coming to the rescue of the Turkish lira.  Amid such uncertainty, economist Arda Tunca says all bets are off for what happens next. ""This is the first time we're using a model completely beyond economic theory. Even when there were crises we could guess what would happen. Now it's impossible,"" he said."
currency fluctuations,World's most expensive city to live in revealed,2024-09-15,2021-12-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59489259,"Tel Aviv has been named as the most expensive city in the world to live in, as soaring inflation and supply-chain problems push up prices globally. The Israeli city came top for the first time in a survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), climbing from fifth place last year and pushing Paris down to joint second with Singapore. Damascus, in war-torn Syria, retained its place as the cheapest in the world. The survey compares costs in US dollars for goods and services in 173 cities. The EIU said the data it collected in August and September showed that on average prices had risen 3.5% in local currency terms - the fastest inflation rate recorded over the past five years. Transport has seen the biggest price increases, with the cost of a litre of petrol up by 21% on average in the cities studied. Tel Aviv's climb to the top of the EIU's World Cost of Living rankings mainly reflected the soaring value of Israel's currency, the shekel, against the dollar. The local prices of around 10% of goods also increased significantly, especially for groceries. The survey found Tel Aviv was the second most expensive city for alcohol and transport, fifth for personal care items, and sixth for recreation. Tel Aviv's mayor, Ron Huldai, warned in an interview with the Haaretz newspaper that rising property prices - not included in the EIU's calculations - meant the city was heading towards an ""explosion"". ""Tel Aviv will become increasingly more expensive, just as the entire country is becoming more expensive,"" he said.  ""The fundamental problem is that in Israel there is no alternative metropolitan centre. In the United States, there is New York, Chicago, Miami and so on. In Britain, there's Greater London, Manchester and Liverpool. There you can move to another city if the cost of living is too onerous."" Last year, Paris, Zurich and Hong Kong shared joint first place in the EIU's survey. Zurich and Hong Kong were fourth and fifth this year, followed by New York, Geneva, Copenhagen, Los Angeles and Osaka. Tehran climbed the most in the rankings, jumping from 79th to 29th, as US economic sanctions continued to cause shortages of goods and rising import prices in Iran. The EIU said the rankings continued to be sensitive to shifts brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. ""Although most economies are now recovering as Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out, the world's major cities still experience frequent surges in cases, prompting renewed social restrictions. In many cities this has disrupted the supply of goods, leading to shortages and higher prices."" It added: ""Fluctuating consumer demand has also influenced purchasing habits, while investor confidence has affected currencies, further fuelling price rises."" The EIU said it expected price rises to moderate over the coming year as central banks cautiously increased interest rates to stem inflation. Source: EIU's World Cost of Living index"
currency fluctuations,Bank of England to consider digital money plan,2024-09-15,2021-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56799726,"The Bank of England and the Treasury have announced they are setting up a taskforce to explore the possibility of a central bank digital currency. The aim is to look at the risks and opportunities involved in creating a new kind of digital money. Issued by the Bank for use by households and businesses, it would exist alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them. No decision has been taken on whether to have such a currency in the UK. However, the government and the Bank want to ""engage widely with stakeholders"" on the benefits and practicalities of doing so. The taskforce will be jointly led by the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, Sir Jon Cunliffe, and the Treasury's director general of financial services, Katharine Braddick. The Bank has previously said it is interested in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) because ""this is a period of significant change in money and payments"". The use of cash in financial transactions has been steadily declining in recent years, while debit card payments have been on the rise. Use of credit cards and direct debits have also been increasing. The Bank also sees having its own digital currency as a way of ""avoiding the risks of new forms of private money creation"", including crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. ""If a CBDC were to be introduced, it would be denominated in pounds sterling, just like banknotes, so £10 of CBDC would always be worth the same as a £10 note,"" the Bank said. ""CBDC is sometimes thought of as equivalent to a digital banknote, although in some respects it may have as much in common with a bank deposit.  ""Any CBDC would be introduced alongside - rather than replacing - cash and bank deposits."" Enter Britcoin. The Bank of England has been pontificating about digital currencies for some time. Now it and the Treasury will seriously look into establishing an alternative digital currency to be used by households and businesses. The flotation of Coinbase and the stellar performance this year of various crypto-assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is the backdrop.  It would basically be a digital version of sterling, backed by the Bank of England, that could change the payments system, the plumbing of the financial system. It would not be a Bitcoin-style speculative asset with wild fluctuations in value. But there will be limited appeal for the fans of crypto, who invest precisely because of their scepticism about central banks.  Instead, the revolutionary thing here could be the direct relationship that ordinary citizens might have with the central bank, which cannot go bust. It could yield simple, direct means of stimulating the economy and even applying negative rates. Central banks would in theory know when and where every e-cash transaction occurred. China is already ahead in its digital yuan experiments. Part of the rationale is to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of financial innovation.  Most of the world's central banks are looking into the possibility of creating such a currency, but the only one already in existence is China's digital yuan, which is currently undergoing public testing. Among the objectives of the UK taskforce is monitoring international developments, ""to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of global innovation"". The Bank also announced the creation of a CDBC engagement forum and a technology forum, as well as a CBDC unit within the Bank itself, overseen by Sir Jon. No timetable was announced for the taskforce's operations."
currency fluctuations,Scottish public finances show improvement,2024-09-15,2018-08-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45260268,"Scotland's public finances have continued to show some improvement over the past year, according to Scottish government statistics.  The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) report said the country spent £13.4bn more than it raised in taxes in the past financial year.  The deficit as a percentage of the country's GDP dropped from 8.9% to 7.9% - still four times higher than the UK. The UK's spending deficit dropped by £6.4bn to £39.4bn in 2017/18. This was the lowest figure since 2007, and the equivalent of 1.9% of the UK's GDP. The Gers figures have become a key battleground in the debate over Scottish independence in recent years.  Scotland had a relatively stronger fiscal position than the UK in 2010/11, but since then the position has been reversed - largely as a result of the collapse in the oil price. The latest statistics estimated that Scotland's total public sector revenue rose by about £3bn to £60bn in 2017/18, of which £1.3bn was from the North Sea oil and gas industry. This was higher than the £266m of revenue from the North Sea in the previous year - but well below the £8bn the offshore industry generated in 2011/12. Scotland's share of total UK revenue has also fallen in recent years from a peak of 9.7% in 2008/09, and currently stands at 8.0% of the UK total.    Total expenditure by the Scottish government, UK government, and all other parts of the public sector in Scotland was said to have increased put at £73.4bn, which was equivalent to 9.3% of total UK public sector expenditure. Other key statistics from the report include:  Last year's report estimated that Scotland's spending deficit had been £13.3bn, or the 8.3% GDP, in 2016/17. But these figures have now been revised upwards to £14.5bn and 8.9% of GDP.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the latest figures, which she said provided further evidence that the country's economy was ""on the right trajectory"" despite the ""limited powers"" at the Scottish government's disposal. And she rejected the suggestion that higher public spending north of the border despite the deficit was a ""persuasive argument for the union"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""If we look at the situation in Scotland within the UK over a longer period of time, this notion that Scotland is somehow subsidised, I think, simply does not stand up to scrutiny."" But the UK government's Scottish secretary, David Mundell, said it was concerning that Scotland's deficit as a share of GDP remained four times that of the UK's. He said: ""These figures confirm that being part of a strong United Kingdom - the 5th largest economy in the world - is worth nearly £1,900 for every single person in Scotland, which supports vital public services.  ""Simply put, Scotland contributed 8% of UK tax, and received more than 9% of UK spending for the benefit of families across the country."" The figures look familiar. The arguments sound the same.  Gers is a hardy annual in Scottish constitutional politics. It's thistle-like and, each August, it has to be grasped. This year, there's a slightly different context.  While those who support independence continue to argue that ""this tells us nothing about the way an independent Scotland's public finances would work"", they are also facing a reality check from their own side about the case they've been making. The sustainable growth commission, chaired by ex-SNP MSP Andrew Wilson and published in May, addressed three broad challenges to the party. They were: to find a way to grow the economy faster; to find a more credible argument about currency than the one used in 2014; and to face up to the scale of the public sector deficit. On the latter, it suggested the use of higher taxes and a squeeze on spending growth.  While this could increase in real terms, the commission proposed that it should rise by less than the rate of growth.  Making some big assumptions about economic growth, Mr Wilson concluded that such an approach might take nine years of falling deficits before hitting the level at which borrowing is widely seen as being sustainable. That's 3% of national output, a target recognised also by Nicola Sturgeon, while Gers points to a deficit last year of 7.9%. While the Gers arguments being made by the SNP in public remain familiar, in private the party has work to do. That begins this Saturday in Ayr, with the first of three national assemblies to discuss the growth commission.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the figures showed that ""the SNP's plans for independence would mean unprecedented levels of austerity for Scotland"". Gers was described as the ""authoritative publication on Scotland's public finances"" in the Scottish government's White Paper on independence ahead of the 2014 referendum. Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie said: ""Whichever way you look at it, under nationalist plans all the good things we all want to do in Scotland would be under threat because of funding cuts."" Scottish Green Party co-leader Patrick Harvie believed the figures were ""another reminder"" that the Scottish economy was ""too focused"" on oil and gas extraction. He added that the Scottish government and other opposition needed to ""remember that both our prosperity and our climate depends on moving to a clean economy"". The Gers report is compiled by statisticians working for the Scottish government's chief economic adviser, and is free from political interference. The Scottish government has published a list of answers to frequently asked questions about how Gers is compiled here."

""However, our technology has found that this account probably doesn't go against our community guidelines"". BBC You and Yours has contacted Instagram's parent company Meta about Ms Reeves hijacked account and it has been removed from Instagram.  The account Shanny_Powell1_ has also been removed, as have 50 others linked to this case. There are many accounts on Instagram using the name Shanny Powell and some of them will be genuine.  However, You and Yours found multiple accounts using variations of this name and promoting ways in which to make money fast.  It is likely that more than one person is behind the fraud, and that Shanny Powell is a false identity.  Ms Reeves discovered that her friend Shaks had also fallen victim to the scam, and it was not him that she had spoken to on Instagram.  ""I felt so guilty, I felt so bad. I just helped ruin someone's life,"" he said. ""If I'd had some common sense and realised that this woman's not right, I could have just put a stop to it and saved some other people from getting scammed.""  Shaks' hijacked account has also now been removed from Instagram.  A spokesperson for Meta said:""Fraudulent activity is banned on Instagram and we take strong action wherever possible to remove it, tackle scammers and protect people on the app.  ""We have taken action on multiple accounts and are continuing our investigations into this issue."" The company confirmed it has over 15,000 dedicated content reviewers, and uses a combination of proactive detection technology and reports from the community to find and remove content that violates its policies.  Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner, Mark Shelford, said that ""it's a horrific story that just outlines how sophisticated some of these scams are. ""It's so important for [Meta] to take responsibility for everything that happens on their platform, and that's why I'm a great supporter of the new Online Harms Bills going through parliament.""

currency fluctuations,China declares all Bitcoin transactions illegal,2024-09-15,2021-09-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58678907,"China's central bank has announced that all transactions of crypto-currencies are illegal, effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin. ""Virtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities,"" the People's Bank of China said, warning it ""seriously endangers the safety of people's assets"".  China is one of the world's largest crypto-currency markets. Fluctuations there often impact the global price of crypto-currencies. The price of Bitcoin fell by more than $2,000 (£1,460) in the wake of the Chinese announcement. It is the latest in China's national crackdown on what it sees as a volatile, speculative investment at best - and a way to launder money at worst. Trading crypto-currency has officially been banned in China since 2019, but has continued online through foreign exchanges. However, there has been a significant crackdown this year. In May, Chinese state intuitions warned buyers they would have no protection for continuing to trade Bitcoin and other currencies online, as government officials vowed to increase pressure on the industry. In June, it told banks and payment platforms to stop facilitating transactions and issued bans on ""mining"" the currencies - the trade of using powerful computers to make new coins. But Friday's announcement is the clearest indication yet that China wants to shut down crypto-currency trading in all its forms. The statement makes clear that those who are involved in ""illegal financial activities"" are committing a crime and will be prosecuted. And foreign websites providing such services to Chinese citizens online is also an illegal activity, it said. The technology at the core of many crypto-currencies, including Bitcoin, relies on many distributed computers verifying and checking transactions on a giant shared ledger known as the blockchain. As a reward, new ""coins"" are randomly awarded to those who take part in this work - known as crypto ""mining"". China, with its relatively low electricity costs and cheaper computer hardware, has long been one of the world's main centres for mining.  The activity is so popular there that gamers have sometimes blamed the industry for a global shortage of powerful graphics cards, which miners use for processing crypto-currencies. The Chinese crackdown has already hit the mining industry. In September 2019, China accounted for 75% of the world's Bitcoin energy use. By April 2021, that had fallen to 46%."
currency fluctuations,Iran's banks banned from Bitcoin deals,2024-09-15,2018-04-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43865105,"Iran's central bank has banned other banks from dealing in crypto-currencies, over concerns the technology could be used illegally. It said Bitcoin could be ""turned into a means for money-laundering and financing terrorism"" and ""a means for transferring criminals' money"". Iran's currency, the rial, plunged to an all-time low in early April. Banks, credit institutions and currency exchanges all now have to avoid any sale or purchase of digital currencies. This is a blow for some in Iran who saw crypto-currencies as a way Iran could overcome problems relating to its banking industry and international sanctions.  In February, Minister of Information and Communications Technology Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi announced a plan to develop Iran's own virtual currency.  Mr Jahromi's project was also backed by Iran's cyber-security authority, which said it would support virtual currencies if they were properly regulated.  But the central bank did not agree. At the time, it told Iranian state media that the ""wild fluctuations"" of crypto-currencies, together with ""pyramid schemes"", had made the virtual currency market ""unreliable and risky"". In early April, India's central bank announced a similar ban on the sale or purchase of crypto-currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given banks three months to unwind their exposure to virtual currency exchanges. The price of Bitcoin is currently $8,895.49 (£6,373.75)."
currency fluctuations,Apple loses its $1tn crown as shares fall,2024-09-15,2018-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46066977,"Apple briefly lost its $1tn valuation on Thursday when its shares fell 7% in after-hours trading despite posting record results. The tech giant's strategy of charging more for its phones has paid off, with revenues jumping in the last three months despite relatively flat sales. Revenues rose 20% to $62.9bn year-on-year, and profits rose 31% to $14.1bn. But a warning of possible weaker sales in coming months sparked a share price slide after official trading ended. The sell-off accelerated after Apple said it would stop disclosing the number of units sold. Apple executives defended their decision, arguing that the figures are no longer good indicators of the firm's financial health. Analysts, however, warned that outsiders may view it as a move that masks less sunny performance. The total number of smartphones sold by all makers globally declined for the first time in 2017. But Apple's strategy of charging higher prices for its phones has helped it to shrug off flagging demand. The firm sold 46.9 million iPhones in the quarter to end-September, a modest rise on the 46.7 million sold for the same period last year. The California-based company is also making more money from ""services"" such as the App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay. Services revenue hit a record $10bn in the quarter. For the firm's full 2018 financial year, profits increased 23% to $59.5bn, as revenue rose 16% to $265.5bn. ""I can reassure that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have,"" Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri told financial analysts. ""A unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past."" Despite the record figures, shares in the firm sank in after-hours trading, falling by 4% and then by more than 7%. They quickly started to rebound, lifting the firm's market value back above $1tn. The decline was blamed in part on a disappointing forecast for the important Christmas season. Apple said it expects sales of $89bn to $93bn for the quarter that ends 31 December, against Wall Street's $93bn forecast.  It posted sales of $88.3bn in the quarter last year. Chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple is ""seeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets"" such as Turkey, India, Brazil and Russia. He said some of that is due to currency fluctuation. Chief financial officer Luca Maestri said Apple also faces some supply uncertainty related to the roll-out of its latest products. The firm, which relies on China for manufacturing, is at risk as trade tensions between US and China rise, though its products have so far been spared from tariffs. Mr Cook said he remains optimistic that the two countries will resolve their issues. So far, Apple's business has not been affected he added, pointing to a 16% revenue rise in its Greater China region in the most recent quarter. Apple's App store has felt the impact of a ""moratorium"" on Chinese approvals for new games, but that is a domestic issue, he added."
currency fluctuations,Engine firm's £2.5m Brexit stockpile,2024-09-15,2019-03-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-47525685,"An engineering firm has stockpiled key components worth £2.5m due to ""uncertainty"" over Brexit. MAN Energy Solutions, which makes marine engines in Colchester, said the move was part of its ""risk mitigation"". The company has also reviewed export arrangements and would use other ports if delays occur at Dover. Richard Guest, managing director, said: ""We don't know what we don't know. It is important we can cope with changes very quickly as they arise."" MAN Energy Solutions is part of a Europe-wide group, worth €3bn (£2.58bn), which in turn is owned by Volkswagen. It manufactures engines, exporting mostly to Asia, the Middle East and South America. Only a small proportion of its products are sold in Europe, but 30% of its key components come from the EU.  Mr Guest said ""uncertainty"" over the UK's departure from the EU was already forcing change in the supply chain, adding that British business needed stability to attract future investment. ""What we want from the politicians is a successful Brexit that doesn't disrupt trade flows,"" he said. Volkswagen had invested £4m in the Colchester plant over the last two years and overseas business had grown by 30% during that time, said Mr Guest.  Mr Guest told the BBC East Sunday Politics programme that MAN Energy Solutions carried out a full risk analysis of possible Brexit scenarios.  He said £2.5m of vital components were being stockpiled and multi-currency contracts were being considered to counteract potential exchange rate fluctuations.   Other measures included using ports in the north east of England and shipping goods to the Republic of Ireland via Liverpool.  But Mr Guest said MAN Energy Solutions could do well after Brexit.  ""Some of our UK operators who previously relied on European suppliers will be looking for a UK-based supplier to provide their equipment,"" he said."
currency fluctuations,El Salvador plans to make Bitcoin legal tender,2024-09-15,2021-06-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57373058,"El Salvador's president says he will make the Bitcoin cryptocurrency legal tender in the country. If his plan is backed by congress, the Central American country would be first in the world to formally adopt the digital currency. It would be used alongside the US dollar, El Salvador's official currency. President Nayib Bukele says Bitcoin will make it easier for Salvadorans living abroad to send payments home. ""In the short term, this will generate jobs and help provide financial inclusion to thousands outside the formal economy,"" Mr Bukele told a Bitcoin conference in Florida, adding that it could also boost investment to the country. He said he would send the legislation to congress next week. Should it pass, the move would open up financial services to the 70% of Salvadorans who do not have bank accounts, the president said. El Salvador's economy relies heavily on remittances, or money sent home from abroad, which make up around 20% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). More than two million Salvadorans live outside the country, but they continue to keep close ties to their place of birth, sending back more than $4bn (£2.9bn) each year. Current services can charge fees for such transfers, which can take days to arrive and sometimes need to be picked up in person, according to the announcement. ""This will improve lives and the future of millions,"" Mr Bukele said.  He did not give more details about how the policy would work. Bitcoin, a virtual asset with no direct connection to the real economy, has seen large fluctuations in value over the years.   Most of the world's central banks are looking into the possibility of creating their own digital currencies. In April, the Bank of England announced it was looking into creating a digital money that would exist alongside cash and bank deposits. Strike, a mobile payments app set up in El Salvador, is working on the introduction of Bitcoin in the country, Reuters reports.  ""Adopting a natively digital currency as legal tender provides El Salvador the most secure, efficient and globally integrated open payments network in the world,"" founder Jack Mallers said.  Rohan Grey, an expert with the Digital Currency Global Initiative, told BBC World Mr Bukele was ""a young president trying to capitalise on a popular image"".  ""There is a lot of PR value in announcing something like this even if you haven't worked out all the details,"" he said.  Mr Grey cautioned more generally that a country adopting a cryptocurrency as legal tender would give considerable control ""to a network that isn't stable, doesn't have accountable actors and doesn't have track record of providing the kind of price stability and liquidity that a currency is supposed to provide"".  The plan announced by President Nayib Bukele would make the small Central American nation the first in the world to adopt the digital currency, Bitcoin, as legal tender alongside the dollar.  It would be a unique and bold step, the first by a sovereign country, and that may well be part of the attraction for Mr Bukele, a young, media-savvy and very popular leader who worries Washington over his increasingly autocratic tendencies.  There are still many questions over how the digital currency would become the country's legal tender - a major overhaul of El Salvador's financial infrastructure would be needed with Bitcoin at its heart.  But, in essence, it appears that is what Mr Bukele is proposing.  Much of El Salvador's developing economy is based on remittances from abroad and the move to a digital currency may allow family members to avoid the costly fees involved in sending money home each month.  Either way, it is a move which is likely to bolster Bitcoin's image as the ""currency of the future"" and President Bukele's standing among his supporters as an innovator."
currency fluctuations,Should you invest in Bitcoins?,2024-09-15,2013-07-03,Constance Gustke,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130702-should-you-invest-in-bitcoins,"Bitcoin has leapt onto the global stage with a bang — and a crash. The digital money has already plunged from a high of $260 in April to today’s value of about $92 Still, Bitcoins, used to purchase goods online or transfer money to other people, have steadily gained traction since they were invented in Japan in 2009. Germany has Bitcoin marketplaces where holders can exchange the currency. Designed to be a global currency, Bitcoin is also gaining popularity in countries like Argentina and Kenya, amid worries about local currency devaluation. Merchants, such as online dating site OkCupid, are slowly starting to accept the digital money for goods and services. On Monday, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known for their legal dispute with Facebook Inc’s Mark Zuckerberg over the origin of the social networking site, unveiled plans to offer shares of a Bitcoin trust — designed to operate like an exchange-traded fund — to the public. According to an initial public offering filing in the United States, the shares would allow investors to “gain exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk.” Despite the hoopla, Bitcoin is still a niche digital currency. It faces numerous challenges on the road to wide-spread acceptance, including volatile price spikes and daily volume surges that point to rampant speculation. Also hindering growth: even sophisticated financial thinkers have trouble understanding how it works. So far, global adoption is still tiny. Less than 1% of the world’s population uses Bitcoin actively, according to estimates, though use is accelerating in the US and parts of Europe. The next 24 months will be crucial to whether the currency will survive and grow, say some experts. Though venture capitalists and technology start-ups are rushing to solve concerns around Bitcoin, any significant expansion is still uncertain given recent market fluctuations. Long-term investors may walk away if volatility continues. Much more likely, Bitcoin may become one digital currency among many others coming to market. “Even if Bitcoin doesn’t survive, cypto-currencies will,” said California-based Andreas Antonopoulos, who advises organisations on emerging technologies and trends.    Origins Bitcoin is a form of electronic money that is not controlled by a person or institution. New units are mined by programs that crack complex mathematical problems and release new blocks of coins, though release is limited to only 21 million virtual coins. Only 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes can be created to control inflation. There are currently about 11.3 million in circulation. The limited supply makes them like digital gold, said Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Bitcoin Education Project. To buy Bitcoin, most people go to Japan-based Mt.Gox, which accepts 17 currencies. Fees are less than .60%.    Ease of use depends on where you live. Adoption is ramping up with small merchants in the US, Canada and parts of Europe, say experts. New trading platforms like Russia-based Bitc-e.com, which also accepts other alternative currencies like Webcreds.com, are even popping up. France recently launched its Bitcoin Central exchange, too. “Europe is a bit ahead of the US,” said Jonathan Waller, who runs a Bitcoin meet-up in Tokyo. Uphill climb Despite this frenzied activity, Bitcoin faces an uphill climb. Its greatest strength — sitting outside the global financial system — is also a weakness. Few retailers accept the currency, though more, like the San Francisco-based social news site Reddit and even US-based blogging platform Wordpress, are accepting it. Rigorous control of new Bitcoin makes expanding usage beyond a cult currency difficult. The biggest challenge might be volatility. As little as $3 million injected into Mt.Gox can spike prices, say experts. In April, Bitcoin plummeted $130 in a day, from a high of $260.  This volatility is catnip for speculators, who seek to profit from sudden price fluctuations. Bitcoin’s main problem is that value is based on whatever the next guy will pay, said Brian Riley, a senior research analyst at the Boston-based research and advisory firm CEB TowerGroup.  “This makes them a speculative currency,” he said. “Speculators are making a mess of Bitcoin,” said Antonopoulos. When traders jump in and out of the currency, it adds to volume spikes. There are currently 182 global currencies, said Riley. “Why do we need another one?” he said. Bitcoins are so volatile that owners must either spend them immediately, before they lose value, or hold them as investments. Turning cash into Bitcoins can take days. Many people rely on cumbersome in-person Bitcoin exchanges facilitated by Bitcoin web sites such as localBitcoins.com, where people meet and exchange currency. For these reasons, investors and consumers should not put more than 5% of their money into the currency, added Waller.  “Bitcoins are one big monetary experiment,” said Hoskinson. Easing concerns There is a chance that these Bitcoin choke points will be solved by an influx of new technology. In the US, a flurry of well-known venture capitalists such as New York City tech wizard Fred Wilson, an early investor in Tumblr and Foursquare, are spearheading Bitcoin startups. The aim: developing better e-wallets, payment systems and even automatic teller machines (ATMs), where you can exchange cash for Bitcoin. Dozens of startups in California’s Silicon Valley are also attacking Bitcoin distribution problems, said Antonopoulos. “Lots of venture capitalists are pouring money into Bitcoin without understanding them,” he added.   History is rife with examples of early movers — Myspace is one — that ended up in technology graveyards due to stronger competitors, though. And currently, at least one dozen virtual currencies like litecoin and ripple are vying for a piece of the digital currency market. These new currencies aren’t tough competitors, said Waller, though there’s still a real risk that Bitcoin won’t survive this onslaught."
currency fluctuations,Bitcoin or bust?,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131219-bitcoin-or-bust,"Digital Currency Primer Digital currencies are “mined,” traded and exchanged. (The
Chicago Federal Reserve has published Bitcoin:
A Primer. Bitcoin.org and Blockchain.info which are repositories
for information and transactions. And numerous Bitcoin exchanges exist around
the world for swapping Bitcoin with other currency.)  According to the Chicago Fed, Bitcoin is a fiduciary
currency and “inherently fragile.” Most fiduciary currency derives its value
from “government fiat,” which means the government says it has value or at
least someone else is willing to accept it as valuable. This is in contrast to
commodity-based currency which is itself often a precious metal of value. Is digital currency finally moving from mania to mainstream? In the past few weeks, Bitcoin — the most widely used digital or virtual currency — has “gone parabolic,” as financial market watchers like to say, soaring from a value of $800 to $1200, then rapidly losing half as much as half its value after a Chinese exchange stopped accepting yuan deposits. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have captured the world’s collective imagination. Not so much for their use, but more for what the emerging phenomena say about the global economy, government-issued fiat currencies and central bank policies. To true believers — and even some academics and wealth managers — investors should hold Bitcoin in addition to gold and other alternatives to help diversify their existing portfolio of investments. But not so fast, say others. It’s a volatile and unproven currency, often fluctuating more than 10% in one day.  The US dollar? Fractions of a percent. Same for the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound. Even gold’s rapid decline in 2013 has been measured on a daily basis, aside from a 9% drop on April 15. In the spotlight So, should consumers be joining the digital currency revolution, and holding Bitcoin alongside other alternatives like gold? Not exactly. But the increasing volume of alternative, cross-border currency is still worthy of attention. Even legitimate currency strategists from both Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have attempted to tackle Bitcoin’s place in the world. But there’s also broad concern. A hearing on the “risks, threats and promises” of virtual currencies was recently held by a US Senate committee. The People’s Bank of China has moved to bar financial institutions from Bitcoin transactions. Other central banks — in France and South Korea, for example — have issued consumer warnings on Bitcoin, cautioning buyers and merchants that its volatility could undermine its utility. Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who coined the term “irrational exuberance” to explain the Japanese real estate bubble and, in turn, warn about late 1990s tech stock valuations, has said that digital currencies have no “intrinsic value.” Outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, however, took a more hedged approach, saying that virtual currencies “may have long-term promise.” Still, for many people, the lure of Bitcoin and other alternative currencies may be too much to ignore. Treading cautiously — and understanding the pitfalls — is key to mitigating your risk of getting burned. “Technology is a tremendously disruptive force in society, and it knows no boundaries,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist for broker ConvergEx, in reference to the advance and hype around Bitcoin. How, exactly, does digital currency work? Created in 2009, Bitcoin are finite (21 million will ultimately exist) and can be transacted in units as low as one “Satoshi” or 0.00000001 BTC, as Bitcoin are abbreviated. Bitcoin are created and recorded on a decentralized computer network, which work together to verify the “mining” of new Bitcoins and cross-reference and record any Bitcoin transaction. Bitcoins move from one owner to the next when each party to a transaction sends (and confirms) an exchange. It could be anything from an online purchase to an international money transfer to settling a sports bet. Transactions are then verified across the network, to prevent double-spending of Bitcoin. As described by a Chicago Federal Reserve primer, Bitcoin and other digital currencies are “inherently fragile” because there’s no way to gauge actual value or price. Buyers and sellers of the currency can debate its value or one side can simply chose not to accept it as payment. The value of official currencies, also called legal tender, is not ever in dispute. Virtual utility? Early on, Bitcoin was used to pay software programmers for their time and effort developing Bitcoin protocols, but its use has extended to general merchandise, online gambling, and, until recently, an intricate illegal drug-dealing network called “The Silk Road.” So far, though, no major retailer has opened up their cash registers for volatile digital currencies. So the currency is used mainly by  an ad hoc network of small buyers and sellers, although their numbers are growing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch FX and Rates Strategist David Woo attempted to divine a fair value for Bitcoin, triangulating its usage in e-commerce and money transfer and its use as a store of value. Woo pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility undermines its role as a medium of exchange — that is transactions plummet as volatility rises. In spite of this, Woo wrote in his note that Bitcoin’s low transaction costs can make it attractive: it is inherently a peer-to-peer currency system and doesn’t require banks or other financial intermediaries to take their cut on transfers or storage. Its encrypted format also makes it more impervious than cash to theft or counterfeiting, he said. That said, Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and suffered network outages, resulting in wild price fluctuations and stolen Bitcoins. “The combination of legal tender status and supply anchors the value of dollars in transactions in a way that Bitcoin will never be anchored,” said CitiFX strategist Steven Englander. And then there’s the competition. Developers for other digital currencies such as Litecoin and open-source payment networks are constantly looking to improve upon (replace) Bitcoin. It’s an “issue that the internet currencies will not be able to overcome easily,” said Englander. Considering the traditional national and international system of currency that exists today, it’s not unreasonable to think cooperating governments could eventually come together to build in some of the features of a digital currency — with transaction verification and security to limit fraud and theft. They could “steal” some of the appeal of Bitcoin by making the alternative safer. In our networked world, we often see companies and governments work to cut out alternative (sometimes illicit) activity and bring it to light. Napster was co-opted first by litigation, then by Apple and iTunes. In the US, marijuana prices have been challenged by fresh legality in various states. Even loan-sharking in emerging economies has been diminished by innovative micro-lending platforms. Eventually Bitcoin will be challenged when governments, banks, merchants and individuals at the centre of the existing structure come together, experts said. Don’t think it could happen? The euro, born from the strength of the German Deutschmark, didn’t come in to existence until January 1, 1999 — then as a digital-only currency. "

currency fluctuations,Is there a best season to buy stocks?,2024-09-15,2018-12-15,Miriam Quick and Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181214-is-there-a-best-time-of-year-to-buy-stocks,"As you look upon a new year with fresh eyes, should you do the same with your approach to the stock market?   ""Sell in May and go away"" is an age-old investment adage, referring to the traditional belief that stocks show weaker performance in the summer, from May to October, and stronger performance in the winter, from November to April. According to the saying, you should sell stocks in spring, just before the summer lull, and buy them in autumn, just before their value rises again. It’s sometimes also called the ""Halloween indicator"". There is a good deal of truth to this. Findings from a 2002 paper showed that this pattern held true in 36 of 37 developed and emerging markets studied globally, and was particularly strong in Europe. The paper noted evidence for it in the UK stretching back to 1694. The effect may be caused by seasonal fluctuations in optimism among investors. But there are other adages that suggest investing in other times of the year, like the “January effect” – an increase in stock prices during the first month of the year – or December’s “Santa Claus rally”, a similar boost that has been linked to holiday-season optimism (and Christmas bonuses).   So, what gives? Is one time of year better than the other to invest? Seasonal adjustments Selling in May is not what people actually do. US and Canadian researchers found that investors are more bullish in spring and cautious in autumn. In the study, the authors looked at how money flows among different categories of mutual funds to find that people are more likely to buy risky assets in warmer months, but are more risk-averse in later in the year, more likely to sell higher-risk assets to buy safer ones. This springtime bullishness even spills over into the financial media. In a paper published in 2014, two Japanese researchers used a text-mining technique to analyse the mood of newspaper articles between 1986 and 2010. They found increased optimism in the first half of the calendar year, yielding to pessimism in the second half. The origin of this seasonal mood cycle may lie in the seasons themselves. Some economists argue that fluctuating temperatures, day length and sunlight levels over the course of the year can sway investor behaviour and so move markets. Lisa Kramer is a professor of finance at the University of Toronto who studies human behaviour and investing. She’s found evidence that there is indeed a seasonal effect on people’s investing habits. She points to seasonal affective disorder – SAD – and how long, cold, dark winters can make people less optimistic about investing. “People are not often aware that their mood can play into this, but the evidence is pouring in,” she says. An earlier 2003 study by the same US and Canadian authors who identified seasonal investing behaviour also linked seasonal preferences for different investment types to SAD. Comparing stock market index data from countries at various latitudes with their seasonal daylight fluctuations, the researchers found a so-called ""SAD effect"" in the seasonal cycle of stock returns that was ""both significant and substantial"". Returns were at their lowest in September, rising throughout autumn and peaking just after the winter solstice (late December) before falling again and flattening out over spring and summer. The results in the southern hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) were six months out of phase with the northern hemisphere, mirroring the seasons. Crucially, the nearer the countries were to the poles and so the shorter their winter days, the more pronounced the winter SAD effect. “It helps us understand why markets can be so volatile,” Kramer says. “It helps us take a step back from our [emotion-driven] decisions.” Still, being cautious is not always a good thing when investing. Stable investments like government bonds typically yield lower returns in the long run than riskier stocks with a higher return potential, and over-caution can actually lead people to take larger risks to avoid a loss. If many investors become more cautious when it’s dark outside and returns are generally lower for cautious investments, why should overall returns then rise in winter? Because when the cautious investors sell their riskier assets in autumn, the price drops, meaning quality investments can be scooped up for a low price by those willing it to take the risk. Since these quality investments were bought at a bargain, the returns are disproportionately high when the market eventually bounces back at the end of winter, the authors suggest, boosting overall returns. But, to be sure… there are several caveats. Off the beaten path Seasonality exists, but it’s just one piece of the investment puzzle. First, the ‘sell in May’ effect is only one of many seasonal cycles affecting stock prices. Others include the January effect, the holiday effect and the turn-of-the-month effect. These effects tend to be stronger in small-cap stocks (shares of companies with a market capitalisation under $2 billion). Second, and more importantly, seasonality is only one of many, many factors affecting the stock market. Returns in a given year may deviate substantially from seasonal patterns. Those looking for investment guidance are better off ignoring the thermometer and calling a qualified financial adviser instead. “There is seasonality in the stock market, but there have been mixed arguments or evidence about why,” says Mark Ma, a professor of accounting at American University in Washington, DC. He gives credence to the SAD effect, but points to a place like “Singapore, where the weather is the same almost all year – around 32 degrees Celsius – but they still found this effect. I think [daylight and temperature] play a big role in it, but it’s probably not the only reason there is seasonality.” He mentions a January effect, and how stock returns in January tend to be higher because the tax year ends in December. So, if people have a lot of profits, they have to pay a high tax bill – but not if they sell their stocks beforehand. Their total taxable income goes down. Ma thinks that there isn’t a fixed window to just invest and profit, and to not bank on any seasonal patterns happening every year. After all, there are tons of different factors at play, especially with something as unpredictable as the stock market. The experts say… Although it’s good to be mindful of seasonality, you should pay closer attention to concrete evidence, like growth potential for a company and how profitable it’s been over the last year, says Haran Segram, a clinical assistant professor of finance at New York University. “I’m a firm believer in the fundamentals of a stock – the cash flow, the risk and growth, rather than the particular month to invest,” he says. All the experts interviewed for this piece say to be mindful of seasonality – but the true best thing to do is take less risk. Although short term you might yield fewer returns, that thinking will pay off in the long haul: like slowly squirrelling money away and letting it compound over years. Segram agrees that, even in depressing winter months, for example, not to allow your investing decisions to be guided by how you feel. “People do have an emotional connection with money,” he says. “They see that it has the means to their comfort and glory in the future. But people don’t make rational decisions at a time when it comes to money. I tell my students, it’s a patience game.” Kramer agrees. “Take a holistic view,” she says. “Make regular frequent contributions to your retirement savings. That’s the best approach to success. When we try to outsmart the market, we often end up harming ourselves.” -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

currency fluctuations,Why Brits ‘snog’ and ‘chinwag’,2024-09-15,2017-06-19,Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20170619-why-british-english-is-full-of-silly-sounding-words,"From ‘gazump’ to ‘gobsmack’, ‘squiffy’ to ‘snog’, British English is full of words that sound like barmy balderdash. Christine Ro explains why. “That wazzock dared to gazump me; I'm gobsmacked by this sticky wicket full of codswallop that's gone pear-shaped!” That sentence may not sound serious. But the situation it describes is. Translated into standard English, it would be something like “That idiot dared to offer more money for the house after my offer already had been accepted; I'm shocked by this tricky situation full of nonsense that's gone awry!” Shakespeare, this isn’t. The first sentence sounds so peculiar to certain ears not just because of the mangling of parts of speech. It’s also full of words, with origins ranging from the 1700s to the 1980s, that have two qualities in common: they’re all rather silly-sounding, and they’re all British English. British English is full of whimsical terms like these. They reflect the UK’s cultural appreciation of wit, a long tradition of literary inventiveness – and Britain’s fluctuating global influence over the centuries. Whimsical words like these are formed in a number of ways. These include blends of other words (eg ‘Oxbridge’, from Oxford and Cambridge); reduplicatives, which repeat sounds or parts of words (‘higgledy-piggledy’); back-formations, which often remove the suffix of their originating word (like ‘kempt’, from ‘unkempt’); and of course sheer nonsense (like Roald Dahl’s invention ‘gobblefunk’). These types of coinages aren’t unique to English, let alone British English. But the relative simplicity of English words may lend itself to this kind of play, says Anatoly Liberman, professor of languages at the University of Minnesota and an etymology blogger for Oxford University Press. “English is largely a monosyllabic language (‘come’, ‘go’, ‘take’, ‘big’, ‘laugh’, and so forth),” he says. “This makes such games easy.” Especially characteristic of these formations in British English is the way they reflect a certain kind of humour. Pop anthropologist Kate Fox has written about the English “ban on earnestness” (an aversion to taking things too seriously) and the pervasiveness of humour in social interaction. This humour is of a particular kind: self-deprecating and given to understatement and irony. It’s unsurprising that this national trait has made its way into the language. Romantic activities (like ‘snog’ and ‘shag’) are spoken of in childish terms. Classic dishes are made to sound deliberately unappetising (‘dead man’s arm’ and ‘Eton mess’ – respectively, a rolled cake filled with jam and a dessert combining meringue, strawberries and cream. And there’s a healthy appetite for nonsensical ambiguity. To take just one example, ‘ladybird’ is a bugbear of perplexed Americans who wonder – although their version of the word is only slightly more sensible – “Why ladybird? Why not ladybug?” This hints at a gleeful willingness in British English to dispense with literal meaning. Food, for instance, is a rich vein of words like this. ‘Fairy cake’, ‘toad in the hole’, and ‘jacket potato’ have nothing to do with fairies, toads and jackets. Child’s play There’s a long tradition in British English of inventing words just for the fun of it. Eminent linguist David Crystal writes in The Story of English in 100 Words that ‘a gaggle of geese’, ‘an unkindness’ of ravens’, and other collective nouns of this ilk were created in the 15th Century. He speculates that this was done deliberately for comic effect, giving rise to ‘a superfluity of nuns’ (pun intended). While whimsical British terms have been coined in every era, certain periods have been especially fruitful. According to Crystal, linguistic inventiveness, particularly of a playful kind, seems to have peaked in the Elizabethan era. This is partly due to the enduring influence of wordsmiths like Shakespeare and his fellow dramatists. Meanwhile, Crystal adds, at this time “there were more people writing, with pressure to produce new plays to feed the daily demands of the new theatres. And there were no dictionaries to act as a stabilising influence.” This created a climate of lexical creativity, which we can thank for words like ‘balderdash’ (meaning, appropriately, a nonsense word or idea). Here are seven of our favourite silly-sounding British words: Since Shakespeare, British writers from Charles Dickens (‘whiz-bang’) and Lewis Carroll (‘mimsy’) to JK Rowling (‘muggle’) have continued to enliven English vocabulary. As Liberman points out, it’s not that these authors had a monopoly on childlike wit. Rather, historically, British English’s “influence was mainly exercised by great authors,” he says. “The joys and charm of British English have to be sought in the works of the great wits of various epochs. For comparison, in the US, the only figure of comparable size – in this respect – is Mark Twain.” Of course, there’s a risk of over-interpreting the relationship between culture and vocabulary. Fanciful terms can be found in all varieties of English: linguists also have written about how terms like ‘face like a dropped pie’ and ‘cultural cringe’ reflect an Australian culture of informality and ‘mateship’. To make matters more complex, the border between British and American English – the two most influential forms of English – is fairly blurry. In fact, many of the words popularly believed to stem from one country actually originated in the other. The University of Sussex’s Lynne Murphy, who has a blog and a forthcoming book about differences between US and UK English, notes that many Americans incorrectly think ‘bumbershoot’ and ‘poppycock’ are British words. That’s simply, she says, because “a lot of Americans stereotype the British as having silly words.” So words that fit that expectation are the ones that gain a great deal of currency overseas. This is also true of terms that mainly sound comical due to their difference from US terms. Murphy explains that Americans love slang with a (non-flattened) short ‘o’ sound, such as ‘cosh’, ‘bollocks’ and ‘dogsbody’, because “that’s a sound that Americans don’t make”. Even off-colour words can come to seem charming, if they’re sufficiently British and familiar. For instance, there were reports that before James Corden started hosting his late-night chat show in the US, his network instructed him that ‘shag’ and ‘squiffy’ were acceptable, but potentially puzzling words like ‘knackered’ weren’t. Mixed bag Today, a great deal of lexical innovation in English is coming from multilingual places, often former British colonies. One habit is transforming the meaning of British or American words (for example, the word ‘deadwood’ means ‘unproductive civil servant’ in Botswanan English). Another is coining words to refer to locally specific situations (like ‘killer litter’ in Singaporean English, referring to the dangerous practice of throwing objects off tall buildings). Not all of these ‘New Englishes’ are deliberately aiming to be humorous. Take Nigerian English, for example, with its delightful coinages like ‘go-slow’ for ‘traffic jam’. Farooq Kperogi of Kennesaw State University in the US has written extensively about Nigerian English. He says that the humour of terms like ‘go-slow’ (and archaic turns of phrase like ‘men of the underworld’ rather than ‘criminals’) is inadvertent. “One of the abiding features of Nigerian English is excessive lexical formality even in informal contexts, which produces unintended comical effects in native-speaker ears,” he notes. “There is nothing in Nigerian English that is purposely humorous.” But unfamiliarity and unexpectedness can give this kind of creativity a comic effect. And in Nigeria, Kperogi explains, “unintentional humour almost always occurs when Nigerian English, which is fundamentally rooted in British English, collides with American English”. However, given the continued primacy of British and American English, amusing words from other forms of English have been slow to reach the global mainstream. This may change, though. With the increasing influence of Nigerian and Indian cinema, for instance, it may only be a matter of time before a word like ‘prepone’ – an antonym of ‘postpone’ in Indian English – enters the vocabulary of British English speakers.

currency fluctuations,The country tourism took by surprise,2024-09-15,2017-02-22,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170222-the-country-that-tourism-has-taken-by-surprise,"What happens to an economy when a country has a sudden and unexpected influx of tourists? Iceland offers intriguing lessons about the impact on cities, the environment and even food supply. Globetrotting Tourist numbers are increasing Over the last 20 years, the number of international tourists has risen steadily. In 1995, around 500 million people travelled abroad – last year, around 1.2 billion people did. It is also an increasingly lucrative industry. In 2015, global revenue from tourism was $1.26 trillion – double what it was in 2005. It contributes more than $7 trillion to the global economy and supports one in 11 jobs around the world. A girl scoops up a huge dollop of sticky white mud and ladles it into the hands of her friend, who smiles and gasps as it spills back into the water. Dozens of people are here, neck deep in a heated pool of soothing seawater. The late November air temperature is around 0C but the lagoon is like a hot bath. An electronic display at the exit to the changing rooms reads 38C. People apply mud masks and video themselves on smartphones encased in little plastic pouches. The Blue Lagoon is well known to Iceland’s visitors. The artificial pool, warmed by a nearby geothermal power plant, is particularly arresting at night. Huge clouds of steam billow into the starry black sky above the crowds of British, French, American, Russian and Chinese holidaymakers who have all come here to soak. Iceland’s hot pools have long been popular. But the number of people visiting the country has increased dramatically in the last few years. Iceland has a population of just over 330,000. Last year, around 1.7 million tourists came to visit. And the numbers are expected to continue rising. Iceland is experiencing a tourism boom that has taken it by surprise – and the influx is changing the once isolated country in interesting ways. After the 2008 financial crisis, the value of the Icelandic krona fell heavily. As part of its economic recovery, Iceland made deliberate efforts to attract foreign visitors. But even those responsible for marketing Iceland abroad have been struck by the numbers. “I don’t think anyone could have expected this,” says Inga Hlin Palsdottir at Promote Iceland, a PR organisation for the country. What’s going on? In many ways, Iceland provides a snapshot of several shifts going on in the world: a move everywhere towards service industries like tourism, which now supports one in 11 jobs on the planet; fluctuations in national economies that have knock-on effects at home and abroad; and the impact of cheaper and more available air travel. The uptick in visitors may also partly be down to people’s growing awareness of the country. Iceland has been in the news quite frequently in recent years. There was the financial crisis that broke its banks and sent the country into political turmoil. There were the eruptions of its Eyjafjallajökull volcano in 2010, which grounded flights across Europe. And last year Iceland’s football team won fans around the world when it reached the quarter-finals in its first ever appearance at the European Championships. But one of the biggest factors has surely been the growing availability of low cost airline tickets from Europe and the United States. Passenger numbers at Keflavik International airport have grown steadily over the last 10 years. In 2016 alone the number of people passing through the airport leapt by 40%, from nearly five million to nearly seven million. In particular, Icelandair’s offer of a free stop-off in the country for passengers travelling across the Atlantic has had a big effect, says David Goodger at analysts Oxford Economics. “People are breaking their trip to spend a few nights in Iceland itself,” he says. “They’ve done a very good job at selling into that market.” Other stop-off destinations for flights between Europe and the Far East have pulled the same trick. “It’s what the likes of Dubai and Singapore did very successfully a few years ago.” The effect of tourist spending is clear, especially in Reykjavik. “Look at this area here,” says Palsdottir, gesturing out of the window of a trendy hotel in Reykjavik’s marina. “During the financial crisis, this was a dead area.” Elsewhere in the city, work to accommodate the visitors continues. A huge building site just 10 minutes’ walk away will soon be home to a brand new, five-star Marriott hotel opening in 2018. At Keflavik airport, a billboard boasts to travellers that it is getting a 7,000 sq m extension. Even the Blue Lagoon is being made bigger. The range of attractions tempting visitors like these is growing, too. In 2014, a new tour was launched where tourists can pay to be driven to a remote glacier and then walk through an ice-tunnel drilled into its glassy bulk – the longest artificial ice-tunnel in the world. In their second year, the tunnel had 22,000 visitors – 50% more than expected. But all these visitors need feeding. One of the local food industry’s biggest current challenges is meeting the demands of tourists who expect to be able to order everything from sauteed asparagus to Waldorf salads on a whim. In Iceland, which must import much of its food, that’s not easy. The sharp fall in the value of the krona in 2008 made importing fresh food prohibitively difficult. One impact of this was the closure of all three McDonald’s restaurants in the country. The person running the franchise said the cost of importing necessary ingredients had simply become too high. Yet even the demise of a fast-food franchise has become a tourist attraction. The “last McDonald’s in Iceland” – a burger and fries bought on 30 October 2009, the day before the restaurants closed – is on display in a local hostel. Visitors are invited to take a selfie with the surprisingly well preserved meal. For anyone who can’t make it to Iceland, there is a live webcam feed. With imports reduced, people turned to locally-produced fruit and vegetables grown in geothermally heated greenhouses. One local farm decided to try and cash in on the tourist boom a few years ago with a horse show, but visitors were more interested in the tomatoes, says Gudridur Helgadottir at the Agricultural University of Iceland. “They always thought this would be about the horses but interest in the greenhouses grew and grew,” she says. “So they decided to open up a restaurant.” Many businesses have benefited from tourism. A chef at a tiny ramen bar in Reykjavik – which sits next to the construction site for a new guesthouse – is cheerful about the changes. “If they get cold watching the seals, they can come and have my soup.” But not everyone is happy. Later, one local says she worries that Reykjavik will soon start to look just like any other large city in Europe, with the proliferation of steel and glass hotels. Increasing demand for accommodation could also cause problems for locals. The government recently took steps to limit the availability of Airbnb rooms, for instance. The fear was that residents faced being pushed out of hotspots like downtown Reykjavik due to rising house prices. Another concern is the impact of so many foreign visitors on the largely pristine environment. Salome Hallfredsdottir works for the Icelandic Environment Association. Last August, she drove to Landmannalaugar, a stretch of terrain at the edge of a lava field in the country’s highlands. But as she arrived, she was greeted by the sight of hundreds of parked cars and far more tourists than she’d ever seen at the spot. “I was pretty shocked,” she says. Hallfredsdottir is particularly concerned about the impact on the highlands, which she calls “the only untouched wilderness left in Europe”. There is a heated debate about whether all of the highlands should be designated as a protected area. One problem is off-road driving, says Hallfredsdottir. It only takes one driver to leave tracks in the dirt for others to think the route is an official one, she says. The damage caused to young plant life and rocky formations can be considerable. “We don’t want every part of the highlands to be accessible,” says Hallfredsdottir. She also wants to see a rise in the number of rangers, who can keep tourists to the appropriate trackways and paths, and also intervene when necessary to prevent littering and other negligent behaviour. No-one has yet worked out how to pay for an expansion of facilities and staff at natural attractions, however. One proposal, a “nature pass” that would have cost 1,500 ISK ($14) per person for access to previously free sites, was rejected by Iceland’s parliament in 2015. However, at one of the most popular national parks, Thingvellir, visitors at least now have to pay to use the car park. Advocates of Iceland’s flourishing new industry are convinced the influx is positive overall, however. “We will all benefit in the end,” says Palsdottir. “We will get better roads, we will get better paths.” But could Iceland’s tourist boom just be a bubble? The sector has grown to rival fishing as one of Iceland’s major industries, generating around 5-6% of GDP – roughly double what it is in most other European countries. Iceland’s yo-yoing currency is a risk, however. A recent fall in the relative values of pound sterling and the US dollar has meant that the two biggest groups of visitors – the Americans and British – have suddenly found their trips cost them more. “Our modelling shows that there is a clear relationship between currency movements and tourism performance,” says David Goodger at Oxford Economics in the UK. The current expectation is that Iceland’s tourism industry will continue to grow, even if it does so at a slower rate. But that is not a given. “Large shifts in currencies could completely undermine that,” he says. “If they become a much more expensive destination then, we could definitely see that reversing.” In other words, Iceland’s tourism bonanza – which surely helped strengthen the krona – could end up undoing itself if prices continue to rise relative to other countries. But the crowds aren’t going anywhere just yet. Back at the Blue Lagoon, one visitor pipes up to her friends: “It would have been even more awesome if there had been fewer people.”"
currency fluctuations,Should you invest in Bitcoins?,2024-09-15,2013-07-03,Constance Gustke,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130702-should-you-invest-in-bitcoins,"Bitcoin has leapt onto the global stage with a bang — and a crash. The digital money has already plunged from a high of $260 in April to today’s value of about $92 Still, Bitcoins, used to purchase goods online or transfer money to other people, have steadily gained traction since they were invented in Japan in 2009. Germany has Bitcoin marketplaces where holders can exchange the currency. Designed to be a global currency, Bitcoin is also gaining popularity in countries like Argentina and Kenya, amid worries about local currency devaluation. Merchants, such as online dating site OkCupid, are slowly starting to accept the digital money for goods and services. On Monday, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known for their legal dispute with Facebook Inc’s Mark Zuckerberg over the origin of the social networking site, unveiled plans to offer shares of a Bitcoin trust — designed to operate like an exchange-traded fund — to the public. According to an initial public offering filing in the United States, the shares would allow investors to “gain exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk.” Despite the hoopla, Bitcoin is still a niche digital currency. It faces numerous challenges on the road to wide-spread acceptance, including volatile price spikes and daily volume surges that point to rampant speculation. Also hindering growth: even sophisticated financial thinkers have trouble understanding how it works. So far, global adoption is still tiny. Less than 1% of the world’s population uses Bitcoin actively, according to estimates, though use is accelerating in the US and parts of Europe. The next 24 months will be crucial to whether the currency will survive and grow, say some experts. Though venture capitalists and technology start-ups are rushing to solve concerns around Bitcoin, any significant expansion is still uncertain given recent market fluctuations. Long-term investors may walk away if volatility continues. Much more likely, Bitcoin may become one digital currency among many others coming to market. “Even if Bitcoin doesn’t survive, cypto-currencies will,” said California-based Andreas Antonopoulos, who advises organisations on emerging technologies and trends.    Origins Bitcoin is a form of electronic money that is not controlled by a person or institution. New units are mined by programs that crack complex mathematical problems and release new blocks of coins, though release is limited to only 21 million virtual coins. Only 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes can be created to control inflation. There are currently about 11.3 million in circulation. The limited supply makes them like digital gold, said Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Bitcoin Education Project. To buy Bitcoin, most people go to Japan-based Mt.Gox, which accepts 17 currencies. Fees are less than .60%.    Ease of use depends on where you live. Adoption is ramping up with small merchants in the US, Canada and parts of Europe, say experts. New trading platforms like Russia-based Bitc-e.com, which also accepts other alternative currencies like Webcreds.com, are even popping up. France recently launched its Bitcoin Central exchange, too. “Europe is a bit ahead of the US,” said Jonathan Waller, who runs a Bitcoin meet-up in Tokyo. Uphill climb Despite this frenzied activity, Bitcoin faces an uphill climb. Its greatest strength — sitting outside the global financial system — is also a weakness. Few retailers accept the currency, though more, like the San Francisco-based social news site Reddit and even US-based blogging platform Wordpress, are accepting it. Rigorous control of new Bitcoin makes expanding usage beyond a cult currency difficult. The biggest challenge might be volatility. As little as $3 million injected into Mt.Gox can spike prices, say experts. In April, Bitcoin plummeted $130 in a day, from a high of $260.  This volatility is catnip for speculators, who seek to profit from sudden price fluctuations. Bitcoin’s main problem is that value is based on whatever the next guy will pay, said Brian Riley, a senior research analyst at the Boston-based research and advisory firm CEB TowerGroup.  “This makes them a speculative currency,” he said. “Speculators are making a mess of Bitcoin,” said Antonopoulos. When traders jump in and out of the currency, it adds to volume spikes. There are currently 182 global currencies, said Riley. “Why do we need another one?” he said. Bitcoins are so volatile that owners must either spend them immediately, before they lose value, or hold them as investments. Turning cash into Bitcoins can take days. Many people rely on cumbersome in-person Bitcoin exchanges facilitated by Bitcoin web sites such as localBitcoins.com, where people meet and exchange currency. For these reasons, investors and consumers should not put more than 5% of their money into the currency, added Waller.  “Bitcoins are one big monetary experiment,” said Hoskinson. Easing concerns There is a chance that these Bitcoin choke points will be solved by an influx of new technology. In the US, a flurry of well-known venture capitalists such as New York City tech wizard Fred Wilson, an early investor in Tumblr and Foursquare, are spearheading Bitcoin startups. The aim: developing better e-wallets, payment systems and even automatic teller machines (ATMs), where you can exchange cash for Bitcoin. Dozens of startups in California’s Silicon Valley are also attacking Bitcoin distribution problems, said Antonopoulos. “Lots of venture capitalists are pouring money into Bitcoin without understanding them,” he added.   History is rife with examples of early movers — Myspace is one — that ended up in technology graveyards due to stronger competitors, though. And currently, at least one dozen virtual currencies like litecoin and ripple are vying for a piece of the digital currency market. These new currencies aren’t tough competitors, said Waller, though there’s still a real risk that Bitcoin won’t survive this onslaught."
currency fluctuations,Bitcoin or bust?,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131219-bitcoin-or-bust,"Digital Currency Primer Digital currencies are “mined,” traded and exchanged. (The
Chicago Federal Reserve has published Bitcoin:
A Primer. Bitcoin.org and Blockchain.info which are repositories
for information and transactions. And numerous Bitcoin exchanges exist around
the world for swapping Bitcoin with other currency.)  According to the Chicago Fed, Bitcoin is a fiduciary
currency and “inherently fragile.” Most fiduciary currency derives its value
from “government fiat,” which means the government says it has value or at
least someone else is willing to accept it as valuable. This is in contrast to
commodity-based currency which is itself often a precious metal of value. Is digital currency finally moving from mania to mainstream? In the past few weeks, Bitcoin — the most widely used digital or virtual currency — has “gone parabolic,” as financial market watchers like to say, soaring from a value of $800 to $1200, then rapidly losing half as much as half its value after a Chinese exchange stopped accepting yuan deposits. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have captured the world’s collective imagination. Not so much for their use, but more for what the emerging phenomena say about the global economy, government-issued fiat currencies and central bank policies. To true believers — and even some academics and wealth managers — investors should hold Bitcoin in addition to gold and other alternatives to help diversify their existing portfolio of investments. But not so fast, say others. It’s a volatile and unproven currency, often fluctuating more than 10% in one day.  The US dollar? Fractions of a percent. Same for the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound. Even gold’s rapid decline in 2013 has been measured on a daily basis, aside from a 9% drop on April 15. In the spotlight So, should consumers be joining the digital currency revolution, and holding Bitcoin alongside other alternatives like gold? Not exactly. But the increasing volume of alternative, cross-border currency is still worthy of attention. Even legitimate currency strategists from both Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have attempted to tackle Bitcoin’s place in the world. But there’s also broad concern. A hearing on the “risks, threats and promises” of virtual currencies was recently held by a US Senate committee. The People’s Bank of China has moved to bar financial institutions from Bitcoin transactions. Other central banks — in France and South Korea, for example — have issued consumer warnings on Bitcoin, cautioning buyers and merchants that its volatility could undermine its utility. Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who coined the term “irrational exuberance” to explain the Japanese real estate bubble and, in turn, warn about late 1990s tech stock valuations, has said that digital currencies have no “intrinsic value.” Outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, however, took a more hedged approach, saying that virtual currencies “may have long-term promise.” Still, for many people, the lure of Bitcoin and other alternative currencies may be too much to ignore. Treading cautiously — and understanding the pitfalls — is key to mitigating your risk of getting burned. “Technology is a tremendously disruptive force in society, and it knows no boundaries,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist for broker ConvergEx, in reference to the advance and hype around Bitcoin. How, exactly, does digital currency work? Created in 2009, Bitcoin are finite (21 million will ultimately exist) and can be transacted in units as low as one “Satoshi” or 0.00000001 BTC, as Bitcoin are abbreviated. Bitcoin are created and recorded on a decentralized computer network, which work together to verify the “mining” of new Bitcoins and cross-reference and record any Bitcoin transaction. Bitcoins move from one owner to the next when each party to a transaction sends (and confirms) an exchange. It could be anything from an online purchase to an international money transfer to settling a sports bet. Transactions are then verified across the network, to prevent double-spending of Bitcoin. As described by a Chicago Federal Reserve primer, Bitcoin and other digital currencies are “inherently fragile” because there’s no way to gauge actual value or price. Buyers and sellers of the currency can debate its value or one side can simply chose not to accept it as payment. The value of official currencies, also called legal tender, is not ever in dispute. Virtual utility? Early on, Bitcoin was used to pay software programmers for their time and effort developing Bitcoin protocols, but its use has extended to general merchandise, online gambling, and, until recently, an intricate illegal drug-dealing network called “The Silk Road.” So far, though, no major retailer has opened up their cash registers for volatile digital currencies. So the currency is used mainly by  an ad hoc network of small buyers and sellers, although their numbers are growing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch FX and Rates Strategist David Woo attempted to divine a fair value for Bitcoin, triangulating its usage in e-commerce and money transfer and its use as a store of value. Woo pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility undermines its role as a medium of exchange — that is transactions plummet as volatility rises. In spite of this, Woo wrote in his note that Bitcoin’s low transaction costs can make it attractive: it is inherently a peer-to-peer currency system and doesn’t require banks or other financial intermediaries to take their cut on transfers or storage. Its encrypted format also makes it more impervious than cash to theft or counterfeiting, he said. That said, Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and suffered network outages, resulting in wild price fluctuations and stolen Bitcoins. “The combination of legal tender status and supply anchors the value of dollars in transactions in a way that Bitcoin will never be anchored,” said CitiFX strategist Steven Englander. And then there’s the competition. Developers for other digital currencies such as Litecoin and open-source payment networks are constantly looking to improve upon (replace) Bitcoin. It’s an “issue that the internet currencies will not be able to overcome easily,” said Englander. Considering the traditional national and international system of currency that exists today, it’s not unreasonable to think cooperating governments could eventually come together to build in some of the features of a digital currency — with transaction verification and security to limit fraud and theft. They could “steal” some of the appeal of Bitcoin by making the alternative safer. In our networked world, we often see companies and governments work to cut out alternative (sometimes illicit) activity and bring it to light. Napster was co-opted first by litigation, then by Apple and iTunes. In the US, marijuana prices have been challenged by fresh legality in various states. Even loan-sharking in emerging economies has been diminished by innovative micro-lending platforms. Eventually Bitcoin will be challenged when governments, banks, merchants and individuals at the centre of the existing structure come together, experts said. Don’t think it could happen? The euro, born from the strength of the German Deutschmark, didn’t come in to existence until January 1, 1999 — then as a digital-only currency. "
currency fluctuations,Tremors in emerging markets,2024-09-15,2014-02-18,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140218-tremors-in-emerging-markets,"Signs of strengthening recovery from developed economies have sent shudders through emerging markets in recent months, prompting heavy outflows of money from countries spanning the globe from India to China and Brazil. Emerging market stocks first started to wobble as far back as last spring, when the US Federal Reserve began to discuss its timetable for pulling back on fiscal stimulus, bringing its era of ‘cheap money’ to a close. But if turbulent stock markets sound like a challenge for people in Ivory Towers or city skyscrapers, think again. The return of higher long-term interest rates in the US and Europe means marginal money and projects are being pulled-out of emerging market countries and businesses. Investors have been rapidly shifting their investments in favour of what look like tried-and-tested markets. Stock markets, interest rates and currency exchange rates around the world are all connected and they have a direct impact on your wallet and pay cheque. In short, this interconnectivity all boils down to how businesses grow. Businesses look at the cost of labour and the price of resources when they decide where to build plants and produce goods, as well as what to pay workers. So ultimately, the price you pay for everything from clothes to computers begins to shift as markets, interest rates and currencies fluctuate. Understanding how global business decisions trickle down to consumers can be challenging, even for the most-sophisticated analysts. Yet it is important for consumer to have a firm grasp on how it all works. At their most basic, exchange rates indicate the price of one currency against another. Underlying those rates are the costs of goods and services that can be bought in the respective currencies, as well as the cost to borrow that currency, i.e. the interest rate. The baseline for these rates is generally targeted by central banks – the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England – and individual and corporate rates are set in reference to that “risk-free” rate. Exchange rates and interest rates adjust daily, based on views of investors and borrowers and which countries/currencies they want to invest in. To get a clearer picture of the ties that bind global currencies and exchange rates together, BBC Capital spoke to Steven Englander, global head of G10 currency strategy at Citibank. Edited excerpts follow. BBC Capital: For many of us, our experience with exchange rates occurs only at a foreign bank if we are travelling or sending money to family abroad. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of “exchanging” going on, so what will really move exchange rates? Englander: It takes a bit of time for the full exchange rate [fluctuation] to really go through into prices [people pay at stores or charge for labour]. In many emerging economies, it moves quicker than in the US, UK and other developed economies. What does happen quickly is the perception that the economy is slowing down and [that] projects are not viable anymore. Economic activity, both corporate and consumer, gets hit very quickly as businesses stall projects [and stop paying workers, cut worker hours or delay buying goods.] BBC Capital: So how do people under, say, the euro which serves many countries and economies, feel the effects of and adjust to these shocks when the individual countries in the eurozone have little influence over their exchange rate and monetary policy? Englander: In the eurozone, the adjustment comes by incomes shrinking, which brings down borrowing levels [as business can’t afford to borrow for expansion and hiring.] This process is very painful, because it takes much longer for competitiveness to be restored. In addition, if foreign investors see an extended period of weakness [they are less likely to invest in the area]. BBC Capital: We've been reading a lot recently about emerging markets and the effect of the US Federal Reserve tapering off its bond buying. How are these related? Englander: The emerging market story is actually threefold. China is slowing and its support for commodity demand is dissipating. [This affects the price of commodities like copper and crude oil and demand for related currencies in Canada and Australia, for example.] The US is beginning to pull rein in bond purchases [which can contribute to long-term interest rates rising.] But some emerging markets responded to global liquidity of the past few years by borrowing more and consuming, rather than investing and implementing structural reform. Now we have a slower China, tighter credit, slower growth and lower commodity prices all happening at once, so countries that were eager to borrow are crunched. BBC Capital: It sounds like investing broadly in emerging markets and China could be challenging in the short-term. So how should investors view these inevitable fluctuations? Do they need to ‘hedge’ their currency exposure? Englander: Currency exposure is part of a diversified portfolio and helps reduce portfolio volatility. Many economists and strategists recommend at least 20% to 30% of a portfolio to be exposed to foreign currencies. This can be done by directly owning foreign currencies or through equity investments abroad or companies with significant business outside their home region. If you hold large US and UK companies — such as those in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index or FTSE 100 — you implicitly have foreign currency exposure. This should also be part of your core financial planning process, understanding how your portfolio and the companies you own are sensitive to individual regions, countries and currencies."
currency fluctuations,Twitter fired us then ghosted us – Africa staff,2024-09-15,2023-11-03,Nkechi Ogbonna,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67299483,"Sacked Twitter staffers in Africa are threatening to sue the company for failing to pay out the redundancy money they say they were promised. Most had only been in the job a matter of months when the social media platform, now known as X, told them they were fired last November. ""It's difficult when it's the world's richest man owing you money and closure,"" one of the sacked workers tells the BBC. The BBC has approached X for comment several times but was rebuffed with, among other things, a smiling poo emoji. A more recent attempt received this response: ""Busy now, please check back later."" The company has previously said that it had paid ex-employees in full. Elon Musk, who took over the company last year, embarked on a massive global cull of employees, sacking more than 6,000 people. He had said he was losing more than $4m (£3.5m) a day. The African contingent, who number fewer than 20, had only just moved into X's new office in Accra, Ghana, following about eight months of working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Sacked staffers told the BBC their treatment by X had harmed their mental health and their family finances. They said they were initially told that, although their contracts were being terminated, they would be paid to work for one more month. But they were immediately locked out of their emails and no further salary payments were made. Since then, the staff said they have been involved in a frustrating year-long struggle with X for compensation. ""Every time we get close, they go silent for weeks on end with no explanation. It has been one year since they were all laid off, defeating the entire purpose of a redundancy package, which is meant to cushion employees against the adverse effects of being laid off,"" said Carla Olympio from Agency Seven Seven, the company providing legal representation to the staff. In September, both parties agreed that all discussions and a settlement would need to be concluded by 5 October at the latest. But, said Agency Seven Seven, this was the latest of many deadlines X has ignored. In July, the BBC reported that the Africa ex-employees alleged that X had ""ghosted"" them in the middle of the negotiations, leaving them without severance pay and other work benefits, such as health insurance, stocks and shares options and unpaid leave allowances. Some of them had been employed from neighbouring countries like Nigeria. Their contract termination meant they were left stranded in Ghana after having moved their families. At the time, the BBC contacted X for a response, and that was when we received the smiling poo emoji in reply. Mr Musk had earlier tweeted that email requests made to their press office would automatically be replied to with this emoji. In a rare interview this April, he told the BBC that the social media giant now has 1,500 employees, down from the just under 8,000 who were employed at the time of his acquisition. When the news of Mr Musk's radical staff cull became public, he tweeted that laid-off employees were given three months' severance pay. But the staff sacked from the Africa office say they did not receive this. According to Agency Seven Seven, X only began negotiations with the sacked Africa staff after the BBC covered the story. But these negotiations have gone nowhere. ""We are now concluding arrangements with international colleague lawyers to pursue the matter in other jurisdictions, where Twitter, now X, might perhaps be compelled to do the right thing,"" said Ms Olympio. ""With currency fluctuations, the entire payment due to them now would be less than a drop in the ocean and yet 12 months later, no payment. It is inexcusable,"" she added. ""It is a shame that the company, since its takeover by Mr Musk... should apparently be so reluctant to do right by this very small Africa team."" This lawsuit against X brought by the Africa team is the latest in a number of cases against the company by other ex-employees, some of whom say they are yet to be compensated following Mr Musk's $44bn (£39.3bn) takeover last year. Earlier this year, X was hit by a lawsuit, filed by ex-employees in a California court, for allegedly refusing to pay at least $500m in promised severance packages.  Globally, the arbitration cases against the organisation stood at more than 2,200 as of August this year, according to a CNBC report.  A former Africa staff member told the BBC they were tired of having their hopes dashed.  Another said they were in shock but remained determined to get everything that was due to them. "
currency fluctuations,Inflation targeting: Has it worked?,2024-09-15,2015-03-11,Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/31559074,"Britain's annual inflation rate slowed to a record low of 0.3% in January Inflation targeting is 25 years old. It began in 1990 in New Zealand and the UK was one of the first to follow, two years later.  A quarter of a century after New Zealand set the ball rolling many central banks now have an inflation target, including the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. It has been a very uneven time in terms of economic performance. It includes a large part of the period known as the 'great moderation' when inflation was substantially lower than previous years and economic growth reasonably stable. But it also includes the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.  First though how does it work?   The basic tools are the same as with most other inflation control policies. The most important of them in normal times is the central bank's interest rate policy.   The basic idea is straightforward enough. The central bank looks at its inflation forecast. If that is above the target it will raise interest rates which will usually lead to slower growth in spending and so to slower price rises. If the inflation forecast is below target it cuts rates with the opposite effect.  There's another important aspect - expectations among businesses, workers and households, external.  If they expect inflation to be, say 2%, then they will set prices and pay deals on that basis and there's a better chance that inflation will be close to the target.  That is why you so often hear central bankers discussing how 'well-anchored' public inflation expectations are. The effectiveness of the approach depends to a significant extent on whether the public regards the inflation target and the central bank as 'credible'. Monetarism is seen by many as the brainchild of the late US economist, Milton Friedman The background to the rise of inflation targeting was the problems with alternative methods of containing rising prices.  The International Monetary Fund has described inflation targeting, external as ""a pragmatic response to the failure of other monetary policy regimes"".   There were two main earlier approaches: targets for either the money supply or exchange rates. Britain tried both in the 1980s and early 90s.  Money supply targets involve trying to ensure that some measure of money grows at a rate that's consistent with moderate inflation.  It is the approach often known as monetarism,, external associated particularly with the Nobel Prize winning economist, the late Milton Friedman.   Germany's Bundesbank used this approach for many years. But by the early 1990s the relationship between money supply and inflation was thought to be too erratic to be used as a guide to policy. In 1993, the then chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, external told Congress:  ""The historical relationships between money and income, and between money and the price level have largely broken down, depriving the aggregates of much of their usefulness as guides to policy."" In Britain, the policy was replaced with an exchange rate target. At first it was done in a less formal way by 'shadowing' the German mark. Then it became more rigid in 1990 when Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism (the ERM) a system that kept currency fluctuations within limited 'bands'. The basic idea with this approach is that you can only maintain the exchange rate target if your own inflation is reasonably close to that of the chosen foreign currency.  That ended dismally for Britain with the forced departure from the ERM as a result of massive speculation in the foreign currency markets.  The problem with exchange rate-based inflation policies is that they leave a country with little or no scope to use interest rates to respond to changes in their own economic circumstances.  A few weeks after the ERM debacle came the UK's adoption of inflation targeting. In the British case, the government remained in charge at first, until the responsibility for achieving the target was handed over to the Bank of England in 1997.  Central banks should be flexible in targeting inflation, says former Bank of England governor Lord King In practice, central banks do not focus exclusively on getting inflation to the target level. Those who think they should do that have been described by the former Bank of England governor Lord (Mervyn) King, external as ""inflation nutters"". Instead what central banks have generally done is known as 'flexible inflation targeting'.  The aim as a rule has not been to keep inflation on target all the time, but to do so over what is called the medium term, which means a few years    In spite of the focus on inflation in their explicit targets, central banks do generally respond to other economic problems - notably unemployment and weak growth.  The Federal Reserve in the United States was rather late to adopt a specific inflation target (in January 2012, external).  Moderate inflation has long been one of its objectives, part of what is called the Fed's ""dual mandate"" - maximum employment and stable prices.  It is true there is a third element, moderate long term interest rates,, external but it is less discussed and the phrase dual mandate is very widely used. For developed countries the target is usually around 2%. That is the figure chosen by the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. The European Central Bank aims at just below this target.  Critics say inflation targeting has constrained what action the Bank of England can take So has it worked? In Britain there have certainly been many occasions when the target has been missed by a sufficiently large margin that the governor of the Bank of England has had to write a public letter to the chancellor of the exchequer, external to explain why.  The most recent case was because inflation too low, but it has usually been the result of prices rising faster than the target rate.   One commentator recently described the target as meaningless, external. But over the longer term inflation has on average been much closer to the objective:  2.1% over 20 years, Lord King has said, external.  Prof Michael Woodford of Columbia University wrote, external that inflation targeting ""has resulted in a high degree of stability in medium-run inflation expectations during the crisis and its aftermath, and I believe that this has improved the stability of the real economy as well"".  Another challenge for the approach is the question of whether it made it harder for central banks to prevent the financial crisis. Prof Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University argues, external that ""in September 2008 it became clear that inflation targeting central banks had not paid enough attention to asset-price bubbles.""  He says it should not have been a surprise that boom-bust cycles can happen without inflation  Prof John Quiggin of the University of Queensland Australia, external, another critic of inflation targets, says ""central banks have failed, disastrously, and admitting this would be the first step towards a sustainable recovery"". Another complaint is that inflation targeting as in the UK - where it is the only explicit objective for monetary policy - constrained the Bank of England in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Prof Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford told the House of Commons Treasury Committee, external in 2012, that ""policy is providing insufficient stimulus to the UK economy now, because of the form of the current monetary policy regime"". He suggested exploring alternatives including something akin to the US Fed's dual mandate.  Prof Karl Whelan of University College Dublin wrote ""the Crisis has ruined inflation targeting's 'wonder drug' reputation"".  Boom-bust cycles can happen without inflation, say critics of inflation-targeting But there are plenty of supporters. A group of 14 leading economists, published an e-book , externaland the general conclusion - not shared by all of them - included this:  ""It (inflation targeting) is needed now more than ever to keep expectations anchored while the advanced economies work their way through today's slow growth, rickety banks, and over-indebted public sectors."" For now, that seems to be the view of most central banks. There are certainly challenges to what you might call the 'inflation targeting consensus', but so far it has survived them.  UK rates mark six years at 0.5% Low inflation temporary, says Carney UK inflation falls to record low Economy tracker: Inflation How quickly are prices rising in the UK?"
