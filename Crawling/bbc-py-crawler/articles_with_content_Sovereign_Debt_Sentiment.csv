Sovereign Debt Sentiment,What has Trump said about your country?,2024-09-14,2017-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39732845,"You can read an updated version of this page here.  Donald Trump is a man who prefers plain speaking to the language of diplomacy.  Find out what he has said about your country, which foreign leaders he has met or called since taking office, and which countries he has mentioned in his tweets.  Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.As the African Union expressed ""shock, dismay and outrage"" and demanded an apology, Botswana summoned the US ambassador and asked the envoy ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US."" According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor. But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods. During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. He tweeted that he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""  Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor told the BBC the idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US, tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country. One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless. During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan. Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country. The two leaders discussed security in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia. The US in May suspended $21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in November 2017 that it would remove the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua, introduced in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America.Thousands of Nicaraguans living in the US will now have until 5 January 2019 to seek ""an alternative lawful immigration status"" or leave. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list. The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry. More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president. When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trump tweeted in September 2013. But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action. ""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trump said. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy ships fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trump on the phone in February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"", according to the New York Times. The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list. The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality. President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" in a phone call with its leader in February. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela. ""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" he tweeted in mid-February. Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro. In an October tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflected statements made by Mr Trump at a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent a word of warning to President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company, gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee and a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                    
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                    
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruled President Donald Trump's travel ban on six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has also called on Saudi Arabia to ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of the first military operation authorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emerged that a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump. In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.  ""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan."" A New York Times article claimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.  Mr Trump responded to criticism by tweeting that it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"". Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She got a standing ovation and as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"". Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.

Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan. Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country. The two leaders discussed security in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia. The US in May suspended $21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trump on the phone in February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"", according to the New York Times. The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list. The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality. President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" in a phone call with its leader in February. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country. One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless. During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president. When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trump tweeted in September 2013. But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action. ""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trump said. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy ships fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela. ""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" he tweeted in mid-February. Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro. In an October tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflected statements made by Mr Trump at a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent a word of warning to President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company, gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee and a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor. But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods. During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US, tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. He tweeted that he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""  Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor told the BBC the idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list. The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry. More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruled President Donald Trump's travel ban on six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has also called on Saudi Arabia to ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of the first military operation authorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emerged that a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump. In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.  ""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan."" A New York Times article claimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.  Mr Trump responded to criticism by tweeting that it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"". Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She got a standing ovation and as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"".

Sovereign Debt Sentiment,'Dangerous undercurrents' in global economy,2024-09-14,2018-10-10,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45803283,"One of the most comprehensive studies of the state of banking and markets since the financial crisis warns that ""dangerous undercurrents"" are a rising threat to the world economy. The International Monetary Fund's Financial Stability Report says that although banks are far safer than they were in 2008 there are new risks. Trade tensions are growing, the IMF says, and inequality has risen. Further moves towards a trade war could ""significantly harm global growth"". Other threats to trade, such as a disorderly Brexit, could also ""adversely affect market sentiment"", the IMF argues. The US-based organisation says that a ""no-deal"" departure from the European Union could lead to fragmentation in European money markets, meaning that finance cannot flow around the system so efficiently. The body urges the Bank of England to be ready to provide more quantitative easing - money printing - if it is required. In a separate report, the IMF said the UK had historically weak public finances with high levels of debt and low levels of assets. Britain sold off many of its assets in the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and also did not create a sovereign wealth fund from its oil revenues, which Norway did.  Of leading industrialised countries, only Portugal's ""net worth"" was in a poorer position, the IMF said.  That could mean that Britain will have to raise more taxes in the future because government-owned asset growth will not provide as much support to the economy. The Financial Stability Report is the second time in 24 hours the IMF has published sober warnings about the state of global finance. On Monday, it downgraded world growth forecasts for next year, blaming new trade barriers. Tuesday's report says governments should resist attempts to roll back banking regulations put in place in 2008 to stop a similar financial crisis happening again. President Donald Trump has already pushed through laws repealing banking rules in America for smaller institutions, saying they were holding back bank lending to businesses.  The IMF also warns market investors, who have seen the largest upward bull run in stocks in history. The report says they are in danger of becoming complacent about the chances of an economic shock to the system. One could be the ending of ""easy money"". Central banks are starting to withdraw the stimulus that was put in place at the time of the financial crisis. Interest rates are rising and quantitative easing - money printing - being dialled back. The IMF fears this could lead to sharp falls in markets. The risks of a government funding crisis in Italy, where the country's banks are under pressure, is also highlighted. ""Looking ahead, clouds appear on the horizon,"" the report, published at the body's annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, says. ""Support for multilateralism has been waning, a dangerous undercurrent that may undermine confidence in policymakers' ability to respond to future crises. ""Nonetheless, despite trade tensions and continued monetary policy normalisation in a few advanced economies, global financial markets have remained buoyant and appear complacent about the risk of a sudden, sharp tightening in financial conditions."" The IMF's warnings will increase fears that the present buoyancy in global growth may not last. The American economy has been performing strongly, encouraging international investors to move capital there and invest in the dollar. To cool inflationary pressure, the American central bank, the Federal Reserve, is raising interest rates, which acts as a further attraction to global capital because returns are higher. That puts pressure on emerging market economies such as Turkey and Argentina, which have large amounts of debt which concerns investors. The IMF says there is a ""risk of contagion"" as investors become increasingly nervous about the strength of emerging markets, with the risk of capital flows towards the US accelerating. The report says that outflows could hit $100bn (£76.4bn) over a year, about 0.6% of emerging market economies' gross national income. That would be ""of a magnitude"" similar to the financial crisis."
Sovereign Debt Sentiment,"Who he was, what he did and why he mattered",2024-09-14,2021-04-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42651950,"The Duke of Edinburgh, arguably the world's most famous husband, has died at the age of 99. He spent seven decades in the shadow of his wife, the UK's Queen Elizabeth II - but his force of personality meant he would never be simply a professional spouse. So who was the man beside the monarch, and how did he come to marry the Queen? First things first: The Duke, also known as Prince Philip, was never in line for the throne - which his eldest son stands to inherit - and never held the title of king.  That's because in the UK, a woman who marries the monarch can use the ceremonial title of queen - but men who marry the monarch can't use the title king, which can only be used by male sovereigns.  The Queen and Prince Philip had four children together: Prince Charles, 72, Princess Anne, 70, Prince Andrew, 61, and 57-year-old Prince Edward.  As they tell it, Philip often exerted his will when they were young.  Royal biographer Ingrid Seward quotes Prince Andrew as saying of his childhood: ""Compassion comes from the Queen. And the duty and discipline comes from him.""  But Andrew also remembered how his father made time to invent bedtime tales, or listen to his children read Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories.  Prince Philip lived long enough to see his eight grandchildren grow up, and to welcome 10 great-grandchildren.  Curiously, Philip's journey to Buckingham Palace began back in 1922, in a crib made from an orange box. He was born on 10 June 1921 on the Greek island of Corfu, the youngest child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg.  That heritage made him a prince of Greece and Denmark, but the following year the family was banished from Greece after a coup.  A British warship carried them to safety in Italy, with baby Philip dozing in a makeshift fruit crate cot. Philip's childhood was fragmented, and darkened by a series of losses.  In 1930, when he was eight years old, his mother was committed to a secure psychiatric centre after suffering a nervous breakdown.  Philip saw little of either parent in the years that followed. His father retreated to the French Riviera with a mistress, and his mother's relatives in the UK helped raise him. He would later adopt their surname, Mountbatten - an anglicised form of the family name Battenberg. A Scottish boarding school, Gordonstoun, passed for home during his teens. Its founder and headmaster was Jewish educational pioneer Kurt Hahn, who had been forced out of Germany for condemning the Nazis.  The school gave Philip structure, and nurtured his self-reliance. Its somewhat Spartan regime saw pupils rise early for a freezing shower and cross-country running, which Hahn believed would combat the ""poisonous passions"" of adolescence. In 1937, one of Philip's four sisters, Cecilie, died in an air crash along with her German husband, mother-in-law, and two young sons. She was heavily pregnant at the time.  Cecilie had recently joined the Nazi party, which had near-totalitarian control of Germany. Grieving Philip, aged 16, walked through the streets of Darmstadt behind his sister's coffin, past crowds giving ""Heil Hitler"" salutes.  ""It's simply what happened,"" Prince Philip later said of that time. ""The family broke up. My mother was ill, my sisters were married, my father was in the south of France. I just had to get on with it. You do. One does."" When Philip left school, Britain was on the verge of war with Germany. He joined the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth (the UK's naval academy), where he proved a brilliant cadet and graduated top of his class. When King George VI paid an official visit in July 1939, Philip was charged with entertaining his young daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret.  Their governess, Marion Crawford (employed as a guardian for the princesses), recalled later that Philip had ""showed off a great deal"". He made quite an impression on the 13-year-old Elizabeth, as would soon become clear. Prince Philip served with distinction in World War Two, seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean. By October 1942, he was 21 years old - and one of the Royal Navy's youngest first lieutenants. The teenaged princess and the officer kept in touch by letter. Over Christmas 1943, after Philip had been to stay with the Royal Family, a photograph of him in naval uniform appeared on her dressing room table. It was a decisive gesture from a reserved but determined young woman. Some aides were sceptical. A famous sneer (since attributed to more than one official) claimed the prince was ""rough, ill-mannered, uneducated and would probably not be faithful"".  But naysayers could do nothing to deter the future Queen. According to biographer Philip Eade, Philip's letters from 1946 reveal an ardent young man with a new sense of purpose.  He wrote to his soon-to-be mother-in-law: ""I am sure I do not deserve all the good things that have happened to me. To have been spared in the war and seen victory, to have been given the chance to rest and to re-adjust myself, to have fallen in love completely and unreservedly, makes all one's personal and even the world's troubles seem small and petty.""  King George gave Philip permission to marry his daughter. But first there were some tweaks to make. The erstwhile Prince of Greece and Denmark became a naturalised British subject, formally joined the Church of England and abandoned his foreign titles.  On his wedding day, 20 November 1947, he was made Duke of Edinburgh, a name he was widely known by for the rest of his life. He was 26, and his new wife 21. The royal couple would have just over four years (and two children) together before duty came knocking.  The fateful news reached them at a game lodge in Kenya, during their 1952 tour of the Commonwealth. King George VI, Elizabeth's father, was dead at 56.  Commander Michael Parker, the Duke of Edinburgh's friend and private secretary, described the moment he realised his wife was now Queen.  ""He looked as if you'd dropped half the world on him. I have never felt so sorry for anyone in all my life. He just breathed heavily, in and out, as though he were in shock. He saw immediately that the idyll of their life together had come to an end."" Philip's naval ambitions were curbed. The new Queen Elizabeth would need her husband by her side. The Duke of Edinburgh was named as the Queen's consort. His primary function was to support his wife.  A long-running row broke out in the early 1950s when Philip wanted the Royal Family to take his surname, Mountbatten.  ""I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children!"" he fumed when the Queen was persuaded to keep Windsor. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba!"" Philip struggled to find purpose in the limited role set out for him. But as a natural pragmatist, he was determined to blow fresh air through the stuffier corridors of Buckingham Palace. The Duke never forgot his family's forced exodus from Greece, and believed monarchies must adapt to survive. He set up informal lunches where the Queen could meet people from a broader range of backgrounds. The footmen - palace servants with a traditional uniform - stopped powdering their hair. And when he learned the palace was running a second kitchen exclusively to feed the royals, he had one shut down.  Some changes were more personal, and reflected his childlike love of gadgets. Before the Coronation, when Philip and the future Queen moved into Clarence House in 1949, he happily installed an array of labour-saving devices, including one in his wardrobe that would eject a suit at the push of a button. The Duke also championed a 90-minute fly-on-the-wall BBC documentary entitled Royal Family, which aired in 1969 and was considered landmark television.  It featured the Queen feeding carrots to her Trooping the Colour horse, watching TV and discussing salad at a Balmoral barbecue while Princess Anne cooked sausages. At Buckingham Palace, Philip had intercoms put in so that servants no longer had to ferry written messages to his wife. He carried his own luggage, and cooked his own breakfast in his rooms with an electric frying pan - until the Queen objected to the smell.  As the longest-serving consort in British history, the prince took on some 22,191 solo engagements. When he retired from royal duties in 2017, he was said to be patron, president or a member of more than 780 organisations. Accompanying the globetrotting Queen on Commonwealth tours and state visits, he visited 143 countries in an official capacity, making use of his fluent French and German.  The countries included Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation, where he is revered by one rainforest community as the reincarnation of an ancient warrior. But one of his most enduring legacies is the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, founded in 1956 at the urging of his former headmaster, Kurt Hahn.  Participants aged 14-25 can gain awards by doing volunteer work, learning physical activities and skills, and undertaking an expedition like a mountain trek or a sailing trip. In 2016, almost 1.3 million young people were taking part in the scheme in more than 130 countries and territories worldwide. ""If you can get young people to succeed in any area of activity,"" its founder told the BBC, ""that sensation of success will spread over into a lot of others."" In his spare time, Philip was a talented sportsman. He learned to sail at Gordonstoun, and became a regular competitor in the regatta at Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, where sailing races are held each summer.  He loved equine sports, including carriage driving, and was among the UK's top four polo players in the mid-1960s.  He was also a committed environmental campaigner and wildlife advocate, becoming president of the World Wildlife Fund (UK) in 1961 - though he faced criticism when a picture emerged of him on a tiger shoot with the Queen in India the same year. Asked to sum up his contribution to British life, Prince Philip responded with typical frankness: ""I've just done what I think is my best. Some people think it's all right. Some don't. What can you do? I can't change my way of doing things. It's part of my style. It's just too bad, they'll have to lump it."" The prince drew repeated controversy by making outspoken or racially insensitive comments, including in 1986 when he told a group of British students in China: ""If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed."" Critics deemed him gaffe-prone and out of touch. His defenders saw the prince as a product of his times who was trying to share a joke.  Insiders said laughter was the glue that kept the forthright Prince Philip and the Queen together. He himself suggested it was her tolerance. The Queen's once-favoured speech-opener, ""my husband and I..."", was mocked in the 1960s and afterwards by satirists who called it archaic and stilted. She retired the phrasing, but the sentiment remained.  Her Majesty, now simply ""I"", summed up Prince Philip in a heartfelt speech for their Golden Wedding anniversary. ""All too often, I fear, Prince Philip has had to listen to me speaking. Frequently we have discussed my intended speech beforehand and, as you will imagine, his views have been expressed in a forthright manner. ""He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.""

Sovereign Debt Sentiment,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2011-11-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-15873438,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Italy's Mario Monti has begun debt talks with Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Nicolas Sarkozy, their first meeting since he took office. At the meeting in Strasbourg, they are likely to discuss Italy's economy and whether bonds should be issued by the whole of the eurozone instead of individual countries. In other debt news, the UK government's implied cost of borrowing dropped below Germany's for the first time in 2.5 years. If the UK was to borrow for 10 years today, it would pay an interest rate of 2.21%. Germany would pay 2.23%. The UK's economic growth rate between July and September was confirmed at 0.5%, compared with a 0.1% expansion in the second quarter. Portugal had its debt rating cut by Fitch to so-called ""junk"" status,  to BB+ from BBB-, and warned it could be cut again. Separately, German business sentiment unexpectedly rose in November for the first time since June, according to an Ifo survey. And in further debt news, Egypt's sovereign rating was also cut, from BB- to B+, after several days of violent clashes in Cairo ahead of the parliamentary elections. In the UK, Arcadia, the owner of Top Shop and BhS, reported a 38% fall in annual profits to £133m and says it expects to close up to 260 stores in the next few years. This video can not be played Biz Heads In Asian business news, Chinese internet company Alibaba posted a 12% rise in quarterly profits, but the figure was still below analysts' forecasts. In Taiwan, shares of smartphone maker HTC fell by 7% - the maximum allowed in one day - after the company cut its growth forecast. And Japan's Suzuki Motors has initiated arbitration proceedings against Volkswagen in an attempt to buy back its shares from the German carmaker. Volkswagen bought a 19.9% stake in Suzuki in 2009, but relations between the two have since deteriorated.

Sovereign Debt Sentiment,Rebooting the case for Scottish independence,2024-09-14,2018-05-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44252435,"Four years on from That Referendum on Scotland, and what's changed? Well, quite a lot, thanks to Brexit, three national elections, a new first minister, a new prime minister, the rise of Richard Leonard and Rees-Moggery, plus an oil and gas slump. But the polling figures on independence have barely shifted. ""Why?"" I was asked this week by a semi-detached Nationalist.  ""Because the arguments haven't moved,"" he answered himself. Neither side has reflected, in public at least, on where their arguments needed sharpening up, least of all on the economic questions. Until today - 25 May 2018. Remember the date. It just might turn out to be significant. The Sustainable Growth Commission will take some digesting. It's a weighty, meaty document. From what I've been told about its recommendations, it retains much of the sunny optimism that buoyed the Yes campaign in 2014, but to that has been added a big dollop of candour. As an economic prospectus for independence, it recognises that people were not sufficiently reassured in 2014, least of all about their pensions, savings and mortgages. They heard glib assurances back then that negotiations with Westminster would go swimmingly, because that would be in Westminster's interest. Downing Street would give Scotland what was asked for, including joint control of sterling. Transition costs were so low as to lack any serious costing. And a higher economic growth rate would flow from an enlightened administration taking all the right policy and fiscal decisions, without facing economic or political headwinds or any internal contradictions on lowered tax and higher spending. I recall one Yes supporter wryly comparing the sentiment of the movement back then to the Summer of Love in 1967. Everything good was possible, and all at once. Nothing bad need happen. It was groovy, man. Andrew Wilson is no hippie, though he draws deeply on the pipe of positivity and optimism. The commission he has led has applied candour to each of the weaker points in the 2014 economic prospectus, and conceded some ground to the critics of independence, in the interests of credibility. Take the currency for instance. The new plan does not seek shared control of the Bank of England.  It takes the word of the former governor, Lord (Mervyn) King, that Scotland could certainly be independent, and it could use sterling, but at one big cost: Holyrood would have to accept whatever monetary decisions are made in the City of London, and made in the interests of a London-dominated nation that no longer included Scotland. If Scotland's economy were out of sync with the cycle in the UK, that could be painful. That's how it was in the 1990s, and Alex Salmond railed against it. But in recent years, London has been the outlier, and Scotland has been at or near the UK average. So interest rate and financial policies set for the British middle ground, even without Scotland in Britain, might have suited Holyrood just fine. A central bank would be set up, without control over interest rates, and there would be a regulator, but with a light workload, as the banks would have shifted at least their brass plates south of the Border, to be regulated from London.  Any smaller financial institutions, still based in Scotland, would have low expectations of a bail-out - though since the crash, that's now the message to all lenders. Or take fiscal policy. The Wilson Commission gulps in full the harsh message from GERS - Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland.  A deficit, including oil and gas revenue, at nearly 10% of national output, or Gross Domestic Product, is not sustainable, it is conceded. So what to do? A lot of work has gone into the answer. It is not simply to grow the economy faster, as the name of the commission suggested it should. The days of the tiger economies, at least in Europe, have gone.  The best hope for boosting growth in the short term - productivity being a longer-term project - is seen as a boost to immigration, with a ""Come to Scotland"" campaign, and financial incentives thrown in.  That's easy for an economist to say: less so for a politician (I intend to return to the question of growth once I've had a chance to digest the recommendations). A key element of the Wilson answer to the fiscal question is discipline on spending. This looks like, politically, the most difficult factor to manage, in an excited environment where expectations can run away from reality. The constraint would not be a real terms cut, but instead a very small increase, at 1% below the cash terms increase in economic growth. For example, suppose 2% inflation and 1.5% real growth, which is not an unreasonable target, meaning 3.5% cash growth. Pare that back to a disciplined 2.5% increase in public spending, and you could guess that would make for uncomfortable discussions round the Cabinet table.  The aim, remember, is to be doing this over the years when immense pressure is expected to build on health and social care budgets. The Wilson report adds to that a cut in defence, including the nuclear deterrent budget, to 1.6% of national economic output (To be clear: Trident money would not be spent on other priorities. It would be put into deficit reduction). Then review tax collection and get it to the same level of efficiency as the best of smallish nations. There's a call for a rigorous review of all spending, to ensure that the government doesn't keep spending on the priorities of 10 or 20 years ago, just because it's aye been, and because those programmes are too difficult to cut. And oil and gas? No, that is taken out the equation, to be treated as a windfall, and put into a future generations fund for long-term projects. All this assumes a taxing and spending regime which doesn't depart much from what we have at the moment. In the early years, it does not encourage people to think that Scotland would shift either to a high-tax, high welfare Scandinavian model or low tax and low regulation. Nor does it battle through the thicket of possibilities around Brexit, and where Scotland might find itself over the next few years.  For five to 10 years of such a fiscal plan, it is reckoned that an independent Scotland would be running a deficit and building up debt. Modelling with what they say are conservative assumptions, the deficit would fall to 3% in the ninth year.  That's the level widely seen, as in euro currency rules, to be a safe and stable level of deficit. Only then could the government start to look at the five other tests being set for creating a Scottish currency - a small package of tick boxes designed to reassure voters and the markets with a canny nod to caution. So while leaving monetary policy to the Bank of England, and requiring tight discipline on spending, the rhetoric of independence or even ""taking back control"" begins to lose its shine. Critics of independence might well question if it would be worth all the effort, and £450m in estimated transition costs, only to find that a change in constitutional status hasn't moved the dials much.  But that's one of the many lessons we're in the early stages of learning from the Brexit process. ""Taking Back Control"" in an open, modern economy is something of a mirage. Even a sovereign parliament is constrained by international agreements and market orthodoxies.  And even at Whitehall's scale and depth, the capacity of government to negotiate and and to manage upheaval is itself a major constraint.  In turn, that places tight limitations on what else it can be expected to achieve in managing or reforming public services. Unpicking economic unions, whether 45 years in the making in Europe or 311 years in Britain, is much more complicated than it might look at first. Bigger and established players in negotiations tend to have most leverage.  When it's done, independence has to be combined with some dependence and a lot of inter-dependence, requiring compromise. And as the Swiss sometimes observe about their relations with Brussels, the negotiations never stop. In that sense, though in few others, the Brexit negotiations may be doing the Scottish constitutional debate a favour. Looking at London and Brussels, Scots can see and smell the rubber hitting the road.   Voters may be more likely, therefore, to seek and reward candour, rather than jumping on the bandwagon painted in the brightest red and sporting the most populist slogan. That's among the big challenges thrown down by the Wilson Commission. The report gives the independence movement something big and meaty to chew on, and to debate internally, perhaps then to move the dials in its direction on the Yes and No polling.  It throws down the gauntlet to opponents of Scottish independence to reflect at least as seriously on the campaign they ran in 2014. They got the majority. But at least some must surely be wary of complacency. Would the same campaign and arguments work again, in the wake of Brexit, and against the Andrew Wilson prospectus? And the report is also a challenge to all of us who take some part in the debate about Scotland's future.  From what we know about it so far, the report of the Sustainable Growth Commission sounds like a serious document for serious times.  It is a more mature approach than we've seen for a long time, and surely demands a mature response."
Sovereign Debt Sentiment,What exactly is populism?,2024-09-14,2018-03-06,By David Molloy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-43301423,"What do Donald Trump, Jeremy Corbyn, and Rodrigo Duterte have in common? Despite their differences, each man has been labelled a populist. Populism is on the rise - especially among Europe's right, and in the US, where it helped crown Mr Trump. Italy's populist Five Star Movement and anti-immigrant League parties have emerged as two major players in the latest elections - the most recent of several such results in Europe. But there's a difference between being popular and being populist.  In political science, populism is the idea that society is separated into two groups at odds with one another - ""the pure people"" and ""the corrupt elite"", according to Cas Mudde, author of Populism: A Very Short Introduction. The term is often used as a kind of shorthand political insult. Britain's Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been accused of populism over his party's slogan ""for the many, not the few"" - but that's not quite the same thing. The word ""is generally misused, especially in a European context,"" according to Benjamin Moffitt, author of The Global Rise of Populism. The true populist leader claims to represent the unified ""will of the people"". He stands in opposition to an enemy, often embodied by the current system - aiming to ""drain the swamp"" or tackle the ""liberal elite"". ""It generally attaches itself to the right in a European context… but that's not an iron rule,"" Dr Moffitt said. Populist parties can be anywhere on the political spectrum. In Latin America, there was Venezuela's late President Chávez. In Spain, there is the Podemos party, and in Greece the label has also been applied to Syriza. All these are on the left. But ""most successful populists today are on the right, particularly the radical right,"" Prof Mudde said. Politicians ""like Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Donald Trump in the US, combine populism with [anti-immigrant] nativism and authoritarianism,"" he added. Commentators - from Time magazine to the President of the European Commission - have been warning about the rise of right-wing populism for years. But in reality, it's nothing new. ""Political scientists have been catching on to this for the last 25-30 years,"" Dr Moffitt says - but admits ""there's been an acceleration."" Experts point to both societal changes like multiculturalism and globalism, and more concrete crises as behind the rise of populist parties in Europe. Martin Bull, Director of the European Consortium of Political Research (ECPR), says the emergence of populist parties in Europe could be seen in the early 2000s - but they remained small for several years. The swell in support seemed to happen ""from 2008 - and particularly in 2011, when the banking crisis turned into a sovereign debt crisis"", he said. It was a rare occasion when an elite class - the wealthy bankers - could be identified as more or less directly responsible for a crisis which affected the majority of society. In his book The Global Rise of Populism, Dr Moffitt argues that there are other traits associated with the typical populist leader. One is ""bad manners"", or behaving in a way that's not typical of politicians - a tactic employed by President Trump and the Philippines' President Duterte. The other, he says, is ""perpetuating a state of crisis"" - and always seeming to be on the offensive. ""A populist leader who gets into power is 'forced' to be in a permanent campaign to convince his people that he is not establishment - and never will be,"" according to Prof Nadia Urbinati from Columbia University. She argues that populist content is ""made of negatives"" - whether it is anti-politics, anti-intellectualism, or anti-elite. Here lies one of the populism's strengths - it is versatile.  It is ""extraordinarily powerful because it can adapt to all situations,"" she said. Another common thread among populist leaders is they tend to dislike the ""complicated democratic systems"" of modern government - preferring direct democracy like referendums instead, according to Prof Bull. That also ties in to its links to authoritarianism, he argues - a lack of trust in the established system gives rise to ""strongman"" leaders. ""Ultimately, the leader makes the decision in a way that just isn't possible in traditional democracies,"" he says. That sentiment is perhaps best embodied by the late left-wing Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, who once said: ""I am not an individual - I am the people"". Such thinking ""can lead to people thinking they're infallible,"" Dr Moffitt said. ""It restructures the political space in a new and scary way"". After all, if you're not with ""the people"" - then you must be against us. That is why populist leaders are often viewed with suspicion - and why the term is often used as a type of insult for a politician who promises too much. It's what Prof Bull says is called ""irresponsible bidding"". ""In order to garner support, they're quicker than the establishment party to make offers, or to promise to change things… that on closer inspection may not turn out to be feasible,"" he said. ""You might question how good that is for democracy,"" he added."
Sovereign Debt Sentiment,UK 'at risk of slipping into recession',2024-09-14,2019-09-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49578410,"The UK is at risk of slipping into recession, according to a closely watched survey of industry managers. The dominant services sector grew only slightly in August, the purchasing managers' index (PMI) from IHS Markit/CIPS suggests. ""The lack of any meaningful growth... raises the likelihood that the UK economy is slipping into recession,"" said IHS economist Chris Williamson. The construction and manufacturing sectors also shrunk in August. The services sector accounts for 80% of the UK economy. According to IHS' survey, the sector barely expanded in August, achieving a score of 50.6 - down from 51.4 in July. Anything above 50 marks growth, while a lower number indicates a contraction.   However, the figure including manufacturing and construction was 49.7, the second contraction for the private sector in three months. IHS Markit said Brexit uncertainty and higher business costs were to blame. ""While the current downturn remains only mild overall, the summer's malaise could intensify as we move into autumn,"" added Mr Williamson. Between April and June the UK's economy contracted for the first time since 2012. A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters.  According to IHS Markit, UK firms are hiring and taking on new clients at a slower pace as they try to gauge whether the government will quit the European Union without a deal at the end of October. Service-based firms, which include hotels, restaurants, banks and insurers, are also seeing profit margins squeezed by rising staff wages , fuel costs and utility bills, the survey found. This measure also slipped into negative growth in 2016 following the Brexit referendum and in 2012, around the time of the European sovereign debt crisis. The numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty. Note too that they exclude the retail and government sectors, which still are growing,"" he said. He expects a 0.4% gain for the economy in the July to September period, assuming a deal is struck with the EU ahead of the UK's departure.     When official estimates were published last month showing the economy contracting in the second quarter of the year, it didn't yet indicate a recession.  For that, according to convention, you need two consecutive quarters where the economy shrinks.  Optimists hoped that the second quarter had been artificially depressed: as companies ran down stocks they had built up ahead of the cancelled March 29 Brexit deadline, they had less need to buy new supplies and that meant less economic activity.  The hope was that once that stockpiling effect was in the past, the economy would show a bounce-back.  The latest figures from purchasing managers (the finance directors and senior managers who watch their new orders and buy new supplies) - suggest activity in production and manufacturing shrank sharply in August.  Today's figures suggest the services sector which makes up about 80% of the economy is growing, but only just: perhaps not enough to compensate for contractions in the rest of the economy.  Taken together, they suggest the economy shrank in the third quarter of the year by 0.1%. The figures are by no means the final word on economic growth in the third quarter. But the concern that we may already be in recession no longer looks fanciful.           "
