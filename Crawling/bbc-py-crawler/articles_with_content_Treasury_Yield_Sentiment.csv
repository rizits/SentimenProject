Treasury Yield Sentiment,What has Trump said about your country?,2024-09-14,2017-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39732845,"You can read an updated version of this page here.  Donald Trump is a man who prefers plain speaking to the language of diplomacy.  Find out what he has said about your country, which foreign leaders he has met or called since taking office, and which countries he has mentioned in his tweets.  Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.As the African Union expressed ""shock, dismay and outrage"" and demanded an apology, Botswana summoned the US ambassador and asked the envoy ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US."" According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor. But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods. During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. He tweeted that he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""  Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor told the BBC the idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US, tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country. One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless. During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan. Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country. The two leaders discussed security in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia. The US in May suspended $21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in November 2017 that it would remove the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua, introduced in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America.Thousands of Nicaraguans living in the US will now have until 5 January 2019 to seek ""an alternative lawful immigration status"" or leave. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list. The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry. More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president. When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trump tweeted in September 2013. But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action. ""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trump said. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy ships fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trump on the phone in February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"", according to the New York Times. The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list. The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality. President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" in a phone call with its leader in February. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela. ""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" he tweeted in mid-February. Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro. In an October tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflected statements made by Mr Trump at a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent a word of warning to President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company, gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee and a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                    
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                    
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruled President Donald Trump's travel ban on six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has also called on Saudi Arabia to ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of the first military operation authorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emerged that a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump. In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.  ""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan."" A New York Times article claimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.  Mr Trump responded to criticism by tweeting that it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"". Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She got a standing ovation and as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"". Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.

Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan. Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country. The two leaders discussed security in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia. The US in May suspended $21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trump on the phone in February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"", according to the New York Times. The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list. The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality. President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" in a phone call with its leader in February. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country. One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless. During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president. When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trump tweeted in September 2013. But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action. ""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trump said. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy ships fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela. ""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" he tweeted in mid-February. Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro. In an October tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflected statements made by Mr Trump at a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent a word of warning to President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company, gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee and a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor. But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods. During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US, tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. He tweeted that he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""  Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor told the BBC the idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list. The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry. More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruled President Donald Trump's travel ban on six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has also called on Saudi Arabia to ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of the first military operation authorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emerged that a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump. In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.  ""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan."" A New York Times article claimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.  Mr Trump responded to criticism by tweeting that it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"". Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She got a standing ovation and as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"".

Treasury Yield Sentiment,The rise and fall of 'Islamic State',2024-09-14,2016-03-09,Jim Muir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35695648,"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul.  ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians.  This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil).  Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.  As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west.  Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed.  Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.  In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.  After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds.  That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.  Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley.  In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.  Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.  The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price.  The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name.  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula.  A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah.  But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment.  The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow.  Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder.  Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.  For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.  Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader.  Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.  Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it.  By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today.  Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.  After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase.  But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004.  The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.  Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.  The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008.  Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies.  Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it.  Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.  Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in.  Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran.  The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in.  They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community.  Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.  Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core.  His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists.  Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military.  As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq.  But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion.  Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of.  The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.  By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq.  They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.  All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad.  The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him.  29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?  What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004.  Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.  Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.  The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam.  Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise.  It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis.  Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.  An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.  With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him.  By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global.  Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism.  A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north.  The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924.  So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.  For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad.  Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts.  Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of Bel and Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq.  It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion.  All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.  A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers.  And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documents published by Der Spiegel in 2015, external give some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.  At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later.  ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

They were stopped at an IS checkpoint,  the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.  ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city.

Life under 'Islamic State': Diaries IS departments carried the organisation's grip into every corner of life, including finance, agriculture, education, transport, health, welfare and utilities.  School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu.  ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways.  As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint.  As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders.  ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

She managed to escape the city and became a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.  This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS.  Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.  But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.  Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army.  Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.  The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed.  The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach.  At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.  The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria.  The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that).  A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to the end of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad.  That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.  It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.  Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank.  ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success.  But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.  In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been a new generation of young militants, external drawn from local sources.  This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike.  He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets.  Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.  ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds.  ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan.  There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else.  Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences.  But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply.  In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS.  In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force.  In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies.  The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners.  Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.  In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in.  It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015.  ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south.  ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling.  In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found.  But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations.  Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants.  The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself.  Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces.  Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient.  In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences.  There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets.  The area around the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria.  But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses.  The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces.  In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province.  Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields.  But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three.  The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years.  IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different.   The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon.  That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS.  Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border.  Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march.  As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages.  Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology.  Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017.  By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour.  But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September.  US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments.  But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames.  So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise?  It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014.  With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing a defiant audio statement in September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence.  ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be.  But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.  ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants.  That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure.  In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before.  The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back.  There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003.  ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul.  ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive.  The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability.  The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul.  And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain.  There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011.  And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them.  Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria.  Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015.  A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia.  But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016.  But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over.  The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted.  Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better.   As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria.  ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed).  The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants.  Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services.  Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack.  While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough.  Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered.  The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge.  ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center.  ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser.  ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance.  Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root.  But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa.  Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, where a detailed survey, external in the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless.  IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.  In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:  the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased  the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam.  ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis.""  Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily.""   Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.  Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed.  ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli.  He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013.  ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups.  But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says.  ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path.  More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.  This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.  The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force.  Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"".  Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq.  ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo].""   ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies.  While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS.  They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever.  While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will.  Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity.  But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious.  By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost.  The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias.  For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus.  It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations.  Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours.  ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis.  ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

Treasury Yield Sentiment,Inside Wagner's African 'success story',2024-09-14,2023-12-11,By Yemisi Adegoke,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67625139,"A welcoming atmosphere greets congregants shuffling into the Russian Orthodox Church, tucked away on an unassuming but badly pot-holed side street in the capital of the Central African Republic (CAR). At first glance there is nothing out of the ordinary about this Sunday morning scene in the mainly Christian country. But Saint-André-Apôtre, about a 20-minute drive from the centre of Bangui, has come to symbolise for some the friendly ties between Russia and the CAR. Father Serguei Voyemawa, who runs the country's only Russian Orthodox Church, is dressed in a floor-length white robe covered by an ornate gold cloak. He walks around reciting prayers and swinging an incense burner as the congregation watches his every move.  The walls of the modest building, which has a concrete floor and aluminium roof supported by wooden beams, are adorned with hand-painted images of saints while half a dozen candles burn on the wooden altar.  Fr Voyemawa was initially hesitant about our visit. It came a few months after the death of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in August, which has led to increased scrutiny and concern over the growing influence of Russia in CAR and especially the presence of the mercenary group. Nearly 200 Russian military instructors arrived in the CAR after President Faustin-Archange Touadéra asked for help to tackle rebel groups in 2018. But according to a report by investigative group The Sentry, in that time Wagner has taken advantage of weak institutions and a weak army to perfect ""a blueprint for state capture"". ""We've seen them focus on four pillars: political, economic, information, disinformation and propaganda - and the military,"" Nathalia Dukhan, a senior investigator at The Sentry who has spent many years reporting on the country, tells the BBC. ""They have been infiltrating and compromising these sectors to advance their financial and economic interests. In the mining sector, Wagner has been using the national army to advance and neutralise some of the armed groups that were controlling areas of interest."" Ms Dukhan says the mercenaries are waging a ""campaign of terror"" and are responsible for widespread human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings, torture and rape.  Earlier this year, the UK proscribed the network as a terrorist group, while the US designated it a ""significant transnational criminal organisation"". However, for many Central Africans, after a decade of civil war, the situation is more complex.  Fr Voyemawa is keen to point out that his relationship with Russia predates the arrival of Wagner forces. He started fundraising for the church in 2010 and building commenced in 2015.  His reluctance to discuss politics is clear: ""Our relationship with Moscow is a religious one."" Even so, he tells me how much things have changed since the troops arrived: ""We Central Africans are very happy because the Russians are here today and on the security front, well there is peace. ""There is peace in the Central African Republic. It's been five years now that we live in peace, without war."" This sentiment has now been immortalised in the centre of Bangui, where a statue of Russian troops shielding a woman and her children stands. At their feet fading bouquets from August remain with messages for ""our best friend Yevgeny Prigozhin"".  Pro-Russia sentiment has recently swept across West and Central Africa, where there have been eight military coups since 2020. Countries including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso are rejecting former colonial power France, which they say has failed to adequately assist with security challenges. Many Central Africans echo these feelings.  ""We need a win-win partnership. That's why the Russians are here... so that this country can also benefit from future development,"" says Emery Brice Ganzaléis, a Central African businessman who recently relocated to Bangui after two decades living in France. ""If Russia adopts the same policy as France in Africa, that won't work."" Bambari, the capital of Ouaka region roughly 400km (250 miles) north-east of Bangui, witnessed some of the worst violence during the conflict and illustrates how security has slowly improved.  The only viable way to get to the town is on a UN-operated flight that runs three days a week. Driving is inadvisable and would take days because the roads are either badly dilapidated or non-existent. It is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the country. So too is the massive presence of the UN mission, known by its acronym Minusca, with trademark blue helmets and white vehicles visible all over town.  Since 2014, Minusca has played an important role in protecting civilians and working with the authorities, but they are not authorised to take sides or fight offensively.  Bambari was still under rebel control two years ago, but is now vibrant and bustling - though the charred remains of burnt-out buildings still dot the town. The relative peace has allowed 15-year-old Jovanie Renemeya - and the thousands of children who were recruited into armed groups - to hope for a better future. She was captured as a young girl with her grandmother and taken to work in a rebel camp. ""I was traumatised for a long time,"" Jovanie says softly, explaining how she endured horrific physical abuse and narrowly escaped being forced to marry one of the rebels. After a year she and her grandmother managed to escape when going to fetch water. Back with her parents, Jovanie has now started pig farming to save money and she dreams of becoming a doctor.  For Victor Bissekoin, the governor of Ouaka, this return to normality would not have been possible without the intervention of Wagner troops. ""When we have asked for weapons and support from the international community, they put sanctions on us,"" he tells the BBC. ""In 2021 Russia arrived [here] and within two years helped us to control almost the whole country, apart from some tiny pockets along some borders. ""When your house burns and you shout: 'Fire! Fire!' you don't care if the water you are given is sweet or salty. All you care about is that it extinguishes the flames."" President Touadéra echoes this and defends Wagner's presence in the country. ""It was said that 80% of the territory was occupied by armed groups. Today, thanks to this co-operation, these figures are completely reversed,"" he tells the BBC during an interview, granted after several days of negotiations, at the presidential palace in Bangui. The 66-year-old, who controversially won a referendum earlier in the year to remove presidential term limits, often surrounds himself with Wagner forces, and it is the first time we see the mercenaries up close. Dressed in military fatigues with faces covered by balaclavas, the handful of troops dart in and out of the palace.  During the interview, the president admits there are still challenges ahead: ""We are training our defence forces so that they become professional forces, ready to be deployed to provide security for the population."" When confronted with the allegations that Wagner mercenaries have committed serious human rights abuses, including torture, rape and extrajudicial killings, he says an investigative committee has been set up to verify the claims. Critics are unconvinced.  ""It's very dangerous because  [the Wagner Group] are in the economic field, they are in the security field, they are in the political field, and now they are leading the country,"" former Prime Minister Martin Ziguele tells the BBC. He initially supported the request for Russian help, but was disappointed when they sent mercenaries from Wagner, a ""criminal group"". ""They are totally free to do what they want, to go where they want, and to decide what they want,"" he says. President Touadéra refuses to give a date for the eventual withdrawal of Wagner, emphasising the need for peace first. Ms Dukhan maintains this is part of Wagner's strategy of infiltration, making the country dependent. It had been thought that Wagner's power in Africa would wane after Prigozhin's failed mutiny against Russia's President Vladimir Putin and then his death. But the group has not been disbanded and its fighters are yet to be fully absorbed into the Russian army.  ""They've been reorganising, redeploying their men and their equipment,"" says Ms Dukhan. ""At first, some interpreted that as departure, but it wasn't. It was simply a reorganisation."" And it certainly appears to be business as usual in the CAR. One clear sign of this is a sighting at the presidential palace of two unmasked Russian men, who are hurriedly whisked in to see the president as we wait for our interview. One of them is top Wagner official Dmitry Syty, who was spotted beside Prigozhin in the last video he posted before his death and is rumoured to be the group's new frontman. Another indication are the signs all over Bangui advertising Africa Ti L'Or, a new Russian beer.  At the city's Cave bar, it is apparent the aggressive marketing campaign has already won over some customers.  ""I wish there were more of [it] in the Central African Republic,"" says Max Franklin as he nurses his Africa Ti L'Or, which is regarded as more potent than local beer and better value as it is sold in bigger bottles.

Treasury Yield Sentiment,How the Plague made the rich richer,2024-09-14,2020-07-02,"Eleanor Russell, University of Cambridge and Martin Parker, University of Bristol",https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-how-the-black-death-make-the-rich-richer,"When a third of Europe’s population was lost, wealth concentrated into tiny groups. Could Covid-19 trigger something similar? This article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. In June 1348, people in England began reporting mysterious symptoms. They started off as mild and vague: headaches, aches, and nausea. This was followed by painful black lumps, or buboes, growing in the armpits and groin, which gave the disease its name: bubonic plague. The last stage was a high fever, and then death. Originating in Central Asia, soldiers and caravans had brought bubonic plague – Yersina pestis, a bacterium carried on fleas that lived on rats – to ports on the Black Sea. The highly commercialised world of the Mediterranean ensured the plague’s swift transfer on merchant ships to Italy, and then across Europe. The Black Death killed between a third and a half of the population of Europe and the Near East. This huge number of deaths was accompanied by general economic devastation. With a third of the workforce dead, the crops could not be harvested and communities fell apart. One in ten villages in England (and in Tuscany and other regions) were lost and never re-founded. Houses fell into the ground and were covered by grass and earth, leaving only the church behind. If you ever see a church or chapel all alone in a field, you are probably looking at the last remains of one of Europe’s lost villages. The traumatic experience of the Black Death, which killed perhaps 80% of those who caught it, drove many people to write in an attempt to make sense of what they had lived through. In Aberdeen, John of Fordun, a Scottish chronicler, recorded that: This sickness befell people everywhere, but especially the middling and lower classes, rarely the great. It generated such horror that children did not dare to visit their dying parents, nor parents their children, but fled for fear of contagion as if from leprosy or a serpent. These lines could almost have been written today. Although the death rate from Covid-19 is far lower than that of the Black Death, the economic fallout has been severe due to the globalised, highly-integrated nature of modern economies. Add to this our highly mobile populations today and coronavirus, unlike the plague, has spread across the globe in a matter of months, not years. While the Black Death resulted in short term economic damage, the longer-term consequences were less obvious. Before the plague erupted, several centuries of population growth had produced a labour surplus, which was abruptly replaced with a labour shortage when many serfs and free peasants died. Historians have argued that this labour shortage allowed those peasants that survived the pandemic to demand better pay or to seek employment elsewhere. Despite government resistance, serfdom and the feudal system itself were ultimately eroded. But another less often remarked consequence of the Black Death was the rise of wealthy entrepreneurs and business-government links. Although the Black Death caused short-term losses for Europe’s largest companies, in the long term, they concentrated their assets and gained a greater share of the market and influence with governments. This has strong parallels with the current situation in many countries across the world. While small companies rely upon government support to prevent them collapsing, many others – mainly the much larger ones involved in home delivery – are profiting handsomely from the new trading conditions. The mid-14th Century economy is too removed from the size, speed, and interconnectedness of the modern market to give exact comparisons. But we can certainly see parallels with the way that the Black Death strengthened the power of the state and accelerated the domination of key markets by a handful of large companies. Black Death business The sudden loss of at least a third of Europe’s population led to a redistribution of wealth for everyone else. In the longer term, however, people responded to the devastation by keeping money within the family. Wills became highly specific and wealthy businessmen, in particular, went to great lengths to ensure that their patrimony was no longer divided up after death, replacing the previous tendency to leave a third of all their resources to charity. Their descendants benefited from a continued concentration of capital into a smaller and smaller number of hands. At the same time, the decline of feudalism and the rise of a wage-based economy following peasant demands for better labour conditions benefited urban elites. Being paid in cash, rather than in kind (in the granting of privileges such as the right to collect firewood), meant that peasants had more money to spend in towns. This concentration of wealth greatly accelerated a pre-existing trend: the emergence of merchant entrepreneurs who combined trade in goods with their production on a scale only available to those with significant sums of capital. For example, silk, once imported from Asia and Byzantium, was now being produced in Europe. Wealthy Italian merchants began to open silk and cloth workshops. These entrepreneurs were uniquely positioned to respond to the sudden labour shortage caused by the Black Death. Unlike independent weavers, who lacked the capital, and unlike aristocrats, whose wealth was locked up in land, urban entrepreneurs were able to use their liquid capital to invest in new technologies, compensating for the loss of workers with machines. In southern Germany, which became one of Europe’s most commercialised areas in the late 14th and 15th centuries, companies such as the Welser (which later ran Venezuela as a private colony) combined growing flax with owning the looms on which workers span that flax into linen cloth, which the Welser then sold. The broad trend of the post-Black Death 14th and 15th centuries was a concentration of resources – capital, skills, and infrastructure – into the hands of a small number of large companies. The age of Amazon Rolling forward to the present, there are some clear similarities. Certain large organisations have stepped up to the opportunities provided by Covid-19. In many countries across the world, entire ecologies of small restaurants, pubs and shops have suddenly been closed down. The market for food, general retail and entertainment has gone online, and cash has pretty much disappeared. The percentage of calories that restaurants provided has had to be rerouted through supermarkets, and much of this supply has now been taken up by supermarket chains. They have plenty of large properties and lots of staff, with the HR capacity to recruit more rapidly, and there are many underemployed people who now want jobs. They also have warehouses, trucks and complex logistics capacity. The other big winner has been the giants of online retail – such as Amazon, who run a “Prime Pantry” service in the US, India and many European countries. High street shops have been suffering from price and convenience competition from the internet for years, and bankruptcies are regular news. Now, much “non-essential” retail space is closed, and our desires have been re-rerouted through Amazon, eBay, Argos, Screwfix and others. There has been a clear spike in online shopping, and retail analysts are wondering whether this is a decisive move into the virtual world, and the further dominance of big companies. Keeping us distracted as we wait at home for our parcels is the streaming entertainment industry – a market sector which is dominated by large companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime (again), Disney and others. Other online giants such as Google (which owns YouTube), Facebook (which owns Instagram) and Twitter provide the other platforms that dominate online traffic. The final link in the chain is the delivery companies themselves: UPS, FedEx, Amazon Logistics (again), as well as food delivery from Just Eat and Deliveroo. Through their business models are different, their platforms now dominate the movements of products of all kinds, whether your new Toshiba branded Amazon Fire TV, or your stuffed crust from Pizza Hut (a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, which also owns KFC, Taco Bell and others). The other swing to corporate dominance has been the move away from state-backed cash towards contactless payment services. It’s obviously a corollary of online marketplaces, but also means that the money moves though large companies that take their slice for moving it. Visa and Mastercard are the largest players, but Apple Pay, PayPal, and Amazon Pay (again) have all seen increases in their transaction volume as cash sits unused in people’s purses. And if cash is still imagined to be a vector for transmission, then retailers won’t take it and customers won’t use it. Small business has taken a really decisive hit across a wide range of sectors as Covid-19, like the Black Death, results in big companies gaining market share. Even those working at home to write pieces like this are working on Skype (owned by Microsoft), Zoom and BlueJeans, as well using email clients and laptops made by a small number of global organisations. Billionaires are getting richer while ordinary people lose their jobs. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, has increased his wealth by US$25 billion since the start of the year. But this is not the whole story. The other big trend in the response to the virus has been the strengthening of the power of the state. Governing pandemics At a state level, the Black Death caused the acceleration of trends towards centralisation, the growth of taxation, and government dependence upon large companies. In England, the declining value of land and consequent falls in revenue prompted the crown – the country’s biggest landowner – to attempt to cap wages at pre-plague levels with the 1351 Statute of Labourers, and to impose additional taxes upon the populace. Previously, the government was expected to fund itself, only imposing taxes for extraordinary expenses such as wars. But the post-plague taxes set a major precedent for government intervention in the economy. These governmental efforts were a significant increase in the crown’s involvement in people’s daily lives. In subsequent plague outbreaks, which occurred every 20 years or so, movement began to be restricted through curfews, travel bans, and quarantines. This was part of a general concentration of state power and the replacement of the previous regional distribution of authority with a centralised bureaucracy. Many of the men running the post-plague administration, such as the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, were drawn from English merchant families, some of which gained significant political power. The most outstanding example of this was the de la Pole family, who in two generations went from being Hull wool merchants to earls of Suffolk. With the temporary collapse of international trade and finance after the Black Death, Richard de la Pole became the crown’s greatest lender and an intimate of Richard II. When Italian mega-companies re-emerged in the late 14th and 15th Centuries, they also benefited from the crown’s ever-growing reliance upon merchant companies. The Medici family, who eventually came to rule Florence, are the most striking example. Merchants also gained political influence by purchasing land, the price of which had fallen after the Black Death. Land ownership allowed merchants to enter the land-based gentry or even the aristocracy, marrying their children to the sons and daughters of cash-strapped lords. With their new status, and with the help of influential in-laws, the urban elites gained political representation within parliament. By the end of the 14th Century, the government’s extension of state control and its continued ties to merchant companies drove many nobles to turn against Richard II. They transferred their allegiance to his cousin, who became Henry IV, in the (vain) hope that he would not follow Richard’s policies. This, and the subsequent Wars of the Roses, generally depicted as a clash between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians, were actually partly driven by the nobility’s hostility towards the centralisation of government power. Henry Tudor’s defeat of Richard III in 1485 ended not only the war but also quashed any further attempts by the English baronage to regain regional authority, paving the way for the continued rise of companies and central government. The state we are in The power of the state is something that we largely assume in the 21st Century. Across the world, the idea of the sovereign nation has been central to the imperial politics and economy of the last few centuries. But from the 1970s onwards, it became common among intellectuals to suggest that the state was less important, its monopoly of control within a given territory contested by multinational corporations. In 2016, of the largest 100 economic entities, 31 were countries and 69 were companies. Walmart was larger than the economy of Spain, Toyota larger than India. The capacity of these large companies to influence politicians and regulators has been clear enough: consider the effects of oil companies on climate change denial. And since Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of the UK from 1979 to 1990, pronounced that she intended to “roll back the state”, more and more parts of previously state-owned assets now operate as companies, or as players in state engineered quasi-markets. Roughly 25% of the UK’s National Health Service, for example, is delivered through contracts with the private sector. Across the globe, transport, utilities, telecommunications, dentists, opticians, the post office and many other services used to be state monopolies and are now run by profit-making companies. Nationalised, or state owned, industries are often described as slow, and in need of market discipline in order to become more modern and efficient. But thanks to coronavirus, the state has come rolling back in again like a tsunami. Spending on a level which was mocked as “magic money tree” economics only a few months ago has been aimed at national health systems, addressed the problem of homelessness, provided universal basic income for millions of people, and offered loan guarantees or direct payments to a host of businesses. This is Keynesian economics on a grand scale, in which national bonds are used to borrow money backed by future income from taxpayers. Ideas about balancing the budget appear to, for now, be history, with entire industries now being reliant on treasury bailouts. Politicians the world over have suddenly become interventionist, with wartime metaphors being used to justify gigantic spending. Less often remarked is the astonishing restriction on personal freedoms. The autonomy of the individual is central to neoliberal ideas. “Freedom loving peoples” are contrasted with those who live their lives under the yoke of tyranny, of states that exercise Big Brother surveillance powers over their citizens behaviour. Yet in the last few months, states around the world have effectively restricted movement for the vast majority of people and are using the police and armed forces to prevent assembly in public and private spaces. Theatres, pubs and restaurants are closed by fiat, parks have been locked, and sitting on benches can get you a fine. Running too close to someone will get you shouted at by someone in a high vis vest. A medieval king would have been impressed with this level of authoritarianism. The pandemic seems to have allowed the fiscal and administrative powers of big government to bulldozer arguments about prudence and liberty. The state’s power is now being exercised in ways that haven’t been seen since the second world war, and there has been widespread public support. Popular resistance To return to the Black Death, the growth in wealth and influence of merchants and big business seriously aggravated existing anti-mercantile sentiment. Medieval thought – both intellectual and popular – held that trade was morally suspect and that merchants, especially wealthy ones, were prone to avarice. The Black Death was widely interpreted as a punishment from God for Europe’s sinfulness, and many post-plague writers blamed the church, governments, and wealthy companies for Christendom’s moral decline. William Langland’s famous protest poem Piers Plowman was strongly anti-mercantilist. Other works, such as the mid-15th Century poem the Libelle of Englysche Polycye, tolerated trade but wanted it in the hands of English merchants and out of the control of Italians, whom the author argued impoverished the country. As the 14th and 15th Centuries progressed and large companies gained a greater share of the market, popular and intellectual hostility grew. In the longer term, this was to have incendiary results. By the 16th Century, the concentration of trade and finance into the hands of large companies had evolved into a near-monopoly upon royal and papal banking by a small number of companies who also held monopolies or near-monopolies over Europe’s major commodities – such as silver, copper, and mercury – and imports from Asia and the Americas, especially spices. Martin Luther was incensed by this concentration and especially the Catholic Church’s use of monopolistic firms to collect indulgences. In 1524, Luther published a tract arguing that trade should be for the common (German) good and that merchants should not charge high prices. Along with other Protestant writers, such as Philip Melancthon and Ulrich von Hutten, Luther drew upon existing anti-mercantile sentiment to criticise the influence of business over government, adding financial injustice to their call for religious reform. The sociologist Max Weber famously associated Protestantism with the emergence of capitalism and modern economic thought. But early Protestant writers opposed monopolistic companies and the commercialisation of everyday life, drawing upon anti-mercantile sentiment that had its roots in the Black Death. This popular and religious opposition eventually led to the break from Rome and the transformation of Europe. Is small always beautiful? By the 21st Century we have become used to the idea that capitalist firms produce concentrations of wealth. Whether Victorian industrialists, US robber barons or dot com billionaires, the inequalities generated by business and its corrupting influence over governments have shaped discussion of commerce since the industrial revolution. For critics, big business has often been characterised as heartless, a behemoth that crushes ordinary people in the wheels of its machines, or vampirically extracts the profits of labour from the labouring classes. As we have seen, the arguments between small business localists and those who favour corporations and the power of the state date back many centuries. Romantic poets and radicals bemoaned the way that the “dark satanic mills” were destroying the countryside and producing people who were no more than appendages to machines. The idea that the honest craftsman was being replaced by the alienated employee, a wage slave, is common to both nostalgic and progressive critics of early capitalism. By the 1960s, the idea that there was some fundamental difference between small and large forms of business added environmentalism to these longstanding arguments. “The man” in his skyscraper was opposed to the more authentic artisan. This faith in local business combined with a suspicion of corporations and the state have flowed into the green, Occupy and Extinction Rebellion movements. Eating local food, using local money, and trying to tilt the purchasing power of “anchor institutions” like hospitals and universities towards small social enterprises has become the common sense of many contemporary economic activists. But the Covid-19 crisis questions this small is good, big is bad dichotomy in some very fundamental ways. Large scale organising has appeared to be necessary to deal with the huge range of issues that the virus has thrown up, and the states that appear to have been most successful are those which have adopted the most interventionist forms of surveillance and control. Even the most ardent post-capitalist would have to admit that small social enterprises could not fit out a gigantic hospital in a few weeks. And though there are plenty of examples of local businesses engaging in food delivery, and a commendable amount of mutual aid taking place, the population of the global north is largely being fed by large supermarket chains with complex logistics operations. After coronavirus The long-term result of the Black Death was the strengthening of the power of big business and the state. The same processes are happening much more rapidly during the coronavirus lockdown. But we should be cautious of easy historical lessons. History never really repeats itself. The circumstances of each time are unique, and it simply isn’t wise to treat the “lesson” of history as if it were a series of experiments that prove certain general laws. And Covid-19 will not kill a third of any population, so though its effects are profound, they will not result in the same shortage of working people. If anything, it has actually strengthened the power of employers. The most profound difference is that the virus comes in the middle of another crisis, that of climate change. There is a real danger that the policy of bouncing back to a growth economy will simply overwhelm the necessity of reducing carbon emissions. This is the nightmare scenario, one in which Covid-19 is just a prequel to something much worse. But the huge mobilisations of people and money which governments and large companies have deployed also shows that big organisations can reshape themselves and the world extraordinarily rapidly if they wish. This gives real grounds for optimism concerning our collective capacity to re-engineer energy production, transport, food systems and much else – the green new deal which many policy makers have been sponsoring. The Black Death and Covid-19 seem to have both caused concentration and centralisation of business and state power. That is interesting to note. But the biggest question is whether these potent forces can be aimed at the crisis to come.
