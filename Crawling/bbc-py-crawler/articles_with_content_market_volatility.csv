market volatility,£71m school campus project to face 'major delays',2024-09-15,2024-08-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdlkvzg2yo,"A new school campus in Peterhead is facing major delays after the preferred contractor pulled out.  Aberdeenshire Council said it is still committed to the £71m project but does not expect it to be finished until at least early 2028.  The authority had been hoping to open the campus, which will replace the town's academy, two primaries and a special education school, in 2026. Robertson Construction said it is withdrawing following a lengthy review of the expected outcomes of the project. The council added the new school was already experiencing delays due to issues in the supply chain and market volatility.  It will now work with the construction sector on the best way to proceed, likely costs and timescales. Peterhead Academy Parents Council said parents are ""losing confidence"" that their children will ever get the chance to learn in modern facilities. David Wilson, chairman of the group said: ""Parents, pupils and staff are having to make do with an ageing building. The children of Peterhead deserve access to safe and suitable facilities.  ""Unfortunately the plans the council have are not turning into action. Sadly it is something that remains in the far future rather than something we will see soon."""
market volatility,'Starmer faces winter fuel anger' as 'scores of MPs could rebel',2024-09-15,2024-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7l3r3lz1go," The row about the government's decision to scrap the winter fuel allowance dominates the front pages.  Looking ahead to Tuesday's Commons vote, the Guardian says ""up to 50"" Labour MPs could refuse to back the plans.  Sources tell the paper that ""dozens"" could abstain or be absent, but few on the government benches are expected to actually vote against the policy.  ""Abstention is the new rebellion"" says one anonymous Labour MP. Describing the vote as ""a key test"" of Sir Keir Starmer's authority, the Times says a ""bullish"" prime minister is ""shrugging off"" any criticism.  Government sources tell the paper they are not concerned about the size of any potential rebellion.  But it also reports that the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall spent the weekend on the phone, ringing round ""wavering backbenchers."" The Daily Mail asks why Labour is pushing ahead with the policy when it claimed that the party's own research back in 2017 warned that cutting the payments could lead to the deaths of thousands of pensioners.  The paper says the ""shocking analysis"" was written after Theresa May's Conservative government announced similar plans to scrap the allowance and describes the proposal, which was later dropped by the Tories, as the ""single biggest attack on pensioners in a generation"".  The Mail points out that Sir Keir was in the shadow cabinet when the research was first published. ""Don't be a fuel, Keir"" says the Daily Mirror's editorial. The paper describes the policy as a ""political mistake"" which ""surely merits a rethink.""  It's urged the government to come up with an ""escape route"" before tomorrow's vote. The i newspaper says the government could respond to the criticism by announcing plans in next month's Budget for a social tariff for energy bills - similar to those for mobile phones.  The paper says government officials are weighing up the idea, which would give households on lower incomes cheaper gas and electricity. The Daily Telegraph leads on the findings of a major report on the state of the NHS, due to be published later this week, which will warn that the health service is ""going backwards"" for the first time in 50 years.  The government-commissioned report, by the surgeon and former health minister, Lord Darzi, will say that progress made since the 1970s on deaths from heart disease is now ""in reverse"". The Times reports that the law enforcement agency at the forefront of the government's plans to tackle trafficking gangs is ""in crisis"" and is losing more officers than it recruits.  The paper says a new report on the performance of the National Crime Agency (NCA) concludes that it is ""on its knees"" due to a lack of funding. The Home Office says it is committed to investing in the NCA. And according to the Telegraph, ""lazy joggers"" are paying ""mules"" to run for them so they do not lose ""kudos"" on the popular fitness app Strava.  Used by runners, cyclists and swimmers, the app tracks routes and times, allowing amateur athletes to share their progress on social media.  But the paper says it has uncovered a new trend where users offer to take on someone else's exercise so they can still boast about how fit they are, even when they are too busy or lazy to do it themselves. Strava says any accounts found violating the apps terms of service will be suspended. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."
market volatility,Energy prices forecast to rise by 9% in October,2024-09-15,2024-08-19,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy54r9r1355o,"Domestic energy prices are expected to rise in the run-up to winter, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight. The forecaster, which is widely regarded for its accurate predictions, said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay £1,714 a year from October. That would be a £146 a year rise compared with a current typical annual bill - the lowest for two years - of £1,568. Energy regulator Ofgem will announce the next official quarterly price cap on Friday, with charities concerned about the prospect of prices rising again. Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less. That is because the cap limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity, rather than the total bill.  It affects 28 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. The sector is regulated separately in Northern Ireland.  Cornwall Insight said prices paid by households, although protected to some degree by the price cap, were affected by volatility in the fragile global energy market. Wholesale costs, paid by suppliers, had risen by about 20% in the last few months, it said. These are reflected in consumer bills, accounting for about half of what customers pay.  With prices set to rise, some billpayers might look at the options available to fix their energy tariff. Cornwall Insight said that the average saving from the top 10 cheapest tariffs on the market in August was only £5 a year, compared with a default tariff set by the price cap.  That may change in the coming weeks, and Richard Neudegg, from price comparison website Uswitch, said there were options for those who wanted certainty. ""Just because it is a fix, it doesn't mean it is a good price fix,"" he said. ""The question for consumers is, if they want that level of certainty, how cheaply can they get it.""  Cornwall Insight also said it expected costs to rise again during the winter, when the January price cap is announced.   It said a ""modest"" rise was anticipated. However, recent tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war could see prices rise further, it added. ""While we don't expect a return to the extreme prices of recent years, it's unlikely that bills will return to what was once considered normal. Without significant intervention, this may well be the new normal,"" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at the forecaster. Charity National Energy Action said any increases in prices, alongside less support from the government, could stretch some households' finances ""beyond breaking point"". Standing charges, a fixed daily fee covering the costs of connecting to a supply, currently stand at at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region. Ofgem is currently considering whether to change the standing charge billing system. Energy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises, but are much higher than before the pandemic. Experts have shared three tips to keep on top of energy use during the warmer months: Read more here if you are struggling to pay energy bills"
market volatility,Global stocks climb as US recession fears ease,2024-09-15,2024-08-09,Michael Race & João da Silva,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dpm9n2g6go,"The stock index of the UK's biggest publicly-listed companies edged higher on Friday after concerns eased over the state of the US economy.  The FTSE 100, which is made up of the country's biggest businesses including banks, airlines and housebuilders, rose in early trading. It follows stronger trading in the US where stock markets had their best day in almost two years on Thursday. Global financial markets have been spooked in the past seven days over fears that world's biggest economy could be heading for a slowdown. But on Thursday, official data revealed US unemployment claims rose by less than expected. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 2.3% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8%, and the Nasdaq jumped 2.9%. In London, the FTSE 100 ticked up 0.7%. Stock markets indexes in Paris and Frankfurt followed a similar path. Stocks in Asia made modest gains, recovering some of the losses after Japanese indexes had their worst day since 1987 earlier in the week. ""The [US] latest jobless claims data, though not normally a major market event, supports the view that recent pessimism may have been overdone,"" said UBS Global Wealth Management. Official figures from the US Labor Department showed first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the US had fallen more than expected to 233,000 last week. But despite the apparent recovery in global markets, analysts warn that trading will likely remain choppy for the time being. ""The market volatility is creating trading opportunities for investors over the short term,"" said Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com. ""It will be a bumpy ride over the election season and we all await the [US Federal Reserve] policy decision in September."" The Federal Reserve held off cutting interest rates last week - something that typically boosts growth - in contrast to other central banks such as the Bank of England. But, this week's market upheaval stoked further speculation about when - and by how much - the Fed will cut borrowing costs. ""[The] Fed is now likely to cut rates up to 50bps in September which in turn supports expanding valuation for the market,"" said Jun Bei Liu, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners."
market volatility,US stock markets rise after days of turmoil,2024-09-15,2024-08-06,Dearbail Jordan and João da Silva,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d77xe2p26o,"US shares opened higher on Tuesday as an uneasy calm returned to global markets after days of sharp falls.  The technology-heavy Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 all closed higher.  It followed subdued trading in the UK and Europe with London's FTSE 100 initially rising before falling back.  In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock index jumped by 10.2%, or 3,217 points in its biggest one-day gain in points, after the previous day's plummet. The stock market rout began on Friday following disappointing US employment figures for July which showed that the jobless rate rose, sparking fears of a recession.   There has also been concern that shares in big technology companies - particularly those investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) - have been overvalued and some of those firms now face difficulties.  The volatility intensified on Monday, spreading to Europe and Asia where Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped by 12%.  But by the end of Tuesday the global picture looked more positive:  ""Markets were hit by a perfect storm over the weekend, with numerous factors combining to spook investors,"" said Rachel Winter, partner at investors Killik & Co.  She added that nerves about the US election had also contributed to the volatility, as ""markets detest uncertainty"". Economists are divided over the outlook for the US economy, with a number cautioning that it is premature to suggest the world's largest economy is heading for a downturn. If it does, however, it would have wider implications.  ""What happens in the US economically and financially does not stay in the US,"" said economist Mohamed El-Erian, who is also president of Queens' College, Cambridge.  ""The US has been the major driver of global economic growth, the US consumer is a very important engine of economic activity so the world as a whole would suffer if the US were to go into recession."" Fears of recession have renewed calls for the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September in a bid to boost growth. Last week, the Fed voted to hold rates in the range of 5.25%-5.5% - the highest for two decades - while other central banks decided to cut them.  Some experts say that was a mistake and that stock markets are likely to remain unsettled as a result. “Markets are very volatile at the moment and will likely stay volatile until the Fed decision in September, so we wouldn't rule out rapid swings in both directions,” said Stefan Angrick, a senior economist with Moody's Analytics. The sharp fall in Japanese stocks on Monday was driven in part by issues facing the country's economy.  Japan's currency, the yen, has been strengthening against the US dollar since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week. It has made stocks in Tokyo - and Japanese goods in general - more expensive for foreign investors and buyers. At the same time inflation in Japan rose by more than expected in June while the economy shrank in the first three months of the year. Commenting on the country's outlook, Jesper Koll, executive director of Monex Group Japan, said he still had confidence in the country. ""Japan’s fundamentals are strong, recession risks are nil and corporate leaders are dead-set on raising capital returns,"" he told the BBC."
market volatility,How Gen Z became so nihilistic about money,2024-09-15,2024-07-31,Lillian Stone,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240731-how-gen-z-became-so-nihilistic-about-money,"The ""buy everything, own nothing"" generation has seen the cost of living soar. They're ""vibing"" their way into adulthood, and some experts say they've got it right. My younger sister, Sophie, isn't worried about retirement – but she's not exactly optimistic about it, either. ""We've got climate change, war – it's like, are we even going to be here to retire?"" she muses on a recent phone call, adding: ""I don't necessarily feel worried. It's more like helplessness."" At 23, Sophie falls firmly into Gen Z, the cohort born between 1997 and 2012. She suspects that her generation may never own homes, accumulate comfortable retirement savings or achieve other traditional financial milestones. She's not alone: Gen Z content creators are loudly airing their nihilism on TikTok and expressing frustration at what they call unattainable financial goals. But experts say the disgruntled TikToks don't tell the whole story. Ajla Brama, a 26-year-old content creator and social media consultant born in Albania, uses TikTok to unpack the financial pitfalls and ""scams"" facing Gen Z in the US, including falling wages and a challenging real estate market in which rent increases outpace earnings. ""We want to be able to afford a decent living, but we can't even move out of our parents' house,"" laments Brama in one video sparked by what she calls a ""lack of accountability"" on the part of employers. ""I get so tired of seeing content saying, 'Oh, if you just saved a little more, if you just invested a little more…' Like, no – people are on the edge. People cannot afford to live, to eat, to put gas in their cars,"" Brama says. That's partly why Brama now splits her time between the United States and Europe, where she feels the quality of life is better for young people with financial limitations. ""People in the US see countries [like Albania] where the salaries might be lower and think 'Oh, I'd never live there',"" she says. ""It's true that, in Albania, you might make a lot less, but you also probably won't have credit card debt or student debt, and you'll have healthcare. People [in Europe] are actually living life."" (The Global Liveability Index would agree.) Around the globe, the eldest Gen Z-ers are heading into their late-20s amid undeniable economic headwinds. Per the July 2024 World Economic Outlook update published by the International Monetary Fund, ""momentum on global disinflation is slowing"", marked by ongoing higher-than-average inflation in services prices, cross-border trade restrictions and central banks' reluctance to initiate rate cuts. With that in mind, financial negativity isn't just a Gen Z problem. Financial wellness company Brightplan's 2024 Wellness Barometer Survey of 1,400 US-based knowledge workers at global companies found that a majority, regardless of age, report feeling stressed about their financial situation, citing high inflation, rising interest rates and market volatility as complicating factors. Andrew Roth, 25, argues that Gen Z-ers aren't all doom and gloom around finance – they just approach traditional milestones a bit more sceptically. ""[For Gen Z], trust in institutions is at an all-time low,"" says Roth, the founder and CEO of dcdx, a Gen Z research and strategy firm. In the US, he says, young people feel ""their government hasn't earned their trust. Older generations haven't earned their trust, whether that's in regard to climate, gun reform, police reform – young people feel that they are not being listened to."" A 2023 survey from Gallup and the Walton Family Foundation backs that up, finding fewer than one in five people aged 18 to 26 reported having ""a great deal"" of trust in major US institutions, including the criminal justice system, the Supreme Court, the presidency, big tech companies and the news.  They may be skeptical of higher education, too. In the UK where one year of university costs £9,250 ($11,881), recent data has found the gap in earning potential between graduates and non-graduates shrinking, stress-testing the question of whether a degree is ""worth it"". In the US, tuition averages $19,068 (£14,844) per year – a cost that has more than doubled in the 21st Century – and recent PEW data found only 22% of U.S. adults report seeing the cost of college as worth it even when students need to take out loans. Only one-in-four said it’s extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree in order to get a well-paying job in today's economy. These feelings are born out in Gen Z enrollment rates. The percentage of US high school graduates enrolling in college has fallen from 70% in 2009, firmly in Millennial territory, to 62% in 2022, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics data cited by a BestColleges review of research.  Roth says the social media-driven ""gamification"" of personal finance – the rise of absurd meme stocks, for example – feeds into an apparent nihilistic approach to money. Take the ""girl math"" phenomenon of 2023 or Gen Z's unfortunate label as the ""buy everything, own nothing"" generation; in all cases, the message seems to be: money isn't real. ""With all the gamification, the true importance of personal finance gets lost,"" says Roth, hinting that the dissociative discourse around savings and success is a bit of a front. ""What some perceive as laziness or nihilism might actually be more of a paralysis because there are so many options,"" he says. The younger generation still wants to flourish, says Mark Beal, an assistant professor at the Rutgers University School of Communication and Information and the author of ZEO: Introducing Gen Z – The New Generation Of Leaders. ""Gen Z does have financial goals,"" notes Beal. ""They are earning money. They are saving money. They are investing money. Some have already purchased homes. They're just approaching [goals] differently. It's not quite as structured and rigid as previous generations – those of us who thought, 'By the time I'm 30, I need a house with a white picket fence'."" Just more than a quarter (26.3%) of adult members of Gen Z owned a home in 2023, according to a report from US real estate company Redfin. Meanwhile, a 2024 report from Britain's National Centre for Social Research found that 81% of Gen Z would buy a home if they could. Meanwhile, in a recent Consumer Pulse Survey of 3,000 adults representing the general population of the United States, TransUnion found that Gen Z ""appeared to be the most stable of any generation"" in the second quarter of 2024, with 65% of Gen Z respondents stating they feel optimistic about their ability to manage household expenses over the next year – compared to less than 50% of baby boomers and Gen X-ers. More like this: • What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024 • Are Gen Z the most stressed generation in the workplace? • Not all employers are tolerating Gen Z's laid-back language Still, 57-year-old Beal notes that where his generation might have followed their parents' financial blueprint, the constant barrage of social media content shows Gen Z that there are other things to live for – other goals that might take priority over homeownership or beefing up one's retirement accounts. ""I'm a Gen X-er,"" says Beal. ""We lived to work. Generation Z works to live. They work to enjoy life, to experience life, to travel. They have a completely different mindset – which, as a Gen X-er, I think is the correct mindset. I think they are living a more well-balanced life."" The way Sophie puts it? Gen Z is ""vibing"". ""I'm just living life, but that's how everyone is,"" she tells me over the phone, noting that most of her friends are enjoying their early 20s without too much regard for the future. Honestly, it sounds familiar – when I was her age, I was scraping by in a cockroach-infested apartment. She adds: ""If financial stuff is brought up, we're all just like, 'Oh, yeah, maybe one day'."" --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. "
market volatility,Expansion plans at school for autistic girls cancelled,2024-09-15,2024-07-11,Chris Caulfield,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7g33glwxyo,"The planned expansion of a Surrey school for autistic girls has been cancelled due to council budget shortfalls. Limpsfield Grange School, near Oxted, had consulted on plans for a £15.3m expansion to help cover a shortfall of specialist places in the county, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The school expects demand for specialist places for autistic girls across both secondary and post-16 ages to rise by 67% by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. Clare Curran, cabinet member for children at Surrey County Council, said construction industry market volatility was impacting on development plans. She said the authority was determined to create additional specialist provision to ""ensure the best possible outcomes for Surrey’s children"". Sarah Wild, the school's headteacher, said: “Sadly we have to announce that the proposed expansion of Limpsfield Grange School, to include a sixth form and places for additional students, has been cancelled by Surrey County Council due to shortfalls in their budget. “Naturally everyone at Limpsfield Grange is extremely disappointed."" She thanked everyone who had supported the expansion plans during the consultation process for their ""time, energy and commitment"". Limpsfield Grange School is a school for autistic girls and provides specialist education for girls aged 11 to 16 years with a permanent capacity of 94 places. Construction to provide an additional 60 places, plus a further 40 sixth form spaces, was set to begin in 2025. The project, part of Surrey County Council’s SEND capital programme, had been approved by the county’s cabinet in January 2022. Ms Curran said high levels of inflation, continued unstable market conditions, increasing need and fixed Government funding had affected costs. She added that it was now costing more to deliver the remaining approved plans within the £189m budget. She pointed to the council's £260m total investment to create new school places and expansion of state-maintained specialist education in Surrey. “We know how important it is to place a child in a setting that is appropriate for their educational needs, safety and wellbeing, and we are determined to create additional specialist provision to ensure the best possible outcomes for Surrey’s children,"" she added.

market volatility,Farmers 'cautiously hopeful' for new government,2024-09-15,2024-07-11,Emily Johnson,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck5g45zl510o,"Farmers visiting the Great Yorkshire Show said they felt optimistic about the new government after enduring challenging times. Facing ""through the roof"" inflation, poor weather and changes in government policy, farmers said they ""desperately needed confidence"" in leadership. Newly appointed Environment Secretary Steve Reed said farming was an ""absolute priority"" for the government. He added that ""food security is national security"", which was a sentiment echoed by farmers. The event in Harrogate, which runs from Tuesday to Friday, has brought together people from across the agriculture industry. Members of the National Farmers' Union spoke to the BBC about what sort of changes they wanted to see in farming moving forward. Andrew Loftus, a beef farmer from Masham in North Yorkshire, said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about the new Labour government. ""If they can support small farming businesses, have fairness in the supply chain, have a good balance between production and the environment, then yes, let's be optimistic,"" he said. Mr Loftus said although he did not expect policy details immediately, he would gain confidence from knowing the government's direction of travel. He added that the farming industry was doing ""great things"" in the environment and ""too little"" of it counted towards its carbon footprint. ""Beef, for example, is criticised for having a high carbon footprint,"" Mr Loftus said. ""But when you look at the sequestration occurring on our farms, that needs to be netted off and understood because it's a complicated picture and we're only getting one side of it at the moment."" A West Yorkshire beef and sheep uplands farmer said she saw the change in leadership as a ""blank sheet of paper"". Rachel Hallos, from Ripponden, told the BBC: ""I think farmers are being dragged in all different directions for quite a length of time now, for all different sorts of reasons. ""I actually think I'm quite excited about what the future could hold, if I'm very honest."" Ms Hallos said government policy and weather had resulted in a ""rough ride"" for farmers. ""I think for any business to invest in themselves and grow, which is what we need to do as an industry, we need that confidence,"" she said. Ms Hallos hoped that ""some stability"" would encourage farmers to deliver more. Angela Kirkwood had a farm near Hull, where she worked as a pig and arable farmer, as well as running a small farm shop. She told the BBC a lot of new MPs would be from urban areas but hoped they would embrace the opportunity to engage with the countryside and use it to grow the economy.  ""We’ve had so many people that can’t get any crops planted and it’s been tough,"" Ms Kirkwood said. ""Farm inflation is still through the roof. You have machinery costs, labour costs, there’s so many variables and so much volatility."" She added the farm industry wanted to achieve the ambition that ""food security is national security"". New Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Steve Reed attended the Great Yorkshire Show just a few days into his role. He told the BBC his government was going to offer farmers a ""new deal"", after they expressed feeling abandoned. ""We’re looking at how we can cut the single biggest cost that has gone up, helping to put so many farmers sadly out of business, which is energy,"" Mr Reed said. He outlined plans to set up GB Energy to cut bills for farmers and to renegotiate a deal with the EU, to ""get British exports moving across the border again"". Mr Reed also explained Labour's pledge to have 50% of government-procured food to be produced in Britain. “The government itself buys an awful lot of food and it doesn’t buy enough of it British,"" he said. The plans include the food purchased to be served in hospitals and on Army bases. ""That’s money directly into the pockets of farmers, so they can invest more and market their Great British produce,"" Mr Reed added.

market volatility,"As Keir Starmer heads to the US, Labour readies for a possible Trump presidency",2024-09-15,2024-07-09,James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05yyn941qo,"When it comes to Britain’s relationship with the United States, the new government has a simple watchword: continuity. One of Sir Keir Starmer’s first calls in office was to President Joe Biden. Unusually, Downing Street even published footage and audio of the prime minister making the call. To the relief of officials, Mr Biden uttered the words “special relationship”. With those words ringing, Mr Starmer heads to Washington DC this week for the Nato summit where he and his wife will attend a dinner at the White House. To the even greater relief of officials, the President will hold a private meeting with the prime minister, not something all Nato leaders will get. The PM is going mob-handed with his defence and foreign secretaries, John Healey and David Lammy. The message could not be clearer: the transatlantic relationship remains the bedrock of UK foreign policy. Much will be made of Mr Lammy’s American credentials: he has lived, studied and worked in the US. He has family there; his father is buried in Texas. He boasts regularly that he has visited the US more than France. But it would be a mistake to think Labour is throwing its lot in with a politically sympathetic Democratic president and administration. “Whoever is in the White House or Number 10 in a big election year, we must work together,” Mr Lammy told the Institute for Government recently, nodding towards the prospect of Donald Trump re-entering the White House. Back in 2018, Mr Lammy called the former US president “a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath” and a “profound threat to the international order”. It wasn’t a one off: he has also accused Mr Trump of promoting racism and separately labelled him a fascist. Since then, the foreign secretary has been on quite a journey and has been working hard to build a relationship with Republicans and allies of Mr Trump. In recent months he has met an array of Trump campaign advisers - past and present - along with Republican members of Congress, including possible Trump running mate JD Vance, whom Mr Lammy refers to as “my friend”. And in a speech to the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington in May, Mr Lammy said Mr Trump’s uncertain commitment to European security had been “misunderstood”. The message from both Downing Street and the Foreign Office is this Labour government will work with whoever lives in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Yet Labour’s preparation for a possible Trump presidency is not limited to pragmatic engagement with his team. The government is also preparing a foreign policy that assumes the long-term trend of US detachment from Europe will continue, alongside growing economic protectionism and a greater focus on domestic US issues. And that will mean the UK doing less with the US and more with other international partners. Take Europe. In recent days both Mr Starmer and Mr Lammy have emphasised their plans to agree a defence and security pact with the European Union (EU), most likely a non-legally binding political declaration. They have made clear they envisage a broad definition of security, including anything from energy and climate change to pandemics and illegal migration. It could even involve some kind of UK participation in the European Defence Fund, the body that coordinates EU cooperation on defence research. There is talk of an early bilateral defence agreement with Germany. Mr Lammy may attend a meeting of EU foreign ministers in September. On one level this is Labour’s way of trying to reset Britain’s relationship with the EU post-Brexit, using defence as a way of building bridges and fostering trust. They hope this could eventually help to improve trade relations with the EU - to boost economic growth - while not unpicking the Brexit settlement, a political row they wish to avoid. But the policy is also a more fundamental recognition that Europe as a continent needs to do more to defend itself and rely less on America’s security blanket. This is equally true of Ukraine. Kyiv fears US support could weaken if Mr Trump is re-elected. Much of this week’s Nato summit will be about how the alliance can “future proof” military support for Ukraine against American political volatility. Labour has gone out of its way to show that London’s backing will remain “iron-clad” despite the change in government, sending Mr Healey on a visit and announcing more military aid within hours of his appointment. But none of this will be easy. Labour is promising to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national output, currently about 2.3%. But that will happen only when a strategic defence review is completed and the Treasury says there is enough tax revenue in its coffers, two conditions no one expects to be achieved soon. And as for greater cooperation with the EU on defence, that will have to wait for the new European Commission to be formed later this year; it will come at a cost of long and difficult negotiations involving many compromises demanded by EU member states; and few expect France to allow the UK much access to lucrative European defence markets by easing EU procurement rules. On climate change, Mr Lammy wants to forge what he calls a “clean power alliance” of developed and developing countries that are committed to generating renewable energy in coming years. He envisages a kind of energy alliance similar to that among oil producing nations, namely OPEC. This is designed to reclaim some of the economic and technical market in renewables from China. But it is also a policy that does not involve the UK looking across the Atlantic and depending on a president who once described climate change as a hoax and who could take the US out of the Paris climate agreement. The foreign secretary has a similar approach towards developing countries, known collectively as the “global south”. He says he wants to “reconnect” the UK with countries that felt ignored or lectured by British ministers in the past, countries denied access to western Covid vaccines or adequate climate finance. The strategic aim – one also adopted by Mr Lammy’s predecessor, Lord Cameron – is to deny countries like China a free hand when it comes to diplomatic and trade opportunities in Africa and Asia. But again, this is a policy that does not involve the UK being dependent on what Washington is thinking. As for Britain’s relationship with China, Labour wants to “compete, challenge and cooperate” with Beijing. That is in stark contrast to bipartisan opinion in Washington that sees China as a long-term strategic threat. Labour is promising a full audit of UK-China relations. But if Donald Trump wins, there are fears he could trigger a full-scale trade war with China that could damage European economies and leave Labour’s central growth plan in ruins. Where the government has less room for manoeuvre is the Middle East. The US is the biggest player in the region and drives western policy. The UK has much less influence. Mr Lammy may at some point renew Britain’s funding for the UN agency in Gaza, UNWRA, drop a UK attempt to delay the International Criminal Court’s decision on issuing an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and even restrict UK arms sales to Israel. This would ruffle feathers in Washington but might be seen by analysts as internal Labour politics designed to counter the loss of a handful of seats to pro-Gaza candidates in last week's general election. It would not change the fundamentals on the ground which remain bleak. There are growing fears of a possible Israeli attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon with bloodshed on a mass and devastating scale. Would the UK support any US military action? Would Mr Starmer deploy British forces in harms’ way to rescue British nationals in Beirut? With US political leadership so uncertain, the government is having to hedge its geopolitical bets. Mr Lammy may be an avowed Atlanticist. But his first official words as foreign secretary did not mention the US once. Instead he declared: “We will begin with a reset with Europe, on climate and the global south.” BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

market volatility,Jersey has 'good opportunity' to become crypto hub,2024-09-15,2024-07-01,Calum Riva,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gvx4nwyqeo,"Jersey has a ""good opportunity"" to become a major centre for crypto technology, according to a specialist in digital currency. Nathan de la Haye, 26, founder of BlockWise, said the island's financial services industry and its clear regulatory guidelines made it an ideal place for crypto businesses. But he also said he believed local companies needed to change their perspective to take advantage of digital currency. He said: “A lot of people think it's just a get-rich-quick scheme, and don't really treat it seriously."" Mr de la Haye explained that companies in Jersey could be cautious about the price volatility of cryptocurrencies. But he said: “The size of the industry means you can't really ignore it any more”. The global cryptocurrency market cap is more than $4.2 trillion, according to cryptocurrency market data platform CoinMarketCap. Mr de la Haye explained that the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) was open to adopting cryptocurrencies and had provided clear guidance for businesses. “They recognise the potential that this technology can have, so they have put the framework in place,” he added. In 2014, the JFSC approved the world’s first regulated Bitcoin investment fund, GABI Plc. Finance industry leader Jason Laity said this was certainly “a sign of a progressive regulatory environment”. However, he stressed that the “regulator must tread a fine line” between supporting crypto and making sure the island's reputation remained intact. He said that the island's reputation was “massively important for the financial services industry” and any emerging fast pace sector needed to be carefully regulated. Mr de la Haye founded BlockWise to consult with businesses in Jersey on crypto technology. He launched his company with the help of Digital Jersey's Tech Start Up Bootcamp. “Having more companies creating new financial products and services related to blockchain and cryptocurrency would be really exciting,” he said. Mr Laity said there was certainly a lot of activity in Jersey, so there was no reason why the number of cryptocurrency start-ups could not increase.

market volatility,"Mortgage costs to rise for 3 million, says Bank",2024-09-15,2024-06-27,Charlotte Edwards,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crged975jx7o,"About three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years, the Bank of England has said. The Bank's latest Financial Stability Report also said about 400,000 mortgage holders are facing some “very large"" payment increases. Renters also remain under pressure from the higher cost of living and higher interest rates, the report found. However, the Bank said that overall risks to the UK financial system were broadly unchanged, and businesses and households have remained resilient to the impact of higher rates. The Bank found that about one third of mortgage holders in the UK, more than three million, are still paying rates of less than 3%. These will mostly be people who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank of England started to increase interest rates in late 2021. These mortgages are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority of fixed-rate deals will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about £180, or about 28%. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Despite this, the amount of people struggling to pay their mortgage is still expected to stay below levels seen after the 2008 global financial crisis. ""The overall share of households who are behind in paying their mortgages remains low by historical standards,"" the Bank says. The report comes after three major lenders began reducing mortgage rates this week, following hints of a summer interest rate cut by the Bank of England. HSBC, NatWest and Barclays all cut the cost of fixed-rate home loans for new deals. ""The stark reality is that a lot of people have yet to come off ultra-low rates [and move] on to the higher rates available today. When they do, there is going to be a lot of payment shock,"" said Emma Jones from mortgage broker When The Bank Says No. ""Even though this week has seen major lenders reduce rates across the board, [rates] are still far higher than what many people are paying now. The irony is that the Bank of England has the power to help the very people it is talking about.” The Bank's report found that the proportion of people falling behind on rental payments has risen from 15.7% to 16.5%. This is said to be the result of landlords passing on the cost of higher mortgage interest rates to their tenants.  Higher rents have resulted in ""savings buffers for renters and low-income households"" being further eroded in the six months to the end of March this year. It also said that research suggested that many renters and lower-income households ""intend to run down their savings even further in the next year to deal with the increased cost of living, making these groups less financially resilient"". Overall, the Bank said that UK banks were still in a good position to assist businesses and households. ""The UK banking system has the capacity to support households and businesses, even if economic and financial conditions were to be substantially worse than expected,"" its report said. The Bank highlighted some ""global vulnerabilities"", including political uncertainty in the UK and abroad, that could affect the sector. It said upcoming elections worldwide could ""lead to financial market volatility"". While the Bank said that risks to the UK's financial system were ""broadly unchanged"" since the first three months of the year, prices of assets such as shares and bonds have continued to rise. Investors are ""putting less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation"", the report said. It warned that these risks ""make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow"".

market volatility,Filton & Bradley Stoke: Why this is one to watch,2024-09-15,2024-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c044jjn0zr1o,"As the general election inches ever closer, we're taking a look at some of the key battlegrounds here in the West. Filton and Bradley Stoke was created as a constituency in 2010 and has been won by one party only, The Conservatives, and one man, Jack Lopresti. However last year the Tories lost control of South Gloucestershire Council and the seat is a target for a resurgent Labour.  Here are a few things to know about Filton and Bradley Stoke. The constituency is in South Gloucestershire, and part of the greater Bristol conurbation.  As the name suggests, it includes the towns of Filton, famous for its airfield, and Bradley Stoke, built in the late 80s and 1990s. In fact, much of the housing in the constituency was built in the last 20 years, including areas such as Charlton Hayes and Lyde Green, with many more planned over the coming years.  The area is also home to some major employers from the aerospace industry, including Airbus, BAE systems and Rolls Royce, as well as the Cribbs Causeway shopping mall. It's also where the Ministry of Defence's largest UK site is based - at Filton Abbey Wood. Filton is synonymous with the aerospace industry, still a major employer here and a sector that is also very much part of the region's identity.  Rolls Royce and Airbus make vital parts for modern aviation and employ more than 8,000 people between them on their sites. Whilst Concordes are no longer built here, you can still see one at the Aerospace Bristol museum as well as other planes, helicopters and aviation projects built locally.  The businesses were based next to Filton Airfield, which after being sold in 2015 to YTL, is slowly being turned into one of the biggest new housing developments in the region. People in Bradley Stoke know only too well the effect a faltering economy can have on a new development. A lack of town planning and a national recession in the early 90s meant the area was built without proper public amenities, whilst many homeowners suffered negative equity problems, leading to its nickname ""Sadly Broke."" Decades on, and YTL are at the beginning of a development nearby called ""Brabazon"" that it is hoped will eventually consist of 6,500 new homes. Whilst the volatility of the housing market has also been evident in recent times, the plans for Brabazon also include a new concert arena and a new public park. However, with the new homes comes concern over schools, access to a GP, and the effect on local transport. Parents in Lyde Green will finally welcome two new schools in 2026 after years of delays, while a new train station is planned to serve Filton's new concert arena.  Meanwhile, in Filton's traditional residential streets, the proliferation of large town houses being turned into Houses of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs), continues to cause friction between landlords and residents concerned about overcrowding.  With so many large employers in the constituency, the area found itself at the heart of a series of strikes in 2022 and 2023. As inflation rose, concerns over working conditions and pay led to several walk outs. This included Royal Mail staff at their huge sorting office in Patchway, as well as ambulance staff based at the North Bristol operations base in Filton. Unhappy with a lack of recruitment and the growing demands of the job, it led to claims from some that, ""the NHS is broken"". Many of the disputes have since been resolved, although not the one involving junior doctors, which has been a recurring issue during this general election campaign. Southmead Hospital - the region's biggest - is just next to the constituency in neighbouring Bristol North West.  Whilst Filton and Bradley Stoke has only ever elected one person to represent them in Parliament, it is Labour which is targeting the seat and hoping to capitalise on any unhappiness over the state of the economy or the NHS.

market volatility,Housing demand wanes as buyers bank on rate cut,2024-09-15,2024-06-13,Charlotte Edwards,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmllreerzmro,"House buyers are putting off purchasing a new home until the Bank of England cuts interest rates, evidence suggests.  UK housebuilder Crest Nicholson was forced to issue a profit warning after it said sales momentum had softened since Easter due to volatile mortgage rates as well as buyers now expecting borrowing costs to drop later this year. Meanwhile, a survey of chartered surveyors found that demand for homes had weakened in May. Financial markets are forecasting that the Bank of England could cut interest rates in August or September.  Crest Nicholson reported a pre-tax loss of £30.9m for the six months to the end of April, including the impact of exceptional costs, compared to a £28.4m profit over the same period last year.  The housebuilder said that while ""the spring selling season started well"", it added: ""Momentum has softened slightly since Easter, reflecting the volatility in mortgage rates and the expectation of a base rate reduction coming later in the year than previously expected."" It added: ""The imminent general election is creating some short-term uncertainty, but this is anticipated to be alleviated in July once the outcome is known."" The firm now expects adjusted full-year profits of between £22m to £29m. Analysts had expected the company to announce profits of around £38m. Crest Nicholson's share price tumbled by nearly 12% to 212.4p. A survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found that demand had weakened in May. Tarrant Parsons, senior economist at RICS, said a recent recovery in the housing market ""appears to have slipped into reverse of late"" which he blamed on higher mortgage rates in the past couple of months. However he predicted that this was ""delaying, rather than derailing, a modest improvement going forward"". ""Indeed, respondents continue to envisage a more positive trend in sales activity coming through over the year ahead, although this is likely predicated on the Bank of England being able to start lowering interest rates in the coming months."" Those surveyed by RICS said that demand was weakest in both south east and south west England. In contrast, prices were still robust in Scotland and Northern Ireland."
market volatility,Sunak announces UK general election for 4 July,2024-09-15,2024-05-22,Paul Seddon,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-69050450,"Rishi Sunak has vowed to ""fight for every vote"" as he called an early UK general election for Thursday 4 July. The PM made the announcement in a rain-soaked speech outside 10 Downing Street, as he bids to win a fifth term in office for the Conservatives. The surprise move overturned expectations of an autumn poll, which might have given the Tories a better chance of closing the gap with Labour. Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""time for change"" away from ""Tory chaos"".  Labour has been posting large leads in national opinion polls, and has insisted it has a fully organised campaign ready to go.  Parliament will now be suspended on Friday, before it is formally shut down on Thursday next week ahead of an official five-week election campaign.  It means there are only two days to pass any outstanding legislation - a move which will mean some of the government's measures will have to be abandoned. October or November had previously been thought more likely for an election date. But the rumours started swirling from early on Wednesday morning, after confirmation that annual inflation had fallen to its lowest rate in almost three years.  And as Prime Minister's Questions got under way in the Commons, it still was not clear whether an announcement was coming. It was not until just after 17:00 BST that the UK's first July election since 1945 was confirmed. The prime minister referred to the inflation figures as he announced the election date in Downing Street later in the day, in a sign he hopes to frame his campaign around a narrative of economic recovery after a period of rising living costs.  He added that the fall in inflation, along with the UK's emergence from recession earlier this year, were ""proof that the plan and priorities"" he had set out were working. But his statement did not go entirely to plan, as he battled worsening rain and activists blasting out New Labour anthem Things Can Only Get Better over a loudspeaker.  There was confusion in at least some parts of the Conservative Party about why Mr Sunak had decided to call the election sooner than had been widely expected. ""I just don't understand it,"" one Tory MP told the BBC. ""The economy is improving. Why not give that more time to bed in?"" One senior minister was annoyed that Mr Sunak had given his speech in the driving rain. ""If the whole point was to remind the public that he was Mr Furlough, why not do the speech inside from the same briefing room?"" They added: ""Labour MPs are happy. We're not. That tells a story."" In a TV statement shortly afterwards, Sir Keir argued Tory ""chaos"" had damaged the economy, and a vote for his party represented a chance to bring political stability. Adding it was ""time for change"", he criticised the Conservatives' management of public services, the NHS and record on tackling crime. ""Give the Tories five more years and things will only get worse. Britain deserves better than that,"" Sir Keir added. SNP leader John Swinney, who took over as Scotland's first minister earlier this month, said the election was a chance to ""remove the Tory government and put Scotland first"". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said it would be a chance to ""kick Rishi Sunak's appalling Conservative government out of office"", whilst Greens co-leader Carla Denyer said her party was aiming to elect at least four new MPs. And Reform UK leader Richard Tice said the Tories had ""broken Britain"" but Labour would ""bankrupt Britain"", and only his party would offer ""common sense policies that can now save Britain"". Mr Sunak's statement is the start of weeks of general election campaigning for the 650 seats in Parliament. It will be fought on the first set of new constituency boundaries since 2010, redrawn to reflect population changes since then, and will be the first where voters have to show ID. The Royal Family has postponed engagements ""which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign"", Buckingham Palace said, adding that the King and Queen sent their ""sincere apologies"" to those affected. At the last election in 2019, Boris Johnson won an 80-seat majority after calling a snap poll as he fought to get his Brexit withdrawal deal through Parliament. It was followed by an extraordinarily volatile period in British politics, as the country was hit by the Covid pandemic and Mr Johnson was forced to resign, amid a cabinet revolt over a series of scandals. His successor Liz Truss lasted 49 days in the job before she quit, after a market backlash to her tax and spending plans announced at a hastily arranged ""mini Budget"" in September 2022. This is the first general election since 2015 that has not required a vote in Parliament to approve the date, since legislation fixing the time between polls was reversed two years ago."
market volatility,Migrants hit by high fees to send money home,2024-09-15,2024-04-29,By Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68817110,"Jerry Lukendo Mbokani has to make several calculations when he sends money to his elderly mother in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Kampala, Uganda, where Mr Mbokani has lived for 16 years, he first has to buy US dollars. To convert approximately $100 (£80) worth of Ugandan shillings would cost almost $3, he reports. He also adds the withdrawal fee of $7, so that his mother doesn't incur a fee when receiving the money. He sends these remittances through mobile money, usually phone-based digital transfers, rather than through a physical location like a bank, post office, or Western Union-style money transfer company. In real terms 10% of the amount could be eaten up in fees. Mr Mbokani, the chief executive of the Refugee-Led Organization Network (Relon), knows he's far from alone. One target of the UN Sustainable Development Goals is that by 2030, remittance fees should be less than 3%, and total fees to send and receive money between a pair of countries should be no more than 5%. Some researchers believe that to be truly affordable, the first goal should be even less than 3%. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that reaching this target could generate $32bn (£26bn), even apart from the direct-cost savings. This is because remittances have such powerful knock-on effects for the economy, and people tend to send more in remittances when fees are lower. Yet the world is far off this target. According to the World Bank, the global average is 6.2%, over double the target. It's especially pricey to send money to sub-Saharan Africa, where the average transaction fee is 7.4%. For particular combinations of countries, fee percentages can climb well into the double digits. One reason for high fees is inconsistent regulation. Within Africa a payment company can't use a single licence across multiple countries, says Nika Naghavi. She is the group head of growth at Onafriq, a digital payment network that extends through more than 40 African countries.  A result is that even between neighbouring countries with a robust trade and frequent population movement, money can't always flow freely. For instance, Ms Naghavi says, transfers between Togo and Benin are frequent and straightforward, helped by having a common currency. Yet money can't easily be sent between Togo and another neighbour country, Ghana. ""That's why the costs become heavy: a lot of it is in compliance and regulation,"" says Ms Naghavi. More technology of business These requirements may not be so applicable to low-value transfers. Sending $50 to a relative in another country is not very risky, but may still fall under a complicated chain of regulations meant to safeguard against money laundering. In some countries, ""the regulations governing who can act as a remittance provider can be quite stifling,"" says Ravenna Sohst, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute Europe. ""For young companies to enter into this market requires a lot of technical, financial and legal knowhow, which I think is one of the reasons why the field has seen relatively few players for a long time."" Ms Sohst says that Mexico-US is an example of a major remittance corridor, where more competition has helped reduce prices. Without competition, rates can be set by the few companies (or informal, cash-based agents) able to facilitate transfers between a pair of countries. Limited competition also means that companies may not feel the need to disclose much information about fees. ""It's up to sometimes the service providers what they want to show to the customer,"" says Uloma Ogba, a gender and learning specialist for the Migration and Remittances Program of the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF).  This can include misleading claims about zero-fee transactions, which ""often means that the service provider and other agents involved along that transaction process are making money some other way"". ""Our North Star should be to ensure that these customer fees are as close as possible to zero,"" Ms Naghavi says. ""But today it's not possible because of the underlying cost of running your business."" Companies may temporarily lower or eliminate transaction fees during disasters, as occurred immediately after the 2023 earthquake in Morocco. But emergency expenses crop up at other times as well. Female migrants, especially, are sending money home to cover unseen expenses. In Ms Ogba's own monthly remittances from the US to Nigeria, she prioritises her parents' healthcare, her cousin's education, and communal obligations like funeral expenses. On top of this are contributions for home renovations. Flexible pricing structures would be particularly helpful for women. They typically earn lower incomes than men and often send smaller, more frequent remittances for things like healthcare and education, Ms Ogba says. Because digital remittances are more affordable than traditional banking (with average fees of 4.8% vs. 6.2% respectively), and because they can require less documentation, much of the innovation is occurring in the digital realm. For instance, a fintech company catering to Gambian migrants in the UK found that its customers wanted to be able to directly pay utility bills for their families in Gambia. It's impossible to talk about digital innovation in sending money without mentioning cryptocurrency. Some enthusiasts believe that Bitcoin and other types of crypto promise more seamless transfers of money anywhere in the world. However, volatility, patchy regulation and limited knowledge remain barriers to uptake of cryptocurrency for remittances. Even more basic technologies can be out of reach for people sending and receiving remittances. While it's cheaper to send mobile money, many of the poorest people in the world lack mobile phones and internet access. While at least half of remittances are now digital, cash remittances dominate in low-and middle-income countries.  It can also be especially difficult for people on the move, or those unable to obtain official forms of identification, to provide tax ID numbers and other documentation. In Uganda, Mr Mbokani says, refugee ID cards aren't part of the same centralised register as national IDs. And there can be obstacles to using refugee IDs at some money transfer agencies. Such issues mean that ""we're leaving a lot of people behind,"" Ms Naghavi comments. "
market volatility,Transport firms feeling pinch of rising fuel costs,2024-09-15,2022-03-07,By Niall Glynn,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60650159,"The conflict in Ukraine continues to affect the cost of oil and gas, putting a further squeeze on the cost of living.  World oil prices have jumped to $139 (£106) a barrel, the highest level for almost 14 years. The Northern Ireland Consumer Council has found 500 litres of home heating oil costs £559.50 - an increase of 75% since 23 February. And petrol and diesel prices continue to soar. Petrol prices of £1.65 per litre have been reported in parts of Northern Ireland, with diesel prices close to £1.80 per litre some places. Those compare to around the £1.20 per litre mark a year ago, and prices are unlikely to fall any time soon. The owner of a County Fermanagh fuel company is predicting that diesel prices could hit £2 per litre by the end of this week.  Garry Jennings, from Jennings Fuels and Lubricants in Kesh, said as well as volatility in oil market, there are issues with supplies coming into Northern Ireland.  ""We are selling the fuel we've bought in on Friday, tonight it looks like there's going to be another 10p on oil and that's going to come to us tomorrow morning.  ""We buy on the day and try and sell on the day so this is fuel we bought in on Friday, tomorrow's fuel is going to be 10p up, what's going to happen Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?""  The Northern Ireland Oil Federation (NIOF) have said there is no issue with supplies, but they are dealing with a 10-day backlog of orders due to mass panic-buying. While some drivers may be able to travel less or use public transport, that is not an option for transport companies. Stephen Anton, from taxi company Fonacab, said rising fuel prices are felt directly by taxi drivers as they are self employed and account for all of their income and costs individually. ""In other words, they fuel their vehicles, the cost of doing so an expense against their booking income,"" Mr Anton said.  ""While drivers can offset fuel costs against their taxable income, the increased fuel costs affect what they take home on a day-to-day basis."" He added: ""If this continues to be a problem, it has the potential to impact negatively on taxi driver numbers across Northern Ireland.  ""Many drivers left the industry for various reasons during Covid and a substantial number have not returned, instead taking early retirement or remaining in other jobs they secured during lockdowns.  ""A sustained high fuel cost may encourage some other drivers to do the same."" Mr Anton said the company was conscious that customers are feeling cost of living increases in their pockets too and did not want to increase fares unnecessarily.  ""There is a balancing act to ensuring that prices remain competitive and affordable for our customers and are also sufficient to allow drivers to make a living and work to provide the services that customers need,"" he said.  ""The current fuel price increases make this a more difficult exercise than ever. ""From our perspective, anything that can be done to reduce fuel costs for drivers' vehicles is a priority.  ""A temporary decrease in fuel duty would be welcome, and there are other tools that local government can employ to reduce overall costs for drivers - for example, reducing the cost of an annual PSV for a taxi to that of an MoT.""  Paul Stewart, from courier firm NI Parcels, said fuel prices had been increasing ""slowly but surely"" over the last year. ""However, in the last six weeks the increases have been huge,"" he said.  ""It has been the largest increase I have ever seen in our business.  ""We have been absorbing some of the increases ourselves, but there is only so much you can absorb, so this has now resulted in some of the increased costs onto our customers.  ""As the fuel prices change so regularly, it is difficult to keep changing your prices and this could make our business look unprofessional. ""It is a very difficult time to absorb the costs or increase prices, we have done a blend of both for now.""   Mr Stewart said the full costs have not been passed onto customers, meaning a reduction in profits for the company.  ""The main issue is the constant price changes making it difficult to set prices, some form of price freeze or price caps would be hugely appreciated,"" he said. ""As the fuel price increases so does the revenue collected on the duty on the increased prices. Duty on fuel could be reduced to help with these increases."" "
market volatility,"Mortgages are scary, say first-time buyers",2024-09-15,2022-10-09,By Huw Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63180909,"First-time house buyers who got a mortgage just weeks before interest rates shot up have said buying is ""scary"" at the moment.  Morgan Luff, 23, and Ewan Anderson, 27, are buying a house in Caldicot, Monmouthshire. They secured a 3.6% interest rate mortgage, but the average rate has now gone above 6%. A building society boss said market volatility is likely to lead to financial difficulty for more people. Morgan and Ewan said they were ""lucky"" to get a five-year mortgage deal in August. They are now in the process of buying the semi-detached house they rent from family. ""It seems we're at the start of these new rates, where down the line it's going to be almost double by the sounds of it,"" Ewan said.  Morgan said the majority of the couple's friends are renting at the moment.  ""We know friends that are not even looking to buy at the moment and just continue renting because it is almost cheaper,"" she said, ""especially if you've got a fixed rent price.""  Morgan said she does worry about taking on such a large commitment when things are so uncertain.  ""With bills, they're going up all the time so you might be able to afford that but you don't know if you're going to afford everything in between,"" she explained. ""It's a massive jump and being so young I don't think you really learn any of this when you're growing up."" She said the process of becoming a home owner was a ""massive eye-opener"". ""Five years is a very long time whereas with renting you can just walk away when your six months or your 12 months are up,"" she said. ""It's very scary."" As borrowing costs rise, ""things will become tighter"" for borrowers, said Will Carroll of Monmouthshire Building Society. The lender was among those to withdraw some fixed-rate mortgage products after the UK government's mini-budget. ""I think it is inevitable, with a cost of living crisis and costs increasing across the board for households, that things will become tighter,"" Mr Carroll said. His staff, he added, were already helping those concerned about the rising cost of repayments, or the prospect of higher rates once existing deals came to an end. ""But as a responsible lender, when we issue a mortgage we do stress an increase in future rates on an individual's ability to pay,"" Mr Carroll added. ""So while we do expect an increase in those members experiencing financial difficulty, we hope that it is not going to be too severe and that we can manage through until things maybe return to more normal circumstances,"" he said. Rates for two and five-year fixed-term mortgages had begun climbing before the mini-budget. Data from Moneyfacts showed average fixed rates a year ago, in October 2021, were 2.25% for a two-year fixed rate and 2.55% for a five-year fixed rate. But by 6 October 2022 the interest rates had increased to 6.11% for a two-year deal and 6.02% for a five-year deal. Former rugby player Mike Powell has been a mortgage broker in Caldicot since 2013.  The last month has been the busiest he has experienced, he said. Things were ""chaotic, manic, turbulent, extremely busy,"" he explained.  ""We try and take the stress away from clients but at times when lenders are pulling deals with very little notice, it's difficult.""  ""We've got people who have been on tracker rates for 10, 12, 15 years who've never done anything,"" he said. ""They've seen their mortgage payments at an affordable cost to them so they've just thought it's not been going up. He said he hears from lenders regularly and there is no sense of panic from industry insiders. ""The banks have got a lot more money this time. They're a lot more liquid than what they were in 2008 so I can't see a crash coming."" Monmouthshire Building Society withdrew fixed-rate products for new customers in the volatile period after the mini-budget, but it honoured existing applications and kept offering fixed-rate deals to existing customers. It expected to reintroduce fixed-rate products to new customers soon, but at a higher rate than before the mini-budget. Monmouthshire Building Society has 10,000 mortgage customers and lends about £350m a year. Speaking at the society's Newport headquarters, Mr Carroll said his team had to adapt quickly to the market reaction after the mini-budget. Mr Carroll said: ""The Bank of England rate is at its highest level now since 2008 and the expectation is that the rate will increase further over the next year. ""I think the markets are forecasting a rate of 5.5% by the middle of next year. So we can expect an increase in the cost of borrowing as we move forward. ""We are seeing our borrowing members come to us sooner than maybe they had done previously with concerns about that increased cost of borrowing into the future."" He encouraged borrowers with concerns to contact the building society's mortgage advisers."
market volatility,Treasury rejects U-turn on mini-budget despite turmoil,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63067163,"The government will not abandon its mini-budget despite the Bank of England having to step in amid market turmoil, a Treasury minister has said. Labour called for the tax-cutting measures to be ditched after they sparked a fall in the pound and a surge in borrowing costs. Government departments are also being asked to find spending cuts. Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said the government's proposals were the ""right plans"" to grow the UK economy. He claimed ""every major economy is dealing with exactly the same issues"" and said the impact of ""Putin's war in Ukraine is cascading through things like the cost of energy, some of the supply side implications of that"". The value of the pound dropped to $1.05 on Wednesday, after the Bank of England stepped in to stabilise the economy, before later rallying to about $1.08. On Wednesday, the Bank announced it would buy government bonds on a temporary basis to help ""restore orderly market conditions"".  Some pension funds hold a lot of government bonds, because they are normally a stable investment, but as their value dropped there were concerns over the solvency of some funds, the BBC has been told.  The Bank's moves on Wednesday followed a highly-critical intervention from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which warned the measures were likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis.  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Chris Philp, has confirmed he is asking government departments to find savings. Speaking on ITV's Peston, Mr Philp said government departments are being asked to ""look for efficiencies wherever they can find them"". These efficiencies will ""stick to the targets"" of the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review ""that set out three year spending plan"", Mr Philp said. Any savings will ""enable us to target spending on things that target growth,"" he added. Gerard Lyons, an economist who has spoken in support of the mini-budget, criticised the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng for ""failing"" to warn financial markets about the plans.  ""Ahead of the budget, it was necessary for the chancellor to keep financial markets on-side,"" Mr Lyons told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""The chancellor appealed to domestic population and appealed to a domestic business community, but one key group he failed to keep on-side was the financial market."" Conservative MP Mel Stride has criticised the government for not publishing a forecast of the UK's economic outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - saying it needs to do so ""as soon as possible"". Forecasts from the independent OBR give an indication of the health of the nation's finances. The BBC understands the government was given a draft before announcing the tax cuts, but it has not been published. ""The OBR should have been brought in earlier,"" said Mr Stride, the chairman of the Treasury select committee. He said the OBR forecast could have then be used to reassure the markets.  ""It is urgently important that the government and the Treasury comes forward at the earliest possible time now with that OBR forecast, with what their fiscal target is going to be, so they can turn and face the markets and say this is this is all fiscally credible."" But Mr Philp said an OBR report will not be published until 23 November, when Mr  Kwarteng plans to set out a ""Medium-Term Fiscal Plan"". This will allow the OBR forecasts to be done ""in a way that's organised and thoughtful,"" Mr Philp said. Downing Street rejected calls for Parliament to be recalled after calls from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to do so MPs can overturn last week's mini-budget. Parliament is currently suspended while the two main parties hold their annual conferences. It is due to come back on 11 October. The £45bn package of tax cuts announced last week would repair ""underlying problems in the economy,"" Mr Griffith said. He added the Bank of England had ""done their job"" by announcing it would buy government debt to stabilise the economy. Few Conservative MPs are commenting publicly about Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's handling of the economic turmoil sparked by his mini-budget - but they are not mincing their words in off-the-record conversations. Inept, humiliating, naive and reckless are just some of the words that have cropped up. What is so irritating to many of them is that this financial instability was predicted - by none other than former chancellor and leadership candidate Rishi Sunak. Some, who describe themselves as ""critical but sensible"", are dismissing ""idiotic talk"" of trying to oust the prime minister. But there is huge pressure on the chancellor, who they accuse of an ""appalling lapse in political judgement"". Read more here. Mr Kwarteng, who unveiled the tax-cutting package last Friday, is yet to speak publicly on the growing impact of the package on markets.  The Treasury said the plans would be funded by £72bn of borrowing and there is an expectation this will surge as interest rates rise.  The pound slumped following his statement and later fell to a record low against the dollar after Mr Kwarteng hinted there were more tax cuts to come.  Julian Smith became the first former cabinet minister to call for the government to ""make changes"". The former Northern Ireland Secretary, who backed Rishi Sunak to become prime minister, tweeted: ""It is critical that the government is honest about the current situation and plays its part in stabilising markets. ""It can keep a growth plan but needs to make changes. Not doing so will only continue further stress and strain on UK citizens."" Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Griffith, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, insisted the UK had a ""very strong balance sheet"" and one of the lowest debt to GDP ratios of major economies. Asked whether the government had any plans to change Friday's measures, he replied: ""We think they're the right plans, because those plans make our economy competitive"". ""At the end of the day, that's ultimately what we've got to do,"" he said, saying ministers were focused on ""getting on and delivering"" its plans to work."
market volatility,Going green could save world 'trillions' - study,2024-09-15,2022-09-13,By Jonah Fisher,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62892013,"Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy could save the world as much as $12tn (£10.2tn) by 2050, an Oxford University study says. The report said it was wrong and pessimistic to claim that moving quickly towards cleaner energy sources was expensive. Gas prices have soared on mounting concerns over energy supplies. But the researchers say that going green now makes economic sense because of the falling cost of renewables. ""Even if you're a climate denier, you should be on board with what we're advocating,"" Prof Doyne Farmer from the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School told BBC News. ""Our central conclusion is that we should go full speed ahead with the green energy transition because it's going to save us money,"" he said. The report's findings are based on looking at historic price data for renewables and fossil fuels and then modelling how they're likely to change in the future. The data for fossil fuels goes from 2020 back more than 100 years and shows that after accounting for inflation, and market volatility, the price hasn't changed much. Renewables have only been around for a few decades, so there's less data. But in that time continual improvements in technology have meant the cost of solar and wind power have fallen rapidly, at a rate approaching 10% a year. The report's expectation that the price of renewables will continue to fall is based on ""probabilistic"" modelling, using data on how massive investment and economies of scale have made other similar technologies cheaper.  ""Our latest research shows scaling-up key green technologies will continue to drive their costs down, and the faster we go, the more we will save,"" says Dr Rupert Way, the report's lead author from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. Wind and solar are already the cheapest option for new power projects, but questions remain over how to best store power and balance the grid when the changes in the weather leads to fall in renewable output. Back in 2019 Philip Hammond, then Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote to the prime minister to say that the cost of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the UK would be more than £1tn. This report says the likely costs have been over-estimated and have deterred investment.  It also says predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that the cost of keeping global temperatures rises under 2 degrees would correspond to a loss of GDP by 2050 were too pessimistic. The transition to renewables was, it says, likely to turn out to be a ""net economic benefit"". The research has been published in the journal Joule and is a collaboration between the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, the Oxford Martin Programme on the Post-Carbon Transition, the Smith School of Enterprise & Environment at the University of Oxford, and SoDa Labs at Monash University.

market volatility,US regulators warn banks over cryptocurrency risks,2024-09-15,2023-01-04,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64159452,"US regulators have issued their first ever joint warning to banks over the risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. The watchdogs told financial institutions to be wary of potential fraud, legal uncertainty and misleading disclosures by digital asset firms. Banks were also cautioned over the ""contagion risk"" from the sector. It comes just two months after the collapse of trading platform FTX sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. In the joint statement, the US Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they were closely monitoring the crypto activities of banking organisations. ""The events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector,"" the statement said. The regulators also said that issuing or holding crypto tokens, which are stored on public, decentralised networks was ""highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices"". Banks were also encouraged to take steps to avoid problems in the digital asset market spreading to the wider financial system. ""It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,"" it added. Tuesday's statement comes after months of hesitancy by US financial industry watchdogs to issue uniform guidelines on cryptocurrencies, despite banks inviting clearer advice from regulators. The cryptocurrency industry was rocked by the collapse of FTX in November.  It was the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange and the entry point for millions of people into the digital asset market. On Tuesday, FTX's former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried officially denied charges that he defrauded customers and investors. He pleaded not guilty in a US court to claims that he took customer deposits at FTX to fund his other firm, Alameda Research, buy property and make political donations. Two of Mr Bankman-Fried's closest colleagues have already pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the investigation, which has shaken the entire cryptocurrency industry. Mr Bankman-Fried was one of the most high-profile figures in the sector, known for his political ties, celebrity endorsements and bailouts of other struggling firms. He has been accused by the US of building ""a house of cards on a foundation of deception, while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto""."
market volatility,Short run-in to 58% Manx Gas bill hike 'not ideal',2024-09-15,2022-04-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-60960380,"A lack of run-in time for the introduction of a 58% hike in gas bills on the Isle of Man was ""not ideal"", the Manx Gas chief executive has said. The rise, which came into force three days after it was announced on Tuesday, was the second in recent months. Jo Cox said the recent approval of a regulatory framework for gas prices left the company little time to work through the figures before 1 April. A dramatic increase in wholesale gas prices has been blamed for the rise. It is the second increase in tariffs in recent months, after a 27.5% hike hit people's bills in December. As well as the tariff increase, customers who pay by direct debit have had the discount applied to their bills slashed from 2.5% to 1%. Ms Cox said the move was necessary to avoid those not using the direct payment system getting ""a bigger hit"" when the changes came into force. The island's monopoly provider only had ""one lever to pull"" at the moment ""because all we sell is gas"", she said, but the company was looking at extending the products it sells and was reviewing operating costs in a bid to keep future rises lower. However, she warned that the volatility in the market could last for up to another year. ""All we can do is just keep watching that market, and trying to protect ourselves in the areas of the areas that we can control so that we can bring those prices down in a different way,"" she added.

market volatility,Markets up after Bank of England bond-buying pledge,2024-09-15,2022-09-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63070445,"Stock markets in Asia and the US have risen after the Bank of England said it would buy £65bn of UK government bonds. The announcement came after Friday's mini-budget sparked financial market turmoil and the pound plunged. Investors also demanded higher returns on government bonds, or ""gilts,"" causing some to slide in value. Speaking in New York on Wednesday, new UK trade secretary Kemi Badenoch defended the government's economic policies. However, gains early in the trading day tapered off towards the close with Japan's benchmark Nikkei index ending 0.9% higher, Australia's ASX 200 up by 1.4% and the Kospi in South Korea less than 0.1% higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng reversed earlier gains to trade 0.8% lower. That came after New York's main stock indexes rebounded from a six-day losing streak to end Wednesday's trading day around 2% higher. The pound was down by around 1% at below $1.08, after earlier making strong gains on Wednesday after the Bank of England's bond-buying announcement. The currency hit a record low on Monday after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled plans to tax cuts, funded by borrowing, in a push to boost economic growth. Analysts said the Bank's pledge to buy government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore ""orderly market conditions"" had helped to calm market volatility. ""The Bank of England's intervention has supported market optimism,"" Jun Bei Liu, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners in Sydney, told the BBC. ""It reversed a previous view of the UK going into a hard landing and debt spiralling out of control,"" she said. Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at online trading platform IG, said the move had ""provided some much-needed relief to recent market jitters."" In New York, the UK's international trade secretary used her first visit to the US since taking the role to try to shore up investor confidence. ""You would by now have heard the Bank of England is taking short-term measures to provide stability, as is their job,"" Ms Badenoch said. ""And we must look at all of this in the context of the fundamentals, which are that the UK economy is strong and we have a plan, a growth plan to cut taxes, promote enterprise, and cut red tape for business,"" she added."
market volatility,Musk threatens to walk away from Twitter deal,2024-09-15,2022-06-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61709782,"Elon Musk has threatened to walk away from his $44bn takeover of Twitter, accusing the social media company of ""thwarting"" his requests to learn more about its user base. In a letter filed with regulators, Mr Musk said he was entitled to do his own measurement of spam accounts. The letter formalises a dispute that has simmered for weeks after Mr Musk declared the deal ""on hold"" pending further information. Twitter has defended its estimates. But Mr Musk has said he believes spam and fake accounts represent a far greater share than the less than 5% of daily users that Twitter reports publicly. ""As Twitter's prospective owner, Mr Musk is clearly entitled to the requested data to enable him to prepare for transitioning Twitter's business to his ownership and to facilitate his transaction financing. To do both, he must have a complete and accurate understanding of the very core of Twitter's business model - its active user base,"" lawyer Mike Ringler wrote in the letter. ""Based on Twitter's behaviour to date, and the company's latest correspondence in particular, Mr Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights,"" the letter said. ""This is a clear material breach of Twitter's obligations under the merger agreement and Mr Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement."" The dispute has raised more doubts about the future of the takeover, which Twitter's board approved in April.  ""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement,"" the company said in a statement. Twitter, which has said Mr Musk waived typical rights to due diligence in his eagerness to clinch the deal, added that it intended to complete the takeover at the agreed price and terms. Mr Musk, who faces a $1bn break-up fee and possible lawsuit if he opts out, first raised the issue of the spam accounts on social media last month, saying the deal was on hold but he remained committed to the acquisition.  Analysts have said the Tesla boss might be using the issue to try to renegotiate the price or even walk away. They said Mr Musk's decision to raise the issue on social media was unconventional, making it difficult to establish how serious he was.  When Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal defended the company's process in a series of tweets, Mr Musk responded with a poo emoji. Mr Musk has said he believes that bots could account for 20% or more of Twitter users. The letter, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, confirms that the two sides have gone back and forth on the issue since early May. It says Mr Musk merits ""reasonable cooperation"" as he tries to line up financing for the deal.  ""Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr Musk's data requests,"" the letter says.  ""Twitter's effort to characterise it otherwise is merely an attempt to obfuscate and confuse the issue."" Texas attorney general Ken Paxton entered the debate on Monday, saying he had launched an investigation into Twitter for ""potentially false reporting over its fake bot accounts"". Twitter has until 27 June to respond to his request for information. Mr Musk's plans for the company have drawn intense scrutiny from regulators around the world, while raising some alarm among investors of electric car company Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX, which Mr Musk also leads.  He has lined up outside investors to help pay for the takeover and is also using equity and loans backed by his Tesla shares, which have been hit in recent weeks as market turmoil wipes billions from the values of companies including Tesla. The decline has also made Mr Musk's offer of $54.20 per share for Twitter look even more generous. On Monday, Twitter shares were trading below $39, down 3%, though they later regained some ground. They have yet to return to the highs they hit last month shortly after Mr Musk revealed he had purchased about 9% of the firm's shares. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the letter marked the ""strongest signal yet that the Tesla founder is prepared to walk away"". ""This is a move Twitter investors have for weeks been steeling themselves for: the moment when Elon Musk's haphazard ruminations in tweets have been distilled into an official letter to regulators,"" she said. ""However, given the added volatility which has hit the tech sector since Mr Musk made his offer, it's highly likely he's after a cheaper price even if Twitter does provide the data requested in support of its initial analysis."""
market volatility,US jobs and wages rise in January,2024-09-15,2018-02-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42921615,"The US labour market barrelled forward in January, as employers added more jobs than expected and wage growth was its strongest in more than eight years. US payrolls expanded by 200,000 last month, driven by hiring in construction, food services and health care, the US Labor Department said. The average hourly wage for private sector workers crept up 2.9% compared to January 2017. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%. Economists have puzzled over lacklustre wage growth, which has lagged in prior months despite the decline in the unemployment rate. Without higher wages, economists have warned that economic growth will be difficult to sustain, since consumer spending plays a large role in the US economy. The Labor Department report, released on Friday, showed average hourly earnings for private sector workers rose 9 cents in January, to $26.74. For the year, the increase was 75 cents. The wage uptick coincided with mandatory minimum pay increases in 18 states. Major employers such as Walmart have also said they planned to boost earnings or provide bonuses. Those factors may have helped lift last month's numbers, but they make it harder to say if the increases will continue, said Lindsey Piezga, chief economist for fixed income at Stifel, based in Chicago. ""While that is encouraging, what we really need to see is sustained wage growth, not one-off, month-to-month volatility,"" she said. Other data in the report was a reminder that monthly gains can be fleeting. For example, the unemployment rate among black workers jumped in January to 7.7%, rising after falling to a record low of 6.8% in December. President Donald Trump had trumpeted that decline as evidence of economic improvement. The US is now in its ninth year of expansion and has been adding jobs steadily since 2010. The increases in January occurred across most industries, a sign of solid growth. The pace of hiring is slowing, however. Over the last three months, payrolls increased by an average of 192,000 jobs, compared to over 200,000 in the same period the prior year. ""I don't think we should be too excited about this,"" said Ms Piezga. ""The momentum of the US economy is waning. We're still talking about positive growth, positive job creation, but at a slower pace."" Economists have said some slowdown in job creation is to be expected as new workers become harder to find.  Despite a relatively high number of job openings, participation in the labour force has remained stuck below 63%, several percentage points lower than it was before the financial crisis. US stock indexes slid after the report.  Analysts said part of the decline was due to investor reaction to the wage increase, which is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates - and could make policymakers move more aggressively. The Fed is one of several central banks that are turning from policies that were designed to boost economic activity in the aftermath of the financial crisis."
market volatility,Global shares jump on second Covid vaccine hopes,2024-09-15,2020-11-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54959414,"Global share prices have surged following news of a second breakthrough coronavirus vaccine, following last week's positive results from Pfizer. Interim data from the US firm Moderna suggests its vaccine is highly effective in preventing people getting ill and works across all age groups. The news pushed Moderna shares more than 9% higher and the Dow to a record. It also lifted firms hit by the virus, with British Airways owner IAG rising 10% and Cineworld up 13.5%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new high, after jumping about 1.6%. The wider S&P 500 increased almost 1.2% from Friday's record and the Nasdaq gained 0.8%. Earlier, the UK's FTSE 100 share index closed about 1.6% higher, while the main market in Paris rose 1.7% and in Germany shares gained 0.5%. Last week, stock markets enjoyed one of their best ever days when a vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech raised hopes that the business world might return to normal next year. A number of other vaccines are also being developed. The gains spurred by Moderna's news on Monday were more muted but still helped the MSCI World Index of global shares to rise further, climbing to a new record high. Firms that have been hit most badly in the pandemic have seen the biggest rises. In the travel sector, cruise line Carnival jumped more than 10%, while Intercontinental Hotels closed almost 5% higher. The prospect of an end to lockdowns also helped oil prices strengthen. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices were up about 3%, and shares in energy companies also gained. The price of gold - which is often seen as a safer asset in times of uncertainty - slipped 0.7% before recovering. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said markets are being driven by a ""tug-of-war between optimism over COVID-19 vaccine progress versus fear of economic slowing as COVID-19 cases continue to rise"". But he said low interest rates, stimulus and medical progress give him a ""glass half-full"" outlook. ""We expect equity prices to inch higher into year-end and 2021, with increased volatility being more the norm than exception,"" he said, Until vaccines can be rolled out, rising cases of the coronavirus were a risk, said Morgan Stanley strategists in a research note to investors. But the investment bank urged shareholders to ""keep the faith... We think this global recovery is sustainable, synchronous and supported by policy""."
market volatility,No malpractice by council in energy mishap- report,2024-09-15,2022-07-28,By Claire Hamilton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-62335765,"Lack of oversight, poor communication and staff too afraid to raise the alarm caused Liverpool City Council's energy bill to soar by £10m, an inquiry has found.  Accountants Mazars examined what led to the council signing off an energy contract which turned out to be void.  However, the report found ""no evidence of malpractice or a cover-up"" by any council employee. There was also no evidence of staff ""playing the market"", it added. The specialist accountants said a combination of factors led to the council's cabinet signing off on an extension to its electricity contract with Scottish Power at a meeting on 4 March, despite the firm having already withdrawn from the commercial market.  As a result, the council was placed on a more expensive tariff. This has impacted schools and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS), which get their energy via council contracts. 'Systematic problems'  The cabinet had not been informed of the company's market withdrawal before it was asked to agree to the deal and the mayor and senior councillors were not made aware of the error until it was too late, the report said.   The council's chief executive, Tony Reeves, resigned earlier this month. The report said the ""chief executive officer did not have controls in place to flag major risks ahead of time"". It added that he had ""insufficient knowledge of the detail of major contracts"" and that he was ""not aware of the significant work pressures of council employees"". Mr Reeves previously told a council committee that he could not ""be expected to have granular knowledge of each council contract... and he acted as soon as he was alerted to the problem"".  Cabinet member and culture change lead, Frazer Lake, said the council's internal processes had been tightened because ""the control measures in place weren't robust enough"".  ""There was confusion around roles and responsibilities,"" he said.   Government-appointed commissioners were brought in to run parts of the council in March 2021 after inspectors found a ""serious breakdown of governance"" and ""multiple apparent failures"". Lead commissioner Mike Cunningham said the contracts issue was symptomatic of the problems at the council. ""There are human errors here. But the things that need sorting out are systematic and organisational rather than one or two mistakes,"" he said.   Mr Cunningham added: ""Liverpool City Council is still emerging from a culture where openness and transparency and clarity were not things that were celebrated, and many people operated in a culture where it wasn't safe to speak out and where you got into trouble for speaking truth to power."" The report does not say exactly how much money the mistake will have cost the council, something which Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp said meant the whole exercise had been a ""complete waste of money"".  ""For over £100,000, we have learned nothing that we didn't know from the Caller report,"" he said.  ""Meanwhile schools are on holiday and will return in September having to set their budgets still not knowing what impact this will have"".  Mr Lake said: ""Schools and the fire service had already budgeted for an increase due to the volatility of the energy market"", but he said any decision to pay any extra costs from council reserves would have to be made by the cabinet at a later date. Mr Cunningham said the council needed to operate with ""a greater sense of urgency"", adding: ""What we are saying is the pace of change is not what it should be and that needs to alter.""  ""This is a big organisation spending a lot of public money. It's going to be tough to turn the tanker around, it's not for the faint-hearted,"" he said.  A council spokeswoman said: ""The city council has since approved a new energy contract with Crown Commercial Services, which will run until March 2025. ""This final cost to the council, the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the city's schools, of being on a variable tariff between 1 April and 30 June is expected to be reported to the council in August.""

market volatility,"Future uncertain but could be rosy, farmers say",2024-09-15,2023-03-17,By Judy Hobson & Becky Holmes,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-64987104,"Farmers dealing with extreme weather, rising costs and labour shortages have said they face an ""uncertain"" future as changes to subsidies are rolled out. The post-Brexit farm payments scheme will finance environmental work and sustainable food production. One farmer said money and guidance was needed, while another said the future could be ""rosy"" but would not be easy. The government said the new scheme would help farmers to ""produce food profitably and sustainably"". EU subsidies used to pay farmers for the amount of land they farmed but now there is a new emphasis on looking after the environment.  The new environmental land management schemes (Elms) will pay farmers public money for actions like managing crop pests without chemicals and working towards net zero. The measures have been broadly welcomed by farming and environmental groups. Sheep farmer John Alpe, told BBC North West Tonight he had already taken advantage of some environmental schemes. However, Mr Alpe, who owns New Laund Farm in Whitewell in the Ribble Valley, said the uncertainty on funding had led to him cutting down on the size of his flock. He said one of his main challenges was rising feed costs. He said he uses between 80 to 100 tonnes a year and the price had gone up by between £150 to £200 a tonne. At the same time, the price being paid for lamb has dropped. He said there was ""no real understanding of how much it's going to be and what we've to do"", so he planned to ""sit quiet and just not spend very much money other than what we need to do"". Whatever happens though, he said he was certain of one thing. ""We won't have more, that's for sure. There will be less.""  Ed Towers, a dairy farmer based at Brades Farm Dairy in Farleton, Lancaster, said 10% of his business relies on government subsidies.  He said like many farmers, he welcomed a more environmentally friendly focus, but said the new scheme lacked detail, making it difficult to plan for the future.  ""I would like to see greater investment opportunities for making the improvements that they want,"" he said.  ""If you want us to have all electric tractors… we need to have the money and the guidance for it."" He said the volatility of milk prices had forced him to investigate a niche market, with his farm becoming the first in the UK to produce milk specifically designed for creating latte art.   He said it offered some protection from fluctuating milk prices, but he was also trying to make other changes to improve the farm's environmental credentials, which has increased costs. He said half of the farm's carbon footprint was ""the methane that comes off the cows and so we didn't want to be part of the problem of climate change, we wanted to be part of the solution"". A diet including a garlic and citrus supplement cut methane emissions by 30%, but it is expensive and has led Mr Towers to sell carbon credits to offset the cost.  Some arable farmers like Lucy and Edd Houghton, from Lymm, Cheshire, have changed what they are planting to combat rising costs of fuel and fertiliser. Their farm produce 300 tonnes of malting barley every year for a single brewery, which has given some financial security, but Mrs Houghton said the price for other crops fluctuated. ""We're getting very good prices for our wheat which is on the back of the Ukraine war,"" she said.  ""At the moment though, the fertiliser costs have increased three times and the cost of fuel is also putting quite a strain on the farm.""  In 2020, they spent £20,000 on fertiliser, but this year, that has risen to almost £90,000. That means they have changed some of the crops on their 700-acre farm and planted oats, which need less fertiliser, while also finding other streams of income, such as spraying crops for 80 local farmers and supplying hay bales for weddings and private functions.  Beef farmer Maggie Kelly has also made changes. Her family now has one of England's biggest pedigree Hereford herds at Nether Hall Farm in the Lune Valley, despite originally having a completely different breed. She said the rising cost of feed forced a change to ""a more efficient cow"", as they were working their socks off and ""making no money"".  ""We used to have a big herd of Limousin's, and there were so many inputs... that we wanted a breed that we could manage on grass."" The National Farmers' Union said it was continuing to work with government to improve its new subsidy schemes, so farmers have all the details they need. ""If Elms is to be successful, we've always said that it needs to be simple, provide certainty and fairly reward farmers for taking part,"" the spokesman said.  The Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs said farming and nature ""can and must go hand in hand"". ""This is essential to support resilient food production,"" a representative said. ""Through our new Elms, we pay farmers to take actions that are good for the farm, good for food production and good for the environment."" They added that the government had ""provided comprehensive details of the schemes which have something on offer for every type of farmer and give them the flexibility to choose what works best for them and their land"". ""They will support farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably, including £600m in grants for equipment to help them become more productive."" Despite the challenges ahead, many farmers do remain hopeful for the future, Mr Alpe said. He said he believed his farm would still be viable when it was time for his son to take over as farmers were ""resilient"" by nature. Ms Kelly added the industry could still thrive if the government made British farming a priority. ""Farmers always step up and feed the population, so I think that the future is going to be really rosy,"" she said.  ""I don't think it will be easy, but I think it will be good.""

market volatility,Profits soar for Famous Grouse maker,2024-09-15,2017-06-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-40458187,"Spirits group Edrington has reported a sharp rise in revenues and profit. The Glasgow-based distiller, whose portfolio includes The Famous Grouse, The Macallan and Cutty Sark, saw group revenue jump by 22% to £701.3m in the year to 31 March. Pre-tax profits climbed by 31% to £189m. Edrington said higher investment in brand marketing and ""greater focus on consumers"" had contributed to ""an encouraging performance"". It added that its results had also been ""impacted significantly"" by the fall in the value of sterling against all major currencies. The company boosted marketing spend during the year by 18% to £110.7m, as part of a drive to ""invest for the long-term health of our brands"". In its annual review, the group said The Famous Grouse ""retained and strengthened its leading market position in the UK"".  However, it also pointed out that ""the continued suppression of the blends market"" had an adverse impact on both that brand, and Cutty Stark. Its Brugal rum brand returned to strong growth in its two core markets - the Dominican Republic and Spain - while delivering ""positive momentum in other markets"". There was also a good performance from its Highland Park single malt, despite a ""highly competitive environment"". Chief executive Ian Curle said: ""2016-17 was a significant year of growth for Edrington despite a difficult backdrop of economic and political volatility, and a fiercely competitive marketplace.  ""Despite short-term uncertainty we are confident about the medium and long-term prospects for the business. ""With its premium brand portfolio, proven strategy and management capability, Edrington has established the necessary momentum to deliver further growth."""
market volatility,Oil cartel leader says demand expected to grow,2024-09-15,2023-10-02,By Faarea Masud,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66985654,"Demand for oil will continue to grow and remain ""resilient"" this year, according to the secretary general of Opec+. Opec+ is a group of 23 oil-exporting countries which decides how much crude oil to sell on the world market. ""We see demand growing about 2.4 million barrels a day,"" Haitham Al Ghais told the BBC. Saudi Arabia said it would be cutting its production of crude oil by a million barrels a day to boost prices. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia - two major oil producers and members of Opec+ - to cut production could cause a ""significant supply shortfall"" by the end of this year. Mr Al Ghais said: ""This is a voluntary decision taken by two sovereign nations, Saudi Arabia and Russia. This decision can be described as precautionary or pre-emptive because of uncertainties"". Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year. They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market. Brent crude, a benchmark for prices, breached $95 a barrel on Tuesday amid predictions of shorter supplies, with fears the price may breach $100 per barrel. The rise prompted a warning to drivers that fuel prices could rise in the coming 10 months, and stoked fears that inflation in key economies could be prolonged. But Mr Al Ghais said Opec was more concerned about ""under investment"" in the oil sector. ""Some have called for stopping investments in oil. We believe this is equally dangerous. It will lead to volatility in the future, possible supply shortages. And therefore we at Opec have always advocated for the importance of continuing to invest in the oil industry as we also invest in decarbonising the industry and move on to adding other forms of alternative energy such as renewables"". Asked if he was concerned about rising oil prices affecting inflation around the world if it goes above $100 a barrel, Mr Al Ghais said it was ""important not to look at things in a short-sighted manner"". ""For next year we see demand continuing to grow north of 2 million barrels a day - of course, all subject to some of the uncertainties in the global market. Nevertheless, we still feel quite optimistic... that global oil demand is going to be quite resilient this year"". Mr Al Ghais said that the oil industry would need close to $14tn in investment to the year 2045. ""Energy demand will grow by nearly 25% by the year 2045 compared to what it is today - and all forms of energy will be required"", he said. His comments come ahead of a meeting of key oil players on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi for the International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC)."
market volatility,Sports Direct profits more than halve,2024-09-15,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40665459,"Profits at Sports Direct have plummeted nearly 60%, which the retailer said was largely due to the weaker pound. The slide in sterling means the firm has had to pay more for its imported goods, and its underlying pre-tax profit fell to £113.7m from £275.2m. However, chief executive Mike Ashley said trading at its new ""flagship"" stores was going well.  Sports Direct's reputation has been badly hit by revelations about staff conditions at its Derbyshire warehouse.  Chairman Keith Hellawell said the company had made ""positive progress"" across the business as it continued to ""strive to ensure that all of our people are treated with dignity and respect"". A recent survey of workers in Shirebrook, to which 3,300 people responded, had showed that an ""overwhelming majority"" of people in the warehouse ""currently feel they are treated with respect"", he added. Staff had elected the company's first UK workers' representative and Mr Hellawell said he had ""no doubt"" their ""contribution will prove invaluable to the board as the Sports Direct family continues to move forward together"". Sports Direct, which has been without a chief financial officer since last October, also said it had appointed Jon Kempster to the role. Mr Kempster is set to join the company on 11 September.  Mr Ashley said Sports Direct was trying to ""conservatively manage the currency volatility that is reflected in our full year results"". Sports Direct imports many of its products from abroad and the pound's fall against the dollar had led to a ""significant fall in profits"", he added. However, he said the company had now put in place hedging arrangements to ""minimise the short-term impact of currency volatility"". The company's key strategy is to turn itself into the ""Selfridges of sport"", and Mr Hellawell said the ""elevation of our retail proposition continues to be a key objective"". Sports Direct said it was forming a ""new strategic partnership"" with sportswear firm Asics. The Japanese company will manage dedicated areas within Sports Direct's new upmarket ""premium"" stores.  Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a ""transformational"" year for Sports Direct.  Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were ""a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores"". The retailer's shares rose by 6% following the release of the results as investors appeared to welcomed the progress it was making to move upmarket.   In recent months, Sports Direct has bought 26% stake in Game Digital, increased its stake in Debenhams, acquired lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and snapped up the US sports clothing and outdoor equipment chains Bob's Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports.  The company's ""spending spree on acquisitions"" had affected profits, Mr Wilson said.  ""That's something to bear in mind when we're looking at these figures and also what that does is it puts Sports Direct in a better position to make a strategic move in, for example, the department store area or in the US with its US acquisitions."" It doesn't look good on paper. But for analysts watching the company this seems like the beginning of the end of a difficult period for Sports Direct.  Financially, it's now protected against a further drop in the pound. Better late than never.   Reputationally, the damage it suffered from its alleged Dickensian treatment of workers is being addressed with a worker on the board of the company.   It's smartening up its shops and restating its goal to be the ""Selfridges of sport"".  The monkey isn't quite off its back. Chief executive Mike Ashley is still facing a court case about a £15m pub bet, which is generating colourful headlines.  But as the chairman ends his statement by saying, Sports Direct has been a big contributor to the UK economy with thousands of jobs and billions in tax. "
market volatility,How Bitcoin is infiltrating the $60bn global art market,2024-09-15,2017-07-24,By Matthew Wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40703182,"Why is the art world getting excited about digital currency Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain? Eleesa Dadiani owns and runs an art gallery in London's famous Cork Street. She was born in Georgia in the Caucasus and was ""breastfed by gypsies"". But she is also a passionate believer in the power of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. When we meet she is busy preparing for an exhibition of sculptures made from the exhausts of former Formula 1 racing cars. One of these strange rib-cage-like creations made from the super-strong alloy inconel has been gold-plated and will sell for about £35,000. ""These are pieces of history,"" she tells me. In a first for the tradition-bound art world of Cork Street, her international clientele will have the opportunity to pay using Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency underpinned by blockchain technology. The gallery will also accept other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Litecoin, and soon, Monero, she says. Why? ""This is not a demand-driven decision at all, it's intuitive based on the way things are going,"" she says. She believes paying by cryptocurrency will become as normal as paying by cash or credit card. She also hopes it will attract a new, non-traditional type of art investor. Blockchain, the underlying technology, is a digital ledger or record of transactions that is distributed across, and verified by, thousands of computers in a network. Once the network has reached a consensus that a transaction has happened, the ledger is updated and cannot be tampered with.    ""Blockchain is a borderless, open source, decentralised peer-to-peer network that governments cannot shut down,"" she says. ""For me, the blockchain is going to be the biggest thing since the internet."" And the fact that there is no centralised body - like a bank head office, for example - makes cryptocurrencies safer, she argues, despite their reputation for being volatile, high-risk and the favourite ""store of value"" for criminals and hackers.  Bitcoin payments can be anonymous and potentially beyond the grasp of tax authorities, but this isn't the reason she's offering payment by cryptocurrency, she assures me.  So how easy is it to accept a Bitcoin payment? ""It's really very simple,"" she explains. ""I give the client my public key [a long string of letters and numbers] and they use that to send bitcoin to my account from their digital wallet or bitcoin exchange,"" she says.  ""My wallet is linked to my personal bank so I can then convert those bitcoins into pounds, euros or dollars.""  Ms Dadiani is such a fan of cryptocurrencies - she trades in them as well - that she is launching her own version, Dadicoin, later this year. The $60bn art world in general is warming to the potential of cryptocurrencies, partly because of blockchain's dual ability to establish the provenance of works of art and thereby reduce the reliance on brokers and other middlemen. Marcelo Garcia Casil, for example, is chief executive and co-founder of Maecenas, an online marketplace that will enable art owners to sell shares in their expensive works of art (worth more than $1m) and raise money far more cheaply than they could though a bank. And the owners also get to keep possession of their artworks while sharing up to 49% of the ownership. Investors, who ordinarily wouldn't be able to afford multi-million-dollar works of art, will be able buy shares or units in the work using cryptocurrency. They will then be able to sell these units later in the marketplace. Each transaction is recorded cryptographically on the Ethereum blockchain. ""We want to make fine art accessible for everyone,"" says Mr Casil, who was born in Argentina, now lives in Singapore, and has a background in investment banking.  ""The old auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have controlled the art market for centuries, so we think the opportunity for disruption is huge."" Establishing the authenticity of works of art is critical to their value, and this will still need to be done by skilled professionals, admits Mr Casil. ""But once the provenance has been recorded in the blockchain, you never have to do it again,"" he says. This takes a lot of cost out of the system. Maecenas has already attracted works of art worth $100m (£77m; 86m euros) in total, says Mr Casil, and the marketplace is due for launch in September. The art world has been flirting with Bitcoin for a few years now, despite the likes of auction house Sotheby's saying they have no plans to accept the currency. In April 2015, the Austrian Museum of Applied Art/Contemporary Art (MAK) was the first museum in the world to buy a work of art using Bitcoin. Dutch artist Harm van den Dorpel created a limited-edition screensaver that was cryptographically authenticated through blockchain. And online gallery Cointemporary exhibits digital artworks by international contemporary artists that can only be bought with Bitcoin. Purchases are handled by Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain establishes the chain of ownership, preventing anyone from stealing or tampering with the work. But will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ever really become a mainstream alternative to traditional money? Views differ widely. In Japan, there is a big move to equip 260,000 retail locations with bitcoin capability, and a few high-street retailers, such as Lush, have opted to accept the currency. But Joe Pindar, a director at cyber-security company Gemalto, says: ""At present there are very few businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method - less than 1% of all retailers.  ""The biggest barrier to adoption is the length of time it takes to settle a payment in person, with transactions taking tens of minutes.  Despite this, Mr Pindar says several large retailers have been experimenting with the cryptocurrency, but may choose ""to adopt bitcoin for online purchases only, where time to process a payment is less important."" The currency's volatility is an issue - the value of one bitcoin topped $3,000 in June, before crashing to below $1,900 in July - and transactions are taking longer and longer to process.  This is largely to do with the rules governing how Bitcoin works, and there is currently a big row over how the issue should be resolved. It could be that blockchain proves to be more important to the art world than its flashier Bitcoin offspring."
market volatility,Covid worries help Bitcoin to three-year high,2024-09-15,2020-11-18,By Justin Harper,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54982604,"Bitcoin, the world's best-known cryptocurrency, has jumped above $17,000 (£12,800) to hit a three-year high. The digital currency has suffered plenty of wild price swings since it was launched in 2009. But investors have been flocking to cryptocurrencies during the pandemic-driven volatility on global stock markets. However, experts have cautioned about viewing them as a ""safe haven"". On Wednesday, Bitcoin had climbed more than 7% to $17,891, its highest level since December 2017. Some analysts said the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged investors to reassess the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But there are still concerns about the fraudulent trading in cryptocurrencies following a succession of high-profile hacks. During times of volatility, investors tend to move their money out of shares and into what are considered safer havens, like cash and gold. Some feel cryptocurrencies are now being viewed as a shelter from stock market volatility. ""Covid-19 has disrupted the traditional safe-haven trade and gold's inability to outperform. Periods of extreme risk aversion have forced many traders to diversify into Bitcoin,"" said Edward Moya, at trading firm Oanda. One attraction of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is capped at 21 million. Some feel this scarcity provides an innate value and shields Bitcoin from inflation, which is becoming a worry. But Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, warned about jumping into Bitcoin. ""Its huge volatility hardly makes it a safe haven as a store of value. I have far more confidence in the $50 note in my wallet retaining its value over time than Bitcoin, which seems to bounce around like a yo-yo."" Last month, PayPal announced that its customers will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts, allowing customers to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said. Next year, PayPal plans to allow cryptocurrency to be used as a funding source. But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility. ""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes.""   Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO).  ""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver. ""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" China is one such country working towards launching its own government-backed digital currency - known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). One trader, Jon Son, told the BBC: ""I think more people are beginning to buy Bitcoin first not to miss the rise and then research into what exactly Bitcoin is."""
market volatility,Firmus raises gas price by further 38% in NI towns,2024-09-15,2021-11-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59233950,"Firmus Energy is putting gas prices up by 38% from 3 December across its Ten Towns network area. The company said rising global energy costs had ""forced"" its hand to put prices up for the third time this year. Firmus gas prices increased by 35% in October and by 18% earlier in the year. The move will affect about 55,000 customers in the Ten Towns area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry. The Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about £268 a year or £255 a year for those with a prepayment meter. Firmus customers in Greater Belfast and in the Gas to the West network area will not be affected by the tariff change. Firmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said: ""This is a not a Firmus issue but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. ""We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable."" Firmus said it would be introducing a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect. Wholesale costs make up 50% of customers' gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect locally. Rising gas prices this year come in stark contrast to last year's low prices, which were described by one economist at the time as a ""consumer sweet-spot"". The Utility Regulator has warned that high prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year. Some analysts have warned the volatility could last for between 18 to 36 months while others have suggested that the short answer is: we don't really know. One thing most are agreed on is that while prices will come down they aren't likely to fall by as much as they have risen. There are only two gas suppliers in Northern Ireland, which is why the Utility Regulator has to agree any price increase before it is passed on to customers. The regulator caps suppliers' profits at 2%. Natasha Toman is a mum of four in Craigavon, County Armagh, and is a Firmus customer worried about what the price rise will mean for her. ""This is two price rises in such a short space of time - it's going to be a tough winter,"" she said. ""I topped my card up with the maximum amount, which is £49, before 1 October so I would be getting it at the cheaper rate and now it is going up again. ""We don't have the luxury to change suppliers - there is only Firmus in this area. ""So you just have to get on with it and make the money stretch but it's tough going and it's going to be cutting in other areas as your home needs to be warm, particularly with four young children."" The Utility Regulator has capped the amount of profit gas providers can make at about 2%. But it has no control over wholesale energy costs, which is one of the key reasons for the price rises. So although a company's profit is capped that doesn't stop prices going up as the cost of commodities increases. The actual cost of the energy makes up about half of our bills and the rest goes to the companies that manage the pipes and to cover other expenses. So if the price of energy goes up the amount companies have to charge to make that 2% profit also increases. Read more: Why are energy bills going up? Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people, said there was a ""real growing fear"" among elderly people about the increasing cost of household bills. More than 50,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland are living in poverty, he said. ""What really concerns me is the perfect storm our older people are facing with higher energy bills and on top of that they have less opportunities to get out of the house because there are a lot less social activities since Covid hit,"" said the commissioner. ""That's how many of them actually managed their energy bills in the past - it was about getting out of the house so they didn't have to put the heat on. ""We're now at a stage where people have to spend much more time at home and are faced with huge bills coming down the line."" Ulster Unionist assembly member Andy Allen said the Stormont executive had to intervene ""swiftly and robustly"" to deal with the winter cost-of-living crisis. This month he put a motion before the assembly asking members to create a winter energy emergency fund - it was passed unanimously. ""We welcome the confirmation from the minister for communities that she will be bidding for the entirety of the £13.7m derived from UK Vulnerable Households fund in order to try and bring forward a support package,"" Mr Allen told BBC News NI. ""We need to see this in days, weeks - not months, not after Christmas. People on the ground need this now."" He said that charities were already having to support people in topping up gas and electric meters. The Utility Regulator, which regulates the suppliers in the market, had warned that substantial rises in the price of gas were coming. Its chief executive John French said: ""Unfortunately over the last six months we have seen unparalleled increases in the cost of wholesale energy at a global level. ""If wholesale prices begin to reduce our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible."" Sinn Féin MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the UK government should remove VAT on energy bills, cutting the costs by 5%. Democratic Unionist Party MP Carla Lockhart said anyone who was struggling with their bills should check whether they were eligible for the universal credit benefit."
market volatility,Pay squeeze bites but unemployment dips,2024-09-15,2017-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41996505,"Wages continue to lag behind the cost of living in the UK, while unemployment remains at a 42-year low. Workers' earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 2.2% in the three months to September compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. But they fell 0.5% in real terms when accounting for inflation, marking seven months of negative pay growth. The number of jobless - people not in work but seeking a job - fell 59,000 to 1.42 million during the period. With inflation at a five-and-a-half-year high of 3% in October, pay is failing to keep up with higher prices. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.3% - its lowest rate since 1975 - and down from 4.8% a year earlier. Minister for Employment Damian Hinds said the unemployment figures showed the ""strength of the economy"". ""A near-record number of people are now in work,"" he said. ""Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet."" At the same time, the number of people in work dropped to 32 million, down 14,000 from the last quarter, according to ONS data. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said the figures were further evidence of ""Tory economic failure"".  She said: ""Both employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010."" Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said employment had declined after two years of ""almost uninterrupted growth"", but was still higher than last year. The last time there was a bigger fall in employment was in April to June 2015, when the number of people in work dropped by 45,000, according to the ONS. The simultaneous drop in the number of workers and unemployed people is due to the rise in people who are classed as ""economically inactive"" - those not working and not seeking or available to work. This includes people studying, retirees, the long-term sick, or those looking after family, and rose by 117,000 to 8.8 million over the quarter.  Mr Hughes said: ""There was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job - so-called economically inactive people."" Separate ONS data showed a bright spot for productivity, which increased by 0.9% in the latest three months - the strongest growth rate for six years. But this follows a prolonged period of weak productivity since the financial crisis. By BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed: Any port in a storm, but it is sensible to put today's leap in productivity in context. After six months of negative figures (-0.5% January to March, -0.1% April to June), today's +0.9% jump in productivity is undoubtedly better news. But it would need at least two more quarters of similarly positive numbers to discern whether this is just normal quarter-by-quarter volatility or the first signs that the productivity slump might be starting to turn. The ONS measures productivity by dividing the number of hours worked by what is called Gross Value Added, the value of goods and services produced by the UK economy. It has leapt this quarter because working hours have fallen slightly and economic growth is higher. Whether we are actually producing more per hour worked - the key to wealth creation and better wages - will only become clear over the next six months. ONS head of productivity Philip Wales said: ""The medium-term picture continues to be one of productivity growing - but at a much slower rate than seen before the financial crisis."" The CBI's head of employment, Matthew Percival, thought the rise in productivity was ""encouraging"". He said: ""Businesses will be looking for the chancellor to cement progress in next week's Budget and maintain flexibility in the labour market, which remains a mainstay of the UK economy."" By BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom: How can unemployment and the number of people in work drop at the same time?  The unemployment rate is a measure of those people who want to work - and cannot - but the employment rate is a measure of everyone in work.  So you could have a large number of people retiring and only some of them being replaced by unemployed people who are recruited to do their jobs.  Employment will fall, and so will unemployment.  In today's figures, the fall in employment seems to be concentrated amongst the 18-24 year olds, suggesting that part of the reason is that they are returning to education, although the figures are supposed to take such seasonal factors into account.

market volatility,What next in Scotland's housing market?,2024-09-15,2022-10-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63320045,"As soaring price inflation, the prospect of recession and of a prolonged European war have closed in on the economy, the housing market appears to have bounced along merrily, as if oblivious. It's not as if they're linked to the price of oil, gas or food, which have driven inflation to 10.1% in the year to August.  The latest house price index, published on Wednesday, shows the average price paid for a Scottish home in August was 9.7% up on the same month last year.  That's down from the 11% rise in the year to July, and down from the 15.1% published a year ago. The English market has seen more volatility in price inflation, partly through the distorting effect of transaction tax holidays - used by the Treasury to stimulate the market as the country came out of recession. Prices in the year to August in England were up 14.3% - down from July's inflation rate of 16.8% - with the average price reaching £315,000. That figure is pulled up by London and the south-east, which have seen more subdued increases in recent years. Price inflation across the UK, with Wales also seeing some lively numbers, means that the average home has gained £36,000 in value over the past year - ahead of average pre-tax full-time earnings. Much of this has to do with the pandemic. The enforced shutdown of the market for parts of 2020 was followed by a burst of pent-up demand, driven by people who had realised during lockdown that they could do with more space. Many saved quite a lot during the pandemic, which they could put into a house purchase. Many also found they could live and work further from the office. So the price of a des res detached home with a bit of space in the country, especially near the coast, has risen fastest of all. The latest figures from Registers of Scotland show the price of a detached home is up by 13% to £349,000 on average, while flats were up 6.7% to £134,000. Aberdeen registered barely any increase, while other bigger cities were close to the national average. The council areas with the biggest increases were Argyll, Highland and the islands. East Lothian and the Borders have been hot spots for rising prices recently, but both saw more modest price increases in these latest figures.  There's a health warning with these figures, though, as they can be skewed by small numbers of transactions, and August can be a quiet month. The big driver of home price inflation in recent years has been the mismatch of supply and demand. Estate agents and surveyors note that there aren't enough homes coming on to the market while demand has remained higher.  When they are put up for sale, the blind bidding system usually used in Scotland is competitive.  To illustrate the point, I'll declare a personal interest: I recently sold my terraced house in Glasgow. There were 13 bidders, and it went for more than 30% above the home report valuation. That, incidentally, puzzles me as to the point or the meaning of a home report valuation. Last year saw the highest number of transactions since 2007, partly to catch up on the lower number in the first year of the pandemic. Registers of Scotland tells us that transaction numbers were down by more than a fifth in the year to June. And according to a specialist in the economics of the housing market, John Boyle at Rettie estate agents, that is at least as important a number to watch if we are to understand the market.  His preferred indicator of market health is the number of sales multiplied by the average price, and since the financial crash of 2008, that has been much lower than it was. Looking ahead, Mr Boyle is one of the market watchers who expects to see the broader economy closing in on house price inflation and dampening it, though not necessarily by driving prices down. That only happens where people are forced to sell - for instance due to divorce or a need to move home for work. What we've seen in recent years is that those who have to move, but cannot sell at the price they want, will often rent out and become tenants elsewhere.   And there's repossession due to mortgage default, which was a feature of past recessions. That is less likely now because affordability checks ahead of agreeing to lend have been much more stringent since 2008. Banks, or at least their regulator, are wary of the destabilising effect it can have on the economy. If homes don't have to be sold, that squeezes supply even further, and holds up prices. Mr Boyle says the mid-to-upper level market has continued to fare quite well, depending on cash buyers and those on secure, higher salaries.  Cash buyers have grown as a share of the market, to around a third. They have an advantage in bidding contests over those who have yet to secure a mortgage or have other houses to sell first. The lower-to-middle market is more exposed and dependent on mortgages. With monthly payments at exceptionally low levels since 2009, home prices adjusted upwards to affordability based on those low mortgage costs.  But as they rise - which they were bound to do eventually, but with the recent budget bùrach in Downing Street turbocharging them - they are making it more difficult to make that second or third step up.  The Registers of Scotland figures are accurate about transactions that have to be registered with that office, but they are backward looking. Deals closed in August were typically struck in spring, before it became clear that the economy was heading downhill. More up-to-date assessments of the market come from Halifax, part of the same group as Bank of Scotland. It says UK prices in the year to August were up 9.9% with inflation on a falling trend. Scotland's prices rose, but by 8.5%, falling from 9.3% inflation over the year. Rightmove, which has a strong grip on the property advertising market, reported that Scotland has seen 6.6% growth in prices in the past year, and it is taking an average 24 days to secure a sale. The UK increase for Rightmove is 7.8% and falling. It notes the recent political and interest rate turmoil has hit the first-time buyer market. Its report this week showed a drop in the number of such people engaged with buying, while those who have a mortgage offer are rushing to complete the purchase before interest rates rise further. The monthly market review by RICS, the surveyors organisation, is the best measure of what lies ahead. It reported buyer enquiries in Scotland have recently fallen for third consecutive month. While limited supply is still supporting a modest price rise, this looks set to end as the pace of house price inflation slows. Looking to the remaining weeks of this year, price and sales expectations are now slightly negative. That does not tell you how much prices or sales might fall - only that the number of upbeat surveyors is smaller than the downbeat ones. If this is a turning point in the market, what is a potential buyer to do? Wait to see if prices fall, or jump into the market in case mortgage costs rise further?  There's no simple answer. It depends on circumstances, of where you are, how long you can stay there, where you want to be, and how you intend to finance it."
market volatility,'I lost millions through cryptocurrency trading addiction',2024-09-15,2021-05-28,By Jonathan Peters,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57268024,"Jake lost millions of pounds trading cryptocurrencies. He does not want his identity known because he is still in treatment at one of the only hospitals in the UK that treats people who are obsessed with gambling on the value of the virtual currency. Jake first bought Bitcoin - the most popular cryptocurrency - in 2015, but it was not until a big win a few years later that his trading spiralled out of control.  ""I can pinpoint the exact moment it became a problem,"" he said. ""I had been eroding the sum I put aside, but I entered a trade, and I was willing to risk that last amount I had. ""I ended up making back pretty much everything I lost in a single trade. The feeling was one of absolute euphoria."" Jake told BBC Scotland's The Nine that this high, coupled with difficulties in his marriage and personal life, quickly led to an addictive cycle. His job at that time meant he was in charge of millions of pounds. He said that he soon took to trading money that was not his in the hope of repeating his first success.  He said: ""The first time I took it, I lost it all in about 20 minutes one night. The market moved very rapidly and I liquidated everything. ""It was about 2am. I went back to bed and had to lie down next to my wife. She had no idea what I had been up to."" Jake had been facing criminal charges for embezzlement but was able to pay back £1.5m to his employer with the help of his family and is now in treatment for his addiction. Cryptocurrencies are digital money that is not issued by a bank. You can trade and invest these currencies like any other - and there are virtually no barriers to entry. The absence of regulation means the market can go up incredibly fast.  During the lockdown, the total value of all cryptocurrencies increased from about £175bn to more than £1.75tn.  Figures from the UK's financial watchdog show that hundreds of thousands of people in the UK hold these digital currencies.  But since the start of May, the market reached its highest-ever level and lost more than £1tn just a few weeks later.  With something this volatile, when you win, you win big. When you lose, you hit rock bottom.  According to experts, cryptocurrency trading addicts show the same kind of behavioural addictions as problem gamblers. There are no figures for the number of people addicted to cryptocurrency trading but Tony Marini, the lead counsellor at the cryptocurrency addiction clinic at Castle Craig hospital in Peebles, said they are seeing more and more people in Scotland. ""This is the crack cocaine of gambling because it is so fast,"" he said. ""It's 24/7. It's on your phone, your laptop, it's in your bedroom."" The clinic has treated more than 100 people for cryptocurrency addictions in the past few years. It is the combination of constant availability and extreme volatility that leads people to his door, Mr Marini said.  ""There are so many people out there that are trading cryptocurrency that are making money,"" he said. ""And they're telling everyone that they're making money. We are not hearing from the people that are losing money."" It is not just the market that can cause problems. The technology that enables cryptocurrencies is notoriously complicated, and if you are not careful, you could easily find yourself investing in a scam. When Jen McAdam's father died a few years ago, she was still working in IT.  She heard about what she thought was a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity, which turned out to be a scam. ""My friends and family invested,"" she said. ""Collectively, our total loss so far has been over 250,000 euros (£215,000).  ""You carry horrendous guilt, shame, regret. You're just in a place of devastation."" Jen wants people to know the risks of investing in these assets, and warns those who do not understand the technology to stay away. ""If you want to invest, and you don't have any knowledge, you're gambling,"" she said. ""You are taking a very high risk."" For some, the investment has paid off. Cameron has seen an amazing turnaround in his fortunes. As a freelance musician, opportunities have been few and far between this past year. He can sum up how lockdown affected him in one word. ""Devastating,"" he said.  ""Gigs came to an end, schools closed, all my sources of income completely vanished,"" Cameron said.  When lockdown hit in March last year, he saw the market for cryptocurrencies was growing, and he decided to invest.  One year on, and in an otherwise difficult economy, he now has things to be cheerful about.  He said: ""It's been a really great year of these assets increasing in value to the point where, at least for the short-term, I'm not going to have any financial worries. ""If I could have told myself last year that I'd have this sort of reserve, I don't know what I'd think. ""It's been such a relief."""
market volatility,Alderney keeps electricity costs below price cap,2024-09-15,2022-05-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4n23de6r6go,"The price of electricity in Alderney remains below the 50p price cap, utility bosses  have confirmed. Alderney Electricity Ltd (AEL) said although the cost of fuel had increased, it would keep the price of a unit of electricity below the 50p per unit price cap for islanders. AEL raised the price of fuel and electricity in May 2022, but introduced an electricity fuel cost relief for customers for three months from 1 May.  Managing director James Lancaster said its latest shipment had ""risen significantly"". He said: “As anticipated, the cost of fuel received in the latest shipment has risen significantly as a result of recent world events and the volatility of the global fuels market. ""The fuel cost component is now 24.46p, which would have raised the price of a unit of electricity on the A tariff above the 50p price cap.  ""As AEL has brought in a subsidy of 4.35p per unit to be applied across all tariffs, this will bring electricity prices back in line with the cap."" Bills due from the end of May 2022 would receive subsidies, the company said. The price cap of 50p per unit for electricity was set in 2008"

The rise affects customers on a variable rate tariff and is expected to increase the average bill by about £100 a year. The company is the latest energy provider to announce price hikes.  On Wednesday, Firmus energy announced a 35% increase on gas tariffs in the Ten Towns Network, to take effect from the same date. SSE Airtricity customers will also see a price rise from October. The Consumer Council said it was the second increase by Click Energy this month.  A 9% price rise came into effect on 1 September.   Raymond Gormley, Consumer Council head of energy policy, said the news would ""adversely impact all Click Energy customers already experiencing financial pressures on their household budget especially considering it is the second increase by the supplier in one month"". ""Any consumers who are experiencing financial difficulty and are struggling with their energy bills should contact Click Energy to find out how they can help during this time.

""Click Energy have stated that there will be no exit fee applied to customers who switch supplier before 30 September 202,"" he said.  A spokesperson for Click Energy said the wholesale energy market was experiencing ""unprecedented volatility with prices at all-time record highs for extended periods of time"".   ""This unparalleled environment means that energy suppliers have to make difficult decisions which unfortunately negatively impact consumers."""
market volatility,Trump calls for end to quarterly reporting,2024-09-15,2018-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45226228,"Donald Trump has called for US companies to issue financial reports just twice a year rather than four times. The US President said he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider altering rules requiring firms to report every quarter. The move would improve ""flexibility and save money"", Mr Trump said. Some analysts have criticised the idea, which they say would ""keep investors in the dark for longer"". Mr Trump tweeted: ""In speaking with some of the world's top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the US. 'Stop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system,' said one"", he tweeted. President Trump said he had ""asked the SEC to study"" such a move. Analysts said the idea of having companies report less frequently was not new, with some suggesting it could make markets less transparent and more volatile when financial data is released after such a long period. ""If you reduce transparency, including the frequency of reporting, it is thus likely to increase uncertainty, which is the enemy of investors,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Sterling Capital Management. Stan Shipley at Evercore ISI said: ""[If] you give investors less information on what's going on, there's a risk of injecting volatility in your stock price because investors are not guided the right way.  ""You're more likely to surprise investors when you're reporting just twice a year instead of quarterly.""  However, other analysts said reducing the frequency of financial reporting to twice a year could potentially reduce ""short-termism"" in listed companies' strategies. ""The difficulty in making better long-term decisions away from a quarterly reporting cycle certainly stands out as being beneficial,"" said Art Hogan at investment bank B. Riley FBR. Randy Frederick at Charles Schwab argued that such a major change for both companies and traders would be ""like trying to turn around the Queen Mary in a swimming pool"". ""This is not something he can change with an executive order,"" he added. The SEC requires listed US companies to issue quarterly and annual financial reports to keep investors informed about their financial position.  The Trump administration wants to cut red tape that it says is responsible for a 50% drop in companies coming to market over the past two decades, including relaxing some of the disclosure and compliance requirements for listed companies and those looking to go public.  In a report published by the US Treasury last year, the administration outlined policies it hoped would revitalise listings - but did not go as far as suggesting quarterly reporting requirements be scrapped. The SEC was not immediately available for comment."
market volatility,Public consultation on post-Brexit farming,2024-09-15,2018-08-01,By Conor Macauley,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45030489,"Plans for the future of farming in Northern Ireland after Brexit have gone out to public consultation.  They include measures to support farms and improve the environment.  The public has until 10 October to give their views.  The current system of EU subsidy payments will no longer apply after 2019. A decision on the shape of the final policy will not be taken until devolved government returns.  It is envisaged that even under domestic arrangements there will be little change until 2022, when a new NI specific system could be introduced.  It is hoped it can improve farmers' productivity, protect their incomes from external shocks like extreme weather or market volatility and encourage them to work in a way which is more environmentally sustainable.  Many farmers rely heavily on support payments for the bulk of their income.  The Ulster Farmers' Union welcomed the consultation but said it was frustrated it had taken so long ""to get the document onto the table"". ""We have to make sure that Brexit is an opportunity for farmers here,"" said president Ivor Ferguson. ""This is an opportunity to create a better system, and it is essential we take this chance to get it right."" The policy paper says such payments can help farms remain viable but can also mask inefficiency.  In coming years it suggests a farm payment which is lower than that currently received and asks for views on the appropriate level.  It also suggests differentiated payments depending on the condition and quality of the land farmed.  Measures could be considered to stop larger farms being overcompensated and prevent money going to non-commercial holdings.  A range of other measures such as income insurance and a deposit scheme, which farmers could save to in good years and draw cash from in bad years, are also suggested.  The new farm policy would encourage farmers to help address significant environmental challenges linked to the industry including water pollution and ammonia emissions which impact biodiversity and sensitive sites.  It says changes in farming practices could deliver ""major gains"" which should be the focus of new proposals.  The policy proposal states farmers should be financially rewarded for providing ""public goods"" like improved biodiversity and asked to help design schemes to do this on a landscape-wide level.  Targets include increases in important habitats and species at favourable status; improved soil and water quality; reduced ammonia emissions and a continuing fall in the carbon intensity of food production.  The paper does not go into detail about what proportion of farm income might be drawn from such schemes.  The policy document also focuses on plans to drive innovation and encourage farmers to share knowledge and get qualifications and training.  There are also proposals to encourage investment and attract young farmers into the industry.  It includes suggestions on a move away from the system of short-term land leasing called conacre to a more efficient system of long term rental. "
market volatility,Building material costs affect public projects,2024-09-15,2021-08-03,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58070738,"Northern Ireland construction companies facing big rises in the cost of building materials could be allowed to increase the prices of previously agreed public sector contracts. Building firms are dealing with surging global prices for products like timber. The Stormont Executive has agreed guidance for government departments dealing with contractors. It includes the possibility of agreeing cost increases or later completion dates.  Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the impact of the pandemic on supply chains has ""had a huge impact on the availability of construction materials with global demand, product shortages and delivery delays leading to market volatility and increased prices"". ""Government contractors are experiencing escalating costs and delays in getting materials which they could not have foreseen when they tendered for government work."" The executive has agreed a ""procurement advisory note"".  It says that where a contractor can ""provide compelling evidence on an open book basis"" that it has experienced a significant delay in the supply of a product that impacts on a completion date then the department and contractor should work together ""in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation"" to identify alternative materials or agree a change to the completion date. On prices, it says it is reasonable to expect contractors to absorb price fluctuations ""within moderate tolerances"".  However it acknowledges that in the current environment contractors may be able to show they are facing cost increases that are higher than that ""which a diligent contractor could reasonably have anticipated"".  In that situation the department should consider adjusting the price of the job. The note emphasises that firms will have to provide ""full transparency"" on how they originally priced a job and how material costs have changed. Mr Murphy said: ""I am pleased the executive has agreed my proposals to make provision to manage delays in supplies and to include mechanisms in existing and new contracts to make allowances for inflationary prices."" The move has been welcomed by the construction industry which has been warning that some firms were facing difficulties in completing contracts at previously agreed prices. Mark Spence, managing director of the Construction Employers Federation, said: ""We welcome this vital lifeline for local contractors who for many months have been shouldering the escalating burden of unforeseen global price increases and material shortages whilst ensuring public works continue to be delivered."" The measures will be reviewed at the end of September."
market volatility,SSE gas and electricity prices to rise again in NI,2024-09-15,2022-08-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62688553,"The energy company SSE Airtricity is putting up its gas and electricity prices in Northern Ireland again. Gas prices will rise by 28.3% from 1 October and electricity prices will go up by 35.4% from the same date. It comes after Ofgem announced the energy price cap in Great Britain will rise to £3,549 a year from October. However, some consumers in NI will be the equivalent of £1,000 a year better off than customers in the rest of UK, the region's energy regulator has said. The chief executive of the Utility Regulator, John French, has calculated that the equivalent combined gas and electricity customers in Northern Ireland will pay £2,393 a year from October. ""I fully recognise that this differential between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is cold-comfort to those who are struggling here,"" he added. Peter McClenaghan, from the Consumer Council, said Northern Ireland was ""facing into a very serious crisis this winter"" and he is angry and fearful on behalf of consumers. The Consumer Council provides advice to consumers and Mr McClenaghan said that ""already many of our households are at the brink"". ""This announcement means consumers in Belfast face combined annual gas and electricity bills in excess of £2,500 a year, with further price increases to come,"" he said. Other companies will also be putting up their prices as they are buying energy in the same wholesale markets as SSE Airtricity. Those wholesale markets are currently a horror show, suggesting that energy prices will continue rising steeply into the early months of next year. SSE Airtricity is Northern Ireland's largest household gas supplier with about 188,000 customers. Those customers have already seen the price they pay more than double since the spring of last year. The Utility Regulator says the latest increase in the price of gas - the fifth since April 2021 - will be equivalent to another £351 a year. Mr French said the wholesale gas market was ""[continuing] to surge"". ""[It] is producing prices 16 times higher than normal historic rates,"" he said. ""We will continue to do everything in our control to support consumers at this very difficult time."" The announcement by SSE Airtricity comes on the day Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy confirmed that the UK government would deliver an energy bill discount of £400 to help households in Northern Ireland that are struggling with the increasing cost of living. But he said there was no guarantee that Northern Ireland households would receive the discount in October, when those in the rest of the UK are due to get it. Donna Dugan, from Carrowdore, County Down, works full-time and cares for her mother Anne, 86, who has vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. She says the price of home heating oil has ""gone up a lot"". ""We got an oil fill up just before the summer period - we normally pay a certain amount every month - and unfortunately this time we were £400 short, which is quite extraordinary for us. ""Over the summer, we have had the heating off completely and we've never had to do that before."" They have also reduced the number of baths Anne has to reduce costs, and she takes more showers instead. Donna says the £400 energy bill discount would make a ""huge difference"". She says it is imperative that ""something is done really urgently"" to tackle the issue. ""I worry that if mummy's situation deteriorates, the impact that will have on my ability to work.  ""I need to work, it's not a choice for me to have reduced hours because we couldn't financially manage. I need to work full-time."" Craig Harrison, of Carers NI, said ""carers are on their knees, financially"".  ""We had the worst rate of carer poverty of anywhere in the UK even before the cost of living crisis began to bite,"" he added. ""Carers' financial situation on all fronts has just deteriorated more and more since then."" He said day-to-day, carers are going hungry, because they cannot afford to buy food. Mr Harrison said they were missing mortgage payments, and borrowing money from friends and family to get by.  ""I'm even aware of female carers having to make their own sanitary products."" SSE Airtricity is also the second largest supplier of household electricity, with about 168,000 customers. They will see their bills rise by the equivalent of another £330 a year. SSE Airtricity managing director Klair Neenan said: ""It was hoped market volatility would ease but the global energy crisis continues to impact gas and electricity costs for all energy suppliers. ""We are acutely aware of the impact this has for households and are working hard to help where we can."" The company said any customer who was concerned or having difficulty with their energy costs should ""please contact us and we will work with you to find a solution together"". Two-thirds of homes in Northern Ireland use oil for their heating. The Consumer Council tracks the price of home-heating oil and its data suggests that prices fell during July, roughly in line with the price of Brent crude oil. But prices have started to increase again in the past two weeks. The Northern Ireland energy market is very different from the rest of the UK for a variety of historical reasons. The electricity market was liberalised much later than the rest of the UK; the former state-owned incumbent still has half the domestic market and there are only a handful of suppliers. The gas network is a relatively recent development and there are still regulated monopoly suppliers in some areas. That means the market is regulated differently from the rest of the UK, for example without the price cap mechanism. Mr French believes that Northern Ireland's simpler market is part of the reason for the lower prices in Northern Ireland. He told BBC News NI: ""We price regulate one company at a time, so we are regulating SEE Airtricity at the moment, that was the announcement today. ""What they are doing in GB in terms of the price cap is looking at the 70 odd companies and try to give an announcement that covers the needs of those 70 companies."" He said that while the GB price cap is forecast to go towards £5,000 in January at the moment he does not see that in the current market for Northern Ireland. It is difficult to give an overall energy cost comparison between Northern Ireland and GB because Northern Ireland is still heavily reliant on heating oil for home heating."
market volatility,House of Fraser slumps to £44m loss,2024-09-15,2018-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44068513,"Department store group House of Fraser lost almost £44m in 2017 as sales fell.  The department store's potential new Chinese owner, C.Banner, said the loss of £43.9m reversed a pre-tax profit of £1.5m for the previous year, while sales fell 6.3% to £787.8m.  It blamed Brexit, terror attacks and online for damaging the performance of the group, which owns 59 UK stores.      The Chinese group has agreed to take a 51% stake in House of Fraser if the chain pushes through a turnaround plan.  The extent of the chain's financial problems were revealed in a document submitted by C.Banner to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, announcing its proposal to acquire the stake in House of Fraser.  It pointed out that the annual loss figure for the House of Fraser group included the start-up and operating costs of House of Fraser China, but excluded the licence fee payable from the Chinese business to House of Fraser UK for the use of the name in that market. Separate figures for the UK business have yet to be reported.  However, the document said: ""The Brexit referendum and the UK's resultant decision to leave the European Union and the terrorist attack in London, combined with a rapidly evolving retail market, produced a period of uncertainty and volatility that resulted in a difficult trading environment for the whole retail industry in the UK.""   However, C.Banner said House of Fraser would become ""more stable"" after completing its restructuring plan and ""take advantage of its well-known brand to capture growth potential"". Earlier this month, C.Banner said it would take a controlling stake in the retailer from another Chinese firm, Nanjing Cenbest, but only if House of Fraser agreed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with its creditors.  The chain expects to make a formal CVA proposal next month, with a full restructuring in place by early 2019. Store closures are planned and the chain wants to renegotiate rents on others.  A CVA is designed to help a struggling company to pay back a proportion of its debts over time. It involves a strict repayment scheme overseen by an insolvency practitioner and must be approved by at least three quarters of the firm's creditors. "
market volatility,SSE Airtricity natural gas prices to rise by 39%,2024-09-15,2022-03-04,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60620138,"SSE Airtricity will increase its natural gas prices for households and businesses by 39% from April.  It will add about £244 onto the typical household bill, which the Consumer Council says is the biggest rise in gas prices in their network since May 2011. The move will affect about 186,000 gas customers throughout Northern Ireland. SSE Airtricity said the continued pressure on global energy markets has had a significant impact on energy suppliers' ability to keep prices down. Their tariffs are independently scrutinised and approved by the Utility Regulator in consultation with the Consumer Council and the Department for the Economy. Andrew Greer, SSE Airtricity general manager, said: ""We understand this news will be unwelcome, if not unexpected, to our customers, given the extensive media focus on wholesale markets over the last six months. ""The cost of purchasing natural gas on the wholesale market has reached record highs this winter and regrettably, a proportion of this must be reflected in our prices,"" he added. ""In March 2021 gas cost around 50 pence per therm, today that cost is around £2 per therm after hitting as high as £4.50 per therm late last year."" Raymond Gormley of the Consumer Council said the company had no option but to increase costs.   He also said the invasion of Ukraine will push costs up. ""Energy prices could be volatile for a number of weeks and will remain high for the foreseeable future,"" he added. ""This situation shows the importance of the Department for the Economy's energy strategy that aims to tackle affordability in the long term and move us away from our dependence on fossil fuels."" John French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said the conflict in Ukraine has significantly exacerbated the volatility and price movements within the market. ""The cost of wholesale gas has increased significantly over the last seven months largely due to Russia reducing the supply of natural gas into Europe,"" he said. ""However, today's announcement does not take into account the further upward wholesale price pressures we have seen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  ""Regrettably, it is highly likely that a further increase to tariffs will be needed at some point."""

""Like anything from Comme Des Garcons. I got a jacket last time I was there for 40% less than I would have paid here,"" he says.  Before June last year, when the UK voted to leave the EU, he rarely went shopping on his regular work trips to the UK.  ""The littlest things from a pint at the pub to a short Uber ride were murder on my bank account because of the exchange rate.""  Now that some brands are significantly cheaper, he spends about $350 (£274; 310 euros) each time he comes, but thinks the favourable exchange rate means he saves around $100. ""It's easier for me to splurge and sometimes I do it too much for my own good,"" he confesses. Mr DeLeon isn't the only one indulging.  Just over a year on from the EU referendum, the pound is still around 16% lower against the dollar. The weakness has lured over a flock of international tourists hungry for high-end brands at relatively bargain prices.  Payments firm WorldPay says non-UK consumers' card spending at department stores rose by a fifth in the first three months of the year, while spending on electrical goods rose 22.7%.  US shoppers like Mr DeLeon have been amongst the biggest spenders, splashing out an extra 21.5% on their cards during the same period, it said. ""The extreme currency fluctuations encourages shoppers to buy more,"" says Honor Strachan, principal retail analyst at GlobalData.  ""They're getting more for their money."" But how do companies manage this kind of discrepancy; with precisely the same product priced significantly differently depending on where in the world it is bought? After all a boom in revenues in one market, can seriously dent demand in the markets international shoppers are coming from.  Many of the world's most famous brands — such as Burberry and Apple — simply raised their UK prices to try and make sure what they sold cost broadly the same across their international markets. But luxury footwear brand Crockett & Jones, which has 12 stores worldwide across locations including London, Paris and New York as well as global wholesale partners, says it has deliberately left prices unchanged.  ""The last thing we want to do is abuse our customer confidence and raise prices in the UK. ""We certainly don't increase our prices at a whim to take advantage of said currency fluctuations,"" says James Fox, export sales director at the firm.  Mr Fox believes that in the long term it's best to keep pricing simple. ""We strive to have a level playing field as and where we can.  ""We offer sterling, euro and dollar price lists, which gives our customers piece of mind that they are buying in their own currency at a level price to the potential competitors within their market."" He says generally any discrepancies tend to average out across currencies, and that re-pricing is only possible ""once or twice a year"" due to the upheaval it causes for the business overall. So is he concerned that the firm could be losing out financially? ""We are fortunate to be in a position that we have a few very strong 'Brexit proof' markets which underpin the company when the UK is trying its best to screw up international trade,"" says Mr Fox. By selling both through its own stores and through wholesalers the firm's risk is already spread out, he adds.  Crockett & Jones is not the only retailer which has kept prices steady.  Ray Clacher, executive vice-president at Trinity - owner of premium brands Gieves & Hawkes, Kent & Curwen and Cerruti 1881 - says non-EU tourists using either the US dollar or a currency that trades in line with the dollar, have driven up sales at its London stores. Nonetheless, these sales are still just a small percentage of Trinity's total revenue. ""We certainly have not adjusted our retail prices to reflect the influx of tourism, in fact, quite the opposite as we want to encourage more UK [sales],"" he says. However, he admits this strategy could change if costs continue to rise.  ""If inflation continues to rise and sterling continues to struggle against the euro and dollar, we will have no choice but to pass on the cost to our customers - but not at present,"" says Mr Clacher.

But it is also important not to be too greedy. Many US retailers that have come to the UK have simply swapped their dollar signs on their US price tags for pounds - betting that British consumers will be willing to pay a premium for their goods. Banana Republic is one such example. After eight years in the UK, it announced last year it would close all eight of its stores. The decision followed six consecutive quarters of falling sales.  ""They thought that because they were a big brand, they could demand higher prices. But UK consumers ""are savvier than that,"" says Ms Strachan. Yet for retailers doing a straight currency conversion from their local currency to the country where they are selling their goods also doesn't necessarily work.  ""Asos made a big thing about launching local websites with a straight currency conversion and it didn't work - local pricing didn't fit in line with competitors.  ""Brands need to look at who else is operating in that space, the wealth of consumers there, and what they're willing to pay, and then price accordingly using localised pricing structures,"" says Ms Strachan. Many firms, particularly larger brands such as Hermes also use currency hedging to protect themselves. This involves working with a bank to buy currency at the current rate to protect themselves against adverse future volatility. In the end, though Ms Strachan says a company's ability to cope with currency volatility comes down to how much people want to buy what they sell. ""If they still want it customers will buy it,"" she says."
market volatility,Three reasons why markets are hitting record highs,2024-09-15,2018-01-05,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42579028,"Not too hot, not too cold - but just right. Goldilocks' requirements for the perfect bowl of porridge are similar to the requirements of an attractive economy. Not too hot - growth busting out the lights raising fears about sustainability and rampant inflation. And not too cold - economic slowdowns and recessions pulling down business profitability and weighing on equity valuations. Market investors certainly sense that 2018 will see a continuation of a global ""Goldilocks economy"". Why? Firstly, there is the gentle recovery in economic growth and increasing demand for companies products across the major drivers of the world economy - Japan and the Asian emerging markets; the Eurozone and, most importantly, America. Secondly, there is the continuing stable expansion of that other engine of the world economy - China. It is the first time since the financial crisis that such a growth ""synchronisation"" has happened. Thirdly, there is little evidence of increasing inflationary pressures, meaning interest rates are likely to remain at close to historically low levels. That leads to the economically benign sum: growth (leading to higher company profits) + low inflation + easy monetary policy. Which equals good news for equities. On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average in America pushed through 25,000 for the first time in its history. And on Friday the FTSE 100 index of leading companies listed in the UK closed at a new record high. There's another codicil to this story, which is minimising investor jitters over when does ""very high"" turn into its well-known cousins ""scarily high"" and ""unsustainably high"".  Although markets are hitting record levels, the day-by-day increases are relatively modest. Unlike at the time of the dotcom boom in the late 1990s, when we last saw such a sustained run of market growth, overall volatility (the rate of increase or decrease) is low. That is easing any fears that there is a sudden correction downwards around the corner. Now, it is of course just at the time of heightened calm that we need to be at our most vigilant. And anyone who says ""it is different this time"" should be gently pointed towards the rapid stock market sell-offs of 2015 and early 2016, led by the precipitate collapse of the Chinese markets. And the fact that the dotcom boom and the supposed ""new normal"" of sustained growth in the 2000s ended in crisis and market carnage. Bear markets follow bull markets like seagulls follow trawlers, ready to feast on the overconfident exuberance of investors chasing valuations ever higher. For now, the bulls are in charge and the bears are quiet. And Goldilocks is enjoying her porridge, at just the economically right temperature."
market volatility,The rollercoaster ride of Scotland's first gold mine,2024-09-15,2020-12-02,By Magnus Bennett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-54886709,"After 35 years of highs and lows, production is finally under way at Scotland's first commercial gold mine. The journey has been fraught with difficulty for prospectors - but it looks like their investment may be about to pay off. Extracting gold from Cononish, near Tyndrum, in the west of Scotland was never going to be an easy proposition. The technical challenges - and costs - of accessing the precious metal from halfway up a mountain were a daunting prospect for those willing to try.  But try they did. Early attempts from the mid-1980s saw prospectors come and go, as they struggled - and failed - to raise sufficient cash for what was always going to be a capital-intensive project. Their efforts to attract backers were also undermined by the volatility of the precious metals market, which often saw gold prices slump.    By 2006, the mine had changed hands several times and was up for sale once more. That seemed to spell the end of Cononish and Scotland's hopes of producing its own gold for the first time. However, in 2007, Australian-listed firm Scotgold Resources entered the scene and revived the mine.  It has been a rollercoaster ride ever since. By 2013, Scotgold had obtained planning permission and put a funding plan in place, only for the gold price to collapse, making the project less palatable for potential investors. Costs were also spiralling, as the mine had fallen by that point within the boundaries of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, which meant much more stringent planning and environmental conditions. An earlier application had been turned down due to conservation concerns. The problems were compounded by the fact that Scotgold couldn't raise money from traditional banking sources, given its small-scale nature. That seemed to be that - until Edinburgh-born businessman Nat le Roux arrived on the scene and recapitalised the company in 2014. Since then, he has pumped in millions of pounds of his own money to keep the project alive.  Mr le Roux, who is a former independent director of the London Metal Exchange, said there was ""a certain romance"" about the idea of a Scottish gold mine. ""But when the mine was brought to my attention seven years ago, it seemed to me to have interesting investment potential. ""When I came into it, the problem was one of finance.  ""By world standards, this is a very small mine. At full production, we will be producing about 2,000 ounces of gold a month.  ""At the same time, the amounts of money needed to finance the operation have been quite substantial."" Scotgold anticipates that over the expected nine-year life of the mine it will cost about £25m in capital expenditure and a further £81m in operating costs. That's a whopping sum - but the owners still stand to make millions if all goes according to plan. Gold prices have soared from as low as £700 an ounce in 2015 to more than £1,300 today. Scotgold believes it can recover 175,000 ounces in total from Cononish, worth £236m at current prices.  Repeated feasibility studies have also shown gold deposits at Cononish to be high-grade - and its rarity as ""authentic Scottish gold"" has already attracted a premium from buyers. In 2016, the company auctioned off 10 limited edition 1oz fine Scottish gold rounds formed from initial extractions from the mine.  They raised an average of more than £4,550 per ounce - a premium of 378% over the then spot price of about £950. Scotgold chief executive Richard Gray has steered the company through turbulent times in recent years, but describes the team working on the project as ""inherent optimists"".  ""There are always issues and problems to overcome but we have this belief that we will overcome them and the mine will be very profitable,"" he says. ""I have always been confident in the merits of the project. ""However, without the support of Scotgold's shareholders to stay the course, there was always a risk in the worst case scenario that the company would be forced to sell the asset to someone who would develop it and subsequently reap the rewards."" There are still challenges ahead. These include the impact of Covid-19, which forced Scotgold to delay production of first gold earlier this year. The company is looking to increase its workforce from 25 to 70 as production ramps up, but finding the people to handle the highly technical aspects of gold extraction has also proven a problem.  Mr Gray explains: ""Expertise is needed and you obviously can't find all the people already existing in the area. Some people will have to come from further afield and hopefully settle nearer by."" Scotgold expects to produce 10,000oz of gold next year before ramping up production to an average of 23,500oz a year for the rest of the mine's life. Cononish may yet prove to be the start of a golden era for prospectors in Scotland. Scotgold remains optimistic that it will discover extensions to Cononish, which would lengthen the life of the mine. And it has identified potentially significant gold deposits in other areas of Scotland where it holds option agreements with Crown Estates Scotland. Mr le Roux says: ""It is not like Cononish is one fortuitous discovery in the middle of an otherwise barren landscape. ""My view, and that of others, is that we will end up with a number of gold mines in the west of Scotland, either on the same scale as Cononish or perhaps a little bit bigger, assuming the gold price holds up."""
market volatility,Gove predicts Brexit boost for farmers,2024-09-15,2017-06-22,By Gavin Stamp,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40348845,"Brexit offers an ""historic"" chance to reshape agricultural policy for farmers and consumers, Michael Gove says. The new environment secretary said leaving the EU was a chance to remove ""cumbersome bureaucracy"" and replace ""inefficient subsidies"" with a better form of financial support for farmers. Mr Gove was recalled to the front bench after the general election. He was addressing a meeting in Parliament organised by the National Farmers' Union. The NFU has warned that the ""wrong"" kind of Brexit deal could result in seasonal labour shortages and the government having to pay billions in direct financial assistance to help farmers cope with market and price volatility. Mr Gove said while EU membership had helped improve environmental standards and encouraged rural diversification, it had had a harmful impact in other areas and the UK's exit from the common agricultural policy meant the UK would no longer be ""dictated to"" by Brussels. ""We now have an opportunity to put things right,"" he said. He pledged to listen to and learn from the industry as the Brexit process unfolded and be their ""energetic champion"" in government. While farmers were excellent custodians of the environment, he said, he recognised that the industry had to be financially viable because people were ""running businesses not just providing scenery"". Mr Gove, whose appointment was criticised by some environmental campaigners, also said combating air pollution would be a priority for him in his new role since clean air was a vital resource for the countryside."
market volatility,More on-island power 'may be needed this winter',2024-09-15,2022-10-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-63197882,"Guernsey Electricity has said it may need to generate more power than usual on the island this winter due to pressures on supply in Europe. It could mean on-island diesel generators in the Vale working harder during the next few months. Guernsey currently imports more than 90% of its electricity. The boss of Guernsey Electricity said its deal with French power firm EDF meant customers were protected from huge cost increases seen elsewhere. Alan Bates, chief executive officer at Guernsey Electricity, said: ""The current concerns over security of supply for this winter and the resulting volatility in prices is, to an extent, caused by the electricity generation capacity issues in Europe.  ""We continue to work with Electricité de France (EDF) to manage our island demand and this includes options to assist in managing these issues."" He added: ""This winter we may need to generate more electricity to support Europe in ensuring demand is balanced to the supply available."" Mr Bates said the contract with EDF ""continues to insulate local consumers, through our price fixing strategy, from the huge increases in costs seen in the UK and elsewhere"".  He said: ""The current level of volatility will eventually start to affect prices; however, we have no plans to change tariffs this winter due to the commodity market.""

market volatility,Bitcoin buster? The search for a more stable cryptocurrency,2024-09-15,2018-08-20,By Matthew Wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45245149,"Cryptocurrencies - digital tokens known as cryptos for short - have investors in the grip of a gold rush fever, with billions being traded every day. Prices fluctuate wildly, making them high-risk investments. But could a more stable, less volatile crypto persuade us to think of digital money less as a speculative investment and more as a mainstream ""smart"" currency? There are now more than 1,500 cryptos - Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin to name just a few - being traded on about 190 exchanges around the world.  Prices have soared and crashed alarmingly. In 2017 the price of a bitcoin rocketed to nearly £15,000 before losing two-thirds of its value in just a few months. It's currently worth about £5,000. This volatility may be a speculative trader's friend, but it has reinforced cryptos' reputation for being high-risk investments for the adrenalin-fuelled ""get rich quick"" brigade.  Crypto fundraising schemes, known as Initial Coin Offerings, have alarmed regulators around the world. So a growing number of crypto start-ups are developing alternatives known as stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to traditional fiat currencies such as the US dollar, British pound or Japanese yen, with the aim of reducing this volatility and increasing confidence. Hong Kong-based Tether has blazed a trail in this market, swapping about $2.7bn (£2.1bn) worth of fiat currency into its eponymous digital tokens. It claims to have all its digital tethers backed by traditional money in its bank accounts - a claim that has been disputed by some. But Tether's 90% dominance of the stablecoin market is enticing several others to try something similar.  For example, crypto finance company Circle is launching a new token called USD Coin. ""Imagine a US dollar coin that you can make payments with, use on crypto networks, or use in smart contracts to pay dividends, but which you can convert back to fiat currency at any time,"" explains Circle chief executive Jeremy Allaire. Circle's USD Coin will run on the Ethereum blockchain - the distributed ledger technology underlying cryptos - and have an open standard infrastructure overseen by a body called Centre. It wants Centre to become the main platform for other stablecoin operators.  ""Crypto represents the next layer of infrastructure for the internet,"" he says. ""It will allow money to move at the speed of light around the world for free, but also offer binding, verifiable contracts, enabling anyone to do business together. ""We're going to see a lot of businesses using tokens for revenue raising. And eventually central banks will want to do this,"" maintains Mr Allaire. Circle, which is backed by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Baidu and has an estimated value of close to $3bn, recently attracted another $110m in investment led by investors such as Chinese crypto mining giant Bitmain.  Kory Hoang is the founder of Stably, a firm in Vancouver that is developing StableUSD, another US dollar-backed stablecoin. The Vietnam-born entrepreneur believes the sector presents ""a huge opportunity"", especially for people in countries with unstable currencies. ""Fruit sellers on the streets in Zimbabwe could accept your digital payment via an app,"" he says. ""Their fiat money is almost worthless, but they could receive tokens in seconds and sell them very easily for a small commission."" Obi Nwosu, founder and chief executive of Coinfloor, a crypto exchange collective, says: ""There are about two billion people who are unbanked or underbanked, which means they have no access to the world of e-commerce.  ""Bitcoin and cryptos give these people access at much lower cost, but admittedly with less protection."" But there is disagreement within the industry about the best way to reduce the price volatility of cryptos. Coinfloor hopes to solve the volatility issue by attracting far more money into the sector in the belief that greater trading volumes will lead to a more efficient market.   This will require better regulation, argues Mr Nwosu, before large institutions are likely to commit serious money. Concerns about the abuse of cryptos for money laundering and terrorist financing remain a barrier to mass acceptance, he says. But this is still better than going down the stablecoin route, he believes, which requires a central organisation to back the digital tokens, with the extra cost this entails. And this structure conflicts with the decentralised nature of cryptos and blockchain technology and could be ""the worst of both worlds"", he says. ""We think that although stablecoins could be popular in the short run, a decentralised currency that is stable and doesn't have a central organisation behind it will be safer in the long run."" Whatever the disagreements about how to achieve price stability for currency and investment purposes, most people in the sector agree that a crypto's additional ability to act as a smart contract presents huge opportunities to ""tokenise"" physical assets. ""Say I have a house in downtown Saigon worth $1m,"" says Mr Hoang. ""I could tokenise it and sell those tokens on the global crypto market. You could issue a billion pieces of your house if you wanted. Then people would start trading them, just like shares in a real estate investment trust. ""It gives investors around the world access to investment opportunities they never had before."" Akbar Thobani, chief executive of crypto trading platform SFOX, says: ""We think that tokenising assets, such as trucks, cars, planes and real estate, will become big business.""  But if stablecoin cryptos do become as mainstream as fiat currencies, will the system be able to cope with the volume?  Many fear blockchain is getting slower and in danger of seizing up altogether. Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, is only able to process about 13 transactions a second, whereas card payment processing platform Visa can cope with more than 20,000 transactions a second.   This is why work is afoot to create more flexible blockchain-based platforms, such as EOS and Stellar, that could cope with a vast increase in transaction volume and millions more users."
market volatility,The man who wants to make the world normal,2024-09-15,2018-02-02,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/42904545,"What is arguably the top economic policy job on the planet is changing hands.  Jerome Powell is taking over from Janet Yellen in charge of the United States' Federal Reserve, the country's central bank.  He takes charge a decade after the financial crisis, which has seen central bankers around the world take very usual measures to keep their economies stable.  So what challenges will he face and how can we expect him to handle them?  The answer will have an impact on the rest of the world. The Fed's job description has been set out for it by Congress - it is to achieve ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates"".  Given that there are three elements, you might find it surprising that it's generally referred to as the Fed's ""dual mandate"".  The focus is usually on the two aspects of the mandate that have a direct impact on the American public, inflation and jobs.   On both of them (and also on the long term interest rates) the US economy is currently looking in reasonably good shape.  The Fed has target for inflation of 2% for a measure known as the personal consumption expenditure price index.  The latest figure was 1.7% and slightly lower if you take out the volatile contribution of food and energy prices. Inflation is thus on the low side from the Fed's perspective, but not by a wide margin.  Unemployment is very low. At 4.1% it's the lowest since the end of 2000. There are places where it's much higher. It's also true that the very low rate partly reflects a decline in the percentage of the adult population that is either working or actively seeking to work (known as the labour force participation rate).  That in turn partly due to the ageing US population but it also reflects people of working age who have dropped out of the labour market, some as result of the problems associated with addiction to opioid painkillers.  Important though these issues are, the monetary policy tools at the Fed's disposal are not much help in addressing them.  The Fed can only really affect conditions across the entire national economy. For the Fed, the issue is whether further declines in unemployment could force employers to offer sharply higher wages to get the workers they need which could in turn feed through into much faster price rises.  The Fed's policy makers seem to think unemployment could go a little lower over the next year or two without generating substantially higher inflation. But over the longer term they think the jobless rate is likely to move slightly higher to about four and a half per cent.  The key policy is the Fed's interest rate policy. Its main tool is the target for the federal funds rate which is what banks charge one another for overnight lending. The Fed doesn't directly fix the rate, but it can steer it towards the target by buying and selling securities. It currently looks like the Fed will probably raise its main interest rate target three times this year. In previous months there have been different views about rate rises - whether too much might hold back economic growth and job creation or whether too little might risk a surge in inflation. Those debates could well resume as the Fed takes further decisions this year. The Fed is far more advanced than central banks in Europe and Japan with the return of policy to something like normal in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It has already raised interest rates five times from the post crisis lows.  In the eurozone the European Central Bank has not even started that process.  The Bank of England has reversed the rate cut that it made after the EU referendum, but that's all. The UK is back to the post-crisis level of official interest rates.  Then there's quantitative easing, buying financial assets (particularly government debt) with newly created money. The ECB is still actively doing it. So is the Bank of Japan, though both have reduced the amount of new securities they are buying.  The Fed finished in October 2014 and is now starting to reduce its stock of assets. This gradual return of Fed policy to something like normal raises a question about the stability of financial markets. The strong performance of share prices (in many other markets too) owes a great deal to central banks' easy money policy.  Is it a bubble?  Throughout this period there have been concerns expressed that it might be and that the return to normal might lead to instability in the markets. Whatever the Fed does it will have an impact on the rest of world. The first step in the return to normal (in 2013) was known as tapering, a gradual reduction in the amount of assets purchased each month under the QE programme.  It produced some volatility especially for emerging markets, an episode known as the ""taper tantrum"". The subsequent increases in interest rates have been less eventful.  The markets have seen them coming as the Fed has made its intentions clear - though always subject to what the economic data actually show.  Still, those questions remain about whether the enthusiasm in stock markets has got ahead of itself.  One of Mr Powell's predecessors, William McChesney Martin, famously said his job was ""to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going"". The risk could be - and there are different views on this - that the party might already be out of hand, and that a nasty hangover is on the way. "
market volatility,US orders 'unprecedented' release of oil reserves,2024-09-15,2022-03-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60936468,"US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from America's reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The release of up to 180m barrels of oil over six months is the largest since the reserve was created in 1974. Oil prices dropped on reports of the move, which is aimed at easing a supply crunch sparked by war in Ukraine. But the release - of about 1m barrels a day - is unlikely to fully resolve the energy crisis, analysts say. Mr Biden promised further action to boost US output, saying the release would ""serve as [a] bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up"". He called for companies to pay extra if they choose not to use oil wells on land they lease from the government, as well as investments to speed up the adoption of greener energy sources. Following Mr Biden's remarks, US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate was more than 7% lower at about $100 a barrel, while Brent Crude fell roughly 5.4% to around $107. The soaring cost of fuel has become a major political issue around the world, including in the US, which hosts mid-term elections in November. Mr Biden said the scale of the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - which together amounts to less than two days of global consumption - was ""unprecedented"".  Thursday's announcement marked the third time in six months Mr Biden has moved to draw down America's crude oil stockpiles But the release of additional reserves is unlikely to be enough to compensate for lost supplies from Russia - the world's second-biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. ""While stock releases will help to keep a lid on prices in the short term, we think it will take an increase in global production to spark a sustained fall in prices,"" said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - hit $139 a barrel earlier this month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions slapped on Moscow by the US and its allies. Energy prices have fallen back since then, but oil is still almost 70% higher than it was a year ago. Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC News reporter It makes for an excellent headline: President Biden releases unprecedented amounts of oil from strategic reserves. But it really only offers a temporary fix to global shortages. So why is the White House even bothering?  Domestically, the President is under a tremendous amount of pressure. November is the midterm elections and Democrats hold a very slim majority that they are desperate to hold on to. Rising inflation was already an issue, and Republicans have been laying the blame for the high cost of living on the White House and specifically Mr Biden.  The record high cost of fuel just adds to the pain being felt by the American middle class. And it certainly doesn't jive well with the president's ""Joe from Scranton"" vibe. Global demand for energy had been rising prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to reopen as coronavirus lockdown measures were relaxed. However, the war in Ukraine has raised fears of supply issues, with warnings that Russian oil exports could fall by as much as 3m barrels a day. Most major energy-producing nations are either at full capacity or are unwilling to increase output. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies, including Russia, confirmed they were sticking to their existing deal to gradually increase production.  The decision came despite pressure from the US, UK and others on members of the group of oil producing nations to boost output. ""The consensus on the outlook pointed to a well-balanced market,"" the group said. ""Current volatility is not caused by fundamentals, but by ongoing geopolitical developments."" The International Energy Agency (IEA) has called an emergency meeting but it is unclear whether other countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, will follow the US by releasing oil reserves.  Mr Biden said he was coordinating with Western nations on the release of the stockpiles and expected them to release another 30 to 50 million barrels. Also on Thursday, Japan said that it would take emergency measures to secure supplies of seven strategic materials it relies on heavily from Russia or Ukraine as the war and sanctions cause disruptions to supplies. The country's industry minister said the actions include government support to boost domestic production, alternative procurement and to help technological developments to reduce use of the materials, which include liquefied natural gas and gases used in computer chip-making."
market volatility,US firms 'more negative' about doing business in China,2024-09-15,2023-03-23,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65034881,"US companies are ""more negative than they've been in a long time"" about doing business in China, according to the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China). As tensions continue to grow between the world's two biggest economies, Michael Hart says that the rivalry has ""made business very challenging"".   The governments of President Xi and President Biden have been disagreeing on what seems like an ever-increasing number of issues; ranging from Ukraine, to coronavirus, and Taiwan, to Tiktok, and semiconductors.  That is reflected in AmCham China's latest annual survey of its more than 900 members. For the first time it shows that a majority, 55%, no longer regard China as a top-three investment priority - a place where they should spend money to grow their business.  The number who see the ""uncertainty of bilateral relations"" as their leading challenge in China has risen 10% in the last year to 66%. At the same time, the number who think China has become less welcoming to foreign companies has grown to 49%.  It's now five years since then US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on $60bn (£49bn) of Chinese goods, as he stepped up his trade war over ""unfair trade practices"" including intellectual property theft and the trade deficit.  China followed through on its promise to retaliate with tariffs of its own. AmCham China members include some of the US's most successful companies such as Nike, Intel, Pfizer and Coca-Cola.  The latter was the first US consumer business to sell its products in communist China after then President Deng Xiaoping opened the country up to foreign companies in December 1978. Ever since then trade has been at the heart of the relationship.  Corporate pessimism over the current state of the US-China relationship reflects a tumultuous few years, according to Mr Hart.  ""Companies are just really tired after three years of Covid,"" he adds, also highlighting a number of other issues. These include travel becoming more difficult, rising labour costs, executives who are ""just not willing"" to take up assignments in China, political pressure, and China becoming a less predictable place in which to do business.  Despite all those difficulties, the numbers show trade between the two countries hit a record high of $690.6bn last year.  This reflection of their mutual dependence has implications for the health of the entire global economy. That is according to Eswar Prasad, who is a professor of global trade policy at Cornell University, and former head of the International Monetary Fund's China Division. ""The reality is that China does need a lot of products, especially technology products from the US, and the US does have a lot of companies that run their supply chains through China,"" he says. ""This is important for the global economy because it's not just supply chains that these two countries are critical for. The tenor for global trade is set by the relationship between these two countries."" The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is supposed to keep that tenor harmonious by upholding global trade rules.  However, in December, the Biden administration forcefully rejected two rulings that went in China's favour about the tariffs that were imposed by then US President Donald Trump as part of his trade war. The US said they were imposed over issues of national security that the WTO had no right to rule on.  Overall, 66.4% of US imports from China and 58.3% of Chinese imports from the US remain subject to tariffs, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, with little sign that either side will reduce them.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. ""The way the US is approaching its relationship with China could lead to a deterioration of the rules-based global trading system that the US and China have signed on to,"" says Prof Prasad. He adds: ""If the US starts withdrawing from engagement with multilateral institutions that does not bode well for global governance."" The souring US-China relationship also means a growing number of US companies are looking at moving their supply chains outside of China. Apple has become one of the world's most profitable companies by making huge numbers of iPhones in China, but is now increasingly making them in countries such as India.  However, that will only have a limited impact on getting round US-China tensions according to Dan Wang, who is the Shanghai-based chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China. ""Even if the US succeeds in building up an alternative supply chain, that alternative one will still largely depend on China,"" she says. Those other countries will still rely on China for components, especially in industries such as green energy, medical technology and electronics, explains Ms Wang. Whilst companies aren't shunning China all together, Mr Hart does say that ""they're trying to de-risk their supply chain"". He adds: ""So they're having more of a China plus one strategy, and they realise that can no longer rely on China."" China's economic growth has slowed to an annualised pace of 3% as coronavirus restrictions curtailed business activity. At the recent National People's Congress, the newly appointed Premier Li Qiang said that, now those measures had been lifted, the target was 5% growth, although it would ""not be easy"" to meet. Ms Wang says: ""Beijing still wants US companies to invest in China, and that attitude I do not believe will change anytime soon."" Mr Hart adds that the giant Chinese consumer market is probably the place where US firms remain ""the most optimistic"". Firms such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Ralph Lauren all have major Chinese expansion plans in the pipeline. However, all this comes against a backdrop of national security concerns between the two nations, centred on technology. These have led to a growing number of measures by the Biden administration to try to stop China accessing US technology. These include trying to limit new investments in China by US semiconductor manufacturers. Both countries have been trying to increase government support for technologies they regard as critical to the future of the global economy. In his State of the Union speech last month President Biden said: ""I've made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict."" ""I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America stronger. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, that China intends to be dominating."" However that approach has not gone down well in Beijing, where President Xi said recently that ""Western countries - led by the US - have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression against us, bringing unprecedentedly severe challenges to our country's development"". It is a rivalry which is increasingly affecting individual companies and spreading around the world.  Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been restricted in many countries because of US pressure, with Germany the latest to consider taking action. Meanwhile, social media firm Tiktok has been threatened with a complete ban in the US, whilst also facing restrictions in the UK. All these tensions between the US and China mean ""the temperature is certainly very high"", according to Prof Prasad and that could come at a cost that is felt well beyond the US and China. ""Rising hostilities between the world's two largest economies, which together account for roughly 40% of world GDP, are likely to create more volatility and uncertainty, which is the last thing an already fragile world economy now needs,"" he says."
market volatility,Pound slips in early trading after Brexit non-vote,2024-09-15,2019-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50117804,"The pound slipped against the dollar as currency markets got their first chance to react to MPs backing a move to delay approval of the Brexit deal. Many banks in London had called in extra staff, expecting volatile trading after the first Saturday sitting in the House of Commons for 37 years.  But the pound's reaction was muted, slipping 0.6% against the dollar to $1.29, and down 0.4% against the euro. On Friday, the pound had been trading at its highest level for five months. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the fall in the currency was limited because ""despite more twists and turns than any other soap opera in history, a hard Brexit is now highly unlikely"".   Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank, told the BBC's Today programme: ""[Investors] are a little bit more anxious certainly than they were at the end of last week. There was a lot of confidence going in to Saturday's vote that there would be something a little bit more constructive. ""Instead, of course, we've got this delay, so the lower pound this morning reflects the delay. But sterling hasn't sold off very much. If we go back 10 to 12 days, we were trading at $1.22, so we are significantly higher and this is of course related to optimism that Boris Johnson's government may have the numbers to push this deal through. This could still be done in a very short period of time. ""But of course, if we look at the medium term, there is still plenty of scope for volatility, there is still plenty of risk."" Deutsche Bank, like many other banks, had set up additional staff to come in on Sunday expecting a strong reaction to Saturday's vote.  But it scaled back numbers after the weekend's events - which saw Prime Minister Boris Johnson send an unsigned request to the EU for a further delay, accompanied by another letter - signed this time - clarifying that was not his own personal position.  Events serious enough to require extra staffing out of normal trading hours are relatively rare in currency trading, normally linked to a big infrequent event such as an election with an uncertain outcome, for example.  But Russell Lascala, global head of FX at Deutsche Bank, said that, since the Brexit referendum, there had been five or six such events. ""The uncertainty has been going on for years. The market is begging for clarity, to be able to invest or not invest."" Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays' UK operations, told the BBC that the deal on offer was ""acceptable"". ""No deal is perfect, but this deal is actually doable and it is, I think, very frustrating to see what appears to be a protracted process when most business leaders would like to see some certainty and get on,"" he said. ""The chances of yet another round of negotiations are extremely unlikely to yield anything significantly different and now the delay is beginning to affect consumer confidence, particularly investment confidence, and I think we have to push ahead and make the best of what we've got coming down the track."" Currency analysts say they expect the next strong movement in the pound to be when the Brexit deal is voted on in Parliament.  However, after Saturday's vote, many believe a no-deal Brexit is now less likely. US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which issues regular updates to its clients, now thinks there is a 5% chance of a no-deal Brexit, down from 10% previously."
market volatility,The PM's troubles have left Labour buoyant,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,By Chris Mason,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63055831,"""Plenty will tell you it's a good idea to bury your differences. But in the Labour Party we like to bury our similarities!""  Labour's former leader Ed Miliband is in ebullient mood. He leans back in his chair, headphones on, chuckling, talking to us on the BBC's Newscast podcast a few hours after Keir Starmer's speech to this year's Labour Conference. Now the shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, he knows what losing feels like and he's been around long enough to see his party do its fair share of internal bickering. He, like others in Liverpool, are convinced something has now changed. And there is, undoubtedly, a buoyancy here. A buoyancy borne of banishing the internal squabbles of the past; floating too on the self made troubles of the new prime minister. People here have looked on open mouthed on what's happened in the last few days in the markets and are worried about the consequences. But they are excited about the political chance they hope it might give them. Sir Keir Starmer calculates Liz Truss has chosen to sail away from the seas upon which an election can be won; he wants to be seen to be tacking straight towards them. ""This stuff with that budget the other day means we can say the Tories are the bogeymen. They're doing just what we always accuse them of, helping the rich!"" said one shadow cabinet minister. Sir Keir's speech was not just a transparent repudiation of the era of Jeremy Corbyn - a man, remember, he served alongside and who he campaigned to make prime minister - it was also a naked embrace of the instincts, even the language of Tony Blair. But even his biggest supporters acknowledge privately he doesn't have what they saw a generation ago as Sir Tony's ease on the stage or capacity to personify an era. ""He's not got that zeitgeisty thing that Tony had,"" one senior figure loyal to Sir Keir admits to me. One phrase used by some in Keir Starmer's circle is ""hero voters"" - a reference to people who have previously abandoned Labour but are now willing to return. Those tasked with trying to talk to them and persuade them tell me the party still has a way to go to introduce Sir Keir and what he stands for to them. They'll hope this speech goes some way to do that. But one said it may not properly happen until a general election campaign, when the coverage of party leaders steps up and voters are paying more attention. Some in the party fear by then it could be too late. Oh, and incidentally, some senior figures hate the phrase ""hero voters"", thinking it is a patronising phrase that belongs in a nerdy Westminster presentation, if that, and certainly not for use more widely. Not least because it suggests long time, loyal Labour voters are somehow less than heroic. There was a conscious attempt by Labour to ensure the leader's speech was not the rhetorical equivalent of ""comfort eating"" as it was put to me: in other words, talking about stuff that is comfortable ground for Labour activists, such as the NHS. The focus instead was on the economy. I'm told there wasn't a big re-write in the light of events of the last few days. And it is true to say that since at least the spring Sir Keir and his team have been talking about how they saw sluggish economic growth as being at the root of plenty of the UK's problems. And remember, for so long the economy has been perceived by many as an Achilles heel for Labour. But there is no doubt their desire to embrace it has been emboldened by the reaction to the government's budget the other day. When, in government, there is nervousness about talking about what is going on, and there is nervousness about not talking about what is going on, it tells you one thing: they are not in control of events. It tells you the government has been a reluctant passenger on this big dipper of market volatility that it strapped itself and the rest of us into. Tory MPs worry that this could be the moment that mugs them of their reputation. And Labour hopes to pocket and run off with the consequences of that. But a couple of final thoughts worth bearing in mind. If I switch from the maritime metaphors from above to a mountainous one now, Labour's challenge ahead is Himalayan in height. And it took them a while even to get to sea level. The result at the last general election was their worst in nearly a century; the worst since 1935. And the last time Labour won a general election, 17 years ago, they won 41 seats in Scotland. At the last election, they won... one. And the Scottish National Party's near monopoly of Scotland's Westminster seats shows little sign of immediate significant retreat. Reaching that snowy summit for Labour is still some way off. And one more thing: even if they were to manage it, and Sir Keir Starmer became prime minister, it wouldn't be the calm, economic serenity of 1997 when Tony Blair arrived in power. It'd be far, far more choppy. Reaching 10 Downing Street will be difficult. Governing in the mid 2020s could prove even harder."
market volatility,Espresso economy: making it slowly,2024-09-15,2018-02-14,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43061928,"If you like your coffee, you've probably stood in the queue behind someone wanting a decaff soya machiatto latte with triple salchow twist, wishing they'd order something a bit simpler, and faster to make. But the making of coffee can be something of a performance, particularly if the freshness of the grind and the frothiness of the milk is what you're paying more than three quid for. Only so many people can squeeze behind the counter to make them. So those of us who like a hit of fancy caffeine have to show a bit of patience. In more economic terms, we have to accept the limits on the efficiency and speed of production. That freshness and personal service puts a constraint on the barista's productivity. In other words, it's hard to see how the barista's employer can get her, or him, to deliver more coffees per hour. At best, the coffee chain can persuade the customer to add value by paying more for extra elements to the coffee that take little time to add. It's easier to see how someone on a production line can improve productivity.  Processes can be honed. A culture of continuous improvement can look for the edge that gets the job done with less resource, or with more reliability, reducing the cost of wastage. Or bosses may sanction the capital expenditure with which to buy new equipment, some of which may replace workers. But for those providing a service, getting more value out of each hour worked is harder.  It's true of making coffee, and of serving in a restaurant or hotel. It's a challenge in education or the health service, particularly if the measure is of quality as well as patient or pupil throughput. This matters because, without improving the value a worker adds per hour, wages and prosperity are going to stall. And that's one of the key economic problems - arguably the biggest one - that we currently face. Productivity growth has stalled in Britain.  And we have new evidence of how the stalling is more of a problem in Scotland. There was a sort of rejoicing some months back, or at least relief, when the figures for 2015 (they take a while to collect) appeared to show that Scottish productivity had caught up with that of the UK as a whole. That is, the amount of output per hour worked in Scotland was getting very close to the amount for the UK.  That's after years when Scots had, on average, been less productive.  In the modern era, using modern data, Scotland has lagged.  But, we told ourselves last year, not any longer. It was pointed out that to have caught up with the UK on productivity was only the start. The UK has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. But new Scottish government figures, published on Wednesday, suggest that 2015 may have been something of a peak, from which Scottish productivity has since been on the slide. Every way you look at it, it's down. The last positive quarter was in July to September 2015. Up to the third quarter of last year, the previous five quarters had been negative.  Just taking the previous four quarters adds up to an annualised decline of 3.2%. But get some clever statisticians to iron out the volatility and seasonal factors (if you insist, ""a trend-based estimate of quarterly growth based on a centred moving average"") and you get to a mere 0.7%.  Still negative, though. If you average things over the year, which is another way of ironing out volatility, output per hour was down more than 1% in 2016. We don't have the full figures for 2017, but it looks like ending up as a steeper drop. And for those who see comparison with the UK as being the key measure of success, how is it looking? Well, it's looking a bit like divergence, and not in a good way. The gap closed at its fastest rate in 2008 and 2009. We could guess that's because the high productivity of London's financial sector took a very big dive with the great recession, making Scots look relatively better. Since 2009, Scottish productivity has been above 96% of the UK's level, and the gap was closing. But in the past two years, it's widened slightly.  Is there a particular sector of the economy that helps explain this?  Oil and gas or finance, for instance?  The statisticians have done some experimental work on this.  It tends towards showing only why further statistical delving is of limited use. Construction figures can be helped a lot by capital investment, for instance.  And if the measure of the property sector is value added, then rising house prices can make productivity look good, without anything productive having happened. The less unreliable numbers show how weak productivity growth is in hospitality, and in government services. And indeed, all of these are merely numbers, derived from survey evidence of the hours people work and separate surveys of employers about how much they produce.  They reflect, to a significant extent, the successful jobs market in which unemployment is very low.  (You could make productivity look much better by firing the least productive workers, though to be clear, that's not a recommendation from me.) The statistics can reflect labour force changes in the way people work, and the patterns in which employers offer additional hours.  So you could choose to pick holes in the methodology. (One proposal from an independence-minded think tank this week is that Scotland's statistical problems can best be addressed with its own statistical agency.) You could also argue that the gap with the rest of the UK is not that worryingly wide.   But the trend is of very weak improvement. And in recent quarters, it's been going in the wrong direction.  The challenge remains of identifying why productivity has been so poor, and what can be done about it. So I offer, in full, the Scottish government's take on the numbers: ""Scotland's economy continues to grow and, while there is no room for complacency, it is encouraging that these statistics show a strong increase in the number of hours worked in recent quarters.  ""Despite the dip in productivity over the last year, annual productivity levels have increased by 5.4% in Scotland since 2007, compared to only 1.4% growth for the UK as a whole.  ""The most recent labour market statistics show our unemployment rate has been lower than the UK's for 11 consecutive months and we are also outperforming the UK on employment, unemployment and inactivity rates for young people and women, demonstrating that the fundamentals of our economy continue to be strong. ""However it cannot be stressed enough that Brexit remains the single biggest threat to our economy. Our latest analysis, confirmed by the UK government's own analysis shows a hard-Brexit could cost Scotland's economy £12.7 billion a year by 2030, so we continue to use all of the powers at our disposal to grow our economy."" So the analysis there is: more people are working, and longer hours.  The chosen benchmark for these numbers is by comparison with the UK as a whole. Taking 2007 as the starting point that proves the point most clearly, the productivity gap with the UK has narrowed (but both are very weak). And, according to this Holyrood view, Brexit is the big threat. Well, maybes aye...  But even if the process stopped now, it's not clear that would do anything to solve the productivity puzzle.  And that puzzle, with respect, is ""a fundamental of our economy""."
market volatility,Energy bills pushed higher by electricity charge,2024-09-15,2023-02-01,By Andy Verity & Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64471262,"The way electricity prices are set has pushed UK household bills up by £7.2bn over two years, analysis suggests. Under existing rules, energy suppliers pay the highest price for wholesale electricity no matter how it is made. Gas-fired power stations are the most expensive way to generate electricity, but only make about 40% of all electricity used by UK homes. That means homes pay over the odds for power generated any other way, said the Carbon Tracker Initiative. If an average price was used instead the UK's electricity bill could be much lower, the not-for-profit climate think tank said.  The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis) said it had ""already launched a major review"" of the electricity market ""to radically cut costs"" for consumers in the long term. The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of power. When it's windy and sunny enough to meet demand for electricity through renewables, the wholesale cost drops to close to zero, according to Beis. But when it's not, the wholesale cost is set at the level that all providers will accept - which is the highest bid. In the past, gas powered generation was among the cheapest ways of producing electricity. For decades, wholesale gas was relatively cheap in the UK, and only started to soar in price in May 2021 as economies recovered from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted supplies. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply since August 2022, but are still about three times the price of May 2021. Charging an average price for wholesale electricity would have made the bill in the two years from 2021-22 £7.2bn lower, the Carbon Tracker Initiative said. According to BBC calculations that's about £250 per household. Due to the current system, firms that make renewable energy have been paid much more for their power than it costs them to generate.  For this reason the government introduced a temporary 45% tax in January on what it calls ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generators in the UK. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, which campaigns for warm homes, said ""injustice"" in the electricity pricing system was at a ""shocking scale"" ""It cannot be right that consumers have been prevented from benefiting from the reduced cost of generating electricity,"" he said. Jonathan Sims, an energy analyst who wrote the CTI report, said the findings showed how the global gas market over the last two years had skewed British power prices. He said these prices did not reflect the different technology the UK now uses to generate electricity.  The CTI's report takes into account the need for sources of power that can be fired up immediately such as gas-fired, or provide near constant output such as nuclear, whereas wind power for example is weather-dependent.  The analysis also suggested Europe's most gas power-dependent countries, the UK and Italy, had consistently paid the highest prices for electricity during the recent period of gas price volatility.  The business department said it was consulting on changes that ""would stop volatile gas prices setting the price of electricity produced by much cheaper renewables"". It also said its windfall tax on renewables generators would ""help fund energy bill support for households and businesses""."
market volatility,Shares of India's 'family silverware' go on sale,2024-09-15,2022-05-04,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61296184,"Shares in the Indian state-run insurance giant Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) went on sale this week in a $2.75bn (£2.18bn) initial public offering, witnessing strong demand from investors. The government is offering a 3.5% stake in what will be India's largest share sale, despite both the size and valuation of the issue being slashed significantly to reflect current market conditions. The issue was fully subscribed on Thursday, a day after it opened for sale to retail investors, employees and policy holders. The date for share listing is 17 May, the government's Department of Investment and Public Asset Management said. Bids for anchor investors opened on 2 May but share sale for the public opened on 4 May and would close on 9 May. General investors can buy equity shares at a price band set at $11.75-12.36 (£9.38-9.87) per share. The company's policyholders, employees as well as small mom and pop investors will be entitled to an additional discount of up to 60 rupees, according to papers filed by the company with India's securities watchdog.Broking firm Zerodha expects at least 8-12 million additional online trading accounts to be opened by investors keen to apply for the IPO, a 10-15% bump up from the 80 million accounts currently in operation. LIC is nearly as old as independent India. Formed by nationalising and merging 245 private insurance companies, it started issuing policies in 1956, holding a monopoly on India's insurance sector until the turn of the millennium.   More than two decades after private competition was allowed, LIC continues to hold a leadership position, with 66% market share as of 2021.   Its sheer size makes the insurance behemoth a systemically important company for India.    At over $500bn, its asset base is bigger than the GDP of several countries. And with nearly 280 million policies in force, it manages four times more policies than the entire population of the UK.   It is also India's largest asset manager, with massive investments in state and central securities as well as the stock market.   According to the ratings agency CRISIL, LIC's equity investments in listed companies represented 4% of the total market capitalisation of the National Stock Exchange. It has also been the default financier of the government in trying times, bailing out flailing state-run companies.   LIC also owns a sprawling portfolio of real estate across India.   With 1.3 million distributors selling policies across pretty much every nook and corner in India, the ubiquitous ""LIC agent"" has held a unique place in independent India's public consciousness.   Srinivasalu Naidu, a septuagenarian who has sold policies door to door for the past 30 years, told the BBC he was known in his heyday as ""LIC Naidu"", a much revered figure in his village in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.    Agents like him have been critical to the company's growth and mission to build trust and create a savings culture across the remote corners of the country.   ""People didn't buy policies from me just as insurance, they did it as an investment. For their kids' education or wedding. They trusted their life savings with me,"" said Naidu.   Private banking giant UBS estimates 10 out of every 100 rupees saved by Indian households go into LIC, a much larger amount than even the deposits attracted by India's largest bank, the State Bank of India.   Given LIC's social relevance and scaled-down valuation, India's opposition politicians have accused the government of selling ""family silverware"" and prioritising shareholders over politicians.  According to analysts, even at the upper price band, LIC's issue has been valued far lower by the government than its three listed private peers - HDFC Life Insurance Co., SBI Life Insurance Co. and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co.   ""It is not justified at all. You should also involve the opposition (in deliberations), when you are disinvesting something like the LIC which is a social security net,"" Dr Shama Mohamed, a spokesperson of the Congress party, told the BBC.   Last month, PM Narendra Modi's government decided to defer the mega IPO amid global stock market volatility due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It had initially planned to raise about $8b by selling 5% of LIC to fund its widening fiscal deficit - the gap between earnings and expenditure.   Amid surging fuel costs and lower growth projections, the pruned fundraising target is expected to put additional pressure on New Delhi's already stretched finances.  But analysts say the size and price are appropriate given the current environment, with foreign investors pulling out nearly $20bn from Indian equities since October 2021. And the government is confident that LIC's dominant leadership position and fair valuation will attract significant investor interest.    ""Even if we have a bit of a constrained environment, we can still pull it off because that's the kind of optimum demand scenario which exists,"" Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary at the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, told journalists in Mumbai last week.   In the long run, a stock market listing is expected to improve how the firm is run and bring in more transparency.  But at a time when its competitors have all gone digital, LIC's overt dependence on physical distributors has been flagged as a cause of concern by analysts, who believe it will continue losing market share in the years ahead.   ""On the margin front, it will be kind of hard for LIC to compete if it sticks to the distributor model. They will have to re-innovate the company and become relevant for what the insurance market will be tomorrow,"" says Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha.   According to economic commentator Vivek Kaul, LIC pays agents twice as much in commissions in the first year, compared to private insurers, which is not sustainable in the longer run.   Covid-19 has also had an impact on the company. Its growth in new business premiums declined significantly as lockdowns disrupted operations, reiterating the need for LIC to significantly leverage technology to drive operating efficiency.   But analysts expect India's young population and massive under-penetration of life insurance to give LIC a long runway for expansion.   According to analysis from the broking firm Anand Rathi, India's protection gap - or the difference between the insurance required and actually available - was 83% or US$16.5 trillion in 2019, the highest in Asia-Pacific, ""thereby presenting a huge potential for growth""."
market volatility,Energy bill help to be reduced from April,2024-09-15,2022-10-17,By Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63283436,"A scheme to cap all household energy bills for two years will be cut from April, the new chancellor has said.  Jeremy Hunt said the support - which limits a typical household bill to £2,500 - would be reviewed so it cost ""significantly less than planned"".  He said the most vulnerable would continue to be protected from soaring wholesale energy prices. The move sparked concern among consumer groups who warned households would be plunged into uncertainty.  ""Everyone knows why decisions have been made at breakneck speed, but there are questions that need to be answered, and answered quickly,"" said National Energy Action boss Adam Scorer. ""Who will still get support? Will it include vulnerable households not on welfare benefits? Will that support be deeper for those in greatest need?"" Mr Hunt is trying to save money after the government's mini-budget left a big projected hole in the public finances. Its plan for large tax cuts sparked turmoil on financial markets over how the plans would be funded. ""Beyond [April], the Prime Minister and I have agreed it would not be responsible to continue exposing public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices,"" the chancellor said.  ""The objective is to design a new approach that will cost the taxpayer significantly less than planned whilst ensuring enough support for those in need,"" he said. Under the Energy Price Guarantee, announced last month, Ms Truss's government capped all household energy bills for two years from 1 October in a bid to prevent millions facing hardship this winter. Now that will only be in place for six months, just to cover this winter. The Treasury will review support given from April, but Mr Hunt said there would be ""a new approach"" targeting those in the most need. Before this guarantee was introduced, the energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to £3,549 for a typical household from October. Predictions from consultants Cornwall Insight suggest that, for households that do not receive any support, a typical annual energy bill could be £4,347 in the spring, dropping to £3,722 next winter - however that prediction could be significantly affected by changing wholesale prices.

Consumer rights campaigner Martin Lewis said that while the support for intervention had been desperately needed, a ""universal energy price guarantee was always expensive and poorly targeted"".  But he added: ""The post-April support will still need to reach a decent way up the net and support middle earners, energy rates are still huge."" Ms Truss's plan - thought to cost up to £150bn - was to be funded through government borrowing after the prime minister rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on oil and gas firms.  However, former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng followed it with plans to cut taxes by some £45bn. Concerns about rising borrowing sparked turmoil on financial markets which spilled over into the mortgage market, where interest rates on loans have surged to 14-year highs.  On Monday, Mr Hunt promised to review the energy support while also reversing £32bn worth of the planned tax cuts. The new chancellor said he was doing ""what is necessary for economic stability"". He added that the Energy Price Guarantee had been ""the biggest single expense"" of Mr Kwarteng's growth plan.  When it was announced, many had criticised the scheme for not being targeted enough, arguing the support should have been means tested.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which had described the package as ""clearly not sustainable in the long-term"", welcomed Mr Hunt's decision. ""While large-scale untargeted support for households this winter was perhaps unavoidable we need to do everything possible to put in place a better designed, better targeted and less expensive scheme next year,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. But the Centre for Ageing Better, a charity, said many older people faced an anxious wait to find out how much help they would get.  Boss Carole Easton said: ""The previous two-year promise provided a level of security for people in uncertain times.   ""It is vital that the government gives plenty of advance notice with clear messaging as to who will be eligible for targeted support in April."" Under Ms Truss's scheme, businesses are protected for six months from soaring energy prices, with those struggling most set to continue receiving help pending a review.  Mr Hunt suggested the targeted approach would continue, but the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) called for clarity.  ""The review to come on business and consumer energy support after six months must avoid a cliff-edge for small firms that remain impacted and vulnerable,"" said the FSB's national chair, Martin McTague.

market volatility,US orders 'unprecedented' release of oil reserves,2024-09-15,2022-03-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60936468,"US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from America's reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The release of up to 180m barrels of oil over six months is the largest since the reserve was created in 1974. Oil prices dropped on reports of the move, which is aimed at easing a supply crunch sparked by war in Ukraine. But the release - of about 1m barrels a day - is unlikely to fully resolve the energy crisis, analysts say. Mr Biden promised further action to boost US output, saying the release would ""serve as [a] bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up"". He called for companies to pay extra if they choose not to use oil wells on land they lease from the government, as well as investments to speed up the adoption of greener energy sources. Following Mr Biden's remarks, US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate was more than 7% lower at about $100 a barrel, while Brent Crude fell roughly 5.4% to around $107. The soaring cost of fuel has become a major political issue around the world, including in the US, which hosts mid-term elections in November. Mr Biden said the scale of the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - which together amounts to less than two days of global consumption - was ""unprecedented"".  Thursday's announcement marked the third time in six months Mr Biden has moved to draw down America's crude oil stockpiles But the release of additional reserves is unlikely to be enough to compensate for lost supplies from Russia - the world's second-biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. ""While stock releases will help to keep a lid on prices in the short term, we think it will take an increase in global production to spark a sustained fall in prices,"" said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - hit $139 a barrel earlier this month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions slapped on Moscow by the US and its allies. Energy prices have fallen back since then, but oil is still almost 70% higher than it was a year ago. Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC News reporter It makes for an excellent headline: President Biden releases unprecedented amounts of oil from strategic reserves. But it really only offers a temporary fix to global shortages. So why is the White House even bothering?  Domestically, the President is under a tremendous amount of pressure. November is the midterm elections and Democrats hold a very slim majority that they are desperate to hold on to. Rising inflation was already an issue, and Republicans have been laying the blame for the high cost of living on the White House and specifically Mr Biden.  The record high cost of fuel just adds to the pain being felt by the American middle class. And it certainly doesn't jive well with the president's ""Joe from Scranton"" vibe. Global demand for energy had been rising prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to reopen as coronavirus lockdown measures were relaxed. However, the war in Ukraine has raised fears of supply issues, with warnings that Russian oil exports could fall by as much as 3m barrels a day. Most major energy-producing nations are either at full capacity or are unwilling to increase output. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies, including Russia, confirmed they were sticking to their existing deal to gradually increase production.  The decision came despite pressure from the US, UK and others on members of the group of oil producing nations to boost output. ""The consensus on the outlook pointed to a well-balanced market,"" the group said. ""Current volatility is not caused by fundamentals, but by ongoing geopolitical developments."" The International Energy Agency (IEA) has called an emergency meeting but it is unclear whether other countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, will follow the US by releasing oil reserves.  Mr Biden said he was coordinating with Western nations on the release of the stockpiles and expected them to release another 30 to 50 million barrels. Also on Thursday, Japan said that it would take emergency measures to secure supplies of seven strategic materials it relies on heavily from Russia or Ukraine as the war and sanctions cause disruptions to supplies. The country's industry minister said the actions include government support to boost domestic production, alternative procurement and to help technological developments to reduce use of the materials, which include liquefied natural gas and gases used in computer chip-making."
market volatility,Tax U-turn lifts pound as borrowing costs fall,2024-09-15,2022-10-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63118918,"The pound has climbed after the chancellor reversed his controversial decision to scrap the top rate of tax. Sterling gained more than 1% to $1.1284 before falling back slightly while government borrowing costs edged lower.  Tory MPs had threatened to vote against Kwasi Kwarteng's plan, saying it was unfair when living costs were so high. The U-turn may ease market nerves, said the Institute for Fiscal Studies, but unease remains over how a remaining £43bn of tax cuts will be funded. ""The difference this makes really is trivial,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the IFS think tank. The chancellor pledged to abolish the 45p rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than £150,000 a year. Getting rid of the rate would have cost the Treasury around £2bn out of the £45bn worth of tax cuts Mr Kwarteng announced in his so-called ""mini-budget"".  ""This was, if anything, possibly the smallest measure from a fiscal point of view, if not a political point of view, in the mini-budget,"" said Mr Johnson. ""It is about 5% of the tax cuts."" The cut to top-rate tax for high earners sparked anger among opposition and Tory MPs and spooked markets amid concerns the unfunded cuts were unaffordable. The chancellor also declined to publish an independent assessment of his plans by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Last week, the pound hit a record low and the Bank of England was forced to step in to stem soaring government borrowing costs. Tony Danker, head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), welcomed the U-turn saying that calming markets was an ""absolute pre-condition to investment and growth"".  He added it had been a ""distraction"" from other important pro-growth reforms promised in the mini-budget. The chancellor is expected to announce reforms to planning laws, green energy, childcare and more in the coming weeks.  But Mr Danker added: ""I think we are going to move onto another test, which is does the chancellor really mean it when he says we are going to reform the supply side of the economy... because I think that is really needed.""  The IFS's Mr Johnson said the U-turn had eased market nerves as there was ""perhaps a sense"" the government would  ""back down"" and ""listen to opinion"".  But he warned of more volatility if the chancellor did not use his next fiscal statement on 23 November to explain how he will fund his tax cuts,  ""He needs to come up with something fairly convincing ... whether that involves undoing some more of those tax cuts or some additional tax rises or something fairly dramatic on the spending side.""  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research called for an OBR forecast to be brought forward.  ""Whilst we welcome this morning's statement, the fundamental issue of how the government expects to finance both its proposed tax cuts and its spending commitments to cap the unit price of energy remains unresolved,"" said deputy director Stephen Millard. ""The overall package continues to be highly inflationary and will lead to faster and higher rises in interest rates than would have been otherwise the case."" The Bank of England has been raising interest rates to try and curb inflation, which is currently at a nearly 40-year-high of 9.9%. On 22 September, the Bank raised rates by 0.5 percentage points to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years. It warned interest rates could rise again after the value of the pound plummeted, following the government's decision to cut taxes and borrow more. Some were estimating that rates could reach more than 6% next year. However, fears of big rate rises receded slightly after Monday's U-turn on the 45% tax rate, with investors now forecasting a rise to 5.75% by May."
market volatility,Five-day bank holiday in Sri Lanka for debt restructure,2024-09-15,2023-06-29,By Annabelle Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66049915,"Sri Lanka began a five-day bank holiday from Thursday to allow the crisis-hit nation to restructure $42bn (£33.2bn) in domestic debt. The country is facing its worst economic crisis since it won independence from the British in 1948. There are fears that the government's restructuring plan could lead to volatility in financial markets. Debt restructuring can involve the extension of the period over which a loan is repaid. The plans include a 30% ""haircut"" - or reduction - on some government bonds held by international lenders, central bank governor Nandalal Weerasinghe announced on Thursday. A day earlier, he had said banks were excluded from the domestic debt restructuring exercise. ""The government expects the entire process to conclude while the markets are closed during these five days,"" Mr Weerasinghe said. ""Local depositors are assured of the safety of their deposits and interests will not be affected."" Local media quoted analysts as saying that the holiday was announced to provide a suitable buffer for any potential market reactions to significant financial announcements. ""The government's action to call an extended public holiday means it obviously saw the risk of bank runs,"" Alex Holmes, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, told the BBC. Earlier this week, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe reassured the public that the restructuring would ""not lead to a collapse of the banking system"". On Wednesday, his office said the cabinet had approved a restructuring proposal by the country's central bank, which would be submitted to parliament for approval over the weekend.   Roshan Perera, an economist and a former director at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, said domestic creditors did not appear to be getting equal treatment. ""From what we see, the banks, private lenders and investors are not being affected from the domestic debt restructuring,"" he told the BBC. ""The central bank balance sheet and the pension funds are taking a broader hit. This is not equitable.""  The employee pension fund is the largest pension fund in Sri Lanka.   The move to restructure domestic debt comes as the country is struggling to come out of its worst economic crisis. Last year, Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt with international lenders for the first time in its post-independence history. However, there have been several important lifelines extended to the country in recent months. The World Bank has just granted it $700m, following a $3bn bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  The World Bank said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide support in a ""phased approach"". The organisation added that it has allocated $500m (£396m) to budgetary support, while the remaining $200m would be used to ""provide better-targeted income and livelihood opportunities to the poor and vulnerable"". The IMF's bailout in March, which was nearly a year in the making, was viewed as a massive lifeline for Sri Lanka. However, the bailout came with conditions, such as requiring the country to make ""swift progress"" on restructuring its debts. In March, the IMF said Sri Lanka had secured financing assurances from all its major creditors, including China and India, which paved the way for the bailout. The IMF has so far released about $330m in funds to Sri Lanka, with the rest due in disbursements over four years.  Sri Lanka's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices, populist tax cuts and inflation of more than 50%. A shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials also helped to push the cost of living to record highs, triggering nationwide protests which overthrew the government in 2022. Sri Lanka's central bank outlined the extent of the country's economic crisis earlier this year. According to its latest annual report, ""several inherent weaknesses"" and ""policy lapses"" helped to trigger the severe economic problems that engulfed the South Asian nation.  The central bank also forecast that the Sri Lankan economy would shrink by 2% this year, but expand by 3.3% in 2024. Its prediction is more optimistic than that of the IMF, which forecast economic growth of 1.5% in Sri Lanka next year. Additional reporting by Archana Shukla"
market volatility,Wall Street plunges on growth concerns,2024-09-15,2018-12-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46445913,"Wall Street shares tumbled on Tuesday, sending all three major indexes down more than 3% in some of the steepest declines in weeks. The Dow Jones index shed almost 800 points, or 3.1%, to close at 25,027.07.  The S&P 500 ended at 2,700.07, down more than 90 points or 3.24%, while the Nasdaq dropped more than 283 points or 3.8% to 7,158.43. The falls came as a closely-watched financial measure caused alarm about US economic prospects. Increasing doubts that talks between the US and China would defuse trade tensions also fuelled the losses, reversing Monday's rise, which followed optimism about those prospects. The declines extended a period of market turbulence that started in October, after the indexes hit record highs earlier in the summer. The losses touched nearly every sector, with the financial industry suffering the biggest declines.  Analysts said the trigger for Tuesday's falls appeared to be concerns about the ""yield curve"", which measures the difference between the interest rates paid on short-term and long-term US bonds. The gap has narrowed in recent months, as investors demand higher rates of return on short-term debt in anticipation of inflation and rate rises.  At the same time, they are accepting relatively lower rates on long-term debt, in anticipation of limited inflation and slower economic growth over the next decade. The difference between the rates on three-year and five-year debt disappeared on Monday. The move fuelled concerns on Tuesday that the same might happen to the gap between two-year and 10-year bonds - a more significant indicator. Historically, when short-term rates rise above longer rates, it signals a recession may be on the horizon. Analysts at S&P Global Ratings said they expected US economic growth to slow, not necessarily contract, in coming months, as a boost from recent tax cuts and increased government spending fades. However, the firm added that the risk of recession had grown, reflecting ""increased volatility"" in financial markets. On Tuesday, shares in financial companies, which are especially exposed to interest rates, were hardest hit. Firms such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, American Express were among the biggest losers on the Dow, all down by more than 3%. Companies at risk in the trade battle, including Apple and aerospace giant Boeing, also suffered steep declines, amid scepticism that the US and China would retreat from their tariff war. ""It was good while it lasted,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, referring to Monday's rally. Tweets by US President Donald Trump fed the doubts, as he sent conflicting signals in a series of Twitter posts. ""President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will. But if not remember... I am a Tariff Man,"" he wrote."
market volatility,"Families may need help with bills, says IMF expert",2024-09-15,2022-01-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60128099,"Struggling UK families may need help with energy bills as inflation soars, an International Monetary Fund expert has said. It comes as the IMF predicted that the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year as it recovers from the Covid pandemic. The forecast for UK growth in 2022 was cut to 4.7% from 5% in the IMF's latest world economic outlook. However, this will be the fastest in the G7 industrialised nations. It partly reflects a rebound from sharp falls the UK suffered during initial pandemic lockdowns two years ago. The International Monetary Fund is an organisation of 190 countries that works to secure financial stability. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, told the BBC that targeted help might be needed to help vulnerable households deal with higher energy bills as they face a cost-of-living squeeze. She said: ""The UK has done very well on the vaccination front, on testing and tracing and so on. ""All that has to be continued. An argument can be made that, especially for instance, in April, as more of the energy price pass-through happens, then that could be a big, sharp increase in the cost of living. ""And one could see a case for very, very targeted help to highly vulnerable households for a short space of time."" Surging food and energy prices drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in a blow to struggling families. The International Monetary Fund expressed concern that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could see energy prices go even higher and stay there for longer. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, backed the idea of help with spiralling energy bills in the UK. That intervention could be helpful to the Treasury, which is currently deciding what type of help could be given to mitigate a £50-a-month rise in bills. Some MPs want the government to delay its announced rise in National Insurance, especially after lower-than-expected public borrowing figures. The Treasury is believed to be looking instead at focusing support on those most in need. On Tuesday, the IMF sharply downgraded its forecasts for the two biggest global economies - the US and China - citing high energy prices and new Covid curbs among its reasons. Overall, the IMF now expects global growth to go from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point lower for this year than in its last prediction in October 2021. ""The global economy enters 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected,"" said the IMF report. As the new Omicron Covid-19 variant spread, countries had reimposed restrictions, it added. ""Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in higher and more broad-based inflation than anticipated, notably in the US and many emerging market and developing economies.  ""And the ongoing retrenchment of China's real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption have limited growth prospects."" The IMF predicted that the higher levels of inflation currently seen in the global economy would go on for longer than it anticipated in its last forecast, persisting for most of 2022. It said supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility and localised wage pressures meant that ""uncertainty around inflation and policy paths"" was high. US economic growth for this year was downgraded by the IMF from 5.2% to 4% after it removed the effects of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better fiscal policy package from its calculations. The legislation is currently stalled in Congress and is unlikely to be enacted in its present form. China's forecast for 2022 was cut from 5.6% to 4.8%. ""In China, disruption in the housing sector has served as a prelude to a broader slowdown,"" the IMF report said. ""With a strict zero-Covid strategy leading to recurrent mobility restrictions and deteriorating prospects for construction sector employment, private consumption is likely to be lower than anticipated."" The IMF said the cut in expectations for global growth also reflected revisions among some other large emerging markets. In particular, the two biggest Latin American economies, Brazil and Mexico, suffered the largest growth downgrades.  Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking re-election later this year, is now expected to grow by just 0.3% in 2022, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. Mexico also saw a downgrade of 1.2 percentage points and is now predicted to see growth of 2.8%."
market volatility,Customers abusing forecourt staff over fuel prices,2024-09-15,2022-03-08,By Huw Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-60667755,"A food distributor is facing a £2m diesel bill and a garage forecourt boss says staff are being abused by some customers as prices surge after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Carmarthenshire wholesaler Castell Howell Foods has seen fuel costs increase 30% in a month. It has a fleet of about 150 vehicles covering Wales and the west of England. The cost of fuel has reached record highs since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine. The garage in Carmarthenshire said it had been forced to ask some drivers not to go back because of ""totally unacceptable"" abuse of its employees. Fuel has increased because the wholesale price for crude oil used in manufacturing petrol and diesel has increased following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Castell Howell normally spends about £1.2m on fuel for its vehicles, but finance director Nigel Williams said its bill has soared in recent weeks. ""What we're seeing over the last month has been an increase of around 30% in the prices we pay and, over the past year, an increase of around 60%,"" he said. ""So that represents an increase on an annualised basis around £700,000."" If price rises are sustained, the company faces an annual fuel cost ""increasing to closer to £2m,"" which he said posed ""a significant challenge"" for the business. ""We are taking it for granted that we're going to have to address this ourselves by being as efficient as possible, passing as much of the price increases on, so that we're not left with incurring losses ourselves.  ""I understand the difficulty that presents to customers who are facing similar challenges and, I think, ultimately, the end user will have to pay more for products."" Carmarthenshire garage boss Sion Jones said he was having to put the price of diesel up 22p a litre compared with his previous delivery at Valley Services, near Llandysul. But the price has increased by a total of 36p since the war began, he said. ""The tanker itself will cost me £8,000 more… from last Wednesday. ""Not in 30 years of being here, I've never seen a price increase like this."" ""We've had to ask a few people not to call again due to abuse that some of our staff have had to take which, in my opinion, is totally unacceptable."" Energy expert Dr Carol Bell said the oil and gas market had experienced a ""tremendous period of volatility"". ""It has seen volatility in one direction, and that's been upwards. And that has been the case, both in oil and gas,"" she said. The UK will phase out the use of Russian oil by the end of 2022, but it will not cut off Russian gas supplies. Dr Bell said Russian oil was easier to replace than gas, because of the ability to transfer oil more easily around the world in tankers. ""The interdependence of the energy markets, particularly gas, back to Russia across the continent of Europe is something that we've all learned a lot more about in the last few months. ""We were already enjoying shortages and very high prices in natural gas and in energy generally in the UK.  ""This is adding another layer to that.  ""And it means that inflation will be with us for longer, irrespective of what happens now in Ukraine almost,"" she said."
market volatility,Turkey pledges action to calm markets,2024-09-15,2018-08-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45165629,"Turkey has pledged it will take action to calm markets after the lira plunged to a new record low in Asian trading.  The details would be unveiled shortly, the country's finance minister told Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. ""From Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market,"" Berat Albayrak said. The lira lost 20% of its value versus the dollar on Friday.  It had already fallen more than 40% in the past year. The  latest blow came on Friday, when US President Donald Trump said he had approved the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium. Concerns about contagion prompted investors to sell riskier assets on Monday including emerging market currencies and stocks in Asia. Mr Albayrak said the country would ""act in a speedy manner"" and its plan included help for the banks and small and medium-sized businesses most affected by the dramatic volatility in the lira. His assurance came after Turkey's president blamed the lira's plunge on a plot against the country. ""What is the reason for all this storm in a tea cup? There is no economic reason... This is called carrying out an operation against Turkey,"" he said. Recep Tayyip Erdogan once again urged Turks to sell dollars and buy liras to help boost the currency.  ""I am specifically addressing our manufacturers: Do not rush to the banks to buy dollars... You should know that to keep this nation standing is... also the manufacturers' duty,"" he said. Experts have blamed the drop in the lira on fears that Turkey may be falling into an economic crisis. The Turkish stock market has also fallen 17%, while government borrowing costs have risen to 18% a year. Meanwhile, inflation has hit 15%. Investors are worried that Turkish companies that borrowed heavily to profit from a construction boom may struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros, as the weakened lira means there is now more to pay back. Then there are Turkey's worsening relations with the US.  Donald Trump's administration hit Turkey's justice and interior ministers with sanctions last week. The dispute centres on Turkey's refusal to release American pastor Andrew Brunson. Mr Brunson has been detained for nearly two years, accused him of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. Trump's decision to double US tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium has only exacerbated the situation.  Not much yet.  Turkey's finance minister said they would start implementing an action plan on Monday but gave no further details. Some would like to see Turkey's central bank increase interest rates. Not only would this help contain inflation but it would also help support the lira. But there are fears that Mr Erdogan, who is famously averse to interest rate rises, may be pressuring the central bank not to act. Early last month, he claimed the exclusive power to appoint the bankers that set interest rates - and to cement his control he has put his son-in-law in charge of economic policy. Mr Erdogan favours lowering borrowing costs to fuel credit growth and economic expansion. Investors are worried that Turkish companies could struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros - a debt pile that only grows as the lira falls. Over a third of Turkish banks' lending is in foreign currencies, according to Reuters. Concerns about contagion were recently reinforced by a report in the Financial Times saying that the European Central Bank is concerned about the exposure of eurozone banks to Turkey. In particular, the report flags that Spain's BBVA, Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas, all of which have significant operations in Turkey, are especially exposed. Eight years ago, concerns about contagion during the eurozone debt crisis saw investors push up the borrowing costs of highly indebted eurozone countries, exacerbating their debt problems.  There are already signs that contagion is spreading, with investors selling riskier assets on Monday. Emerging market currencies fell on along with the lira, while Asian stocks fell across the board."
market volatility,US shares regain ground to close higher,2024-09-15,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42957834,"US stock markets have ended a day of massive fluctuations on a high note, rebounding  after recent steep losses.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.3%, while the Nasdaq hit 2.1% and the S&P 500 rose 1.7%. Stocks shuttled between positive and negative territory throughout the day, their activity spanning more than 1,000 points. On Monday, the Dow had plunged by nearly 1,200 points or 4.6%, triggering losses in Asia and Europe.  ""I think what you're seeing today is, 'Hold on. This got overdone'. The fundamentals of the companies haven't changed since Friday,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at online brokerage TD Ameritrade.  Analysts have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices.  Investors are also fretting over the prospect of rising interest rates, which push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The steep sell-off began last week after data in the US showed stronger than expected wage growth. The report came amid other shifts, including new tax cuts, trade tensions, and a sinking dollar, that analysts say could lead inflation to rise faster than expected. The conditions pose a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which will need to raise interest rates to counter inflation, without moving so aggressively that it severely curbs economic activity. It is not clear how the changing economic currents, including tax cuts, will affect company financials ultimately, said Michael Bapis, managing director of The Bapis Group at Hightower, a wealth management firm in New York. ""You're seeing that volatility now because there's uncertainty,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 4.7%. Markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris had initial losses of up to 3%, before recovering some ground.   London's FTSE 100 closed down almost 200 points or 2.6% at 7141. Frankfurt's Dax and Paris's CAC were down 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. On Monday the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level since April of last year. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow in the US was up 25% and London's FTSE 100 rose 7.6%. Monday's decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US.  US markets opened sharply lower again on Tuesday, but quickly rebounded amid frantic trade that continued throughout the day. Analysts have said the swings in the US markets in part reflect big investors moving to sell stocks and put money in other assets, such as bonds, which benefit from higher interest rates. Other companies that had strategies betting on calm markets also had to adjust. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not think the declines were a sign of broader problems. ""There are no systemic issues,"" he told a congressional panel on Tuesday. ""I don't think these types of moves, given how much the market has rallied, have financial stability concerns."" Even if you don't own shares directly, the chances are that you will be paying into a pension which is invested in shares and bonds. More than nine million people in the UK have auto enrolment pensions, and 12 million are active members of defined contribution schemes. That means the value of the pension is dependent on the value of the investments in it. Similarly, anyone who owns shares or funds in an ISA or a SIPP will have seen the value of their savings fall. But experts point out that investments rise and fall over time, and over the longer term, it should make little difference. ""It is effectively no change for normal investors, in that you have ridden a wave on the way up, so now is not the time to cash in,"" said Rebecca O'Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor. ""This is unwelcome news, but it is fundamentally a not unexpected reaction to the euphoria that saw markets rise so fast."" If you are planning on retiring in the next couple of months, you will have a slightly smaller pension pot than you did at the start of the year. But coincidentally the FTSE 100 is at almost exactly the same place it was a year ago, so you won't have lost anything over that longer term. Furthermore if you have a while to go before you retire, the shares in your pension fund have just become cheaper to buy - so there is a greater chance of them increasing in value. But, as ever, future market trends are difficult to determine. ""Markets are capricious beasts in the short term, and, looking forward, stock prices could move in either direction without defying the laws of statistics,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""However, in the long term, markets are more reliable in generating growth, and so anyone saving for retirement should still consider the stock market as a friend, not a foe."" Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets, but doubt whether there will be a prolonged period of selling. Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, said the recent moves were a ""correction"" rather than a crash. ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added that bear markets - when shares go into a long period of decline - tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. And analyst Laith Khalaf, of Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that, despite the heavy falls on Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones share index is still 20% up on where it stood this time last year."
market volatility,New York Stock Exchange closes trading floor,2024-09-15,2020-03-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51954868,"The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is set to shut in the latest coronavirus-related closure. The Intercontinental Exchange, which operates the NYSE, said all buying and selling of shares will happen electronically from 23 March.  Much of the trading is already electronic. It comes after some staff had tested positive for the virus. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has suggested Wall Street could limit trading hours due to the pandemic. Mr Mnuchin's proposal followed weeks of market turmoil, with wild swings in share prices dragging indexes down roughly 30% from their recent highs. However, New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham said markets do not need to close. ""While we are taking the precautionary step of closing the trading floors, we continue to firmly believe the markets should remain open and accessible to investors,"" she said. ""All NYSE markets will continue to operate under normal trading hours despite the closure of the trading floors."" Ms Cunningham had previously defended the decision to keep the floor open, telling broadcaster CNBC that having people execute and manage trades helped to reduce volatility.  However, in recent days New York has ordered gathering places such as gyms, bowling alleys, theatres, bars and restaurants to shut. It has also closed schools and banned gatherings of more than 50 people. On Wednesday, Governor Andrew Cuomo mandated no more than 50% of staff report to work at non-essential businesses. When the New York Stock Exchange has shut its doors on previous occasions, such as after the September 11 2001 attacks, that has closed markets.  But today, only about 18% of buying and selling happens via the the trading floor, which is a mix of brokers with clients and representatives from major companies. CME Group, which operates other exchanges, announced last week that it was shutting its in-person trading floor. At the time, it said no cases had been reported. Cboe Global Markets made a similar move. It is not surprising the floor of the New York Stock Exchange is closing. It was never a matter of ""if"" but ""when.""  Most of the work done by traders can be done electronically.  But keeping the floor open had symbolic value, suggesting that despite what turmoil may be unfolding elsewhere, America's economy was still open for business.  However, the NYSE also had to contend with the reality on the ground. New York City is contemplating a ""shelter in place"" for all residents and there are hundreds of people moving on and off the floor every day.  If the idea is to try and contain the virus, keeping the floor open was quickly becoming unrealistic."
market volatility,Gas pressure builds further,2024-09-15,2022-01-16,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-60016038,"Monday brings a big moment for Scotland's energy transition. Winners in the auction for 15 ScotWind sea areas will be announced. Covering 8,600 square kilometres, the announcement starts the process of a gigantic effort to put as many as 1,200 turbines out at sea. Many will be of the pioneering floating variety, giving us much more marine wind potential in deeper water. They should, on average production, generate around twice the electricity Scotland needs, though that demand will rise as the nation transitions from carbon fuels to far more electricity use. Faith in that transition is being shaken by the exceptionally high costs for energy coming down the pipeline. Prices are already up. Household bills have been capped, and that cap is likely to rise by about 50% from April. There's no way out of the rising bills. Ofgem, the regulator, is obliged by law to pass on the costs of sourcing energy. We'll find out on 7 February just how high they are going to rise in spring, with the new price cap reflecting the recent soaring price of natural gas. There are ways to mitigate that rise. The government could cut 5% VAT, though that would make only a limited difference, and the biggest part of the tax giveaway would be to well-off people who use the most energy.  Cutting tax, when it is already only a quarter of the VAT rate for most goods and service, would run counter to the net-zero policy of reducing use of fossil fuels. Alternatively, governments - in Holyrood as well as Westminster - could use their resources to offset the impact on the households in most fuel poverty, by expanding the size and reach of welfare benefits, most obviously the £140 per year Warm Homes Discount on bills. With around £600 to £700 extra being loaded onto the annual average bill from April, that would have to be a big uplift to provide the support many people will need. Or government at Westminster could guarantee loans to energy suppliers so that they continue to absorb the increased cost of wholesale gas and electricity, and smooth the effect of the higher input costs.  But that assumes there will be lower wholesale and other costs from spring onwards: that last autumn and this winter have seen exceptional spikes in prices, and we'll return to energy trading to normal.  That's a bold assumption. Here's why, and here are some factors to watch over the next few months. Gas has gone global.  It used to be bought in forward contracts along pipelines, suiting suppliers and customers. The market was regional, dictated by the limitations of pipelines. That has changed.  While a lot of gas is bought on the forward market - a guaranteed price to deliver in a set number of months after the contract is struck - a higher proportion of it is now traded in the volatile spot market. That's the price for delivery the month after next, that has gone from less than 50p a therm for years, to more than £4 in a recent spike. It has since fallen to below £2, but continued volatility is expected. The fall since the start of the year is partly because of the arrival in European ports of ocean-going tankers loaded with LNG, liquified natural gas. These ships, from Qatar or the Gulf of Mexico, go where the price paid is highest, and that's anywhere around the world. So when economies are back to growth in Asia, they bid up the price of the LNG shipments. There's unfinished business back in Britain. We are yet to pay the price of rescuing nearly 30 companies that ceased trading since September.   The average cost of each customer being taken on by one of the surviving companies is estimated at around £1,000. That's the cost of buying further gas supplies for new customers in the market, at a much higher spot price than customers are currently paying.  It also includes the repayment of account credit balances built up by customers over last summer. The deceased suppliers burned through those balances in trying to keep buying on that fast-rising short-term wholesale market.  Surviving suppliers expect to recoup that cost through the Supplier of Last Resort (SoLR) system, and that can be expected to appear in bills from next autumn. So with forward prices for gas in the winter of 2022-23 currently in the region of £2 per therm (four times the price a year ago), and with those extra costs being loaded on, industry insiders say prices will either stay high or they could go a further £500 or £600 higher from October. The energy market is changing. The exceptionally low level of wind across Europe during much of 2021 meant there was a need for back-up, also known as baseload.  Nuclear plants, such as Hunterston, are being closed and in Britain, they are replaced very slowly or not at all. Coal-burning is being shut down. So there is more dependence on gas to provide the baseload supply, meaning demand for gas is up. That has left less of the supply to replenish gas storage. The UK has very little gas storage, preferring to see its upstream primary resource as a form of energy security.  But European countries have lots more storage capacity, and it's been running very low for months. The coming summer will need to see the stocks built up again for next winter. That will require a return to normal wind speeds and a steady supply of gas… which brings us to Vladimir Putin. Europe depends heavily on Russia - Britain much less so, but its gas prices are heavily influenced by demand and supply across Europe. While Norway has stepped up supply through a growing number of pipelines, Russia is in a high-stakes geo-political duel with countries it sees as adversaries on its western flank. Its political leadership is threatening a further invasion of Ukraine, at the same time as demanding that the Nato defence alliance pull troops and weapons back from Russia's frontier and that it pledges not to allow further countries to join.  The ultimatum, thrown down just before Christmas, looks as if it's designed to be rejected by a Kremlin administration that wants to crank up the tensions. Russia wants to commission a Gazprom pipeline already installed from Russia to Germany, but that is fiercely opposed by the USA, it has been stalled by Germany, and its future is tied up with events in Ukraine.  Russia says it has fulfilled its contractual commitments to supply gas through other pipelines, but it is accused of controlling the tap on further supplies in order to put political pressure onto the countries that depend on it. Such behaviour over the past decade is one of the main reasons customers have diversified supply to LNG and to Norway, but there is still a reliance on Russia and a vulnerability.  And as Russia gets more belligerent, there is more pressure placed on to the LNG tanker market. The early stages of talks between the US and Russia, and then between Nato and Russia, have not shown much sign of reducing this tension. Students of international relations might wonder where the British PM is in this sharply rising period of international tensions, given that the UK has a seat on the UN Security Council and is one of Nato's bigger contributors. The answer: in a career-threatening crisis about partying and boozing in Downing Street. Government policy is for the distribution costs of electricity - the high voltage cabling and local distribution networks - to be shifted on to gas. That is part of the response to global warming, and the pledge to get to net zero.  The idea is to create a strengthening incentive to shift from gas to electricity. Given current price rises, that doesn't look imminent. But it remains policy. That drive towards net zero was given a lot of impetus by the COP26 gathering in Glasgow last November. You may recall that conference nearly foundered on the issue of whether coal was to be ""phased out"" or, in the words of the final agreement ""phased down"". What followed some weeks later was a report from the International Energy Agency, showing that burning of coal reached new records last year.  China and India, in particular, are using coal to fuel economic growth, with China hard hit in recent months by a shortage of power supply. With gas prices high globally, coal has become a financially attractive alternative. Britain has returned to coal-burning to support that electricity baseload - a last gasp in the final years before its coal plants are finally extinguished. COP26 also featured pressure on the British government and others to put a stop to further drilling for oil and gas. The imperative of limiting the rise in global temperatures is reckoned to mean that we have already tapped all the reserves we can allow ourselves to exploit. And yet with both gas and oil prices riding high, investment is back into boom times. Rystad energy consultancy says it is on course to rise from $601bn to $628bn this year. It has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, but it is on course to do so by 2024.  As part of that, gas and LNG upstream investments are rising 14% to $149bn. Upstream oil (exploration and production, that is) is rising 7% to $307bn. The campaign to 'keep it in the ground' is not going well."
market volatility,Why is Christmas dinner more expensive this year?,2024-09-15,2017-11-28,By Alex Taylor,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42152612,"The cost of Christmas dinner is set to increase, with even the UK's cheapest supermarket spread destined to be 16% more expensive than in 2016.  That's according to Good Housekeeping magazine's annual festive food survey which looked at Britain's 10 biggest stores. A Christmas meal for eight people - including 11 essential components, bought at the lowest price available - has risen from £19.82 last year to £23.53 this festive season. Around the table, this equates to £2.94 per head compared with £2.48 last year.  It's worth noting though, of course, that what you end up paying for Christmas dinner will depend on how you shop and how much time you have to do it, as BBC Reality Check discovered previously.   Good Housekeeping also have very specific criteria for the ingredients they choose. Nine of the 11 items are more expensive in their cheapest form, including turkey. The cheapest bird, according to Good Housekeeping is now up to £8.99 from £8 - a 12% increase. Potatoes have seen the biggest jump from 29p for the cheapest bag last year to £1.49 for a comparable amount this time.  Good Housekeeping says it will only accept Maris Piper or King Edward potatoes in its survey and a 1.5kg bag of Maris Piper potatoes from Co-op costing £1.49 is the cheapest price submitted by any retailer that fits its requirements. However, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board says growers are being paid less for their potatoes this year and the consumer is also paying less - and indeed, a quick comparison site check suggests you can buy 2.5kg of potatoes from many stores for significantly less than £1.49. So, it's all about the type of spuds, it seems. When it comes to dessert, Christmas pudding fans, at least, will be pleased to see a drop in price, but other sweet treats have gone up.  The cheapest pack of six mince pies is 9p more this year, brandy butter is 24p more and it seems you can't get a Christmas cake for less than £3.99 compared with £3 in 2016. Overall, nine supermarkets are more expensive than last year, with Aldi, Morrisons and Iceland all increasing their prices by more than 13%.  Marks & Spencer is the only supermarket whose basket has got cheaper, dropping its prices by more than 20%.  Lidl offers the most cost-effective overall deal for Christmas dinner at £25.53, whilst Waitrose is deemed most expensive at £41.47. The findings from Good Housekeeping represent the biggest year-on-year cost increase since it began its survey nine years ago. This reflects rising food prices across the UK, as the weak pound pushes up import costs. Food inflation hit a three-year high in May, according to the British Retail Consortium, and is now nearing 4.2% - the highest since October 2013. Much of this is down to the ""sterling effect"" - the sharp fall in the value of the pound following the EU referendum. Brexit-induced uncertainty has affected supermarkets, with Sainsbury's, for one, warning about rising costs and falling consumer confidence as it reported a drop in annual profits. The instability has also hit farmers, unsure how to price their goods in the current climate. A National Farmers Union spokesman told the BBC: ""British farmers have been dealing with a lot of uncertainty and price volatility since the vote to leave the EU.  ""But as producers of the raw ingredients for a food and drink sector, farmers are price-takers rather than price-makers; increasing costs on farm, for example, are rarely passed on to the companies buying the farmers' produce."" Steve Dresser, director at Grocery Insight, said the problems are similar for supermarkets from a business perspective: ""The diminished pound means that any supplies bought in Europe are more expensive than they were pre-Brexit when Sterling was stronger. ""Lots of supply agreements are done with a long outlook, which means that deals may have been struck for Christmas well before the result of the referendum was known.  ""Therefore, these supply agreements will reflect the changes in the market and lead to higher prices, despite the retailers best efforts to keep a lid on increases. But festive cheer need not disappear right away. Shoppers can still save by shopping around. ""Bargains are thin on the ground this Christmas, so supermarket choice is crucial,"" said Caroline Bloor, consumer director at Good Housekeeping.  ""A turkey will usually be your biggest outlay, so if you can find quality and value, you'll be off to a great start. Aldi and Lidl have the cheapest one this year. Now is not the time for loyalty - swapping supermarkets is the best way to save."" Vicki Parry, 27, from Heswall in Merseyside, cooks Christmas lunch every year for her parents and three siblings, as well as her own two young children. She says the family found that researching the best deal can make a big difference. ""Last year we really noticed the price increase - food, as with everything else, seems to be getting more expensive. ""Our solution as a family was to shop around online and in-store. We knew what we wanted, but rather than buy all our ingredients from one place, we tried to mix things up. ""Taking the time definitely saved us money - we'll do the same this year."""
market volatility,How is UK election affecting Asian business?,2024-09-15,2017-06-09,By Leisha Chi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40211161,"Uncertainty hangs over the UK after Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to call a snap general election backfired, resulting in a hung parliament.  The pound has dropped by more than 2% against the dollar, sterling's biggest one-day fall since the Brexit referendum vote last June. So far there has not been much in the way of global contagion in the currency or stock markets.  But in Asia, where shares were trading as results drifted in, some companies heavily exposed to the UK saw their share prices fall.  Asian firms with big investments in Britain were under pressure over concerns political uncertainty will complicate Brexit negotiations. They include infrastructure firm CKI, Power Assets and CK Hutchison, which are all owned by Chinese billionaire Li Ka-Shing. Shares in those businesses are down nearly 2%.  Malaysian property conglomerate YTL, Singapore-based transport firm Comfortdelgro and property firm City Developments also have investments in Britain.  ""Without question, there is volatility ahead. The market is desperate for any indication of what a Brexit deal might look like,"" Lee Hardman, an analyst at MUFG said. For financial firms in the UK, one looming question about Brexit is whether they would have to move their operations if they lost access to the single market - an issue over so-called European passporting rights.  Shares in British lenders Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC slipped by about 1% on Asian markets as the prospect of a hung parliament became clearer.  Fund manager Janus Henderson, which is also heavily exposed to the UK market for revenues, fell by about 1.5% in Sydney trading. The Australia-listed CYBG, which owns the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, fell as much as 1.4% before recovering. The firm, which was spun from National Australia Bank last year, gets all of its revenues from the UK. Overall Asian stock markets have largely shrugged off the election upset - as well as digesting possible implications from former FBI director James Comey's testimony to a US Senate committee. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index closed 0.5% higher and South Korea's Kospi cended the day up 0.8%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was flat, the Shanghai composite end 0.1% higher and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.3%, Follow Leisha on Twitter."

The Irish Minister for Agriculture said the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure will be funded by the government and the EU.  Michael Creed said it he was ""keenly aware that the last number of months have been very difficult for beef farmers"". He said the scheme aims to provide financial aid to farmers most affected. Mr Creed added: ""There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance."" He said this fund, combined with the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot introduced earlier this year, provides ""an injection of up to €120m"" to the sector. Farmers must meet certain eligibility criteria to qualify.  Eligible farmers are to get €100 per animal slaughtered between 24 September 2018 and 12 May 2019, covering up to a maximum of 100 animals per herd. A payment of €40 will also be made on suckler cows that calved in 2018, up to a maximum of 40 suckler cows. Dairy herds are not eligible for the measure, with the exception of dairy herds of less than 40 dairy cows. Animals that are controlled by slaughtering establishments, and dealer/agent herds, are not eligible for the aid. If it is oversubscribed, payment rates may be subject to minor revision. The scheme will open for applications during the third week of August."
market volatility,Investment boss in tearful video apology,2024-09-15,2018-11-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46295109,"The boss of a Florida-based financial firm has made a tearful video apology to clients after bad bets on oil and natural gas prices wiped out their investments. James Cordier blamed a recent bout of market volatility for the losses, which are set to destroy his firm. ""I truly invested your funds like you were family,"" he said in the 10-minute video posted on YouTube. ""I'm sorry that this rogue wave capsized our boat."" Natural gas prices enjoyed their biggest one-day percentage gain in eight years on Wednesday last week, only to suffered their largest one-day loss in 15 years the very next day. Meanwhile, oil prices have also fallen sharply. Mr Cordier is president of OptionSellers.com, based in Tampa, and co-wrote a book called The Complete Guide to Option Selling. The company managed money for wealthy investors and specialised in options, which give investors the right to buy or sell at a pre-determined price. OptionSellers said the losses were its ""clients' private business. We are in communication with them."" It was not clear how much money the firm managed or the size of the losses. Mr Cordier said in his video that he had 290 clients. However, the losses could total more than $150m, according to Ohio lawyer Jason Albin, who has been in contact with about 80 clients. Mr Albin said he thought the trades, which in some cases involved retirement accounts, should not have been permitted because of the risk involved.  He is looking at taking legal action against INTL FCStone, the brokerage that cleared the bets on behalf of Mr Cordier's company. INTL FCStone declined to comment on the claims. The firm said accounts managed by Optionsellers.com were liquidated after ""unprecedented volatility"" in the oil and gas markets last week. ""Although well collateralized, accounts managed by a commodities trading advisor, Optionsellers.com, had to be liquidated as a result of these moves,"" the company said. ""Liquidation of these accounts was in accordance with our customer agreements and our obligations under market regulation and standards."""

A decision on the shape of the final policy will not be taken until devolved government returns.  It is envisaged that even under domestic arrangements there will be little change until 2022, when a new NI specific system could be introduced.  It is hoped it can improve farmers' productivity, protect their incomes from external shocks like extreme weather or market volatility and encourage them to work in a way which is more environmentally sustainable.  Many farmers rely heavily on support payments for the bulk of their income.  The Ulster Farmers' Union welcomed the consultation but said it was frustrated it had taken so long ""to get the document onto the table"". ""We have to make sure that Brexit is an opportunity for farmers here,"" said president Ivor Ferguson. ""This is an opportunity to create a better system, and it is essential we take this chance to get it right."" The policy paper says such payments can help farms remain viable but can also mask inefficiency.  In coming years it suggests a farm payment which is lower than that currently received and asks for views on the appropriate level.  It also suggests differentiated payments depending on the condition and quality of the land farmed.  Measures could be considered to stop larger farms being overcompensated and prevent money going to non-commercial holdings.  A range of other measures such as income insurance and a deposit scheme, which farmers could save to in good years and draw cash from in bad years, are also suggested.  The new farm policy would encourage farmers to help address significant environmental challenges linked to the industry including water pollution and ammonia emissions which impact biodiversity and sensitive sites.  It says changes in farming practices could deliver ""major gains"" which should be the focus of new proposals.  The policy proposal states farmers should be financially rewarded for providing ""public goods"" like improved biodiversity and asked to help design schemes to do this on a landscape-wide level.  Targets include increases in important habitats and species at favourable status; improved soil and water quality; reduced ammonia emissions and a continuing fall in the carbon intensity of food production.  The paper does not go into detail about what proportion of farm income might be drawn from such schemes.  The policy document also focuses on plans to drive innovation and encourage farmers to share knowledge and get qualifications and training.  There are also proposals to encourage investment and attract young farmers into the industry.  It includes suggestions on a move away from the system of short-term land leasing called conacre to a more efficient system of long term rental. "
market volatility,SSE gas and electricity prices to rise again in NI,2024-09-15,2022-08-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62688553,"The energy company SSE Airtricity is putting up its gas and electricity prices in Northern Ireland again. Gas prices will rise by 28.3% from 1 October and electricity prices will go up by 35.4% from the same date. It comes after Ofgem announced the energy price cap in Great Britain will rise to £3,549 a year from October. However, some consumers in NI will be the equivalent of £1,000 a year better off than customers in the rest of UK, the region's energy regulator has said. The chief executive of the Utility Regulator, John French, has calculated that the equivalent combined gas and electricity customers in Northern Ireland will pay £2,393 a year from October. ""I fully recognise that this differential between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is cold-comfort to those who are struggling here,"" he added. Peter McClenaghan, from the Consumer Council, said Northern Ireland was ""facing into a very serious crisis this winter"" and he is angry and fearful on behalf of consumers. The Consumer Council provides advice to consumers and Mr McClenaghan said that ""already many of our households are at the brink"". ""This announcement means consumers in Belfast face combined annual gas and electricity bills in excess of £2,500 a year, with further price increases to come,"" he said. Other companies will also be putting up their prices as they are buying energy in the same wholesale markets as SSE Airtricity. Those wholesale markets are currently a horror show, suggesting that energy prices will continue rising steeply into the early months of next year. SSE Airtricity is Northern Ireland's largest household gas supplier with about 188,000 customers. Those customers have already seen the price they pay more than double since the spring of last year. The Utility Regulator says the latest increase in the price of gas - the fifth since April 2021 - will be equivalent to another £351 a year. Mr French said the wholesale gas market was ""[continuing] to surge"". ""[It] is producing prices 16 times higher than normal historic rates,"" he said. ""We will continue to do everything in our control to support consumers at this very difficult time."" The announcement by SSE Airtricity comes on the day Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy confirmed that the UK government would deliver an energy bill discount of £400 to help households in Northern Ireland that are struggling with the increasing cost of living. But he said there was no guarantee that Northern Ireland households would receive the discount in October, when those in the rest of the UK are due to get it. Donna Dugan, from Carrowdore, County Down, works full-time and cares for her mother Anne, 86, who has vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. She says the price of home heating oil has ""gone up a lot"". ""We got an oil fill up just before the summer period - we normally pay a certain amount every month - and unfortunately this time we were £400 short, which is quite extraordinary for us. ""Over the summer, we have had the heating off completely and we've never had to do that before."" They have also reduced the number of baths Anne has to reduce costs, and she takes more showers instead. Donna says the £400 energy bill discount would make a ""huge difference"". She says it is imperative that ""something is done really urgently"" to tackle the issue. ""I worry that if mummy's situation deteriorates, the impact that will have on my ability to work.  ""I need to work, it's not a choice for me to have reduced hours because we couldn't financially manage. I need to work full-time."" Craig Harrison, of Carers NI, said ""carers are on their knees, financially"".  ""We had the worst rate of carer poverty of anywhere in the UK even before the cost of living crisis began to bite,"" he added. ""Carers' financial situation on all fronts has just deteriorated more and more since then."" He said day-to-day, carers are going hungry, because they cannot afford to buy food. Mr Harrison said they were missing mortgage payments, and borrowing money from friends and family to get by.  ""I'm even aware of female carers having to make their own sanitary products."" SSE Airtricity is also the second largest supplier of household electricity, with about 168,000 customers. They will see their bills rise by the equivalent of another £330 a year. SSE Airtricity managing director Klair Neenan said: ""It was hoped market volatility would ease but the global energy crisis continues to impact gas and electricity costs for all energy suppliers. ""We are acutely aware of the impact this has for households and are working hard to help where we can."" The company said any customer who was concerned or having difficulty with their energy costs should ""please contact us and we will work with you to find a solution together"". Two-thirds of homes in Northern Ireland use oil for their heating. The Consumer Council tracks the price of home-heating oil and its data suggests that prices fell during July, roughly in line with the price of Brent crude oil. But prices have started to increase again in the past two weeks. The Northern Ireland energy market is very different from the rest of the UK for a variety of historical reasons. The electricity market was liberalised much later than the rest of the UK; the former state-owned incumbent still has half the domestic market and there are only a handful of suppliers. The gas network is a relatively recent development and there are still regulated monopoly suppliers in some areas. That means the market is regulated differently from the rest of the UK, for example without the price cap mechanism. Mr French believes that Northern Ireland's simpler market is part of the reason for the lower prices in Northern Ireland. He told BBC News NI: ""We price regulate one company at a time, so we are regulating SEE Airtricity at the moment, that was the announcement today. ""What they are doing in GB in terms of the price cap is looking at the 70 odd companies and try to give an announcement that covers the needs of those 70 companies."" He said that while the GB price cap is forecast to go towards £5,000 in January at the moment he does not see that in the current market for Northern Ireland. It is difficult to give an overall energy cost comparison between Northern Ireland and GB because Northern Ireland is still heavily reliant on heating oil for home heating."
market volatility,Pound surges on Brexit deal hopes,2024-09-15,2019-10-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50011444,"Sterling surged on Friday to a three-month high amid investor optimism about a last-minute Brexit deal between Britain and the European Union. Against the dollar the pound rose 1.9% to $1.2682, and against the euro was up 1.67% at €1.1489. The currency has rallied more than 3% since Thursday, its biggest two-day gain since before the June 2016 referendum on leaving the EU. Many UK-focused shares also surged, with Royal Bank of Scotland up 11.6%. On Friday, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he had had a ""constructive"" meeting with UK Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. That followed talks between the Irish and British prime ministers on Thursday, after which a joint statement spoke of ""a pathway to a possible deal"". Deutsche Bank's foreign exchange strategist George Saravelos said he was ""turning more optimistic on Brexit"" and no longer negative on the pound, while JPMorgan said the Anglo-Irish statement may have ""changed everything"". ""The chances of a deal seem to have improved and the pound has moved accordingly but hurdles still remain,"" said Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management. ""Time to thrash out the details of the deal are tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval."" Other analysts cautioned that trading on the financial markets was thin, leading to higher volatility and a sharp jump in some share prices. Meanwhile, another analyst said the price surges were probably due to algorithms driving the market. Following the more confident noises coming from Brussels, London and Dublin, there were hopes that a meeting between British and EU negotiators will pave the way for a Brexit transition deal at a summit on 17-18 October. The rally in sterling undermined the UK's export-heavy FTSE 100 stocks, and the blue chip index itself was up under 0.9%. But shares exposed to UK growth and consumers soared. Housebuilders Persimmon, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey rose more than 10%. Next rose nearly 8.5%, and ITV more than 6%. The more UK-focussed FTSE 250 index was up more than 4%. The yield on 10-year British government bonds was on track for its biggest three-day rise since 2017."
market volatility,Aston Martin boss hits back at the doubters,2024-09-15,2019-03-06,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47457220,"The boss of Aston Martin Lagonda has delivered a passionate defence of the company's strategy amid signs some city investors are losing faith. Andy Palmer said the company will prove the sceptics wrong, as he stressed the luxury carmaker's long-term plans and importance to UK manufacturing. Aston Martin's shares slumped last week as the UK's only quoted carmaker posted its first results since going public. It comes as Aston rolled out its latest products at the Geneva Motor Show. These include models to take on the likes of Ferrari, Rolls-Royce and Bentley, meaning that James Bond's favourite carmaker will soon be able to compete in all segments of the luxury car market, from hypercars to sports utility vehicles. But Mr Palmer fears that Aston Martin's ""good news message"" is being drowned out. Last month, the shares sank about 20% after the carmaker delivered its maiden set of profit figures. The share price went below £11, having debuted on the London Stock Market last October at £19. One long-time city observer said Aston Martin's very brief life as a public company was so far the worst he had seen in almost 30 years. But Mr Palmer blamed the share price slide and criticism on people who don't understand the long-term investment case.  And because the actual number of shares listed is relatively small, this increases the price volatility. ""My disappointment with last week's reaction is because the results were, in fact, really, really strong,"" he insisted. Mr Palmer wants people to understand Aston Martin's importance to British manufacturing.  ""Everything else has been sold. When everything is sold overseas, when you come to economic downturns it is much easier to switch off a plant if it's not in your home backyard.  ""It's much easier for Honda to close their plant or for Nissan to turn off the X-Trail... because [the HQs] are a long way from home. ""We need to create engineers in the UK; we need to create intellectual property; we need to create apprentices. When you don't own your own industry, you can't guarantee that you can do that."" The UK car industry ""messed up in the 1970s and '80s"", says Mr Palmer, an executive at Nissan before taking the top job at Aston Martin. ""It's a legacy time bomb that has been sitting with us for some time."" The motor show launch included the first car to be produced under the company's revival of the legendary Lagonda marque. Lagonda is being re-launched as an all-electric brand, with the All-Terrain Concept unveiled at the show set to go into production at Aston Martin's new factory at St Athan, Wales, in 2022. The car will line up against the Rolls-Royce Cullinan and Bentley's Bentayga, although Mr Palmer expects his product to be more appealing to millionaire tech entrepreneurs. The car will have a range of about 400 miles, and wireless rapid-charge technology - and cost about £300,000. The Lagonda brand was born in 1899 and ""we need to invigorate it,"" Mr Palmer said. ""It will be the first all-electric vehicle luxury car brand."" Aston Martin also unveiled its Vanquish Vision, a 200-mph supercar to challenge Ferrari's new F8 Tributo and latest Lamborghinis. The Vision's price tag is at least £250,000. Completing the line-up of launches was a £1m hypercar, called the AM-RB 003. It will be put into production in late 2021. Mr Palmer described the unveilings as ""a show of force… It shows our long term story remains strong and on track,"" he told the BBC.  The Geneva displays are part of the company's Second Century strategy to launch one new model a year for seven years. With the launch of a planned new Lagonda sedan, in production from 2023, that strategy will be complete. After that, ""it's copy-repeat, copy-repeat"", he said. He described Second Century as a defensive plan to protect Aston Martin, loss-making for decades, against downturns in the global economic cycle and changing markets. ""We'll have a company more capable of dealing with these things,"" he said. ""My job is to make sure the company is prepared for these events."" Mr Palmer has been a vocal critic of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, putting his head above the parapet long before many other executives. ""The worry is that you get contaminated with the Brexit story."" But he is hopeful an agreement will be done before 29 March because he ""finds it inconceivable that sensible people in Brussels and UK can't find a deal"". There is, of course, the rest of the world to worry about, although Aston Martin's key China and US markets are doing well. He is particularly pleased with the continuing growth in China, where 50% of customers are now female. So-called rich empowered females are an important growth market, including in Saudi Arabia, where driving restrictions on women have been lifted. The company has opened more dealerships in the country. Mr Palmer accepts that Aston Martin still has a macho, perhaps intimidating reputation - a legacy of the 007 connection. But that's more the case in the West, he believes. ""The preconception does not exist in China, which is why we've been able to get to 50%"". But the company still needs to do more to attract women buyers and get them into the showrooms for a test drive, he says. There will be no ""pinking and shrinking"" of the cars, but much more emphasis on marketing and approach. ""We don't want to alienate any potential customer, male or female."" He has set up a female advisory board, made up of the sort of rich empowered females he wants to buy his cars. They meet about once a quarter to advise on everything from car design to car advertising.  ""When men talk about female customers they can sound condescending, even though that's not the intention. The advisory board helps us to get the tone and manner right."" If only setting the right tone and manner among city investors was as easy."
market volatility,Espresso economy: making it slowly,2024-09-15,2018-02-14,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43061928,"If you like your coffee, you've probably stood in the queue behind someone wanting a decaff soya machiatto latte with triple salchow twist, wishing they'd order something a bit simpler, and faster to make. But the making of coffee can be something of a performance, particularly if the freshness of the grind and the frothiness of the milk is what you're paying more than three quid for. Only so many people can squeeze behind the counter to make them. So those of us who like a hit of fancy caffeine have to show a bit of patience. In more economic terms, we have to accept the limits on the efficiency and speed of production. That freshness and personal service puts a constraint on the barista's productivity. In other words, it's hard to see how the barista's employer can get her, or him, to deliver more coffees per hour. At best, the coffee chain can persuade the customer to add value by paying more for extra elements to the coffee that take little time to add. It's easier to see how someone on a production line can improve productivity.  Processes can be honed. A culture of continuous improvement can look for the edge that gets the job done with less resource, or with more reliability, reducing the cost of wastage. Or bosses may sanction the capital expenditure with which to buy new equipment, some of which may replace workers. But for those providing a service, getting more value out of each hour worked is harder.  It's true of making coffee, and of serving in a restaurant or hotel. It's a challenge in education or the health service, particularly if the measure is of quality as well as patient or pupil throughput. This matters because, without improving the value a worker adds per hour, wages and prosperity are going to stall. And that's one of the key economic problems - arguably the biggest one - that we currently face. Productivity growth has stalled in Britain.  And we have new evidence of how the stalling is more of a problem in Scotland. There was a sort of rejoicing some months back, or at least relief, when the figures for 2015 (they take a while to collect) appeared to show that Scottish productivity had caught up with that of the UK as a whole. That is, the amount of output per hour worked in Scotland was getting very close to the amount for the UK.  That's after years when Scots had, on average, been less productive.  In the modern era, using modern data, Scotland has lagged.  But, we told ourselves last year, not any longer. It was pointed out that to have caught up with the UK on productivity was only the start. The UK has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. But new Scottish government figures, published on Wednesday, suggest that 2015 may have been something of a peak, from which Scottish productivity has since been on the slide. Every way you look at it, it's down. The last positive quarter was in July to September 2015. Up to the third quarter of last year, the previous five quarters had been negative.  Just taking the previous four quarters adds up to an annualised decline of 3.2%. But get some clever statisticians to iron out the volatility and seasonal factors (if you insist, ""a trend-based estimate of quarterly growth based on a centred moving average"") and you get to a mere 0.7%.  Still negative, though. If you average things over the year, which is another way of ironing out volatility, output per hour was down more than 1% in 2016. We don't have the full figures for 2017, but it looks like ending up as a steeper drop. And for those who see comparison with the UK as being the key measure of success, how is it looking? Well, it's looking a bit like divergence, and not in a good way. The gap closed at its fastest rate in 2008 and 2009. We could guess that's because the high productivity of London's financial sector took a very big dive with the great recession, making Scots look relatively better. Since 2009, Scottish productivity has been above 96% of the UK's level, and the gap was closing. But in the past two years, it's widened slightly.  Is there a particular sector of the economy that helps explain this?  Oil and gas or finance, for instance?  The statisticians have done some experimental work on this.  It tends towards showing only why further statistical delving is of limited use. Construction figures can be helped a lot by capital investment, for instance.  And if the measure of the property sector is value added, then rising house prices can make productivity look good, without anything productive having happened. The less unreliable numbers show how weak productivity growth is in hospitality, and in government services. And indeed, all of these are merely numbers, derived from survey evidence of the hours people work and separate surveys of employers about how much they produce.  They reflect, to a significant extent, the successful jobs market in which unemployment is very low.  (You could make productivity look much better by firing the least productive workers, though to be clear, that's not a recommendation from me.) The statistics can reflect labour force changes in the way people work, and the patterns in which employers offer additional hours.  So you could choose to pick holes in the methodology. (One proposal from an independence-minded think tank this week is that Scotland's statistical problems can best be addressed with its own statistical agency.) You could also argue that the gap with the rest of the UK is not that worryingly wide.   But the trend is of very weak improvement. And in recent quarters, it's been going in the wrong direction.  The challenge remains of identifying why productivity has been so poor, and what can be done about it. So I offer, in full, the Scottish government's take on the numbers: ""Scotland's economy continues to grow and, while there is no room for complacency, it is encouraging that these statistics show a strong increase in the number of hours worked in recent quarters.  ""Despite the dip in productivity over the last year, annual productivity levels have increased by 5.4% in Scotland since 2007, compared to only 1.4% growth for the UK as a whole.  ""The most recent labour market statistics show our unemployment rate has been lower than the UK's for 11 consecutive months and we are also outperforming the UK on employment, unemployment and inactivity rates for young people and women, demonstrating that the fundamentals of our economy continue to be strong. ""However it cannot be stressed enough that Brexit remains the single biggest threat to our economy. Our latest analysis, confirmed by the UK government's own analysis shows a hard-Brexit could cost Scotland's economy £12.7 billion a year by 2030, so we continue to use all of the powers at our disposal to grow our economy."" So the analysis there is: more people are working, and longer hours.  The chosen benchmark for these numbers is by comparison with the UK as a whole. Taking 2007 as the starting point that proves the point most clearly, the productivity gap with the UK has narrowed (but both are very weak). And, according to this Holyrood view, Brexit is the big threat. Well, maybes aye...  But even if the process stopped now, it's not clear that would do anything to solve the productivity puzzle.  And that puzzle, with respect, is ""a fundamental of our economy""."
market volatility,US shares see their biggest weekly gain in 46 years,2024-09-15,2020-04-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52239979,"US stocks have just recorded their biggest weekly gain since 1974 despite the bleak economic outlook. Wall Street's S&P 500 shares index has risen 12% this week, as the US central bank announced more stimulus measures to support the economy. Financial markets have experienced extreme volatility as the economic impact from the coronavirus worsens. Gold prices hit a seven-year high with many investors still remaining cautious about the future of the global economy. ""It looks like the Fed are on a mission to blow holes in every dam that stops the flow of credit. And it sure sounds like they have plenty more dynamite if needed,"" said Stephen Innes, global chief market strategist at Axicorp.  ""Markets have been encouraged by corona curves flattening in Europe, exits from lockdowns in China, and talk of economic reopening globally. The level optimism has caught virtually everyone by surprise.""  On Thursday, the Federal Reserve said an additional $2.3 trillion was available to support debt markets saying it would act ""forcefully, pro-actively, and aggressively"" to combat an economic tidal wave. The strong words came after data showed US jobless claims jumped by 6.6 million, taking the three-week total to more than 16 million unemployed and seeking benefits. The Fed's chairman Jerome Powell emphasised the central bank's measures were temporary, but that there was ""no limit"" to the dollar amounts it can deploy for programmes already on the books. Markets were also lifted by comments from Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who said there may end up being fewer fatalities from the coronavirus than earlier forecast. He placed the number at around 60,000 Americans, compared to earlier estimates of up to 240,000 deaths."

Nexus, which operates the rail system, predicts charges this year will be £4m higher than previously expected, according to a new report. It said costs had ""increased significantly"". It comes after the network received several government bailouts following a collapse in user numbers amid the coronavirus pandemic. Nexus would not confirm its total energy costs, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but said: ""The cost of high-voltage power which is used to operate the Metro system has increased significantly due to the volatility of the energy market. ""We are working to achieve the lowest possible price for our power supply in the year ahead, but it is still too early to predict what the extra cost will be.

market volatility,Goldman Sachs results beat expectations,2024-09-15,2017-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41648796,"US banking giant Goldman Sachs has reported a fall in third-quarter profits following a further fall in bond trading revenue. However, the 26% drop in bond trading revenue was smaller than expected, following a slump of 40% in the second quarter.    Goldman's net income for the quarter fell by 3% from a year earlier to $2.04bn (£1.55bn).   Rival Morgan Stanley posted a stronger-than-expected rise in profits. Net income rose 11% to $1.69bn in the third quarter, helped by record revenues in its wealth management division which offset the decline in trading activity.  ""Our third quarter results reflected the stability our wealth management, investment banking and investment management businesses bring when our sales and trading business faces a subdued environment,"" said Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman. Goldman's bond-trading division has seen three consecutive quarters of declines as a result of low volatility in the market for trading fixed income, commodities and currencies.  However, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said: ""After two quarters in a row severely missing Wall Street's bond trading estimates, Goldman's 26% decline did not look so bad. ""While we did not see a sharp rebound in (bond) trading, one can, at a minimum, say that this quarter Goldman looked pretty much like everyone else.""   Goldman's bond trading results were of particular interest because it is more dependent on trading than rivals and it does not have a significant retail operation to offset recent declines. The bank's better-than-expected overall results were also fuelled by its performance in private equity investments and from higher fees that it earned through dealmaking."
market volatility,Costing a packet? Biscuit prices rise,2024-09-15,2017-12-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42199020,"Cracking open some fancy biscuits is a welcome treat over Christmas, but this year the observant shopper might notice a hefty rise in prices. Research by The Grocer based on data from Brandview has found price rises of up to a third on own-label Christmas biscuits sold by supermarkets. It said five supermarkets had increased prices with shortbread and gingerbread the main victims. The report says that a steep rise in butter prices is partly to blame. Biscuits featured in the report include: A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: ""The cost of individual products is determined by a number of factors and prices can fluctuate, both up and down, as a consequence. We remain committed to providing our customers with great quality and value every time they shop with us."" Waitrose disputed the report's finding that its Christmas Choc Shortcake Selection (585g) had risen from £4 to £5. It said The Grocer had taken a discounted price in 2016 and the price was actually unchanged from last year. There has been a trend this year of rising food prices, driven by the weakness of the pound which makes imported food more expensive. The latest inflation figures showed that in October the price of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose at an annual rate of 4.1%, the highest since September 2013. Butter has seen even steeper rises, which experts says reflects falling milk production. Data from European Commission showed that for the year to the end of October, butter prices had risen by 47% compared to last year. In recent weeks the price has fallen a bit, which has been welcomed by the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). A spokesperson for the FDF said: ""We will continue to monitor dairy market developments closely because extremes of price volatility are not helpful for UK food manufacturers or for the wider supply chain."""
market volatility,Modelling the economic impact of Brexit,2024-09-15,2018-11-29,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-46384747,"The economic impact of Brexit has been keeping the modellers busy. On one day, the UK Treasury and Bank of England both published estimates of how different Brexit arrangements might be expected to go, the day after the Scottish government updated its figures.   The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is doing likewise, following the International Monetary Fund. So some questions: They all differ, depending on the assumptions fed into the models. But they all agree - that any kind of Brexit is going to mean lower output from the UK economy into the long-term, when compared with the trajectory of the economy if the UK stayed within the European Union. What they also show - or at least, none of them disagree: a hard Brexit or ""no deal"" Brexit would be worse for economic output than any other variety of Brexit. So the economy can be expected to grow. But the Treasury reckons there could be a 3.9% gap, after 15 years, between the output of the economy if the government's White Paper from July were to be implemented, and unchanged links with the EU. Compare that with the 9.3% gap between EU membership in 2034 and a ""no deal"" departure from the EU. The Scottish government has a different take, updating its numbers from earlier this year, to say the average Scot would be £1,600 worse off by 2030, under the prime minister's plan.   That equates to having 7.4% less real disposable income, while business investment would drop around 7.7%.  The same figures were related to a Free Trade Agreement, when they ran the numbers in St Andrew's House earlier in the year. That's what Theresa May says. Others disagree, saying that voting down her deal should lead to other options being brought forward, or re-entering negotiations with Michel Barnier. But because the PM wants to focus minds on her version of the choice, the Whitehall figures are also presented as a positive premium of the White Paper or Free Trade Agreement when compared with ""no deal"". Thus, by starting from a really bad ""no deal"" baseline, the White Paper option can be made to look like it will deliver a 6.9% boost to the economy, or a typical/average Free Trade Agreement would add 2.7%.   The modelling that refers to the White Paper was by Whitehall economists. It looks like they were unable to make assumptions about the deal being put to MPs on 11 December, because so little is known about the way it might turn out 15 years from now. Being in the government machine, it might have seemed politically unhelpful to say so. The deal being pushed by the prime minister is detailed on the transition arrangements, but leaves a lot to be negotiated beyond that. The Treasury economists looked at outcomes that could veer towards a typical Free Trade Agreement (no tariffs, but customs barriers, something like the EU's new relationship with Canada) or membership of the European Economic Area (like Norway).  The Canadian-style option would carry a higher cost to economic growth (a bigger hit to its potential) than the Norwegian-flavoured one. That's reckoned to be the time it might take for the new relationships between the UK and its trading partners to settle into some sort of pattern.  So take note, all ye who say ""just get it over with"".  Whatever happens, this will take years to get it ""over with"". The UK Treasury model includes some heroic assumptions about the speed at which Liam Fox's Department for International Trade could do deals with other countries.  No other country has succeeded in striking so many deals so quickly. An important point arising from the models, including the Scottish government and the Treasury, is that the effects change over time. So in Scotland, over the short to medium term, the first years would be mainly affected by trade and tariff barriers.  But as businesses adjust to that, the role of net migration begins to have a more significant impact, and likewise productivity. Lower net migration can be expected to reduce the rate of growth.  And less inward investment means less of a contribution to productivity improvements from new processes and ideas coming in from abroad. The St Andrew's House economists say that, by 2030, productivity would account for 60% of the difference in GDP between a ""no deal"" Brexit and EU membership, while migration would explain 26% of it.  That leaves only 14% to be explained by the more obvious barriers to trade, such as tariffs. And this assumes no change to the way the EU Single Market operates.  If, for instance, Brussels deepens the integration of financial services, which it would like to do, that could have a big impact on growth within the EU over the next decade. It would widen the growth gap with the UK. Almost certainly, yes. The UK Treasury model takes a look at this, and reckons that the regions of England with the most dependence on exporting manufactured goods (for which they import some components) would be hardest hit by a hard Brexit. That includes north-east England and the West Midlands, where the impact on the car industry and chemicals would be felt strongest.  For north-east England, ""no deal"" looks like a 10.5% drop in output compared with EU membership  Some Brexit arrangements could hit services harder, and they would mean worse news for London, with its financial services powerhouse. But overall, London could be expected to take the least harsh impact from most types of Brexit, and particularly the ""no deal"" variety. The south-east and south-west of England would be less hard hit as well, followed by Scotland. The Treasury model indicates a ""no deal"" Brexit would mean an 8% hit to Scottish output after 15 years. An average or typical Free Trade Agreement with the EU would come at a price of 5% compared with EU membership.  Membership of the European Economic Area, like Norway, would leave Scotland trailing 1% behind its EU potential. And here's the unusual thing: Scotland is the only part of the UK which would have the same output under the UK Government's White Paper, as it would with EU membership. Why does it do relatively well, or relatively less badly? Energy, it seems.  Whether oil or renewables, that sector is thought to be relatively protected from the disruption of Brexit. They're not forecasts. They are the application of models, based on our current understanding of the way the economy works. These brainy economist types can tweak the model to increase the level of immigration or reduce the extent of customs delays, and thus they get to a lot of different results. And yes, they are almost always wrong, but they offer some guidance as to what can be expected. Many of the forecasts that have been way out of whack in the past decade may reflect the lack of current understanding of the way the economy works post-crash. When these models spit out one figure for a set of post-Brexit circumstances, that is the mid-point figure for a range of outcomes.  For no deal, for instance, the impact on output of changes to trading arrangements is estimated at 7.6%, but that is in the range between 9% and 6.3%. What none of the models offers is the factoring in of other changes that might take place in the world or UK economies over that time.  And you can be sure that lots will take place; trade wars, shooting wars, tax cuts and hikes, changes in technology, extreme weather events, commodity market volatility.  Also, if things are going badly, the Government can take decisions on taxation, spending or borrowing that can alter the performance of the economy. They do seek to look into the future however, and those who wish to dismiss them can point to predictions of calamity immediately following the 2016 Brexit referendum. In the short term, the more alarming prospects proved to be wrong. George Osborne, then the Chancellor, was one of the most prominent exaggerators. Migration is seen by economists as a way of boosting output, or Gross Domestic Product. Immigrants are more likely to be of working age, and more productive than others.  If there were no change to the current flows of people across the North Sea and Channel, the Treasury reckons on a 4.9% hit to GDP if there were a Free Trade Agreement, compared with EU membership. But if the government implements change to migration policy to reduce inflows of European workers to a net zero, that would mean a 5.4% hit to output per capita.  Even the most enthusiastic Brexiteers concede that the short-term impact on the economy will be disruptive, and it will take a knock.  They then look to two main factors that could help boost the growth rate to a higher level than the EU.   One is de-regulation. With more flexible working patterns, and fewer regulatory requirements - making it cheaper to hire workers for instance - businesses would be able to grow faster. That assumes that such de-regulation is politically possible.  The problem that it could face is if public opinion turns to being protective of health and safety or of employment conditions which originated in the European Commission.   Alternatively, a trade deal with the EU may require the UK to continue having such employment conditions to ensure a level playing field - which was the point of introducing them across the EU in the first place. The other factor championed by Brexiteers is the possibility of alternative trading partners providing a platform for faster growth - if, for instance, UK businesses can tap into the rapid growth of Asian economies, or easy access into vast North American markets.  What they have been poor at proving is that the European Union has held back UK businesses from trading.  Scotch whisky or salmon, for instance, have had easy access into markets around the world, while the UK has been in the EU. Striking trade deals with other countries tends to take a long time. It requires expert negotiators, and Britain's have been shown to be inexperienced. Meanwhile, in the age of economic nationalism, championed by President Donald Trump, the case for protectionism is being heard much more loudly than the case for making concessions to do deals and increase the flow of free trade."
market volatility,How a small Hong Kong firm saw its shares soar,2024-09-15,2022-08-04,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62417010,"A little-known Hong Kong company has seen its stock market value soar in recent days, for no apparent reason. AMTD Digital made its New York debut last month, priced at $7.80 a share. This week, the firm's shares have been on a rollercoaster ride, closing on Wednesday at $1,100. The meteoric rise in AMTD Digital's value has seen it likened by some commentators to ""meme stocks"", shares that gain popularity among retail investors through social media. Trading in the company's shares has been particularly volatile this week, as its value rose above $300bn on Tuesday. That meant that AMTD Digital briefly overtook technology giant Alibaba's New York stock market valuation. In Wednesday's trade it plunged by more than 30%, but that still gave it a higher US market value than Disney. On Monday, AMTD Digital thanked investors and said it ""noted significant volatility"" in trading. ""The company is also monitoring the market closely for any unusual trading activities or abnormalities,"" the statement said. AMTD Digital offers services to develop online businesses' financial services technology. It had 50 members of staff as of the end of February this year, according to a stock market filing. It makes money mainly by charging fees and commissions for its digital financial services business, which brought in just over $25m in revenue last year, according to a regulatory filing. A space-themed corporate video on the company's website highlights the range of digital services that the company offers. The company's website describes it ""as the fusion reactor at the core of the AMTD SpiderNet ecosystem, AMTD Digital is a one-stop digital solutions platforms in Asia with businesses spanning multiple verticals, including digital financial services, digital media, content & marketing, SpiderNet ecosystem solutions, and digital investments."" Some commentators have likened the rise in AMTD Digital's value to so-called ""meme stocks"". Due to the nature of their popularity, trading in meme stocks is often extremely speculative and volatile. US retailer GamesStop and cinema chain AMC were two of the most high profile meme stocks that saw their shares soar last year. ""This is a major head-scratcher and it shows that the era of meme stocks is not over with a $300bn market cap,"" Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities told the BBC. ""In a major risk off market in 2022 it's bewildering this meme dynamic can still happen but yet it has and Wall Street is watching this latest craze,"" he added. AMTD Digital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC."
market volatility,"Mortgages are scary, say first-time buyers",2024-09-15,2022-10-09,By Huw Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63180909,"First-time house buyers who got a mortgage just weeks before interest rates shot up have said buying is ""scary"" at the moment.  Morgan Luff, 23, and Ewan Anderson, 27, are buying a house in Caldicot, Monmouthshire. They secured a 3.6% interest rate mortgage, but the average rate has now gone above 6%. A building society boss said market volatility is likely to lead to financial difficulty for more people. Morgan and Ewan said they were ""lucky"" to get a five-year mortgage deal in August. They are now in the process of buying the semi-detached house they rent from family. ""It seems we're at the start of these new rates, where down the line it's going to be almost double by the sounds of it,"" Ewan said.  Morgan said the majority of the couple's friends are renting at the moment.  ""We know friends that are not even looking to buy at the moment and just continue renting because it is almost cheaper,"" she said, ""especially if you've got a fixed rent price.""  Morgan said she does worry about taking on such a large commitment when things are so uncertain.  ""With bills, they're going up all the time so you might be able to afford that but you don't know if you're going to afford everything in between,"" she explained. ""It's a massive jump and being so young I don't think you really learn any of this when you're growing up."" She said the process of becoming a home owner was a ""massive eye-opener"". ""Five years is a very long time whereas with renting you can just walk away when your six months or your 12 months are up,"" she said. ""It's very scary."" As borrowing costs rise, ""things will become tighter"" for borrowers, said Will Carroll of Monmouthshire Building Society. The lender was among those to withdraw some fixed-rate mortgage products after the UK government's mini-budget. ""I think it is inevitable, with a cost of living crisis and costs increasing across the board for households, that things will become tighter,"" Mr Carroll said. His staff, he added, were already helping those concerned about the rising cost of repayments, or the prospect of higher rates once existing deals came to an end. ""But as a responsible lender, when we issue a mortgage we do stress an increase in future rates on an individual's ability to pay,"" Mr Carroll added. ""So while we do expect an increase in those members experiencing financial difficulty, we hope that it is not going to be too severe and that we can manage through until things maybe return to more normal circumstances,"" he said. Rates for two and five-year fixed-term mortgages had begun climbing before the mini-budget. Data from Moneyfacts showed average fixed rates a year ago, in October 2021, were 2.25% for a two-year fixed rate and 2.55% for a five-year fixed rate. But by 6 October 2022 the interest rates had increased to 6.11% for a two-year deal and 6.02% for a five-year deal. Former rugby player Mike Powell has been a mortgage broker in Caldicot since 2013.  The last month has been the busiest he has experienced, he said. Things were ""chaotic, manic, turbulent, extremely busy,"" he explained.  ""We try and take the stress away from clients but at times when lenders are pulling deals with very little notice, it's difficult.""  ""We've got people who have been on tracker rates for 10, 12, 15 years who've never done anything,"" he said. ""They've seen their mortgage payments at an affordable cost to them so they've just thought it's not been going up. He said he hears from lenders regularly and there is no sense of panic from industry insiders. ""The banks have got a lot more money this time. They're a lot more liquid than what they were in 2008 so I can't see a crash coming."" Monmouthshire Building Society withdrew fixed-rate products for new customers in the volatile period after the mini-budget, but it honoured existing applications and kept offering fixed-rate deals to existing customers. It expected to reintroduce fixed-rate products to new customers soon, but at a higher rate than before the mini-budget. Monmouthshire Building Society has 10,000 mortgage customers and lends about £350m a year. Speaking at the society's Newport headquarters, Mr Carroll said his team had to adapt quickly to the market reaction after the mini-budget. Mr Carroll said: ""The Bank of England rate is at its highest level now since 2008 and the expectation is that the rate will increase further over the next year. ""I think the markets are forecasting a rate of 5.5% by the middle of next year. So we can expect an increase in the cost of borrowing as we move forward. ""We are seeing our borrowing members come to us sooner than maybe they had done previously with concerns about that increased cost of borrowing into the future."" He encouraged borrowers with concerns to contact the building society's mortgage advisers."
market volatility,Treasury rejects U-turn on mini-budget despite turmoil,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63067163,"The government will not abandon its mini-budget despite the Bank of England having to step in amid market turmoil, a Treasury minister has said. Labour called for the tax-cutting measures to be ditched after they sparked a fall in the pound and a surge in borrowing costs. Government departments are also being asked to find spending cuts. Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said the government's proposals were the ""right plans"" to grow the UK economy. He claimed ""every major economy is dealing with exactly the same issues"" and said the impact of ""Putin's war in Ukraine is cascading through things like the cost of energy, some of the supply side implications of that"". The value of the pound dropped to $1.05 on Wednesday, after the Bank of England stepped in to stabilise the economy, before later rallying to about $1.08. On Wednesday, the Bank announced it would buy government bonds on a temporary basis to help ""restore orderly market conditions"".  Some pension funds hold a lot of government bonds, because they are normally a stable investment, but as their value dropped there were concerns over the solvency of some funds, the BBC has been told.  The Bank's moves on Wednesday followed a highly-critical intervention from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which warned the measures were likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis.  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Chris Philp, has confirmed he is asking government departments to find savings. Speaking on ITV's Peston, Mr Philp said government departments are being asked to ""look for efficiencies wherever they can find them"". These efficiencies will ""stick to the targets"" of the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review ""that set out three year spending plan"", Mr Philp said. Any savings will ""enable us to target spending on things that target growth,"" he added. Gerard Lyons, an economist who has spoken in support of the mini-budget, criticised the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng for ""failing"" to warn financial markets about the plans.  ""Ahead of the budget, it was necessary for the chancellor to keep financial markets on-side,"" Mr Lyons told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""The chancellor appealed to domestic population and appealed to a domestic business community, but one key group he failed to keep on-side was the financial market."" Conservative MP Mel Stride has criticised the government for not publishing a forecast of the UK's economic outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - saying it needs to do so ""as soon as possible"". Forecasts from the independent OBR give an indication of the health of the nation's finances. The BBC understands the government was given a draft before announcing the tax cuts, but it has not been published. ""The OBR should have been brought in earlier,"" said Mr Stride, the chairman of the Treasury select committee. He said the OBR forecast could have then be used to reassure the markets.  ""It is urgently important that the government and the Treasury comes forward at the earliest possible time now with that OBR forecast, with what their fiscal target is going to be, so they can turn and face the markets and say this is this is all fiscally credible."" But Mr Philp said an OBR report will not be published until 23 November, when Mr  Kwarteng plans to set out a ""Medium-Term Fiscal Plan"". This will allow the OBR forecasts to be done ""in a way that's organised and thoughtful,"" Mr Philp said. Downing Street rejected calls for Parliament to be recalled after calls from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to do so MPs can overturn last week's mini-budget. Parliament is currently suspended while the two main parties hold their annual conferences. It is due to come back on 11 October. The £45bn package of tax cuts announced last week would repair ""underlying problems in the economy,"" Mr Griffith said. He added the Bank of England had ""done their job"" by announcing it would buy government debt to stabilise the economy. Few Conservative MPs are commenting publicly about Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's handling of the economic turmoil sparked by his mini-budget - but they are not mincing their words in off-the-record conversations. Inept, humiliating, naive and reckless are just some of the words that have cropped up. What is so irritating to many of them is that this financial instability was predicted - by none other than former chancellor and leadership candidate Rishi Sunak. Some, who describe themselves as ""critical but sensible"", are dismissing ""idiotic talk"" of trying to oust the prime minister. But there is huge pressure on the chancellor, who they accuse of an ""appalling lapse in political judgement"". Read more here. Mr Kwarteng, who unveiled the tax-cutting package last Friday, is yet to speak publicly on the growing impact of the package on markets.  The Treasury said the plans would be funded by £72bn of borrowing and there is an expectation this will surge as interest rates rise.  The pound slumped following his statement and later fell to a record low against the dollar after Mr Kwarteng hinted there were more tax cuts to come.  Julian Smith became the first former cabinet minister to call for the government to ""make changes"". The former Northern Ireland Secretary, who backed Rishi Sunak to become prime minister, tweeted: ""It is critical that the government is honest about the current situation and plays its part in stabilising markets. ""It can keep a growth plan but needs to make changes. Not doing so will only continue further stress and strain on UK citizens."" Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Griffith, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, insisted the UK had a ""very strong balance sheet"" and one of the lowest debt to GDP ratios of major economies. Asked whether the government had any plans to change Friday's measures, he replied: ""We think they're the right plans, because those plans make our economy competitive"". ""At the end of the day, that's ultimately what we've got to do,"" he said, saying ministers were focused on ""getting on and delivering"" its plans to work."
market volatility,Going green could save world 'trillions' - study,2024-09-15,2022-09-13,By Jonah Fisher,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62892013,"Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy could save the world as much as $12tn (£10.2tn) by 2050, an Oxford University study says. The report said it was wrong and pessimistic to claim that moving quickly towards cleaner energy sources was expensive. Gas prices have soared on mounting concerns over energy supplies. But the researchers say that going green now makes economic sense because of the falling cost of renewables. ""Even if you're a climate denier, you should be on board with what we're advocating,"" Prof Doyne Farmer from the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School told BBC News. ""Our central conclusion is that we should go full speed ahead with the green energy transition because it's going to save us money,"" he said. The report's findings are based on looking at historic price data for renewables and fossil fuels and then modelling how they're likely to change in the future. The data for fossil fuels goes from 2020 back more than 100 years and shows that after accounting for inflation, and market volatility, the price hasn't changed much. Renewables have only been around for a few decades, so there's less data. But in that time continual improvements in technology have meant the cost of solar and wind power have fallen rapidly, at a rate approaching 10% a year. The report's expectation that the price of renewables will continue to fall is based on ""probabilistic"" modelling, using data on how massive investment and economies of scale have made other similar technologies cheaper.  ""Our latest research shows scaling-up key green technologies will continue to drive their costs down, and the faster we go, the more we will save,"" says Dr Rupert Way, the report's lead author from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. Wind and solar are already the cheapest option for new power projects, but questions remain over how to best store power and balance the grid when the changes in the weather leads to fall in renewable output. Back in 2019 Philip Hammond, then Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote to the prime minister to say that the cost of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the UK would be more than £1tn. This report says the likely costs have been over-estimated and have deterred investment.  It also says predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that the cost of keeping global temperatures rises under 2 degrees would correspond to a loss of GDP by 2050 were too pessimistic. The transition to renewables was, it says, likely to turn out to be a ""net economic benefit"". The research has been published in the journal Joule and is a collaboration between the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, the Oxford Martin Programme on the Post-Carbon Transition, the Smith School of Enterprise & Environment at the University of Oxford, and SoDa Labs at Monash University.

market volatility,Transport firms feeling pinch of rising fuel costs,2024-09-15,2022-03-07,By Niall Glynn,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60650159,"The conflict in Ukraine continues to affect the cost of oil and gas, putting a further squeeze on the cost of living.  World oil prices have jumped to $139 (£106) a barrel, the highest level for almost 14 years. The Northern Ireland Consumer Council has found 500 litres of home heating oil costs £559.50 - an increase of 75% since 23 February. And petrol and diesel prices continue to soar. Petrol prices of £1.65 per litre have been reported in parts of Northern Ireland, with diesel prices close to £1.80 per litre some places. Those compare to around the £1.20 per litre mark a year ago, and prices are unlikely to fall any time soon. The owner of a County Fermanagh fuel company is predicting that diesel prices could hit £2 per litre by the end of this week.  Garry Jennings, from Jennings Fuels and Lubricants in Kesh, said as well as volatility in oil market, there are issues with supplies coming into Northern Ireland.  ""We are selling the fuel we've bought in on Friday, tonight it looks like there's going to be another 10p on oil and that's going to come to us tomorrow morning.  ""We buy on the day and try and sell on the day so this is fuel we bought in on Friday, tomorrow's fuel is going to be 10p up, what's going to happen Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?""  The Northern Ireland Oil Federation (NIOF) have said there is no issue with supplies, but they are dealing with a 10-day backlog of orders due to mass panic-buying. While some drivers may be able to travel less or use public transport, that is not an option for transport companies. Stephen Anton, from taxi company Fonacab, said rising fuel prices are felt directly by taxi drivers as they are self employed and account for all of their income and costs individually. ""In other words, they fuel their vehicles, the cost of doing so an expense against their booking income,"" Mr Anton said.  ""While drivers can offset fuel costs against their taxable income, the increased fuel costs affect what they take home on a day-to-day basis."" He added: ""If this continues to be a problem, it has the potential to impact negatively on taxi driver numbers across Northern Ireland.  ""Many drivers left the industry for various reasons during Covid and a substantial number have not returned, instead taking early retirement or remaining in other jobs they secured during lockdowns.  ""A sustained high fuel cost may encourage some other drivers to do the same."" Mr Anton said the company was conscious that customers are feeling cost of living increases in their pockets too and did not want to increase fares unnecessarily.  ""There is a balancing act to ensuring that prices remain competitive and affordable for our customers and are also sufficient to allow drivers to make a living and work to provide the services that customers need,"" he said.  ""The current fuel price increases make this a more difficult exercise than ever. ""From our perspective, anything that can be done to reduce fuel costs for drivers' vehicles is a priority.  ""A temporary decrease in fuel duty would be welcome, and there are other tools that local government can employ to reduce overall costs for drivers - for example, reducing the cost of an annual PSV for a taxi to that of an MoT.""  Paul Stewart, from courier firm NI Parcels, said fuel prices had been increasing ""slowly but surely"" over the last year. ""However, in the last six weeks the increases have been huge,"" he said.  ""It has been the largest increase I have ever seen in our business.  ""We have been absorbing some of the increases ourselves, but there is only so much you can absorb, so this has now resulted in some of the increased costs onto our customers.  ""As the fuel prices change so regularly, it is difficult to keep changing your prices and this could make our business look unprofessional. ""It is a very difficult time to absorb the costs or increase prices, we have done a blend of both for now.""   Mr Stewart said the full costs have not been passed onto customers, meaning a reduction in profits for the company.  ""The main issue is the constant price changes making it difficult to set prices, some form of price freeze or price caps would be hugely appreciated,"" he said. ""As the fuel price increases so does the revenue collected on the duty on the increased prices. Duty on fuel could be reduced to help with these increases."" "
market volatility,US regulators warn banks over cryptocurrency risks,2024-09-15,2023-01-04,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64159452,"US regulators have issued their first ever joint warning to banks over the risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. The watchdogs told financial institutions to be wary of potential fraud, legal uncertainty and misleading disclosures by digital asset firms. Banks were also cautioned over the ""contagion risk"" from the sector. It comes just two months after the collapse of trading platform FTX sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. In the joint statement, the US Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they were closely monitoring the crypto activities of banking organisations. ""The events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector,"" the statement said. The regulators also said that issuing or holding crypto tokens, which are stored on public, decentralised networks was ""highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices"". Banks were also encouraged to take steps to avoid problems in the digital asset market spreading to the wider financial system. ""It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,"" it added. Tuesday's statement comes after months of hesitancy by US financial industry watchdogs to issue uniform guidelines on cryptocurrencies, despite banks inviting clearer advice from regulators. The cryptocurrency industry was rocked by the collapse of FTX in November.  It was the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange and the entry point for millions of people into the digital asset market. On Tuesday, FTX's former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried officially denied charges that he defrauded customers and investors. He pleaded not guilty in a US court to claims that he took customer deposits at FTX to fund his other firm, Alameda Research, buy property and make political donations. Two of Mr Bankman-Fried's closest colleagues have already pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the investigation, which has shaken the entire cryptocurrency industry. Mr Bankman-Fried was one of the most high-profile figures in the sector, known for his political ties, celebrity endorsements and bailouts of other struggling firms. He has been accused by the US of building ""a house of cards on a foundation of deception, while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto""."
market volatility,£2.8bn shopping centre takeover collapses,2024-09-15,2018-11-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46383066,"Shares in the owner of shopping centres including Lakeside and the Trafford Centre have plunged after a £2.8bn takeover bid was abandoned. The consortium bidding for Intu Properties blamed economic uncertainty and market volatility for walking away. It was led by the Peel Group and included Saudi Arabian firm Olayan and Canada's Brookfield Property. Shares in Intu sank 35% to 125p - almost half the 210.4p a share the consortium had offered for the company. David Fischel, chief executive of Intu, said a surge in Brexit-related uncertainty had scuppered the proposal. ""The escalation in the news around Brexit and all the potential ramifications has obviously ramped up a lot in the last couple of weeks and has made it a very hard climate to make a big investment decision,"" he said. John Whittaker, chairman of the Peel Group, which has a 27.3% stake in Intu, said it remained ""fully committed ... as a long-term strategic shareholder"". It is the second time this year Intu has been jilted. In April, Hammerson abandoned a £3.4bn bid.   Intu said it would continue investing in its shopping centres, but would be paying lower dividends to investors in the short term.  The company said it expected full-year growth in net rental income of between zero and 1% assuming there are ""no further material tenant failures"", which it says have hit growth by some 1.5% over the year.  Mr Whittaker said there was a ""key role"" for physical shops despite a spate of recent closures of some of the best-known names in retailing.  Earlier this month, Mike Ashley, whose Sports Direct recently took over House of Fraser, said he would close four of the department store chain's stores in Intu shopping centres after failing to agree rent cuts for the shops.  Other troubled stores include Debenhams (another Mike Ashley investment), New Look and restaurant chains Prezzo and Jamie's Italian.  A recent report by consultants PwC found 14 shops were closing every day as UK high streets face their toughest trading climate in five years. Data from retail analysts Springboard indicated that shoppers were continuing to favour buying online rather than heading out to the shops. Its data for last week's Black Friday event showed the biggest losers were shopping centres.  Footfall at shops was down 7% from a year ago, high streets suffered a 6.4% decline and shopping centres' visitor numbers fell 9.1%."
market volatility,S Korea bans anonymous Bitcoin trades,2024-09-15,2018-01-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42784384,"South Korea is banning the use of anonymous bank accounts to make cryptocurrency transactions.  The move is aimed at stopping virtual currencies being used for crimes such as money laundering.  The regulations will bring the country closer into line with financial rules in other markets. South Korea is believed to be the world's third-biggest market for trades in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, behind Japan and the US.  And its importance in the world of digital currency has meant that decisions made in Seoul can result in large, sudden price swings. South Korea considers Bitcoin trading ban How does South Korea sway Bitcoin prices? Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? The new policy, which had been discussed for some time, will kick in on 30 January.  Holders of anonymous cryptocurrency wallets must now link them to bank accounts in their own name, and have their identities confirmed.  The requirements are similar to the Know Your Customer anti-crime regulations in the US. Separately, underage investors and foreigners will also be banned from opening cryptocurrency accounts in South Korea. And even stricter measures may be introduced later, with officials earlier this month saying a ban on cryptocurrency trading activities was one step being considered. On Monday, Yonhap reported that the country's cryptocurrency exchanges would be hit with hefty tax bills in a separate attempt to rein in the sector.  Trading is popular among the country's younger population and demand has seen a 30% premium put on some virtual trades compared to other countries.  However, volatility around prices together with the lack of regulation surrounding cryptocurrency trading has led to ongoing concerns among South Korean officials that investors are leaving themselves open to potentially huge losses.

market volatility,Should we care about the price of Bitcoin?,2024-09-15,2017-12-21,By Simon Atkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42435995,"On Wednesday, cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell by about 10% to a value of $15,800 (£11,810).   ""It has plunged,"" a colleague said. ""Should we do a story?"" Business journalists (or at least some of them) will debate passionately whether something is indeed a plunge, a dive, or merely a fall, a dip or a retreat. It's what makes us great company at parties. And sure, a 10% movement downwards would usually fall into one of the more dramatic descriptions.  But to give it some perspective, Bitcoin dropping to $15,800 on 20 December took it to its lowest level since, well, 11 December. Which means we are not debating the terminology, but whether or not we should report, blow-by-blow, how Bitcoin is performing at all.    Nobody could accuse the media of ignoring Bitcoin and its rivals, at least not recently. The BBC, like many others, has referred regularly to the skyrocketing price over the past year, including it almost doubling in value over the past month or so. And it seems almost daily there is a legitimate news story: just this week there have been probes about insider trading,Bitcoin crime stories and people asking for Bitcoin as a wedding gift to pick three at random from our website. So there is little doubt cryptocurrencies have entered the mainstream consciousness and news agenda.   Both the currencies, and the technology behind them, seem sure to become more prevalent in the global economy.  The possibilities which that opens up, as well as the risks, is surely worth investigating.  Governments around the world are weighing in with their opinions on regulation. Some well-respected figures have warned that Bitcoin is a bubble that carries a big risk for investors. These seem reasonable things to report, as well as reflecting the more optimistic point of view. Meanwhile the trading of Bitcoin on a huge futures market such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is also interesting and worth covering, in that it marks a big step towards mainstream investing. But should we be reporting specifically on the price, where the news is essentially: price goes up, price goes down? It is tempting because Bitcoin stories are popular. And some people do clearly want to know.  That list includes investors of course, and anyone wanting to buy, sell or just indulge in one of those ""If only I'd invested five years/five months/five weeks ago"" internal monologues. If that is you, fear not. Plenty of services can tell you what the price of Bitcoin is doing right this second. The BBC tends to use Coindesk as its reference point. There have been occasions when we decided the price was worth marking - most recently, for example, when it crossed the $10,000 threshold. But is choosing not to report on what some see as significant on-the-day price movements a kind of cryptocurrency snobbery?  Well firstly, while we have currency market data pages using information bought from a third party, the BBC does not usually get involved in the nitty-gritty reporting of daily currency market movements.  And if we do write or broadcast about what the dollar, sterling and the euro are up to, it is only when somebody judges it editorially significant.   Sometimes it is when that movement is the result of some other newsworthy event (the sharp fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit referendum springs to mind).  And of course the value of established physical currencies still has far more impact on people's lives - be they running a business, have savings and investments, be going on holiday or indeed buying anything that has been made abroad. So after a bit of a discussion in the BBC's Singapore office, here are few reasons why we feel reluctant to do stories based on the price movements in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency: Incidentally, at the time of writing on Thursday, Bitcoin has bounced back from that ""plunge"" of yesterday to above $17,100. Which is higher than it was 24 hours ago. So no. I don't think we should do a story. "
market volatility,Pound and UK shares hit by Brexit turmoil,2024-09-15,2018-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46219038,"The pound and shares in housebuilders and banks have fallen sharply after cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey quit over Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit deal. Royal Bank of Scotland sank 9%, with 7% falls for Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments. Sterling fell 1.7% against the dollar and 1.9% against the euro. The FTSE 100 index closed little moved, but the FTSE 250, which mainly comprises UK-focused firms, fell 1.6%. Capita topped the fallers in the FTSE 250, plunging 14%, with Countryside Properties down 9%. Shares in companies that do most or all of their business in the UK reflected the continued political uncertainty, as members of the Conservative Party and opposition politicians voiced their scepticism over the draft deal.  ""The market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders,"" said Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""These sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said: ""The odds of a general election have just gone up and that means the possibility of a Corbyn government must have increased as well.  ""Markets don't like the prospect of that because of Labour's intention to raise taxes on companies and nationalise large sections of the economy."" The higher chances of an election was one of the reasons behind RBS' steep fall, as the Labour Party has said it would nationalise the lender. However, shares in other banks also fell, as investors considered the threat to the economy and therefore to banks' balance sheets if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal. Sterling ended the day in London at under $1.28 against the dollar after a turbulent day's trading.  Initially on Wednesday, when Theresa May announced she had secured cabinet backing for the draft Brexit agreement with Brussels, the pound recovered earlier lost ground. But by Thursday morning it was already wavering.  A string of ministerial resignations led by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, undermined confidence in the pound further as market observers deemed the chances of a disorderly Brexit had risen. The Brexit process has been punctuated by big movements in the pound's relationship with the dollar, something which can lead to big gains or losses for investors.   In the run-up to, and immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016, for example, the pound hit a peak of volatility against the dollar.  And as the graphic below shows, the events surrounding Wednesday's draft agreement has triggered the greatest volatility for sterling since the referendum.  Jane Foley at Rabobank said the pound's plunge was ""firmly tied"" to the perception that Mrs May will have difficulty in pushing the Brexit plan through Parliament.   She said the resignations had increased speculation that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote, something that would weigh heavily on the pound: ""Any turn of events that could raise the risk of a general election would also punish the pound, given the risk of a market-unfriendly far-left government."" Chris Turner at ING said Mr Raab's resignation had increased the chances of a leadership challenge and a no-deal Brexit.  He said the pound ""could fall another 3-4% unless the threat of a leadership election is quashed or there are clearer signs that the withdrawal agreement can garner more support in parliament"".   Organisations that speak on behalf of business like the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the draft deal, because it offered the prospect of a smooth path towards Brexit. The CBI described the agreement as a ""compromise, including for business"" but was happy that it represented a ""step back from the cliff-edge"". The agreement includes a 21-month transition period, during which time the UK will negotiate new trade terms with the EU. The UK would have a unilateral right to extend that transition period, which was described as ""very positive for business"" by James Stewart, head of Brexit at KPMG. Northern Ireland also has the guarantee of a ""friction-free"" customs border with the Republic of Ireland. CBI Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""There is a possible path to frictionless trade now in terms of negotiating the final deal. I don't think anyone thinks the transition or the backstop is the answer, so this has to be used as a route to a final deal with frictionless trade and access for services."" Of course not.  Pro-Brexit economist Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at Netwealth Investment and former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson while he was Mayor of London, says the draft withdrawal deal is not something to cheer about. ""Whilst it has avoided the cliff edge, I think it's important we don't bury our heads in the sands here and view this as a 'good' deal - this is still disappointing,"" he said. Those who had hoped the draft deal would supply some reassurance will also be disappointed as Theresa May wrestles with critics and struggles to unite enough MPs behind her plan."
market volatility,Firmus raises gas price by further 38% in NI towns,2024-09-15,2021-11-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59233950,"Firmus Energy is putting gas prices up by 38% from 3 December across its Ten Towns network area. The company said rising global energy costs had ""forced"" its hand to put prices up for the third time this year. Firmus gas prices increased by 35% in October and by 18% earlier in the year. The move will affect about 55,000 customers in the Ten Towns area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry. The Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about £268 a year or £255 a year for those with a prepayment meter. Firmus customers in Greater Belfast and in the Gas to the West network area will not be affected by the tariff change. Firmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said: ""This is a not a Firmus issue but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. ""We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable."" Firmus said it would be introducing a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect. Wholesale costs make up 50% of customers' gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect locally. Rising gas prices this year come in stark contrast to last year's low prices, which were described by one economist at the time as a ""consumer sweet-spot"". The Utility Regulator has warned that high prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year. Some analysts have warned the volatility could last for between 18 to 36 months while others have suggested that the short answer is: we don't really know. One thing most are agreed on is that while prices will come down they aren't likely to fall by as much as they have risen. There are only two gas suppliers in Northern Ireland, which is why the Utility Regulator has to agree any price increase before it is passed on to customers. The regulator caps suppliers' profits at 2%. Natasha Toman is a mum of four in Craigavon, County Armagh, and is a Firmus customer worried about what the price rise will mean for her. ""This is two price rises in such a short space of time - it's going to be a tough winter,"" she said. ""I topped my card up with the maximum amount, which is £49, before 1 October so I would be getting it at the cheaper rate and now it is going up again. ""We don't have the luxury to change suppliers - there is only Firmus in this area. ""So you just have to get on with it and make the money stretch but it's tough going and it's going to be cutting in other areas as your home needs to be warm, particularly with four young children."" The Utility Regulator has capped the amount of profit gas providers can make at about 2%. But it has no control over wholesale energy costs, which is one of the key reasons for the price rises. So although a company's profit is capped that doesn't stop prices going up as the cost of commodities increases. The actual cost of the energy makes up about half of our bills and the rest goes to the companies that manage the pipes and to cover other expenses. So if the price of energy goes up the amount companies have to charge to make that 2% profit also increases. Read more: Why are energy bills going up? Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people, said there was a ""real growing fear"" among elderly people about the increasing cost of household bills. More than 50,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland are living in poverty, he said. ""What really concerns me is the perfect storm our older people are facing with higher energy bills and on top of that they have less opportunities to get out of the house because there are a lot less social activities since Covid hit,"" said the commissioner. ""That's how many of them actually managed their energy bills in the past - it was about getting out of the house so they didn't have to put the heat on. ""We're now at a stage where people have to spend much more time at home and are faced with huge bills coming down the line."" Ulster Unionist assembly member Andy Allen said the Stormont executive had to intervene ""swiftly and robustly"" to deal with the winter cost-of-living crisis. This month he put a motion before the assembly asking members to create a winter energy emergency fund - it was passed unanimously. ""We welcome the confirmation from the minister for communities that she will be bidding for the entirety of the £13.7m derived from UK Vulnerable Households fund in order to try and bring forward a support package,"" Mr Allen told BBC News NI. ""We need to see this in days, weeks - not months, not after Christmas. People on the ground need this now."" He said that charities were already having to support people in topping up gas and electric meters. The Utility Regulator, which regulates the suppliers in the market, had warned that substantial rises in the price of gas were coming. Its chief executive John French said: ""Unfortunately over the last six months we have seen unparalleled increases in the cost of wholesale energy at a global level. ""If wholesale prices begin to reduce our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible."" Sinn Féin MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the UK government should remove VAT on energy bills, cutting the costs by 5%. Democratic Unionist Party MP Carla Lockhart said anyone who was struggling with their bills should check whether they were eligible for the universal credit benefit."
market volatility,How Bitcoin is infiltrating the $60bn global art market,2024-09-15,2017-07-24,By Matthew Wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40703182,"Why is the art world getting excited about digital currency Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain? Eleesa Dadiani owns and runs an art gallery in London's famous Cork Street. She was born in Georgia in the Caucasus and was ""breastfed by gypsies"". But she is also a passionate believer in the power of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. When we meet she is busy preparing for an exhibition of sculptures made from the exhausts of former Formula 1 racing cars. One of these strange rib-cage-like creations made from the super-strong alloy inconel has been gold-plated and will sell for about £35,000. ""These are pieces of history,"" she tells me. In a first for the tradition-bound art world of Cork Street, her international clientele will have the opportunity to pay using Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency underpinned by blockchain technology. The gallery will also accept other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Litecoin, and soon, Monero, she says. Why? ""This is not a demand-driven decision at all, it's intuitive based on the way things are going,"" she says. She believes paying by cryptocurrency will become as normal as paying by cash or credit card. She also hopes it will attract a new, non-traditional type of art investor. Blockchain, the underlying technology, is a digital ledger or record of transactions that is distributed across, and verified by, thousands of computers in a network. Once the network has reached a consensus that a transaction has happened, the ledger is updated and cannot be tampered with.    ""Blockchain is a borderless, open source, decentralised peer-to-peer network that governments cannot shut down,"" she says. ""For me, the blockchain is going to be the biggest thing since the internet."" And the fact that there is no centralised body - like a bank head office, for example - makes cryptocurrencies safer, she argues, despite their reputation for being volatile, high-risk and the favourite ""store of value"" for criminals and hackers.  Bitcoin payments can be anonymous and potentially beyond the grasp of tax authorities, but this isn't the reason she's offering payment by cryptocurrency, she assures me.  So how easy is it to accept a Bitcoin payment? ""It's really very simple,"" she explains. ""I give the client my public key [a long string of letters and numbers] and they use that to send bitcoin to my account from their digital wallet or bitcoin exchange,"" she says.  ""My wallet is linked to my personal bank so I can then convert those bitcoins into pounds, euros or dollars.""  Ms Dadiani is such a fan of cryptocurrencies - she trades in them as well - that she is launching her own version, Dadicoin, later this year. The $60bn art world in general is warming to the potential of cryptocurrencies, partly because of blockchain's dual ability to establish the provenance of works of art and thereby reduce the reliance on brokers and other middlemen. Marcelo Garcia Casil, for example, is chief executive and co-founder of Maecenas, an online marketplace that will enable art owners to sell shares in their expensive works of art (worth more than $1m) and raise money far more cheaply than they could though a bank. And the owners also get to keep possession of their artworks while sharing up to 49% of the ownership. Investors, who ordinarily wouldn't be able to afford multi-million-dollar works of art, will be able buy shares or units in the work using cryptocurrency. They will then be able to sell these units later in the marketplace. Each transaction is recorded cryptographically on the Ethereum blockchain. ""We want to make fine art accessible for everyone,"" says Mr Casil, who was born in Argentina, now lives in Singapore, and has a background in investment banking.  ""The old auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have controlled the art market for centuries, so we think the opportunity for disruption is huge."" Establishing the authenticity of works of art is critical to their value, and this will still need to be done by skilled professionals, admits Mr Casil. ""But once the provenance has been recorded in the blockchain, you never have to do it again,"" he says. This takes a lot of cost out of the system. Maecenas has already attracted works of art worth $100m (£77m; 86m euros) in total, says Mr Casil, and the marketplace is due for launch in September. The art world has been flirting with Bitcoin for a few years now, despite the likes of auction house Sotheby's saying they have no plans to accept the currency. In April 2015, the Austrian Museum of Applied Art/Contemporary Art (MAK) was the first museum in the world to buy a work of art using Bitcoin. Dutch artist Harm van den Dorpel created a limited-edition screensaver that was cryptographically authenticated through blockchain. And online gallery Cointemporary exhibits digital artworks by international contemporary artists that can only be bought with Bitcoin. Purchases are handled by Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain establishes the chain of ownership, preventing anyone from stealing or tampering with the work. But will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ever really become a mainstream alternative to traditional money? Views differ widely. In Japan, there is a big move to equip 260,000 retail locations with bitcoin capability, and a few high-street retailers, such as Lush, have opted to accept the currency. But Joe Pindar, a director at cyber-security company Gemalto, says: ""At present there are very few businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method - less than 1% of all retailers.  ""The biggest barrier to adoption is the length of time it takes to settle a payment in person, with transactions taking tens of minutes.  Despite this, Mr Pindar says several large retailers have been experimenting with the cryptocurrency, but may choose ""to adopt bitcoin for online purchases only, where time to process a payment is less important."" The currency's volatility is an issue - the value of one bitcoin topped $3,000 in June, before crashing to below $1,900 in July - and transactions are taking longer and longer to process.  This is largely to do with the rules governing how Bitcoin works, and there is currently a big row over how the issue should be resolved. It could be that blockchain proves to be more important to the art world than its flashier Bitcoin offspring."
market volatility,Living with mum and dad at 30,2024-09-15,2018-05-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44236706,"The story of the US couple successfully winning the right to evict their 30-year-old son from their home, has prompted a number of 30-somethings to get in touch with the BBC about their experiences of living with their parents. Reasons for staying at home range from the culturally acceptable to the financial. Here, people in their 30s describe their current living arrangements with mum and dad. ""I have lived my whole life in Calgary, an oil and gas-based city. I saw an abundance of oil and gas jobs in the industry growing up, and becoming a petroleum geologist seemed like a natural course to take. ""I was thrilled when I got my first permanent job at a small oil company, and later I had saved enough money for a down payment on a small townhouse.  ""But in July 2016 the company I worked for declared bankruptcy as the price of oil fell. I received no severance but I was able to sell my townhouse (at a loss) right before the company went under.  ""My parents and I have always had a good relationship and they were gracious enough to let me move back in with them. They recognise and understand the issues young Canadians encounter.  ""A lot of my friends are in the same position and understand the situation I am in. If anything, it's me who is putting pressure on myself to leave home. ""There is still considerable volatility in my employment and in the Canadian oil and gas industry. I am not confident in moving forward and purchasing or renting a new place. ""I would now consider myself in a place of 'precarious employment'.  I have no employment insurance, no health or dental coverage. I am not alone in my career uncertainty. I feel I have done everything right, but I still feel anxiety towards the future of my career.  ""Right now, 'leaving the nest' is just not a financially wise decision."" ""Tuition fees were introduced at the time I was applying for university so I couldn't afford to go away from home to study.  ""I stayed home and studied at the Open University whilst juggling a business and part-time jobs to pay for tuition, business expenses, transport, domestic contributions and saving for a house deposit.  ""By the time I graduated from the four-year degree and teaching qualification, house prices in my area had quadrupled - £45,000 starter homes went up to £180,000, and I have been priced out ever since.  ""It was devastating - if I got a full-time job at 16 and saved I would have been able to buy a house! ""I think my chance of buying my own home has probably gone. I tried to get a good education, but when I worked it out, I was worse off having gone to university."" You may also like: US parents win battle to evict son, 30 Single, 30 and time to leave home?

But because of the 'Bank of Mum and Dad' who helped her out, things were never the same between us. ""You do feel cut off from people because you feel you become different from them. It can be isolating. ""I've kind of given up now. When I was around 30, I wanted to move out but you get to the point that it's not worth it. I could probably get a deposit together but my wages are not enough to pay for a mortgage.  ""In some ways living at home is a good thing because of family health issues - I might have had to come back home anyway. My parents are elderly, so it's probably too late to move out now.  ""I'm paying towards household bills and groceries. We try to make the best of it, but we do get fed up of society saying I should move out - sometimes you don't always have a choice!"" ""I have a full-time job and help at home by paying towards the mortgage, utilities, and I do household chores.  ""Even though I contribute at home, I still follow my parents' house rules - the main one is that I can't bring a male visitor to stay at my parents' house overnight.  ""Also, I have to let them know if I'm going out, where I'm going and with whom just in case of emergency, but I don't mind. It's just a sign of gratitude and respect.  ""In my culture as a Filipino, it's normal for children to live with their parents even if they're all grown up. We have a close-knit family. ""I think when parents take care of their kids from newborn to 18, it's the kids' turn to take care of their parents when they get old. ""Nowadays, people are trying to save money especially after college when a lot of us are in debt so more people are staying longer at home with parents.  ""I have four siblings who all moved out when they got married. I'm still single and so I'm at home. But I don't feel any pressure to move out. The thought of moving out by myself never occurred to me."" Interviews by Andree Massiah, UGC Hub & Social News team"
market volatility,House prices 'rebounded in April',2024-09-15,2019-05-08,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48199086,"UK house prices picked up in April following a fall in values the previous month, according to the country's biggest mortgage lender. The Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said property values rose by 1.1% in April compared with March when prices fell 1.25%. The annual rate of growth almost doubled with house prices up 5% compared to a year earlier when house prices dropped. The average home is valued at £236,619. Compared with 10 years ago, which was the trough in house prices amid the financial crisis, the typical UK property has risen in value by £81,956, the equivalent of a 4.3% average annual increase. Various house price surveys have painted a subdued picture for property values in the last couple of years.  The annual house price rise of 5% reported by the Halifax, based on its own mortgage data, is out of step with many other surveys. For example, the Nationwide Building Society said April was the fifth month in a row in which annual house price growth was below 1%. The year-on-year volatility has been explained by the Halifax as a result of the comparison with a low growth rate over the corresponding period in 2018. The Halifax calculates its annual change figure based on the last three months compared with the same three months a year earlier, in an attempt to smooth out any volatility. Yet, analysts still say the latest estimate from the Halifax should be treated with some scepticism. ""One explanation for ricocheting growth figures like this is persistently low stock levels. In sought after areas, this can lead to demand being supercharged one minute and gone the next, with price rises coming in waves as brief competitions for limited numbers of homes come and go,"" said Lucy Pendleton, founder director of estate agents James Pendleton. ""Even so, the Halifax index's behaviour so far in 2019 has been unusual to say the least."" Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ""The lack of supply and properties coming to the market is most likely continuing to support property prices, while cheap mortgage rates continue to attract those who are ready to take the plunge."""
market volatility,How is Northern Ireland's energy market different?,2024-09-15,2022-08-14,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62525562,"The UK's new Prime Minister, Liz Truss, has announced her plan to tackle the energy crisis. The government has promised Northern Ireland households will get the same support with energy bills as the rest of the UK but it is not clear how that will be delivered. That's because Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK, with its own rules and regulator. We are all acutely aware that there is a global energy price crisis, with warnings of further increases on the horizon. The supply of gas from Russia to Europe being under threat, meant wholesale price jumped again last month. There has been a 600% increase in wholesale gas between July 2021 and this year. It hit £3.52 per therm on Tuesday 26 July.  This is six times higher than on the same day in 2020.  That is still lower than the highest price we have seen this year - a record £4.95 in early March. Wholesale costs make up about two thirds of your gas bill which is why suppliers have then increased their prices. Two thirds of homes in Northern Ireland use home heating oil.  The home heating oil market is not regulated as there are so many different suppliers - there is more competition. Currently 500 litres (109.9 gallons) is costing £412.51 - that is 89% higher than the same time last year, when it would have cost £218.66, and 60% higher than pre-pandemic levels. If we take each of the gas suppliers, SSE Airtricity for example which supplies the Greater Belfast area, an annual bill is 142% higher than April 2021 at £1,242.30. Firmus Energy, which supplies towns across Northern Ireland, current average annual bills are 190% higher than April 2021 at £1,504.22. Power NI which is the largest electricity supplier in Northern Ireland, the average annual bill in July 2022 was £944, that is 55% higher than in April 2021 when it was £610. The energy market in Northern Ireland is regulated by the Utility Regulator. It regulates the prices of three suppliers - two gas companies (SSE Airtricity and Firmus) and one electricity provider Power NI. It also cap their profits at 2% for gas suppliers and 2.2% for Power NI. It is called the energy price cap - it basically means there is a maximum amount that suppliers can charge customers for each unit of energy. It was designed to protect consumers from price volatility. Until recently, it was reviewed twice a year. It is now going to be reviewed every three months to try and prevent suppliers from going bust. Many suppliers have been in financial distress as they have to absorb the increasing cost as they can't raise prices, but when they go bust, it is consumers who ultimately foot the bill. In Northern Ireland, suppliers can announce price increases as and when they need to, as long as it is approved by the Utility Regulator, who scrutinises their costs. It means that while we have more frequent announcements, they are more gradual increases than those seen in the rest of the UK, where typically there are two massive hikes.  If we take a look at the regulated electricity price in Northern Ireland, it is lower than in the rest of the UK. Whereas, gas prices are a bit different, it depends what supplier you are with.  The average bill in Greater Belfast area is lower than Great Britain, but the average Firmus bill is slightly higher. Our system of regulation is more sensitive to change, that can be a good thing or a bad thing.  While we get increases passed on to us more quickly, our system means when prices come down we are likely to feel that more quickly too. In England, Scotland and Wales the next increase is due in October. Northern Ireland's system means we do not know when the next price rises will be, but we do know the regulator previously said that any further market volatility would translate into higher prices for consumers. If some of the anticipated increases in GB are announced in October, then that would make average bills substantially higher in the rest of the UK compared to how things currently stand in Northern Ireland. But we do not know when or how much prices here could go up in the meantime."
market volatility,Electricity customers to be consulted on tariffs,2024-09-15,2023-02-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64722469,"Electricity customers in Guernsey have been asked about potential tariff changes, due to the ""volatility of the global energy market"". Guernsey Electricity (GE) said it was looking to increase the standing charge by 65%, and put up the price of heating homes using electricity by 13%.  It said it was also asking customers for views on changing the tariffs for people with air source heat pumps.  A two-week consultation has been launched. The company has asked customers for their views because of ""the volatility of the global energy market following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022."" One proposal set out in the consultation is an increase in the customers' standing charge, from £30 to £49.50. Another is to freeze the price people can sell electricity generated at their homes home back to the grid at 9.9p pKWH.  Chief financial officer Karl Brouard said: ""Although local customers have been relatively insulated from the types of rises seen in the UK as a result of our forward price setting strategy, we are not immune from the wider geopolitical impact."" ""We realise that this comes at a time when the cost of living for everyone is increasing, but we cannot let these changes delay the planned investment in the network and the need to maintain the security of electricity supply."" Mr Brouard added the island was ""facing increases in the cost of imported energy, together with a rise in the cost of on-island generation at the power station"". The results of the consultation will feed into the final tariff application made to the States Trading Supervisory Board (STSB), which has the responsibility to assess and approve tariffs. Last year, the STSB approved an application to allow GE to increase its tariffs to raise revenue by 9%.  The Environment and Infrastructure Committee said a new electricity strategy was to be debated before the end of March 2023, having previously said it would be in December 2022.  Committee president Lindsay de Sausmarez said work was ""progressing well"" on the strategy, with an aim to publish a policy letter on it ""by the end of March 2023"".

market volatility,Holyrood Budget: growing pains,2024-09-15,2017-12-15,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-42363801,"A good budget requires a rabbit to be pulled from the finance minister's hat. That's ""good"" in the journalist's sense that it's at least interesting. As a financial magician, Derek Mackay still has plodding patter. Last year's budget speech from the finance secretary, likened to a pupil reading a lesson at the school carol service but only under protest, had improved to the point of sounding a bit like Jackanory. But when he reached into his hat of magic tricks to give his budget a bit of wizardry, it seemed as if said rodents had been breeding. Like rabbits. Not one new tax band, but two. A rate hike here, a cut there, contriving to make Scotland both the highest and lowest taxed part of the UK. By the time he sat down, Mr Mackay's bunnies were hopping all over Holyrood and beyond, their whiskers twitching at the prospect of some green shoots for a nibble.  Unfortunately, those are the frosty winter shoots on which an economic recovery depends. At first glance, this looked a politically astute budget. Going further than expected for the NHS. A raft of measures to please the business lobbyists. A big wad for rural broadband.  Most of those who speak for business were willing to welcome most measures, particularly on business rates. The tourist sector was particularly positive about both business rates being linked to a lower inflation index, and broadband reaching hotels on the periphery. Housebuilders like the business rate changes too, and a small cut to the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax levied on first time buyers. But the rest of the property sector was disappointed there wasn't more change to the LBTT, which has put a dampener on things towards the upper end of the market. Engineering Scotland liked the look of more research funding. The Scottish National Investment Bank is seen positively. The Federation of Small Businesses saw some positives, but remarked that it had sought ""ballast in choppy markets, but instead the Scottish government steered into uncharted economic waters"". Experts and analysts have more doubts than business. Reform Scotland, the think tank, thinks the tax cuts bring unnecessary risk and could lead to lower revenue.   IPPR Scotland reckons a lot of the tax cut on low earners will go to second, part-time earners in better off households, who may not be the most deserving. The Chartered Institute of Taxation noted the potential for some anomalies, as the new starter rate becomes entangled with the tapering of Westminster's benefits system. Hargreaves Lansdowne, the wealth managers, note that tax relief on pensions may now require a lot more paperwork. Politically, the tax reform showed Scotland can go its own way, without necessarily frightening the horses. With a bit of take and give, the reform is expected to bring in an extra £164m - merely 1.3% up on an income tax take of nearly £12bn. It had most of what will be needed to win over the Scottish Green MSPs with whom Mr Mackay hopes to get his budget over the line at Holyrood. But economically, the seismic change to Scotland's income tax is likely to overshadow one very small, very significant number that wasn't even in the budget speech: 0.7%. That's the amount by which the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC) expects the economy to grow next year.   For three years after that, growth is forecast to remain below 1%. Way off in 2022, it rises to the unimpressive heights of 1.1%. The UK growth forecast, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, was the main, unwelcome surprise of Phillip Hammond's November budget. Conceding it had been over-optimistic about Britain's return to productivity growth, it adjusted to the reality of very slow improvements. That delivered a growth forecast for next year of a dismal 1.4%. So using parallel assumptions about Scotland's productivity, which has been going backwards of late, the SFC forecasts a growth rate of only half as much. Some of that gap can be explained by faster population growth south of the Border, but not all.  In a cautiously worded document from the SFC, the warnings are stark: ""The growth that has been achieved in recent years has been driven by factors which include a boom in the construction industry, strong labour market growth, a falling savings ration and support form the oil and gas industry. These factors are unlikely to continue to support growth to the same extent in the coming years. ""Future downside risks include the UK's changing relationship with the EU, a weakening outlook for global trade, Scotland's industrial and demographic structure and weak onshore demand linked to activity in the oil and gas sector."" On earnings, it's starker still: ""Real household disposable income [that's the useful stuff that matters, including tax and benefits] is not expected to see any growth until 2020-21 because of a combination of slow wage growth, very limited employment growth and inflation"". And much of this has to do with productivity being so weak, having ""a profound impact on GDP and the Scottish economy as a whole"". This downgrade in growth forecast is measurable when compared with the Scottish government's forecast last February. Things have taken such a downward lurch that the increase in tax rates is wiped out by the reduction in tax revenue. Next year, Derek Mackay's income tax changes are expected to add £164m to the total revenue, yet total revenue is down more than £200m on expectations in February. That gap widens rapidly over subsequent years. By 2021-22, contrasting February's estimate with this month's figures adds £188m from the change to tax bands and rates, yet the total tax take is down by more than £900m - from £14.59bn to £13.66bn. Welcome to the world of tax revenue volatility, or what they sometimes like to call buoyancy. It's an exciting new world for MSPs, but forces them to think much harder about the ways in which growth can be increased. One last question that puzzled me about Derek Mackay's speech. Was this tax rise a one-off or not? Taxpayers who are being asked to pay more might well be willing to accept such incremental change this year, but probably want to know the big picture and the further horizon.  Will higher earners still be paying to counter Westminster's spending squeeze - which is expected to last into the mid-2020s - with further, unending tax hikes?"
market volatility,Firm banks on carbon fibre bikes in Europe,2024-09-15,2022-05-05,By Pedro Garcia,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61082317,"There is growing demand from amateur cyclists for more affordable, carbon fibre bike frames.   The material is light and strong, and among other things enthusiasts hope it will improve their speed.  In Portugal, Carbon Team and its investors are betting on this appetite for high-end bikes growing in Europe. Located in Campia (not far from Oliveira de Frades, a town famous for bikes), a group of investors from Portugal, Germany, and Taiwan launched the firm in 2018. The company believe manufacturing of hi-tech bicycle components is poised to return to Europe, after decades of supply from firms in China and Taiwan. Emre Ozgunes joined Carbon Team in 2019, hired as a general manager for the new company after years of experience in the Portuguese bike sector.  Originally from Turkey, he worked as a factory floor employee in a bicycle company in central Portugal, where he learned the trade.  ""I always yearned to start a business from scratch"", Mr Ozgunes tells the BBC.  The investors put €8.4m (£7m; $9.2m) into Carbon Team and after three years of product development, production started last year.  Just three people staffed that first production line: Mr Ozgunes, Miguel Oliveira, the company's production manager, and Filipa Antunes, now technical manager.  By March of this year output had increased - with 30 employees constructing between 8 and 10 frames per day. Mr Ozgunes hopes that by 2023 they will have almost 200 people on Carbon Team's payroll, making up to 150 frames per day.  Although it's a long way off, expansion to this size would make Carbon Team the only company in Europe to mass produce carbon fibre frames. Almost all the frames will be exported. If demand really takes off, there is land available behind the factory where they could build an additional unit and double maximum capacity to 110,000 frames per year. There is a wider trend gaining popularity among European industries to relocate key elements of their supply chain closer to home, limiting their dependency on Asian suppliers for parts and raw materials. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated this trend. Freight prices skyrocketed and lockdowns forced many Asian factories to sporadically suspend their production.  The Confederation of the European Bicycle Industry (Conebi) estimates that among all bicycles sold in Europe, 40% of their parts are made on the continent, rising to more than half for electric bikes. ""This is positive, but there is still the need to have more production of components in Europe,"" says Manuel Marsilio, general manager of Conebi. ""The supply chain disruptions in the bicycle industry have boosted discussions that started already before the pandemic. Making components closer to where bicycles and e-bikes are assembled has many advantages and the industry is likely to go in that direction,"" he adds.   The industry is currently debating how to speed-up this shift - but it will be a slow transition.  The latest Global Bike & Bike Accessories Market report by consultancy firm, PwC, shows that over half of European bicycle manufacturers buy their frames on the international markets. Marta Baldin, from PwC's Italian branch and co-author of the study, tells the BBC, that ""in the near future, supply from overseas is not expected to decrease or slow down. It is expected that the biggest concentration of imports will still come from Asian markets"". More technology of business: Analysts suggest the biggest opportunity for European firms lies at the higher end of the market. ""On quality and innovation, EU producers do not suffer from foreign competition and this is the main reason why niche and high-quality bike products are still manufactured in the EU,"" she adds. And as wages rise for factory workers in Asia, buying from that region is losing some of its economic advantage. Meanwhile, freight costs are increasingly prohibitive, points out Mr Ozgunes.  Volatility on international commodities markets is also helping Carbon Team at the moment. The price of aluminium, for instance, traditionally the cheaper alternative to carbon fibre, soared to record levels in March before moving lower.  Although carbon fibre prices have risen as well, the increase is currently nowhere near the rise in aluminium prices. This inflationary trend will likely have an impact on the price of mid-range bicycles too, according to Mr Ozgunes. On the factory floor, Carbon Team's employees focus silently on their tasks, all demanding precision. A group of employees applies carbon fibre to moulds. Others, on separate tables, prepare and test the raw material. In a separate aisle, four large ovens bake the final product, while recently made frames are tested for quality and safety. Filipa Antunes, Carbon Team's technical manager, joined in February 2020, one month before the onset of the pandemic.  ""Demand for two-wheeled vehicles rose exponentially with the pandemic and luckily many companies built up their capacity,"" she says. She is optimistic and thinks the proposed expansion promises a bright future for her and her company."
market volatility,Stock markets and pound rise ahead of Brexit deal,2024-09-15,2020-12-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55433657,"UK stock markets have closed for the Christmas break in an upbeat mood. The FTSE 250 jumped 1.15% to 20,531, hours before the Brexit trade deal with the EU was announced. But the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up just 0.01% at 6,502 as traders waited for confirmation of the deal to emerge. Market positivity will give a seasonal boost to investors, including the millions who have a financial stake in stock markets through their pensions. The pound was up, showing a gain of about 0.7% against the dollar to touch $1.36 before falling back slightly. It also gained 0.5% against the euro, rising to €1.1136. Across Europe, shares were also on the rise, although the key Frankfurt stock market was closed. Asian markets closed positively with Japan's Nikkei gaining 0.54%, while markets in Australia, South Korea and Singapore also saw modest rises. Sterling has always been the most reliable of Brexit trade deal sentiment - the pound rose against the US dollar yesterday and continued that rise this morning.  It started the week worth $1.34, dropped to $1.32 as hopes of a deal faded, and this morning climbed to $1.36.  The stock market reaction today has been muted - the FTSE 100 was barely changed this morning, but much of the reaction to the looming deal took place yesterday.  The FTSE 250, a stock market index that is regarded as more representative of the UK economy, climbed nearly 2% on Wednesday.  Lloyds Bank, which investors have come to see as a bellwether of sentiment towards a trade deal, rose 7% yesterday and another 6% this morning. An agreement on fishing rights has been the main stumbling block of the trade talks as an end-of-year deadline looms. The pound has seen plenty of volatility in recent weeks as negotiations between UK and European ministers have stalled and deadlines missed. Last week, it had hit a two-year high above $1.36. The British currency had surged almost 1% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak in what has been a roller-coaster ride. ""Sentiment improved after headlines started appearing that the United Kingdom and European Union have finally reached a provisional Brexit trade agreement."" said Jeffrey Halley at foreign exchange firm Oanda. If your reaction to ""market movements"" is that you are not directly affected because you do not invest money, think again. You are likely to be one of the millions of people with a pension - either privately or through work - who have their savings invested by pension schemes. As much as £600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest their money to help it grow. But that means the value of your savings pot is influenced by the performance of the investments. So rises or falls in shares can affect your pension and effectively your savings, which is why you are affected by major market movements. However, it's worth bearing in mind that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet, so short-term market fluctuations are not something to panic about. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.  ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term,"" she adds. ""It's important to bear in mind that investors have lived through major ups and downs in the past and come out the other side."""
market volatility,Irn Bru sales up as new recipe introduced,2024-09-15,2018-03-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43555306,"The maker of Irn Bru has reported its sharpest annual rise in sales of the soft drink, up by 8%. AG Barr issued its figures for the year to January with strong results also for its Rubicon fruit drink brand, up 5%, and Funkin mixers, up 25%. The firm cited an increase in market share, and moving most of its products out of the reach of the new sugar levy. Next week the UK government will begin to tax soft drinks with more than five grams of sugar per 100 millilitres.  By reformulating its drinks with less sugar, AG Barr says 99% of products will not be affected by the levy, which is aimed at improving health. The Lanarkshire-based company has also announced a new strategic partnership with Bundaberg, the family-owned Australian firm best known for its ginger beer. AG Barr reported a more modest 4% growth to international sales. One reason for the rise in Irn Bru sales was a boost to its plastic bottling capacity at the new Milton Keynes plant. It has also sought to align its marketing with the growth in ""food-to-go"" in retail chains such as Greggs. Newly-launched Irn Bru Xtra sold the equivalent of 60 million cans during the year - a third of the figure for Irn Bru Sugar Free. Rubicon Spring water, another new product, sold 17 million bottles. Overall, revenue in the year to January 27 was up 8% to £278m, while pre-tax profits rose 4% to £45m. Roger White, chief executive of AG Barr said the firm has delivered ""consistent broad-based sales growth across our portfolio, well ahead of the soft drinks market  performance throughout the year, supported by successful innovation, strong core brands, and further development of our partnership"". He added: ""The UK economy is likely to expected to remain uncertain for business as a whole, with regulation, changing customer dynamics and consumer preferences adding further volatility for the soft drinks industry."""
market volatility,Business output grows further as restrictions ease,2024-09-15,2021-07-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-57779997,"Looser Covid restrictions helped boost Scottish private sector output to near record levels last month, according to a report. A regular RBS survey of purchasing managers found a steep rise in new business, with firms hiring more staff for the third month in a row. ""Improved client confidence"" was among other reasons cited for the upturn. The rate of output growth was slower than May's, but was still the second quickest since September 2013. The survey follows a separate RBS report on jobs, which found hiring activity at Scottish businesses continued to surge last month, amid easing Covid-19 restrictions and rising economic activity. The bank's latest PMI index - which measures combined manufacturing and service sector output - posted 58.4 in June, falling from May's survey record of 61.5.  Any figure above 50 suggests economic expansion. The survey indicated that the latest increase in new business was broad-based and led by services, with goods producers seeing growth slow on the month. Meanwhile, input prices faced by private sector firms continued to soar during June, with the rate of inflation the fastest since February 2011.  Panellists attributed greater costs to material shortages, price hikes at suppliers, Brexit and higher fuel and utilities prices. In response, Scottish private sector firms increased their average charges for the eighth month running. According to the survey, companies remained optimistic about activity over the coming year.  That confidence was linked to looser lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reopening of some sectors, as well as ""surging inflows"" of new work and hopes of a strong economic recovery. RBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said the June data showed ""some signs of optimism"" for the Scottish firms. ""The rates of increase in both business activity and new work slowed only slightly from May's respective series records and remained marked,"" he said. ""Inflationary pressures are a key concern, however, as material shortages and greater fuel and utilities fees continued to put severe upward pressure on input costs and, subsequently, selling prices."" In a separate development, Scotland's public spending watchdog has warned of ""acute and unpredictable"" financial pressures that will require co-operation between Scottish and UK governments.  Scotland's auditor general Stephen Boyle said in a blog on Friday that the response to Covid had made finances more complex than ever, and managing volatility would be difficult.  He warned that the £4.6bn committed to Covid spending for this year was not guaranteed by the UK government and could be increased or reduced. Mr Boyle said there was a need for effective communication and co-operation between Downing Street and Holyrood.  He added that acute and unpredictable financial pressures did not only come from the public health crisis, but from backlogs in the NHS and courts."
market volatility,Oil price rises due to fears over Russian shortfall,2024-09-15,2022-03-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60680787,"Oil prices rose on Thursday amid confusion over whether major producers would help to plug a gap in supplies from Russia. The United Arab Emirates had appeared to push members of the Opec producer group to raise output, only for the UAE's energy minister to quash hopes. The oil price rose more than 5%, after a 17% fall on Wednesday. ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement,"" said analyst Stephen Innes. US President Joe Biden and other leaders have pledged to try to ease the price pressures for households. Officials from the US have been in talks with oil producers aimed at boosting supply. ""We favour production increases and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels,"" Ambassador Yousuf Al Otaiba said in a statement tweeted by the UAE Embassy in Washington. But the energy minister Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said later that the Gulf state remained committed to the existing Opec monthly output agreement, which fixes how much crude is produced by member countries. Oil prices have jumped more than 30% since 24 February, touching $139 (£105) a barrel at one point this week.  The oil price had fallen back to about $106 a barrel at one point on Wednesday, but by Thursday morning it was trading at around $116. On Tuesday, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck issued an ""urgent appeal"" to Opec oil producers to increase output ""to create relief on the market"". Saudi Arabia-led Opec and an extended group of oil producers called Opec+ - which includes Russia - have agreed to avoid a price war and keep control over the market. Mr Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management, said: ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement as we are in an unprecedented situation."" Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said: ""We think it will be challenging for Opec+ to boost production in this environment.""  Worries about oil and gas supplies have led to soaring domestic heating bills and fuel prices at the pump. Both petrol and diesel prices hit new records in the UK on Wednesday, according to the RAC motoring group. Unleaded petrol was 159.57p a litre on average, while diesel was 167.37p.  By Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondent Despite the mixed messages coming out from the UAE, there is a broad consensus within Opec+ that there is no immediate need to boost oil production faster. So, even if the UAE tries to convince other members to increase production during the next meeting, it will be difficult to find many backers.  While Abu Dhabi is a prominent member of Opec+, Riyadh and Moscow are the leaders of the pack and they are the ones who call the shots. Any decision to increase supplies will essentially boil down to Saudi Arabia. While the UAE is keen to increase production, it is very unlikely that it will break ranks and pump more oil unilaterally.  Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have maintained a neutral stance during the course of this war, and the former would be unwilling to take any decision related to Opec+ that the Russians would oppose. Opec+ has attributed the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and maintained that there is no shortage of supplies in the market. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""A tank of petrol is now almost £88 while diesel has now gone over £92. Diesel unfortunately appears to be on a clear path to £1.70 a litre. ""As this is an average price, drivers will be seeing some unbelievably high prices on forecourts as retailers pass on their increased wholesale costs."" Energy prices have been soaring for more than a year amid a rapid rebound in demand for oil, which had collapsed during the pandemic. Russia's invasion of Ukraine added new price pressures, as sanctions make it hard for the country - typically the producer of about 7% of global supplies -  to find buyers for its oil.  The US and Canada have also announced bans on Russian oil imports, while the UK said it would phase them out by the end of the year. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic national reserves, but that move is not enough to respond to the recent run-up in prices. The agency said on Wednesday that oil reserves may be tapped further. ""If there's a need, if our governments decide so, we can bring more oil to the markets, as one part of the response,"" said IEA chief Faith Birol."
market volatility,Is the shopping centre ready to check out?,2024-09-15,2018-11-30,By Bill Wilson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46383807,"In the 1960s shopping centres offered a vision of the future - large shiny complexes which looked to bring the ease and glamour of US suburban malls to UK town and city centres. From the 1970s to the 1990s they were followed by out-of-town shopping centres, often built on land which had recently housed Britain's vanishing heavy industries. In the past decade there has been a 21st Century renaissance in the original concept of the city centre arcades, whether it be the new Westfield Centres in Shepherd's Bush and Stratford in London, or the rebirth of the once-derided Bull Ring in Birmingham. At the same time the growth of online shopping, and other societal changes, have left a fractured landscape, and an industry looking at an uncertain future. The latest illustration of this has been the cancellation of a £2.8bn deal to purchase shopping centre giant Intu Properties - owner of the Trafford and Arndale centres in Manchester, Metrocentre in Gateshead, and Lakeside in Essex. The potential buyers, a consortium led by Peel Group, blamed ""uncertainty around current macroeconomic conditions and the potential near-term volatility across markets"". In November, a report from analyst Nelson Blackley warned that more than 200 UK shopping centres were in danger of falling into administration. According to Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics, shopping centres which have an exciting future will be those that plug into the desires of consumers to be more than mere ""shoppers"". He says there should also be a future for those outlets which offer a more nuts-and-bolts service, but are in good locations. ""In my view we are seeing, in terms of physical properties, the polarisation in the shopping market, between those retail centres which are thriving because they are flagship destinations, and the rest,"" says Mr Lim. ""These flagship shopping centres - the likes of Westfield, Leeds Trinity, Birmingham's Bullring - are the ones that are tapping into consumers' desire for experiences;  offering bars, restaurants, cinemas, bowling alleys, opportunities to try things like cooking, and so on. ""Looking at these centres, the retail experience is important but it is not necessarily the sole driver of footfall."" He adds: ""It is by having a blended proposition, that includes other activities, that will allow a centre to thrive.   ""Experiences are more important than ever before - Western households have an abundance of material possessions and want something more."" As well as these landmark ""experience"" destinations, Mr Lim says that there is a strata of secondary and tertiary shopping centres that are doing well. ""These are the sites close to where people live, work, or have transport hubs nearby.  These outlets will have seen their retail pull diminish over the past 10 years. But their locations enable them to have a sustainable level of footfall to survive. ""But those shopping centres which do not have one of the benefits of these location factors are the most susceptible to the growing lure of online."" Mr Lim says not only is consumer behaviour changing - but that it is changing very quickly.  It is being brought about not only by online the growth of the experience economy, but also by the development of smartphones making it easier to make purchases on the go. ""At the same time there has been a diminishing of the value attached to possessions.  Millennials are one of the groups driving this retail change, what they want are experiences they can share with their friends on social media, something very different to what older people want,"" he adds. After the Intu deal fell through, shares in it and in rival chain Hammerson fell sharply.  Intu, while saying it would continue to invest in the long term of its shopping centres, pointed to what it said was was a ""challenging market."" ""There is the uncertainty of Brexit, which is likely to inform a lot of shopping centre decisions in the near future,"" says Mr Lim. ""But there also has to be an acknowledgement that the bigger picture for shopping centres is one of fast-changing consumer behaviour."" Graham Parker is editor of industry magazine Retail Destination (formerly Shopping Centres). ""The story is that shoppers are migrating to the top of the range shopping centres, such as the Trafford Centre or Bluewater in Kent,"" he says. He says that footfall across shopping centres generally is down 2.5% to 3%, but only by 1% at the prime locations.  ""Physical retail is suffering not only from online shopping, but increasing business rate bills, the national minimum wage and Brexit hitting the pound and making imports more expensive,"" he adds. ""This may have to get worse before they get better. That is why this Christmas is going to be absolutely crucial for shopping centres and the brands and chains that have outlets in them."""
market volatility,JP Morgan sues Tesla for $162m after Musk tweets,2024-09-15,2021-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59306199," JP Morgan Chase is suing Tesla for $162m (£121m) over tweets in 2018 by boss Elon Musk that he could take the electric car maker private. The bank accused Tesla of ""flagrantly"" breaching a deal it claims should have triggered payments to JP Morgan. Mr Musk's notorious tweets that he had funding to take Tesla off the New York stock market sparked volatility in the share price. He later abandoned the move and was fined by the US financial regulator. JP Morgan's suit, filed in a Manhattan federal court, says the companies had an agreement signed in 2014 that allowed the bank to buy Tesla shares at a set price and date. Under the deal, Tesla sold so-called warrants to JP Morgan allowing the bank to purchase shares if the ""strike"" price was below Tesla's share price when the warrants expired in June and July 2021. ""We have provided Tesla multiple opportunities to fulfil its contractual obligations, so it is unfortunate that they have forced this issue into litigation,"" a spokesperson for JP Morgan said in a statement. JP Morgan said the warrants contained standard provisions that allowed it to adjust their price to protect both parties against the economic effects of ""significant corporate transactions involving Tesla,"" such as an announcement the company was going private. Mr Musk's tweeted on 7 August 2018 tweet that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share and had ""funding secured"". He scrapped the plan 17 days later. Tesla's share price rose approximately 10-fold by the time the warrants expired this year, and JP Morgan said this required Tesla under its contract to hand over shares of its stock or cash.  Failure to do so, said JP Morgan, amounted to a default. Tesla has yet to comment publicly on the bank's lawsuit. But the company said in 2019 when news of the dispute emerged that JP Morgan was being ""opportunistic"" to take advantage of the share price volatility. Mr Musk is an enthusiastic and frequently controversial user of twitter, and now has 64 million followers.  Only this month the billionaire caused a stir when he asked his followers in a twitter poll whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares. The vote was 'yes'. His 2018 tweets on taking Tesla off the stock market led to charges from the powerful US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, for misleading the market. Mr Musk vehemently denied the charges, but eventually agreed a settlement that led to him stepping down as chairman of the carmaker. He and Tesla paid $40m in penalties."
market volatility,Oil on stormy market waters,2024-09-15,2020-05-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52718928,"Tuesday 19 May: pencilled in to my diary as a day to watch for oil market chaos. I'll have to focus on the new job figures instead, because the oil market is on the up. The warning of chaos came a month ago, when the US benchmark price went negative. Global supply was vastly outstripping demand. Storage tanks at Cushing, Oklahoma - the hub for storing the region's oil - were either filling up, or booked up. And in a quirk of America's oil market, the monthly closure of delivery contracts arrived with a lot of traders unable to store the black stuff. So they had to pay to offload it. With even more supply and even less storage by mid-May, things were set fair for more of the same mayhem. But things have changed. The price of West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude has risen from below $20, when the mayhem subsided a month ago, to nearly $33 per barrel, surging 12% for good measure on Monday. Brent crude, the North Sea cocktail that serves as a benchmark for the rest of the world, was also up by nearly 8%, trading around $35. The last time they were close to these levels was mid-March, on a rapid descent because Opec had failed to agree with Russia on cutting production, and both Europe and North America were heading towards lockdown. What things have changed? There's more demand than there was. China and its neighbours have fired up their economies to some extent. Europe and North America are beginning to do so. Monday's stock markets were also buoyed by a more positive vibe from eased lockdown and a supportive US Fed. Supply has been cut. The eventual agreement between the Opec oil exporter cartel and non-member Russia was not enough last month, but Saudis added a further tranche of production cuts. There's still an imbalance, and the price is still lower than producers want or need it to be. But it looks stabilised for now. One of the most significant parts of the supply cut was in the US. America doesn't have an autocrat's power to turn the taps. A historic quirk of the Texas oil industry is that it's regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission. It met early this month, and opted not to impose any restraints. That's because the price was restraining enough. Fracking is a boom and bust technology. In March, production was very strong. The USA had become the world's biggest oil producer. But by the middle of this month, it had lost two-thirds of the temporary drilling rigs used to frack for oil and gas, and counted weekly by industry data specialist Baker Hughes. That is going to hurt those who invested in the US boom, but it's good news for other producers who needed prices to rise.  Effectively, it means the US has become the swing producer. Instead of the Saudi-led Opec cartel controlling the taps and therefore the price, the price has become the mechanism for Texan and Dakotan drillers to match demand with supply. There is one other element worth noting about the decreased volatility from last month. Industry analysts explain much of the plunge into negative prices by reference to speculative flows of investment funds. There are moves afoot to limit the ability of investors to move US markets that way - though they were also afoot 12 years ago, when speculators drove the price up to a $145 spike. That matters because volatility directly affects investment decisions by oil companies, and that feeds through to jobs. A lot of jobs. President Trump is aware of that in an election year. He performed an impressive contortion last week, with a Tweet that welcomed both rising crude prices - meaning jobs, and low fuel costs, which has felt like a tax cut. It also matters because speculators can disrupt markets for other commodities that are important to the world economy. That could include food, which saw a period of global market volatility during the financial crisis in 2008, and left a lot of people hungry. One commodity that is always there at times of crisis, as a safe haven in an investment storm, is gold. It doesn't earn you anything, but it's rare and it doesn't corrode. It's been on the rise in recent weeks, now trading at its highest levels since 2012, above $1.750 per ounce."
market volatility,Bank forecasts worst UK growth since 2009,2024-09-15,2019-02-07,By Ben Morris,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47155537,"The Bank of England expects growth this year to be the slowest since 2009 when the economy was in recession. It is forecasting growth of 1.2% this year, down from its previous forecast of 1.7% made in November.  The Bank said it had seen further evidence that businesses were being cautious in the run-up to Brexit, including evidence from its own survey of firms. As expected the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75%. The Bank put the fall in growth down to a decline in business investment and housebuilding, as well as a halving of the growth rate in exports. The UK was also being hit by slower-than-expected growth in the eurozone and China, the Bank said in its Quarterly Inflation Report. ""Growth appears to have slowed at the end of 2018 and is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" it said. The Bank even sees a one-in-four chance of the economy slipping into recession in the second half of this year. There has been an ""intensification"" of Brexit uncertainties, the Bank said. Its survey of 208 firms showed that half had started putting plans in place for a no-deal Brexit. The survey also showed that a fifth had taken on extra warehouse space It also noted a sharp fall in business investment at the end of last year. ""Uncertainty appears to have risen recently, and may have weighed on investment by more than had been expected in August,"" the Bank said. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ""The fog of Brexit is causing short term volatility in the economic data, and more fundamentally, it is creating a series of tensions in the economy, tensions for business."" Interest rates remain at 0.75%, where they have been since the Bank of England last raised in interest rates in August. Many economists think that once the uncertainty over Brexit is lifted then the economy will accelerate and the Bank will have to raise interest rates to stop it overheating. However, recent economic data has indicated weakness in the UK economy. Growth in the service sector, the biggest part of the economy, appeared to have stalled in January, according to closely-watched survey of purchasing managers. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicts that the Bank will raise rates once this year and twice in 2020. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We still think that a decent rebound in GDP growth, should a Brexit deal be reached, will result in interest rates rising further than the Bank and the financial markets assume."" Moves in interest rates are important to the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages. Even a small rise of 0.25% can add hundreds of pounds to their annual mortgage costs. ""It's a very good time for people looking to borrow,"" said Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco, a mortgage broker. He said there had been a lot of competition among lenders in January, with some very good deals for five-year fixed mortgage deals. Some lenders are offering five-year fixed deals at below 2%, he said. Concern over Brexit has held back some people from borrowing. ""There is a lot of pent-up demand,"" said Mr Montlake. Savers who depend on higher interest rates to boost their incomes will be disappointed that rates have stayed on hold for a sixth consecutive month.   While the Bank cut its growth forecast it also noted the strength of the labour market, where the unemployment rate is currently 4%. The rate at which people are switching to new jobs is only slightly below the level hit before the financial crisis of 2007. That switching suggests that employers are having to compete to attract staff, the Bank said. It also noted a pick-up in the average number of hours worked at the end of last year and firmer wage growth. The Bank thinks that wage growth will increase in the coming years as the UK's unemployment rate continues to fall. The main reason the Bank thinks underlying inflation pressures will grow is that wage growth will rise. Britain's unemployment rate has hit its lowest level in more than 40 years.  The Bank predicts that earnings will rise by more than 3% a year over the next three years."
market volatility,Oil producers stick to their plan despite Ukraine,2024-09-15,2022-03-03,By Sameer Hashmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60591107,"Even though oil prices have surged to ten-year highs, a powerful cartel of oil-producing countries say they will only increase their output by a modest amount.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, led by Russia, known as Opec+, will not be turning on the taps. The 23-country-strong cartel will add 400,000 barrels of oil per-day to the market from April.  The group is sticking firmly to an agreement signed by its members in 2021 - to continue gradual restoration of output that was halted during the pandemic. Many countries produced fewer barrels of oil during the pandemic as demand dropped sharply during lockdowns. However, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine the global benchmark contract for oil, Brent crude, has surged to $119 a barrel, driven by anxiety over tighter supply.  Opec+ released a statement attributing the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by ""current geopolitical tensions"" and stated that there was no shortage of supplies in the market. Separately, members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) have also agreed to release more oil on to the market - 60 million barrels - from their strategic petroleum reserves.  Half of that volume is expected to come from the United States. But the emergency move did little to reassure stock and commodity markets with oil prices rising immediately after the decision was announced. Energy market experts believe oil prices will remain high in the near-term.  Markets are likely to remain volatile because major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have announced plans to exit Russian operations and joint ventures.  According to reports, customers of Russian oil are already facing difficulty over payments and shipping after the West's sanctions were imposed, blocking some Russian banks from global payment systems. ""In the short run, we are looking at a pretty serious run-up in prices. All this uncertainty about Russia, the potential threat of physical disruptions is making the markets nervous"" says Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Traders suggest oil exporters have been offering Russia's highest-quality oil at a discount over the last few days but found few buyers. Russia is the world's third largest producer of oil, behind the United States and Saudi Arabia. It accounts for 8-10% of global oil supply. Europe relies on Russia for nearly 40% of its natural gas. So, given Russia's crucial position in the global energy market, the US and European Union have, so far, stopped short of imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industries. Analysts say the group's decision to stick to its timetable - a gradual increase in production - has not come as a surprise, given its previous reluctance to deviate from steadily ramping-up output.  Key members of Opec+ may fear that adding more supplies to the market at this stage could lead to an oversupply later in the year. A glut would bring down prices sharply.  Energy experts believe that from the cartel's point of view little has changed yet in terms of physical supply on the market. And that prices have risen in direct response to uncertainty over the invasion. However, there have been some noticeable changes, buyers reluctant to purchase from Russia, for instance, are now switching to similar grades of Middle Eastern oil.  ""Opec+ has always based its decisions on what the current data is showing them, rather than what the data will look like in the future due to geopolitical factors"" says Ahmed Mehdi, Analyst, Renaissance Energy Advisors, an energy research house. There may also be another reason Opec+ members are holding back. Negotiations to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are widely expected to come to a head in March. If sanctions on oil-producer, Iran, are eased, then it could unlock Iranian oil exports.  Mr Cahill believes that the deal could put the brakes on the oil rally, and bring down prices. ""The Iran deal is the wildcard: it could break the price momentum"" he says.  US president Joe Biden's administration, alarmed by rising fuel prices, has been putting pressure on key Opec member states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to turn on the taps, with little success. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been in touch. During a call with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan it is thought the two leaders discussed the Opec+ deal and pledged to continue coordination on global energy markets. The response to the Ukraine conflict from the Gulf States has, so far, been muted.  Last week, the UAE, a close ally of the US in the region, abstained during the vote on a draft United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Moscow's actions. Analysts suggest Saudi Arabia and the UAE may be taking a more neutral stance to preserve co-operation with Russia on geopolitical and energy issues."
market volatility,Recession fears prompt selling in global stocks,2024-09-15,2019-08-14,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49352760,"Global stock markets fell around the world as concerns about the US-China trade war and the global economy prompted investors to dump shares. The three main US stock markets closed 3% lower overnight, European stocks fell across the board, while Asian stock markets opened lower. Weak data from Germany and China on Wednesday helped fuel a rush for safe assets like bonds and gold. Bond market moves pointed to possible recessions in major economies. The US central bank also came under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump for not doing enough to support the world's largest economy.  There are concerns that renewed attacks by Mr Trump on the Federal Reserve could erode investor confidence on its ability to make independent decisions. Analyst Oliver Pursche, from financial services company Bruderman, said the global picture was precarious. ""What's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening with Brexit and the trade war, it's all a mess,"" the chief market strategist said. ""Every central bank around the world is trying to prop up economies and every politician around the world is trying to destroy economies."" News that Germany's GDP contracted in the second quarter, and that China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low, had already spooked markets in Europe. The FTSE 100 closed more than 1% lower, while in Germany and France the markets finished more than 2% lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped some 2% in early trading on Thursday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 1.4% lower. Both later regained some ground. Disruptions related to pro-democracy protests have also weighed on the stock market in Hong Kong.  Another worry was that bond markets are flashing recession warnings.  The yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds inverted for the first time since June 2007.  This means investor appetite for safety is such that they are willing to get lower returns for holding bonds for a longer period. Usually investors demand higher returns for holding bonds for longer due to the risks involved with parking your money away for a long time. Historically, such bond movements have been a reliable indicator of possible recessions, and preceded the last global downturn more than 10 years ago. The UK bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2008, while the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year German government bonds was at its tightest since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the CBOE volatility index - the so-called fear index - jumped higher, and spot gold prices rose. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again attempted to deflect the market turmoil onto the US Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy, calling Fed chief Jerome Powell ""clueless"". In raising interest rates four times last year ""the Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late"" in cutting borrowing costs, the president tweeted. ""Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!"" Recent presidents have avoided commenting on Fed policy, in a sign of respect for the bank's independence. Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The recession signal from the bond market will only heap pressure on the Federal Reserve to give the president what he wants - more rate cuts. Wall Street certainly thinks it's inevitable, pricing in a cut in September. Last month, America's central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008. That failed to impress Donald Trump who berated Fed Chair Jay Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough. And as the havoc on the financial markets was unfolding, President Trump was back on twitter defending his administration's tariff war with China and attacking the Fed, calling the chairman clueless.  But if Mr Trump gets what he wants, it may come at a steep price.  The Fed's recent rate cut didn't buoy the markets like it used to. So it's not clear that more rate cuts will blunt the damage from his ongoing trade war with China which is creating uncertainty and raising costs for businesses and consumers. Earlier on Wednesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network the central bank should cut rates by half a percentage point ""as soon as possible"", an action he claimed would lead to stock markets soaring. Despite the US delaying the 1 September imposition of tariffs on some Chinese imports into the US, it has done little to ease concerns.  ""The challenge is that Trump's trade policy has proven so erratic that you cannot relieve the sense of uncertainty,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon.  As of September last year, the US central bank had a relatively rosy outlook for the economy, expecting that the stimulus from the Trump administration's massive $1.5tn tax cut package and spending in 2018 would sustain growth and justify steadily higher interest rates. Mr Trump wants to make the economy a central part of his case for his 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview scheduled to air on Fox Business Network on Friday, former Fed chief Janet Yellen said she felt the US economy remained ""strong enough"" to avoid a downturn, but ""the odds have clearly risen and they are higher than I'm frankly comfortable with""."
market volatility,"Carney: 150,000 firms 'not ready for no-deal'",2024-09-15,2019-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48710999,"About 150,000 businesses still do not have the paperwork they need to keep exporting to the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mark Carney has said.  The Bank of England governor added that many had built up contingency stocks, but these would only last ""weeks"". ""Business will be reliant on what the governments are able to do in order to keep the ports open, the trade flowing,"" he told the Today programme. But he said the financial system was prepared for a no-deal scenario.    The UK is due to leave the EU by 31 October after seeking an extension to leave the bloc back in March.  Boris Johnson, considered the favourite in the race to become the next prime minister, has said the UK must leave in October, even if it has not struck a deal.  His rival, Jeremy Hunt, has said the UK may need more time, although he would accept no-deal as a last resort.  Ahead of his Mansion House speech to the City on Thursday, Mr Carney said about three quarters of UK businesses have done as much as they could do to prepare for a no-deal.  ""But it doesn't mean they are fully ready, in fact far from it,"" he told the BBC.  He also stressed that in the event of a no-deal exit, the return of trade tariffs on goods shipped to the EU would be ""automatic"".  This contradicts a claim from Mr Johnson that the UK could secure a 10-year standstill in current arrangements using an article of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade known as ""Gatt 24"".  ""The Gatt rules are clear... Gatt 24 applies if you have a [withdrawal] agreement, not if you've decided not to have an agreement, or you have been unable to come to an agreement,"" Mr Carney said.   ""So... we should be clear that not having an agreement with the European Union would mean that there are tariffs, automatically, because the Europeans have to apply the same rules to us as they apply to everyone else.""  Mr Carney also said he was cautiously open to Facebook's new digital currency, Libra, which is due to launch in the first half of next year.  But he said the Bank would be setting ""ground rules upfront"" to protect consumers and their data, and that Libra ""had to be safe or it is not going to happen"". ""Welcome to the world of finance: there is oversight, there is consumer protection, there is market integrity, people have certain rights to privacy that have to be respected.  ""And we're not going to allow a network that comes into place that is a network for criminals and terrorists."" Facebook unveiled details about Libra this week, claiming the virtual currency would be as easy to use as texting. It said Libra would be independently managed, backed by real assets and pegged to a basket of well-known currencies.  But there have been concerns about how people's data and cash will be protected, as well as the currency's potential volatility.  Mr Carney said: ""All the major global central banks and supervisors would have direct regulatory control of this if it is going to work, which is an open question, and we have an open mind about it."""
market volatility,North Korea gears up for 'biggest military parade',2024-09-15,2020-10-08,By Laura Bicker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54459248,"North Korea is preparing for what is expected to be the largest military parade in its history. Thousands of soldiers have practised for months to ensure that each step is marched with precision and each fervent cry of adoration will be heard by the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. These events are often ostentatious formal displays of military might to show a devoted people paying homage to their leader in closely directed goose-stepping drills. Mistakes are not tolerated. But these parades can also be part provocation. A chance to show off new missiles and weaponry despite being under strict economic sanctions. The state has not featured any ballistic missiles in its parades since Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first summit in 2018.  Talks between the two sides broke down in Hanoi last February without a deal and North Korea has continued to test a number of new short range ballistic missiles.   This event, on 10 October, to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party comes just weeks before the US presidential election. So is North Korea going to use it to make a point and prove that it still has weapons capable of striking the United States? It's certainly going to be big, according to the editor-in-chief of the Daily NK, a Seoul-based website with paid sources in the North.  Lee Sang Yong told me that as early as March, Pyongyang had ordered its military to mobilise 32,000 soldiers. It's become so large that the site where soldiers practise has had to be expanded. ""The Pyongyang Mirim airport now has two new roads and 10 new buildings. Therefore, I think it is likely that we will see Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles [ICBMs] or Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles [SLBMs] on display at the parade this time,"" he said.  ""Also, 600 students and researchers from Kim Il-sung University will also take part. This is not an insignificant number. This university is where they develop new talent for missile development. By bringing them to the parade or putting them on display, North Korea may be trying to install pride and respect for the missile development talents."" Jeongmin Kim, an analyst with NK News, said North Korea does not always use these events to prove a point to the outside world. ""We have to remember that many times - for a hereditary dictatorship especially - they constantly have to prove legitimacy to rule to their domestic audience.  ""So 10 October will also aim to do exactly that: trying to show its people, with dazzling parades with uplifting propaganda slogans, that they are 'doing okay', despite all of what has been going on this year.  ""Of course, precedents do point to the possibility of Kim Jong-un or other high-level officials making a speech that may involve some message aimed at the outside world, such as how they are not waiting around for sanctions relief any more and will focus on 'self-reliance'."" While some will be watching for any new missiles on display, there is growing concern about the welfare of the 25 million North Korean people. 2020 has been a bad year for most countries, but for North Korea it has the potential to be devastating. ""I hear there is a surge in the number of orphans and homeless street kids in the North this year,"" said Lee Sang Yong. ""Even though we cannot even imagine it here in South Korea - there are people in the North who are dying and starving."" The state closed its borders to the outside world in January to prevent an outbreak of Covid 19 spreading from neighbouring China.  Authorities have reportedly issued ""shoot-to-kill"" orders along the border and created a buffer zone to stop anyone entering the country.  Diplomatic sources told me earlier this year that stockpiles of PPE and other essential medical supplies, including vaccines, had built up at the border with China, unable to get through. North Korea claims to have had no cases of Covid-19, but Kim Jong-un continues to hold high-level meetings to ensure tight restrictions remain in place. The North Korean people are now cut off from the outside world more than ever before. Even movement between provinces has been limited. ""Land, sea, and air. It's a complete shutdown of both people and material,"" said Mr Lee.  ""Unless you are military personnel or a high-ranking officer, no one is moving inside of North Korea. Quarantine measures against Covid-19 are so tight. ""The North Korean economy has come to a halt. Smugglers and small traders at the border have questioned why the regime is risking the fate of the economy if there is no Covid-19 in the country."" Six months' training for 10 minutes on parade Trade with its key ally China has plummeted by nearly 70% in the first eight months of this year, as compared to last year.  The impoverished state has also been battered by extreme weather in recent months and Korean state television spends its afternoons showing ""heroic"" efforts to overcome the damage from several typhoons. Kim Jong-un has now ordered a nationwide drive to try to boost the ailing economy, describing it as an ""80-day battle"".   In short, that means more work for the North Korean people, extra hours in the fields or factories and additional duties in their towns and villages. The harder they struggle, the more loyal they will seem to local leaders. The message blasted across state TV is one of ""self-reliance"". In the South, farms across the country are busy harvesting rice. But it's hard to know if this is happening in the North. It's difficult to get a clear picture of how badly the state's harvests have been hit, but with 11 million people in the country thought to be food insecure, even a small number of rain-ravaged fields can amount to thousands going hungry. My team travelled to the Demilitarised Zone near Geosong on the east coast. We drive past white sandy beaches flanked by high barbed wire. Bright blue skies give us a crystal clear view of the mountains to the north. A few checkpoints are visible on the peaks From here, curious South Koreans love to peer into the North. This is as close as they can get. Pyongyang dramatically cut off all communication with Seoul in June and blew up the inter-Korean liaison office Earlier this month an incident in disputed waters to the west of the peninsula saw a South Korean man, thought to have been trying to defect, shot and killed. His body was burned.  It shocked South Koreans. And yet the North still has friends here. Some still harbour hopes of ending the 70-year war even after Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un could not reach a deal on denuclearisation. Just three years ago, North and South Koreans competed together at the Winter Olympics in Gangwon province and the local governor believes it's time to look again at these types of exchanges as a path to peace. ""The effort to reach a big deal resulted in no deal. It is time for us to go back to develop non-political initiatives and to achieve small deals in sport and cultural exchanges,"" said Choi Moon Soon. ""It is very unfortunate that we are left with the situation that even small exchanges between North and South Korea are cut off by pursuing the political big deal and revealing differences in the process."" Mr Choi would like to create a United Nations peace zone at the border.  International sanctions mean this is an unlikely dream for now. Instead Mr Choi acknowledged that North Korea is keeping a close eye on the US presidential election to figure out its next move. ""I am not sure if I will see North and South Korea unified in my life time but I have two daughters and I would like it if they didn't inherit this volatile situation. We live with continuing threat and potential of conflict. We shouldn't pass down this volatility to our next generation."" That may be out of his hands and instead fall to whoever wins the White House. Pyongyang is trying to read the situation inside and outside its country. It's not yet clear which path it's willing to take.  Will its current perilous predicament eventually encourage Kim Jong-un back to the negotiating table. Or will he look further inward and keep the borders closed. The North Korean leader has been unusually quiet this year. This parade is a chance to show his hand and his agenda and put the fate of his country back into the public eye."
market volatility,US suggests Russia could be behind gas pipe leaks,2024-09-15,2022-09-29,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63084613,"The US has said it ""seems"" Russia is to blame for this week's leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told the BBC an investigation was being carried out into the cause of what she called ""an act of sabotage"", adding ""it is highly unlikely that these incidents are coincidence"" No evidence about how the leaks happened has been made public. Russia has dismissed suggestions that it was to blame. It said claims it had damaged the pipelines were ""stupid and absurd"". President Putin described the damage as ""unprecedented sabotage, in fact, an act of international terrorism"" during a phone call with Turkey's President Erdogan, according to the Kremlin, which added Russia plans to bring it up for ""urgent discussion"" at the UN Security Council. Earlier Russia's Foreign Ministry suggest it was the US that stood to benefit from the pipeline being out of action because it would be able to increase its own natural gas sales. The White House has dismissed such suggestions. ""It's probably most likely some form of sabotage,"" according to Mike Fulwood of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. ""If there was one incident of a pipeline rupture of leak then accidental damage could be a possibility, it is very rare. ""The most likely cause of accidental damage is an anchor being dropped and dragging across the pipeline"". He added that with multiple leaks in a short period of time ""doesn't sound like it could be accidental, although theoretically it could be"". The high water pressure at the bottom of sea makes a detonation difficult, according to energy engineering expert Professor Russell Johns of Penn State University.  He says ""it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance"" if they wanted to stop supplies. The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine.  The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs.  Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history. ""I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner,"" she said. ""No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy"". The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth. The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna. ""Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."" Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets. However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share ""in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels"". When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that ""this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan"" and that such a move ""helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security"". This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders. Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps ""so that citizens are not hurting"". Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, ""at least the American companies as good American citizens"" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK. ""We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest. ""We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."" One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump. The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election.  An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: ""I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that.""

market volatility,Apple iPhone sales fears rock Wall Street,2024-09-15,2018-11-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46186131,"Apple shares sank by 5% on Monday, dragging down US markets and wiping more than $40bn (£31bn; €35bn) off the tech giant's market value. The fall followed a profit warning from some of the firm's suppliers, which exacerbated concerns that demand for iPhones is slowing. The declines made the company one of the biggest losers on the Dow, which closed down 2.3%. The wider S&P 500 ended about 2% lower, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.75%. Technology stocks led the Wall Street sell-off which saw shares in most sectors tumble.  Tech firms helped drive many of the stock market gains earlier in the year but now face rising calls for regulatory and tax changes that could hurt their growth. Amazon shares lost more than 4%, Alphabet dropped over 2.5% while Facebook fell 2.3%. Apple's share price fall came after Lumentum, a US manufacturer of facial recognition technology and Apple supplier, said one of its major customers had reduced its shipments. As a result, Lumentum downgraded its sales and profit outlook, sending its shares down over 30%. Lumentum's warning came shortly after another Apple supplier, Japan Display, also cut its full-year guidance blaming ""volatile customer demand"". The warnings from Apple suppliers extended a slide in Apple shares that started earlier this month after the firm's sales forecast disappointed investors. The shares closed at about $194, down 5% for the day and more than 15% below their peak in October. Apple has insisted that it is optimistic about its Christmas season outlook, attributing the weaker than expected forecast to one-off changes, such as the timing of the release of new phones, and temporary supply chain issues. It continues to make record profits, thanks to higher prices and growing income from its services business, which includes services such as the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music. But analysts have remained sceptical, especially after the firm said it would stop sharing the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells with investors. They have warned that Apple's reliance on higher prices could also make it especially vulnerable if there is a broader pullback in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, which has been embroiled in a corruption scandal at Malaysia's state-backed development fund, also dragged Wall Street indexes lower.  Shares in the investment bank ended down about 7.5%, after a Malaysian official said the country wanted a refund of the fees Goldman earned for work on bond sales for the 1MDB fund. A former Goldman executive this month pleaded guilty to US charges that he had participated in a scheme to use some of the money raised in those offerings for bribes. The US market declines come amid an extended period of volatility on Wall Street, with investors wary due to warnings of a slowdown in global growth, trade tensions, falling oil prices and rising interest rates. US companies are also facing a rising dollar, which hurts sales overseas.  The combination of factors has helped fuel speculation that corporate profits may be at their peak, especially after several companies, including Apple and Amazon, issued weaker than expected sales forecasts for the months ahead."
market volatility,Living with mum and dad at 30,2024-09-15,2018-05-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44236706,"The story of the US couple successfully winning the right to evict their 30-year-old son from their home, has prompted a number of 30-somethings to get in touch with the BBC about their experiences of living with their parents. Reasons for staying at home range from the culturally acceptable to the financial. Here, people in their 30s describe their current living arrangements with mum and dad. ""I have lived my whole life in Calgary, an oil and gas-based city. I saw an abundance of oil and gas jobs in the industry growing up, and becoming a petroleum geologist seemed like a natural course to take. ""I was thrilled when I got my first permanent job at a small oil company, and later I had saved enough money for a down payment on a small townhouse.  ""But in July 2016 the company I worked for declared bankruptcy as the price of oil fell. I received no severance but I was able to sell my townhouse (at a loss) right before the company went under.  ""My parents and I have always had a good relationship and they were gracious enough to let me move back in with them. They recognise and understand the issues young Canadians encounter.  ""A lot of my friends are in the same position and understand the situation I am in. If anything, it's me who is putting pressure on myself to leave home. ""There is still considerable volatility in my employment and in the Canadian oil and gas industry. I am not confident in moving forward and purchasing or renting a new place. ""I would now consider myself in a place of 'precarious employment'.  I have no employment insurance, no health or dental coverage. I am not alone in my career uncertainty. I feel I have done everything right, but I still feel anxiety towards the future of my career.  ""Right now, 'leaving the nest' is just not a financially wise decision."" ""Tuition fees were introduced at the time I was applying for university so I couldn't afford to go away from home to study.  ""I stayed home and studied at the Open University whilst juggling a business and part-time jobs to pay for tuition, business expenses, transport, domestic contributions and saving for a house deposit.  ""By the time I graduated from the four-year degree and teaching qualification, house prices in my area had quadrupled - £45,000 starter homes went up to £180,000, and I have been priced out ever since.  ""It was devastating - if I got a full-time job at 16 and saved I would have been able to buy a house! ""I think my chance of buying my own home has probably gone. I tried to get a good education, but when I worked it out, I was worse off having gone to university."" You may also like: US parents win battle to evict son, 30 Single, 30 and time to leave home? 'Our family's housing market generation gap' ""I have a friend who was in the same situation at first. But because of the 'Bank of Mum and Dad' who helped her out, things were never the same between us. ""You do feel cut off from people because you feel you become different from them. It can be isolating. ""I've kind of given up now. When I was around 30, I wanted to move out but you get to the point that it's not worth it. I could probably get a deposit together but my wages are not enough to pay for a mortgage.  ""In some ways living at home is a good thing because of family health issues - I might have had to come back home anyway. My parents are elderly, so it's probably too late to move out now.  ""I'm paying towards household bills and groceries. We try to make the best of it, but we do get fed up of society saying I should move out - sometimes you don't always have a choice!"" ""I have a full-time job and help at home by paying towards the mortgage, utilities, and I do household chores.  ""Even though I contribute at home, I still follow my parents' house rules - the main one is that I can't bring a male visitor to stay at my parents' house overnight.  ""Also, I have to let them know if I'm going out, where I'm going and with whom just in case of emergency, but I don't mind. It's just a sign of gratitude and respect.  ""In my culture as a Filipino, it's normal for children to live with their parents even if they're all grown up. We have a close-knit family. ""I think when parents take care of their kids from newborn to 18, it's the kids' turn to take care of their parents when they get old. ""Nowadays, people are trying to save money especially after college when a lot of us are in debt so more people are staying longer at home with parents.  ""I have four siblings who all moved out when they got married. I'm still single and so I'm at home. But I don't feel any pressure to move out. The thought of moving out by myself never occurred to me."" Interviews by Andree Massiah, UGC Hub & Social News team"
market volatility,How PM Modi misread the mood of India's farmers,2024-09-15,2021-01-13,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55630394,"After more than 45 days of protests and eight rounds of talks with the government, India's farmers have refused to budge. Nothing short of a repeal of three market-friendly farm laws - designed to loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce - will make the farmers retreat from protest sites ringing the capital, Delhi. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court, responding to a bunch of petitions, put the laws on hold. The uncertainty lingers. So why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government fail to anticipate the blowback to the laws and misread the public mood in the affected states of Punjab and Haryana? Were they lulled into complacency because a Punjab-based ally initially supported the laws? (The Akali Dal later reversed its stand and quit the government.) Did the government believe that the laws would not lead to any significant erosion of popular support? Mr Modi has built a reputation for tough talking and playing hardball with his critics and his party is widely believed to have its ears to the ground. Protests had been brewing in Punjab even before the laws were ratified in the parliament in the middle of the pandemic last September. Angry farmers had squatted on railway tracks in protest. In late September, the regional Akali Dal had walked out.   So why was Mr Modi caught on the wrong foot by what has now grown into arguably the world's biggest protest? One reason, many believe, is that Mr Modi has not faced a mass movement against his regime. A protest by the influential Patel community in Gujarat in 2015 demanding quotas in government jobs lingered on for four years before a resolution. A months-long protest led mostly by Muslim women in a Delhi neighbourhood against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was cleared last March amid measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. But none were as large and intense as the ongoing protests, and did not challenge the government in the way the defiant farmers have.  ""I don't think Mr Modi misread the situation because he had no knowledge about the protests in Punjab. I think the overconfidence arose from his inexperience in dealing with mass protests,"" says Prof Parminder Singh, a civil rights activist. Second, the current protests are significantly different from similar agitations in India's history. In colonial India, peasant revolts against exploitative rulers often turned violent. Since Independence in 1947, farmers have staged demonstrations against falling crop prices, indebtedness and farm distress. But none have seen the staggering levels of cohesion and mobilisation - involving some 40 farmers' unions, more than half a million protesters, and large swathes of civil society - as the ongoing agitation.  The protests have originated in Punjab, the relatively prosperous farming heartland of India. Along with its neighbour Haryana, the two states have benefited most from India's farm policies. These farmers are now frustrated over stagnant and falling farm incomes and fear that entry of private businesses will hurt their future. The protests have now widened to coalesce around a range of anxieties over farming in India - shrinking plots of land, diminished produce, volatility in crop prices, and centralisation of lawmaking in a country where farming matters are mainly entrusted with the states.   ""The protest is more than an arena of grievances,"" Pratap Bhanu Mehta, professor of political science at Ashoka University, told me. ""It's also about a lack of trust in the government and an assertive articulation of federalism.""  At the protest sites, the mood is one of unbending resistance against the government. ""People here are calling it a revolution for our rights,"" Surmeet Mavi, one of the editors of Trolley Times, a daily newsletter published from the protest site, told me. ""It's a feeling of fearlessly taking on the powerful government."" For decades, the dominant stereotype of the Indian farmer has been one of a semi-literate, struggling man, who tirelessly ploughs the land. The reality is that India's 150-odd million farmers are of different kinds - the big and small; the landed and the landless. So when it was reported that the protesters were having pizzas, there was some unkind social media chatter about whether these people really worked on the farms. It laid bare, again, how little urban Indians know about their rural brethren. What Mr Modi's government and many people have possibly failed to understand is that many of the protesting farmers have deep linkages with urbanity.  Many of them have children in the army and police, speak English, use social media and have both travelled and have relatives abroad. The protest sites are well organised with clinics, ambulances, kitchens, facilities, libraries, and even its own newspaper. Like most urban protests, there's the risk of the media-fuelled spectacle overtaking the underlying complexities of the agitation. ""This farmer movement speaks the language of middle-class India. They are saying they are patriotic, and fighting for the rights they hold dear,"" says historian Mahesh Rangarajan. This is also not a conventional protest against farm distress or drought, which most governments have been successful at managing. This agitation is ironically a consequence of Punjab's success in farming - the state is the biggest beneficiary of government-guaranteed prices of wheat and rice, and elaborate state-supported marketing structures.  These have now become a millstone around Punjab's neck - a glut of two crops has led to overflowing stocks, stagnating incomes and depleting groundwater. ""The challenge is that Punjab has been unable to transition from a largely well-to-do farming society to one where there is environmentally sustainable agriculture and industrialisation,"" says Prof Mehta.  More than 85% of India's farmers are small and marginal, and they work on some 47% of the total farming land. Both the government and farmers agree that farming needs reform. But they cannot agree on specifics. ""There are solutions. But the farmers don't trust the government,"" says Prof Mehta. And therein lies the real problem."
market volatility,North Korea gears up for 'biggest military parade',2024-09-15,2020-10-08,By Laura Bicker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54459248,"North Korea is preparing for what is expected to be the largest military parade in its history. Thousands of soldiers have practised for months to ensure that each step is marched with precision and each fervent cry of adoration will be heard by the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. These events are often ostentatious formal displays of military might to show a devoted people paying homage to their leader in closely directed goose-stepping drills. Mistakes are not tolerated. But these parades can also be part provocation. A chance to show off new missiles and weaponry despite being under strict economic sanctions. The state has not featured any ballistic missiles in its parades since Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first summit in 2018.  Talks between the two sides broke down in Hanoi last February without a deal and North Korea has continued to test a number of new short range ballistic missiles.   This event, on 10 October, to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party comes just weeks before the US presidential election. So is North Korea going to use it to make a point and prove that it still has weapons capable of striking the United States? It's certainly going to be big, according to the editor-in-chief of the Daily NK, a Seoul-based website with paid sources in the North.  Lee Sang Yong told me that as early as March, Pyongyang had ordered its military to mobilise 32,000 soldiers. It's become so large that the site where soldiers practise has had to be expanded. ""The Pyongyang Mirim airport now has two new roads and 10 new buildings. Therefore, I think it is likely that we will see Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles [ICBMs] or Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles [SLBMs] on display at the parade this time,"" he said.  ""Also, 600 students and researchers from Kim Il-sung University will also take part. This is not an insignificant number. This university is where they develop new talent for missile development. By bringing them to the parade or putting them on display, North Korea may be trying to install pride and respect for the missile development talents."" Jeongmin Kim, an analyst with NK News, said North Korea does not always use these events to prove a point to the outside world. ""We have to remember that many times - for a hereditary dictatorship especially - they constantly have to prove legitimacy to rule to their domestic audience.  ""So 10 October will also aim to do exactly that: trying to show its people, with dazzling parades with uplifting propaganda slogans, that they are 'doing okay', despite all of what has been going on this year.  ""Of course, precedents do point to the possibility of Kim Jong-un or other high-level officials making a speech that may involve some message aimed at the outside world, such as how they are not waiting around for sanctions relief any more and will focus on 'self-reliance'."" While some will be watching for any new missiles on display, there is growing concern about the welfare of the 25 million North Korean people. 2020 has been a bad year for most countries, but for North Korea it has the potential to be devastating. ""I hear there is a surge in the number of orphans and homeless street kids in the North this year,"" said Lee Sang Yong. ""Even though we cannot even imagine it here in South Korea - there are people in the North who are dying and starving."" The state closed its borders to the outside world in January to prevent an outbreak of Covid 19 spreading from neighbouring China.  Authorities have reportedly issued ""shoot-to-kill"" orders along the border and created a buffer zone to stop anyone entering the country.  Diplomatic sources told me earlier this year that stockpiles of PPE and other essential medical supplies, including vaccines, had built up at the border with China, unable to get through. North Korea claims to have had no cases of Covid-19, but Kim Jong-un continues to hold high-level meetings to ensure tight restrictions remain in place. The North Korean people are now cut off from the outside world more than ever before. Even movement between provinces has been limited. ""Land, sea, and air. It's a complete shutdown of both people and material,"" said Mr Lee.  ""Unless you are military personnel or a high-ranking officer, no one is moving inside of North Korea. Quarantine measures against Covid-19 are so tight. ""The North Korean economy has come to a halt. Smugglers and small traders at the border have questioned why the regime is risking the fate of the economy if there is no Covid-19 in the country."" Six months' training for 10 minutes on parade Trade with its key ally China has plummeted by nearly 70% in the first eight months of this year, as compared to last year.  The impoverished state has also been battered by extreme weather in recent months and Korean state television spends its afternoons showing ""heroic"" efforts to overcome the damage from several typhoons. Kim Jong-un has now ordered a nationwide drive to try to boost the ailing economy, describing it as an ""80-day battle"".   In short, that means more work for the North Korean people, extra hours in the fields or factories and additional duties in their towns and villages. The harder they struggle, the more loyal they will seem to local leaders. The message blasted across state TV is one of ""self-reliance"". In the South, farms across the country are busy harvesting rice. But it's hard to know if this is happening in the North. It's difficult to get a clear picture of how badly the state's harvests have been hit, but with 11 million people in the country thought to be food insecure, even a small number of rain-ravaged fields can amount to thousands going hungry. My team travelled to the Demilitarised Zone near Geosong on the east coast. We drive past white sandy beaches flanked by high barbed wire. Bright blue skies give us a crystal clear view of the mountains to the north. A few checkpoints are visible on the peaks From here, curious South Koreans love to peer into the North. This is as close as they can get. Pyongyang dramatically cut off all communication with Seoul in June and blew up the inter-Korean liaison office Earlier this month an incident in disputed waters to the west of the peninsula saw a South Korean man, thought to have been trying to defect, shot and killed. His body was burned.  It shocked South Koreans. And yet the North still has friends here. Some still harbour hopes of ending the 70-year war even after Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un could not reach a deal on denuclearisation. Just three years ago, North and South Koreans competed together at the Winter Olympics in Gangwon province and the local governor believes it's time to look again at these types of exchanges as a path to peace. ""The effort to reach a big deal resulted in no deal. It is time for us to go back to develop non-political initiatives and to achieve small deals in sport and cultural exchanges,"" said Choi Moon Soon. ""It is very unfortunate that we are left with the situation that even small exchanges between North and South Korea are cut off by pursuing the political big deal and revealing differences in the process."" Mr Choi would like to create a United Nations peace zone at the border.  International sanctions mean this is an unlikely dream for now. Instead Mr Choi acknowledged that North Korea is keeping a close eye on the US presidential election to figure out its next move. ""I am not sure if I will see North and South Korea unified in my life time but I have two daughters and I would like it if they didn't inherit this volatile situation. We live with continuing threat and potential of conflict. We shouldn't pass down this volatility to our next generation."" That may be out of his hands and instead fall to whoever wins the White House. Pyongyang is trying to read the situation inside and outside its country. It's not yet clear which path it's willing to take.  Will its current perilous predicament eventually encourage Kim Jong-un back to the negotiating table. Or will he look further inward and keep the borders closed. The North Korean leader has been unusually quiet this year. This parade is a chance to show his hand and his agenda and put the fate of his country back into the public eye."
market volatility,Electricity customers to be consulted on tariffs,2024-09-15,2023-02-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64722469,"Electricity customers in Guernsey have been asked about potential tariff changes, due to the ""volatility of the global energy market"". Guernsey Electricity (GE) said it was looking to increase the standing charge by 65%, and put up the price of heating homes using electricity by 13%.  It said it was also asking customers for views on changing the tariffs for people with air source heat pumps.  A two-week consultation has been launched. The company has asked customers for their views because of ""the volatility of the global energy market following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022."" One proposal set out in the consultation is an increase in the customers' standing charge, from £30 to £49.50. Another is to freeze the price people can sell electricity generated at their homes home back to the grid at 9.9p pKWH.  Chief financial officer Karl Brouard said: ""Although local customers have been relatively insulated from the types of rises seen in the UK as a result of our forward price setting strategy, we are not immune from the wider geopolitical impact."" ""We realise that this comes at a time when the cost of living for everyone is increasing, but we cannot let these changes delay the planned investment in the network and the need to maintain the security of electricity supply."" Mr Brouard added the island was ""facing increases in the cost of imported energy, together with a rise in the cost of on-island generation at the power station"". The results of the consultation will feed into the final tariff application made to the States Trading Supervisory Board (STSB), which has the responsibility to assess and approve tariffs. Last year, the STSB approved an application to allow GE to increase its tariffs to raise revenue by 9%.  The Environment and Infrastructure Committee said a new electricity strategy was to be debated before the end of March 2023, having previously said it would be in December 2022.  Committee president Lindsay de Sausmarez said work was ""progressing well"" on the strategy, with an aim to publish a policy letter on it ""by the end of March 2023"".

market volatility,Sports Direct profits more than halve,2024-09-15,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40665459,"Profits at Sports Direct have plummeted nearly 60%, which the retailer said was largely due to the weaker pound. The slide in sterling means the firm has had to pay more for its imported goods, and its underlying pre-tax profit fell to £113.7m from £275.2m. However, chief executive Mike Ashley said trading at its new ""flagship"" stores was going well.  Sports Direct's reputation has been badly hit by revelations about staff conditions at its Derbyshire warehouse.  Chairman Keith Hellawell said the company had made ""positive progress"" across the business as it continued to ""strive to ensure that all of our people are treated with dignity and respect"". A recent survey of workers in Shirebrook, to which 3,300 people responded, had showed that an ""overwhelming majority"" of people in the warehouse ""currently feel they are treated with respect"", he added. Staff had elected the company's first UK workers' representative and Mr Hellawell said he had ""no doubt"" their ""contribution will prove invaluable to the board as the Sports Direct family continues to move forward together"". Sports Direct, which has been without a chief financial officer since last October, also said it had appointed Jon Kempster to the role. Mr Kempster is set to join the company on 11 September.  Mr Ashley said Sports Direct was trying to ""conservatively manage the currency volatility that is reflected in our full year results"". Sports Direct imports many of its products from abroad and the pound's fall against the dollar had led to a ""significant fall in profits"", he added. However, he said the company had now put in place hedging arrangements to ""minimise the short-term impact of currency volatility"". The company's key strategy is to turn itself into the ""Selfridges of sport"", and Mr Hellawell said the ""elevation of our retail proposition continues to be a key objective"". Sports Direct said it was forming a ""new strategic partnership"" with sportswear firm Asics. The Japanese company will manage dedicated areas within Sports Direct's new upmarket ""premium"" stores.  Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a ""transformational"" year for Sports Direct.  Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were ""a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores"". The retailer's shares rose by 6% following the release of the results as investors appeared to welcomed the progress it was making to move upmarket.   In recent months, Sports Direct has bought 26% stake in Game Digital, increased its stake in Debenhams, acquired lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and snapped up the US sports clothing and outdoor equipment chains Bob's Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports.  The company's ""spending spree on acquisitions"" had affected profits, Mr Wilson said.  ""That's something to bear in mind when we're looking at these figures and also what that does is it puts Sports Direct in a better position to make a strategic move in, for example, the department store area or in the US with its US acquisitions."" It doesn't look good on paper. But for analysts watching the company this seems like the beginning of the end of a difficult period for Sports Direct.  Financially, it's now protected against a further drop in the pound. Better late than never.   Reputationally, the damage it suffered from its alleged Dickensian treatment of workers is being addressed with a worker on the board of the company.   It's smartening up its shops and restating its goal to be the ""Selfridges of sport"".  The monkey isn't quite off its back. Chief executive Mike Ashley is still facing a court case about a £15m pub bet, which is generating colourful headlines.  But as the chairman ends his statement by saying, Sports Direct has been a big contributor to the UK economy with thousands of jobs and billions in tax. "
market volatility,Retail sales jump on Black Friday deals,2024-09-15,2018-12-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46630865,"Retail sales jumped more than expected in November, helped by Black Friday promotions and stronger growth in sales of household goods. Official figures showed sales rose 1.4% from October, despite economists' forecasts of about a 0.3% gain. But for the three months to November, which smoothes out monthly volatility, sales growth was 0.4% on the previous quarter, the slowest rate since April. Several retailers have warned of tough trading this winter. Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley said November was ""unbelievably bad"", while Superdry and online retailer Asos have also warned of dismal trading. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the changing nature of Black Friday sales promotions posed a challenge for the process of adjusting for seasonal variations. Household goods sales leapt by 5.3% on the month in November, the biggest increase since the end of 2013 and driven by an 11% increase in electrical appliances. Online sales as a proportion of all retailing exceeded 20% for the first time, the ONS said. Surveys from the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard have suggested that households were continuing to shop cautiously in November. However, recently consumers have seen the fastest growth in underlying pay growth since 2008, with inflation falling to a 20-month low of 2.3%, according to ONS figures released earlier this week. Thomas Pugh, UK Economist at Capital Economics, said the stronger spending could point to a weaker December, but that the longer term trend was more positive. He said: ""With inflation continuing to fall back... and pay growth on the up, there should be scope for consumer spending growth to gather some momentum further ahead. [The] big picture is that a continued acceleration in real earnings, assuming a Brexit deal is signed, should give household spending a boost next year."" Philipp Gutzwiller, head of retail at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said November data showed that ""online is now truly coming of age"".  He added: ""More than perhaps any month before, the fact that overall sales rose in November was thanks to the relative success of Black Friday online compared with on the High Street."" The most recent high street and shopping centre footfall data for November, compiled by Springboard, showed the worst decline since the recession. It turns out Christmas came early - but may not have been quite the bumper gift that some retailers were anticipating. Black Friday is increasingly a fixture in the festive shopping calendar, shifting Christmas spending from December to November.  The ONS, which produces the retail figures, smooth them out to allow for seasonal patterns, but their adjustment process may not have yet caught up with what is still quite a new phenomenon.  So, the ""adjusted"" increase in the amount of goods sold between October and November may appear stronger than it should. And it's clear that shifting more goods in November came at a heavy price for retailers such as Asos, which had to discount heavily to keep up with competitors, damaging profits.  Beyond the November headline, the underlying trend in spending is slowing - growing by 0.4% over the last four months. That's the weakest rate since April, and doesn't bode well for retailers or the economy as a whole.  And if Christmas shopping is happening earlier, December could disappoint. Indeed, a survey from CBI points to weakest growth in sales this month for over a year."
market volatility,Cutting energy prices will take years - power boss,2024-09-15,2022-12-04,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63834755,"It ""will take years"" to get energy prices back to pre-Ukraine war levels, the boss of one of the world's biggest energy firms has told the BBC. Enel's Francesco Starace said bringing prices down depends on new sources of energy such as renewables and heat pumps. Governments across Europe are spending billions helping business and households afford energy bills. They are also scrambling to secure new supplies.  Mr Starace said the company, which produces and distributes electricity and gas, tried to shield its 20 million European customers from energy market volatility this year. It did its best to stick to the fixed-price contracts it had agreed, he said. Breaking customer trust would inflict greater damage on the firm than a hit on one year's results, he said. The Italian energy giant sells power to more than 70 million homes and businesses in over 30 countries. But Enel is planning to leave many of those countries as it focuses on renewable energy and becoming carbon neutral by 2040. It also wants to cut its huge debts of around $63bn (£52bn). It is investing heavily in making solar panels as it expands an existing factory in Sicily and builds a new one in the US.  Soaring energy prices have been the biggest contributor to inflation and the cost of living crisis in the UK, the US and the Eurozone. The global energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""showed very clearly how dependence on one single source of energy is dangerous for Europe"", Mr Starace said. The future will be ""extremely decarbonised"" and depend on nuclear and renewable energy, he said. However, that shift to renewables also has risks. In July, the International Energy Agency warned that China's dominance of the solar industry creates ""potential challenges that governments need to address"".  Mr Starace said the West has been over-reliant on China for renewables and other goods. ""Some rebalancing needs to be happening because it is unhealthy,"" he said, when asked about geopolitical tensions interfering with energy supplies.  This has helped drive Enel's investment in solar panels, although the expansion of the Sicilian factory will still meet only 10% of Europe's needs, he said. Political leaders have also acknowledged that Europe needs to get its energy from more places. According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, the EU and its member states have signed 56 energy deals with 23 countries this year. Among the latest was a 15-year deal for Germany to get liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar through a contract with ConocoPhillips. Norway is also boosting natural gas production and the world's biggest producer, the US, has been pumping out record amounts. This means the chances of Europe repeating its dependence on Russia with another country are ""quite low"", according to Megan Richards, a former director of energy policy at the European Commission. ""A lot of work has been done"" to replace Russian energy, she added, before warning: ""I think Europe will not be completely domestically independent for a very, very long time, if ever"" even though ""renewables will increase dramatically"".

market volatility,Mortgage deals withdrawn in record numbers,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63061534,"Lenders withdrew a record number of mortgage products overnight, according to analysts, as they grappled with the prospect of rising interest rates. Moneyfacts, a financial information service, said that 935 mortgage products, around a quarter of the total, were taken off the shelf. Interest rates are expected to rise sharply following the government's tax-cutting mini-budget on Friday. Economists are predicting that could lead to a 10-15% drop in house prices. The cost of government borrowing has risen sharply since Friday and the Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates at its next meeting in November. That in turn will raise the cost of borrowing for banks and building societies offering mortgages. As a result lenders are withdrawing mortgage deals in order to re-price them. Moneyfacts said the fall in mortgage products on offer was the biggest daily drop it has ever recorded. It was double the previous biggest drop, which occurred at the height of the Covid pandemic. A total of 2,661 mortgage products are still available - but that is half the number that were on sale at the start of December last year when interest rates started to rise.  Brokers are reassuring those who already have a mortgage, or an agreement for a new mortgage, that they will be unaffected for the time being. However, when they come to remortgage, they are likely to find monthly repayments have become a lot more expensive. When Usman Ahmad, his wife and two children moved into their house four years ago they thought it would be their ""forever home"". But he is worried that higher interest rates may mean they can no longer afford to stay there. When the family bought their house in Manchester in 2018, they fixed the mortgage at 2.05% for five years with monthly payments of £927, Mr Ahmad said.  Usman, a 33-year-old self-employed courier, said if he took out a fixed rate mortgage today he would be facing monthly payments of more than £1,250 a month. ""I'm thinking if that's now, what are the rates going to be like in nine months' time when I have to take out a new deal?"" On top of rising energy and food prices, the higher borrowing cost could be the last straw, he said.  ""I'm worried about defaulting on the mortgage and losing the house,"" Usman said.   Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said: ""Borrowers would be wise to keep calm over the current volatility in the mortgage market and seek the advice from a independent broker. Various lenders have been very vocal that their decision to withdraw products is a temporary measure, amid the uncertainty over interest rates.  ""Those looking to remortgage may find they have more equity in their home amid rising house prices, but first-time buyers may be struggling to find a property they can afford."" However, mortgage brokers are reporting a high number of calls from buyers hoping to lock in deals as soon as possible. They are warning that if the rates on offer climb too high buyers could pull out. Ray Boulger, at mortgage adviser John Charcol, told the BBC that rising rates would have a big impact on the ability of people to buy, and would deter some people from buying at all. ""A key factor in house prices is how much people could afford on their monthly mortgage,"" he said.  Investment bank Credit Suisse has published analysis predicting that ""house prices could easily fall 10%- 15%"". The house price ""correction"" would be gradual, over the next 18 months approximately, Credit Suisse added, as most people have fixed-rate mortgages that don't need to be renewed immediately. Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at Capital Economics, also predicted a sharp fall in house prices of up to 15%. ""The rise in market interest rates that has already happened will push up mortgage rates to at least 6% and reduce the size of loans that lenders can offer,"" he wrote. ""The resulting drop in buying power makes a significant drop in house prices inevitable."" What have been your experiences of trying to secure a mortgage since the summer?

market volatility,Protests erupt in El Salvador as Bitcoin crashes,2024-09-15,2021-09-08,By Katie Silver,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58459098,"Angry protests, technological glitches and a plummet in value marked the first day of El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. The price of Bitcoin on Tuesday crashed to its lowest in nearly a month, falling from $52,000 (£37,730) to under $43,000 at one point.  An opposition politician said the fall caused one of Latin America's poorest countries to lose $3m.  The rollout of bitcoin in El Salvador was far from what President Nayib Bukele would have envisaged when he began his bold experiment.   Platforms such as Apple and Huawei weren't offering the government-backed digital wallet, known as Chivo, and servers had to be pulled offline after they couldn't keep up with user registrations.  But, as the day went on, Chivo began appearing on more platforms and was accepted by the likes of Starbucks and McDonald's.   The government has even given Salvadorans $30 each of Bitcoin to encourage its adoption.  It says bitcoin could save the country $400m a year in transaction fees on funds sent from abroad.  However, using data from the World Bank and the government, the BBC calculates this to be closer to $170m. ""We must break the paradigms of the past,"" President Bukele tweeted. ""El Salvador has the right to advance towards the first world."" Ed Hernandez runs a family shop in San Salvador where customers buy essentials like rice, beans and cleaning products.  He's well and truly on board.  ""During the pandemic, it will be nice not to use physical cash,"" he told the BBC, adding that it protects him from customers paying with counterfeit notes.  What wasn't good timing for El Salvador though was the tumble Bitcoin took on its first day as legal tender, falling 20% at one point.  ""It was a very bad day for President Bukele, his government and his Bitcoin experiment,"" opposition politician Johnny Wright Sol told the BBC.  ""The majority of the population knows very little about cryptocurrencies. What we do know is it's a very volatile market. Today that was surely made manifest.""  Mr Wright Sol said Bitcoin was not an apt national currency and was rushed through: ""The Bitcoin law was approved in parliament with hardly any debate. It took only about five hours to go through.  ""We're not cryptocurrency or Bitcoin haters, but we don't believe that it should be compulsory that businesses should be obligated to accept Bitcoin in payment.  ""The state is backing these payments and assuming the risk but at the end of the day us taxpayers are all the state."" Mr Wright Sol isn't the only critic.  More than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the country's supreme court, where fireworks were set off and tyres were burnt.  Beyond financial instability, some say the adoption of Bitcoin may fuel illicit transactions. But Mr Hernandez, the shopkeeper, is not put off by the volatility:  ""I see it as a risk yes - but like everything in life, there's a risk. When we own a shop, sometimes we buy a product and we don't sell it. ""When others see a crisis though, I see an opportunity."" "
market volatility,The impact of trade tariffs on two US firms,2024-09-15,2018-07-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45011587,"New trade tariffs are raising costs for US businesses, testing their power to pass on the expenses to consumers.  US equipment maker Caterpillar on Monday said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. But while higher prices are shielding some firms, others are under strain. On the same day, food processor Tyson Foods cut its profit forecast, saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.70-$6 for its 2018 financial year due to a surplus in US supply caused by the tariffs. That was down from its earlier $6.55-$6.70 forecast. Lower prices for beef and pork have also reduced demand for chicken, the firm added. ""The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,"" said Tom Hayes, Tyson Foods president and chief executive officer.  The updates were the latest from businesses explaining how trade disputes are raising costs and shifting demand for products that range from cars to beer. In March, the US announced tariffs on steel and aluminium, prompting China, the European Union, Mexico and other places to retaliate with import taxes on US products such as pork, wine and whiskey. Separately, the US and China have also imposed tit-for-tat tariffs of $34bn on the other country's goods, in a row over intellectual property practices and state subsidies. While some firms, including Caterpillar, have said they will pass on higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, others are more constrained. BMW, for example, has said it would raise prices in China by 4%-7% on two SUV models, which are US-made. But the rise will not completely absorb the cost of China's new taxes on US vehicles, the firm warned. Harley Davidson told investors it plans to shoulder the cost of European tariffs on US-made motorcycles in order to remain competitive. It is also grappling with higher steel and aluminium prices. Overall, analysts expect the duties to have a relatively modest impact. Analysts at US bank Wells Fargo estimate that the US tariffs so far will boost inflation in the US by 0.1%, but said that the rise could be softened by price declines for products targeted by other countries for retaliation. The changes come as higher fuel and labour costs fuel stronger inflation in the US. The index for producer prices climbed 3.4% over the 12 months to July, the strongest annual gain since November 2011, according to figures from the US Labor Department. The consumer price index increased 2.9% over the 12 months to June. With wage growth still relatively slow, economists say it's not clear how many increases households can handle before they reduce spending."
market volatility,Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions,2024-09-15,2021-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58650634,"A surge in gas prices has hit consumers and energy firms in the UK, with knock-on effects for the food industry and supplies of carbon dioxide. Elsewhere in Europe, consumers are also facing a steep rise in energy bills, and governments are scrambling to help. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty for Europeans in funding the move to renewable energy. Here, five correspondents explain how different countries are responding. Consumers' bills have spiralled here in recent months, with the cost of electricity increasing 35% over the last year and nearly 8% in August alone. Energy prices in Spain are closely tied to the wholesale gas market, so the price per megawatt hour for consumers has repeatedly hit new highs recently.  ""I was paying about €40 (£34) per month and now I'm paying around €60,"" said Amparo Vega, who has a newspaper kiosk in central Madrid.     Earlier this month, the coalition government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez unveiled a series of measures aimed at bringing bills back down.  They include tax cuts and a temporary reduction in extraordinary profits made by energy companies. The latter move has drawn criticism from the industry, although the government has clarified that renewable energy providers will be exempt.   The government says its aim is to reduce electricity bills by over 20% by the end of the year. As winter approaches, consumers such as Ms Vega hope that happens. ""The outlook isn't very rosy,"" says Michele Fiorita, taking some air outside his shop in central Rome. ""My energy bills have gone up by about 15% but I've heard they'll rise by around 40% in the next few months."" Italy is particularly exposed to gas price hikes: 40% of its energy comes from natural gas and around half of that is imported from Russia.  So lower Russian gas exports to Europe and an increase in the price of raw materials have hit hard.  The Italian government has already spent some €1.2bn to cut the increase in energy prices for households and this week pledged another €3bn to help further in the coming months.  Prime Minister Mario Draghi says for the next three months ""system costs"" will be eliminated from gas and electricity bills. They're the tariffs added to bills to help fund the transition to renewable energy. It's a short-term sticking plaster to help reduce the jump in energy prices for struggling households but removes an important financial incentive to help the switch to renewables.  Fundamentally, Italy will need to diversify its energy sources, moving away from its dependence on gas and more towards green energy. ""That's surely the future,"" says Michele, ""it's the only way to reduce costs in the long-term."" As soaring energy costs present huge personal difficulties for families, they also pose some tricky politics for Brussels.  EU leaders have been busy pushing their sweeping climate plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 - a drive known as ""Fit for 55"". It's wide-ranging but includes proposals that, critics say, could lead to huge further price hikes.   Even backers of the measures quietly admit the transition to a greener economy inevitably, one way or another, hits people in the pocket. On the current crisis, the European Commission says that price rises are a combination of several factors, particularly the global surge in demand.  Increases in the price of CO2 permits under the EU's carbon pricing scheme are blamed for some of the rises, but the Commission says it's only a ""small percentage"". It wants to expand that scheme under ""Fit for 55"".  But with calls from the Spanish government for the energy crisis to be on the table at the next EU leaders' summit, Brussels is facing questions over what it can or will do to help.  Guidance is being worked on in terms of the mitigation measures member states can individually take within EU rules. But there's no sign of any significant, centralised intervention.  The more the crisis heats up, the greater the backlash may be over the EU's climate plans. However, those in favour would argue that the faster the move to a green economy, the faster member states can escape this kind of volatility.   Surging European gas prices have been felt by Polish consumers because the country's energy regulator has approved three price hikes this year, raising bills by more than 20%. But household gas bills are still regulated here, so customers are insulated from any sharp changes in market prices. Also, about half of Poland's gas demand is met by domestic production, which is typically cheaper than imported gas.  That cheaper, domestic gas is used to cover the needs of households first, while industry is mostly supplied with more expensive imports. But here again, energy-intensive Polish companies are shielded from sky-rocketing market prices because they have long-term supply contracts with a fixed price.  In Poland, coal is still the main fuel driving the economy, with gas a long way behind. That is starting to change.  The solar power market is one of the fastest growing in Europe and state-controlled power companies are planning huge investments in offshore wind.  Gas will become more important then, because the government sees natural gas as a bridging fuel to replace ageing coal plants and ensure the lights remain on when the wind drops under cloudy skies.  In Poland, the origin of the gas is a political issue. The government plans to cease its decades-old dependence on Russian gas next year and replace it with US and Norwegian gas, arguing it will no longer suffer Gazprom overcharging it for gas, because it can abuse its position as a monopoly supplier. POLAND'S COAL: The vast European mine infuriating the neighbours Non-EU Norway is one of the biggest producers of oil and natural gas in Europe, though very little of it is used for its own needs. Only 1.4% of electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels and waste, 5.8% by wind power and the remaining 92.9% is produced by hydroelectric power.  Norway's Equinor energy company has agreed to allow a 2bn-cubic-metre increase in gas exports for the next year to support increased European and UK demand. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor is two-thirds owned by the state.  While bills are not as high as elsewhere in Europe, Norwegians are not immune from increasing energy prices. ""We currently pay 750 NOK (£63) a month for energy and warm water, but in Oslo prices are relatively low,"" says Magnus, 26, who lives in a studio apartment in the capital with his girlfriend. The couple are moving to a bigger flat in Bergen on the west coast and expect their bills to go up: ""When you live somewhere where fewer people are, then electricity is more expensive. That's why I'm thinking of just getting solar panels."" From 1 October, Norway will be able to export electricity to the UK via a ""North Sea link"" of underwater high-voltage electric cables connecting the two power grids. There have been concerns the recent UK price surge could spread to Norwegian households and industries. But one proposal to impose a tax on outgoing energy has been rejected, as Norway also needs to import energy in certain periods of the year."
market volatility,US suggests Russia could be behind gas pipe leaks,2024-09-15,2022-09-29,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63084613,"The US has said it ""seems"" Russia is to blame for this week's leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told the BBC an investigation was being carried out into the cause of what she called ""an act of sabotage"", adding ""it is highly unlikely that these incidents are coincidence"" No evidence about how the leaks happened has been made public. Russia has dismissed suggestions that it was to blame. It said claims it had damaged the pipelines were ""stupid and absurd"". President Putin described the damage as ""unprecedented sabotage, in fact, an act of international terrorism"" during a phone call with Turkey's President Erdogan, according to the Kremlin, which added Russia plans to bring it up for ""urgent discussion"" at the UN Security Council. Earlier Russia's Foreign Ministry suggest it was the US that stood to benefit from the pipeline being out of action because it would be able to increase its own natural gas sales. The White House has dismissed such suggestions. ""It's probably most likely some form of sabotage,"" according to Mike Fulwood of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. ""If there was one incident of a pipeline rupture of leak then accidental damage could be a possibility, it is very rare. ""The most likely cause of accidental damage is an anchor being dropped and dragging across the pipeline"". He added that with multiple leaks in a short period of time ""doesn't sound like it could be accidental, although theoretically it could be"". The high water pressure at the bottom of sea makes a detonation difficult, according to energy engineering expert Professor Russell Johns of Penn State University.  He says ""it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance"" if they wanted to stop supplies. The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine.  The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs.  Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history. ""I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner,"" she said. ""No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy"". The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth. The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna. ""Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."" Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets. However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share ""in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels"". When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that ""this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan"" and that such a move ""helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security"". This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders. Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps ""so that citizens are not hurting"". Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, ""at least the American companies as good American citizens"" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK. ""We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest. ""We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."" One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump. The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election.  An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: ""I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that.""

market volatility,JP Morgan sues Tesla for $162m after Musk tweets,2024-09-15,2021-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59306199," JP Morgan Chase is suing Tesla for $162m (£121m) over tweets in 2018 by boss Elon Musk that he could take the electric car maker private. The bank accused Tesla of ""flagrantly"" breaching a deal it claims should have triggered payments to JP Morgan. Mr Musk's notorious tweets that he had funding to take Tesla off the New York stock market sparked volatility in the share price. He later abandoned the move and was fined by the US financial regulator. JP Morgan's suit, filed in a Manhattan federal court, says the companies had an agreement signed in 2014 that allowed the bank to buy Tesla shares at a set price and date. Under the deal, Tesla sold so-called warrants to JP Morgan allowing the bank to purchase shares if the ""strike"" price was below Tesla's share price when the warrants expired in June and July 2021. ""We have provided Tesla multiple opportunities to fulfil its contractual obligations, so it is unfortunate that they have forced this issue into litigation,"" a spokesperson for JP Morgan said in a statement. JP Morgan said the warrants contained standard provisions that allowed it to adjust their price to protect both parties against the economic effects of ""significant corporate transactions involving Tesla,"" such as an announcement the company was going private. Mr Musk's tweeted on 7 August 2018 tweet that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share and had ""funding secured"". He scrapped the plan 17 days later. Tesla's share price rose approximately 10-fold by the time the warrants expired this year, and JP Morgan said this required Tesla under its contract to hand over shares of its stock or cash.  Failure to do so, said JP Morgan, amounted to a default. Tesla has yet to comment publicly on the bank's lawsuit. But the company said in 2019 when news of the dispute emerged that JP Morgan was being ""opportunistic"" to take advantage of the share price volatility. Mr Musk is an enthusiastic and frequently controversial user of twitter, and now has 64 million followers.  Only this month the billionaire caused a stir when he asked his followers in a twitter poll whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares. The vote was 'yes'. His 2018 tweets on taking Tesla off the stock market led to charges from the powerful US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, for misleading the market. Mr Musk vehemently denied the charges, but eventually agreed a settlement that led to him stepping down as chairman of the carmaker. He and Tesla paid $40m in penalties."
market volatility,Dairy farmers told to cut milk supplies,2024-09-15,2020-04-09,By Kevin Keane,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52233147,"The dairy manufacturer Muller has ordered farmers across Scotland who supply them with milk to cut production because of an oversupply.  It has written to more than 250 dairy farmers asking them to reduce output because of changing consumer habits caused by the coronavirus crisis. It has been estimated more than a million litres of unwanted milk is being produced across the UK each day. This means some dairy product is having to be poured down the drain. Even though demand from supermarkets has increased, that has not filled the gap left by the closure of cafes and restaurants. Dairy farmer Ian Burgoyne from Crocketford, near Dumfries, said: ""To have to do this after months and years of planning, large amounts of investment, it is a heartbreaking situation."" Muller has asked all dairy farmers to reduce their output by 3%. It has suggested various ways this could happen such as feeding whole milk back to calves or retiring some cows from the herd early. But there is also concern about the capacity to return to full production when lockdown conditions ease. A spokesman for Muller said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted the market for milk. We are asking farmers to temporarily reduce milk production by 3%. ""While supplying farmers will continue to receive their full contracted price, we hope that this collaborative approach will prevent the need for further and more serious measures."" Graham's Dairy has not restricted farm output but has admitted some milk has had to be thrown away. Owner Robert Graham said: ""We're working hard to find alternative uses and alternative capacity across UK for our product and we've been able to do that to some degree. ""Nobody wants to see waste but it's the volatility. It's the changes in customer behaviour and so much of the food service sector currently being closed."" Robert Hunter, from the Scottish Dairy Cattle Association, says margins are so tight for milk producers there is no wriggle room. He added: ""A lot of dairy farmers won't be able to ride this storm out. Because things have been so tight for so many years we have tightened everything down that we possibly can."" Dairy farmers have long complained that supermarkets undervalue milk and sell it too cheap.  The milk mountain is now pushing the price down further with some analysts saying those without a contract to supply it are finding that their milk is worthless."
market volatility,Fake Walmart news story boosts crypto price,2024-09-15,2021-09-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58545944,"Cryptocurrency Litecoin saw a sudden surge in price on Monday over a press release about Walmart accepting it for payment - which turned out to be fake.  The release, published through a legitimate press channel, claimed that Walmart would accept the currency through all its digital stores.  Walmart later told US media outlets the announcement was ""inauthentic"". By that time, several major news websites and press agencies had spread the supposed news.  The announcement made it on to Globe Newswire, a service widely used to distribute press material from companies.  The faked release has since been deleted, and did not appear on Walmart's own website. A tweet from a verified Litecoin Twitter account linking to the release has also been deleted. Hours later, the Litecoin Foundation tweeted that it had no such partnership. But while it was being reported as fact, the price of Litecoin jumped from about £125 per token to close to £170, before falling back near its original price, at about £128.  Globe Newswire said ""a fraudulent user account was used to issue an illegitimate press release"". ""This has never happened before,"" the company said in a statement - adding that it was bringing in ""enhanced authentication"" to stop it happening again. It did not detail exactly what went wrong or who was behind the fake release.  But so called ""pump and dump"" schemes are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency world - where bad actors attempt to raise hype around a coin, inflating its price, and quickly sell off their own stock before the market corrects itself. The false press release suggested that Litecoin would be accepted on all Walmart ecommerce platforms from 1 October.  It contained quotes that appeared to come from both the Walmart chief executive and the founder of Litecoin.  One clue to its nature was that a press contact email address pointed to a web domain which had been registered only last month. Emails to that address bounced as undeliverable. The fabrication was unmasked when CNBC reached representatives of Walmart by phone and were told the press release was fake. CNBC said it had been among the news organisations to publish the story before discovering it was not true.  Walmart, the Litecoin Foundation, and Global Newswire have been contacted for comment. The announcement raised eyebrows among some sceptical observers because of the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, which can be an obstacle in using them for retail purchases.  Other companies which have accepted Bitcoin have drawn up terms to limit their exposure to large price swings.  For example, when Tesla briefly accepted Bitcoin as a payment option for its cars, it made clear that the price was in US dollars - and that any quote in equivalent Bitcoin was only valid for a limited time window.  It also said that if a refund was needed, Tesla would have the choice of whether to pay it back in US dollars or Bitcoin, which may work out as a lower cash value than what was paid.  Similarly, PayPal recently introduced the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin - but it cannot be used to make payment purchases. Instead, the cryptocurrency assets will be sold for the right amount of real money to make the purchase. "
market volatility,"Carney: 150,000 firms 'not ready for no-deal'",2024-09-15,2019-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48710999,"About 150,000 businesses still do not have the paperwork they need to keep exporting to the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mark Carney has said.  The Bank of England governor added that many had built up contingency stocks, but these would only last ""weeks"". ""Business will be reliant on what the governments are able to do in order to keep the ports open, the trade flowing,"" he told the Today programme. But he said the financial system was prepared for a no-deal scenario.    The UK is due to leave the EU by 31 October after seeking an extension to leave the bloc back in March.  Boris Johnson, considered the favourite in the race to become the next prime minister, has said the UK must leave in October, even if it has not struck a deal.  His rival, Jeremy Hunt, has said the UK may need more time, although he would accept no-deal as a last resort.  Ahead of his Mansion House speech to the City on Thursday, Mr Carney said about three quarters of UK businesses have done as much as they could do to prepare for a no-deal.  ""But it doesn't mean they are fully ready, in fact far from it,"" he told the BBC.  He also stressed that in the event of a no-deal exit, the return of trade tariffs on goods shipped to the EU would be ""automatic"".  This contradicts a claim from Mr Johnson that the UK could secure a 10-year standstill in current arrangements using an article of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade known as ""Gatt 24"".  ""The Gatt rules are clear... Gatt 24 applies if you have a [withdrawal] agreement, not if you've decided not to have an agreement, or you have been unable to come to an agreement,"" Mr Carney said.   ""So... we should be clear that not having an agreement with the European Union would mean that there are tariffs, automatically, because the Europeans have to apply the same rules to us as they apply to everyone else.""  Mr Carney also said he was cautiously open to Facebook's new digital currency, Libra, which is due to launch in the first half of next year.  But he said the Bank would be setting ""ground rules upfront"" to protect consumers and their data, and that Libra ""had to be safe or it is not going to happen"". ""Welcome to the world of finance: there is oversight, there is consumer protection, there is market integrity, people have certain rights to privacy that have to be respected.  ""And we're not going to allow a network that comes into place that is a network for criminals and terrorists."" Facebook unveiled details about Libra this week, claiming the virtual currency would be as easy to use as texting. It said Libra would be independently managed, backed by real assets and pegged to a basket of well-known currencies.  But there have been concerns about how people's data and cash will be protected, as well as the currency's potential volatility.  Mr Carney said: ""All the major global central banks and supervisors would have direct regulatory control of this if it is going to work, which is an open question, and we have an open mind about it."""
market volatility,Oil on stormy market waters,2024-09-15,2020-05-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52718928,"Tuesday 19 May: pencilled in to my diary as a day to watch for oil market chaos. I'll have to focus on the new job figures instead, because the oil market is on the up. The warning of chaos came a month ago, when the US benchmark price went negative. Global supply was vastly outstripping demand. Storage tanks at Cushing, Oklahoma - the hub for storing the region's oil - were either filling up, or booked up. And in a quirk of America's oil market, the monthly closure of delivery contracts arrived with a lot of traders unable to store the black stuff. So they had to pay to offload it. With even more supply and even less storage by mid-May, things were set fair for more of the same mayhem. But things have changed. The price of West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude has risen from below $20, when the mayhem subsided a month ago, to nearly $33 per barrel, surging 12% for good measure on Monday. Brent crude, the North Sea cocktail that serves as a benchmark for the rest of the world, was also up by nearly 8%, trading around $35. The last time they were close to these levels was mid-March, on a rapid descent because Opec had failed to agree with Russia on cutting production, and both Europe and North America were heading towards lockdown. What things have changed? There's more demand than there was. China and its neighbours have fired up their economies to some extent. Europe and North America are beginning to do so. Monday's stock markets were also buoyed by a more positive vibe from eased lockdown and a supportive US Fed. Supply has been cut. The eventual agreement between the Opec oil exporter cartel and non-member Russia was not enough last month, but Saudis added a further tranche of production cuts. There's still an imbalance, and the price is still lower than producers want or need it to be. But it looks stabilised for now. One of the most significant parts of the supply cut was in the US. America doesn't have an autocrat's power to turn the taps. A historic quirk of the Texas oil industry is that it's regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission. It met early this month, and opted not to impose any restraints. That's because the price was restraining enough. Fracking is a boom and bust technology. In March, production was very strong. The USA had become the world's biggest oil producer. But by the middle of this month, it had lost two-thirds of the temporary drilling rigs used to frack for oil and gas, and counted weekly by industry data specialist Baker Hughes. That is going to hurt those who invested in the US boom, but it's good news for other producers who needed prices to rise.  Effectively, it means the US has become the swing producer. Instead of the Saudi-led Opec cartel controlling the taps and therefore the price, the price has become the mechanism for Texan and Dakotan drillers to match demand with supply. There is one other element worth noting about the decreased volatility from last month. Industry analysts explain much of the plunge into negative prices by reference to speculative flows of investment funds. There are moves afoot to limit the ability of investors to move US markets that way - though they were also afoot 12 years ago, when speculators drove the price up to a $145 spike. That matters because volatility directly affects investment decisions by oil companies, and that feeds through to jobs. A lot of jobs. President Trump is aware of that in an election year. He performed an impressive contortion last week, with a Tweet that welcomed both rising crude prices - meaning jobs, and low fuel costs, which has felt like a tax cut. It also matters because speculators can disrupt markets for other commodities that are important to the world economy. That could include food, which saw a period of global market volatility during the financial crisis in 2008, and left a lot of people hungry. One commodity that is always there at times of crisis, as a safe haven in an investment storm, is gold. It doesn't earn you anything, but it's rare and it doesn't corrode. It's been on the rise in recent weeks, now trading at its highest levels since 2012, above $1.750 per ounce."
market volatility,Is the shopping centre ready to check out?,2024-09-15,2018-11-30,By Bill Wilson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46383807,"In the 1960s shopping centres offered a vision of the future - large shiny complexes which looked to bring the ease and glamour of US suburban malls to UK town and city centres. From the 1970s to the 1990s they were followed by out-of-town shopping centres, often built on land which had recently housed Britain's vanishing heavy industries. In the past decade there has been a 21st Century renaissance in the original concept of the city centre arcades, whether it be the new Westfield Centres in Shepherd's Bush and Stratford in London, or the rebirth of the once-derided Bull Ring in Birmingham. At the same time the growth of online shopping, and other societal changes, have left a fractured landscape, and an industry looking at an uncertain future. The latest illustration of this has been the cancellation of a £2.8bn deal to purchase shopping centre giant Intu Properties - owner of the Trafford and Arndale centres in Manchester, Metrocentre in Gateshead, and Lakeside in Essex. The potential buyers, a consortium led by Peel Group, blamed ""uncertainty around current macroeconomic conditions and the potential near-term volatility across markets"". In November, a report from analyst Nelson Blackley warned that more than 200 UK shopping centres were in danger of falling into administration. According to Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics, shopping centres which have an exciting future will be those that plug into the desires of consumers to be more than mere ""shoppers"". He says there should also be a future for those outlets which offer a more nuts-and-bolts service, but are in good locations. ""In my view we are seeing, in terms of physical properties, the polarisation in the shopping market, between those retail centres which are thriving because they are flagship destinations, and the rest,"" says Mr Lim. ""These flagship shopping centres - the likes of Westfield, Leeds Trinity, Birmingham's Bullring - are the ones that are tapping into consumers' desire for experiences;  offering bars, restaurants, cinemas, bowling alleys, opportunities to try things like cooking, and so on. ""Looking at these centres, the retail experience is important but it is not necessarily the sole driver of footfall."" He adds: ""It is by having a blended proposition, that includes other activities, that will allow a centre to thrive.   ""Experiences are more important than ever before - Western households have an abundance of material possessions and want something more."" As well as these landmark ""experience"" destinations, Mr Lim says that there is a strata of secondary and tertiary shopping centres that are doing well. ""These are the sites close to where people live, work, or have transport hubs nearby.  These outlets will have seen their retail pull diminish over the past 10 years. But their locations enable them to have a sustainable level of footfall to survive. ""But those shopping centres which do not have one of the benefits of these location factors are the most susceptible to the growing lure of online."" Mr Lim says not only is consumer behaviour changing - but that it is changing very quickly.  It is being brought about not only by online the growth of the experience economy, but also by the development of smartphones making it easier to make purchases on the go. ""At the same time there has been a diminishing of the value attached to possessions.  Millennials are one of the groups driving this retail change, what they want are experiences they can share with their friends on social media, something very different to what older people want,"" he adds. After the Intu deal fell through, shares in it and in rival chain Hammerson fell sharply.  Intu, while saying it would continue to invest in the long term of its shopping centres, pointed to what it said was was a ""challenging market."" ""There is the uncertainty of Brexit, which is likely to inform a lot of shopping centre decisions in the near future,"" says Mr Lim. ""But there also has to be an acknowledgement that the bigger picture for shopping centres is one of fast-changing consumer behaviour."" Graham Parker is editor of industry magazine Retail Destination (formerly Shopping Centres). ""The story is that shoppers are migrating to the top of the range shopping centres, such as the Trafford Centre or Bluewater in Kent,"" he says. He says that footfall across shopping centres generally is down 2.5% to 3%, but only by 1% at the prime locations.  ""Physical retail is suffering not only from online shopping, but increasing business rate bills, the national minimum wage and Brexit hitting the pound and making imports more expensive,"" he adds. ""This may have to get worse before they get better. That is why this Christmas is going to be absolutely crucial for shopping centres and the brands and chains that have outlets in them."""
market volatility,Cutting energy prices will take years - power boss,2024-09-15,2022-12-04,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63834755,"It ""will take years"" to get energy prices back to pre-Ukraine war levels, the boss of one of the world's biggest energy firms has told the BBC. Enel's Francesco Starace said bringing prices down depends on new sources of energy such as renewables and heat pumps. Governments across Europe are spending billions helping business and households afford energy bills. They are also scrambling to secure new supplies.  Mr Starace said the company, which produces and distributes electricity and gas, tried to shield its 20 million European customers from energy market volatility this year. It did its best to stick to the fixed-price contracts it had agreed, he said. Breaking customer trust would inflict greater damage on the firm than a hit on one year's results, he said. The Italian energy giant sells power to more than 70 million homes and businesses in over 30 countries. But Enel is planning to leave many of those countries as it focuses on renewable energy and becoming carbon neutral by 2040. It also wants to cut its huge debts of around $63bn (£52bn). It is investing heavily in making solar panels as it expands an existing factory in Sicily and builds a new one in the US.  Soaring energy prices have been the biggest contributor to inflation and the cost of living crisis in the UK, the US and the Eurozone. The global energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""showed very clearly how dependence on one single source of energy is dangerous for Europe"", Mr Starace said. The future will be ""extremely decarbonised"" and depend on nuclear and renewable energy, he said. However, that shift to renewables also has risks. In July, the International Energy Agency warned that China's dominance of the solar industry creates ""potential challenges that governments need to address"".  Mr Starace said the West has been over-reliant on China for renewables and other goods. ""Some rebalancing needs to be happening because it is unhealthy,"" he said, when asked about geopolitical tensions interfering with energy supplies.  This has helped drive Enel's investment in solar panels, although the expansion of the Sicilian factory will still meet only 10% of Europe's needs, he said. Political leaders have also acknowledged that Europe needs to get its energy from more places. According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, the EU and its member states have signed 56 energy deals with 23 countries this year. Among the latest was a 15-year deal for Germany to get liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar through a contract with ConocoPhillips. Norway is also boosting natural gas production and the world's biggest producer, the US, has been pumping out record amounts. This means the chances of Europe repeating its dependence on Russia with another country are ""quite low"", according to Megan Richards, a former director of energy policy at the European Commission. ""A lot of work has been done"" to replace Russian energy, she added, before warning: ""I think Europe will not be completely domestically independent for a very, very long time, if ever"" even though ""renewables will increase dramatically"".

market volatility,Alderney set to raise electricity price cap,2024-09-15,2022-12-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64053213,"Electricity prices in Alderney could go up in 2023, depending on market volatility for diesel which the island's generators use, the States has warned. The Policy and Finance Committee has agreed to raise the price cap from 50p to 60p per unit. The cap sets a maximum price Alderney Electricity Ltd (AEL) can charge for each kilowatt hour of electricity. The increase is subject to approval by the full States of Alderney next year. AEL raised its prices earlier this year, but also introduced a cost relief for customers for three months from 1 May. The draft Ordinance to be placed on the Billet does not commit to an increase in electricity prices, but allows AEL the flexibility to quickly respond to market forces, within the constraints of the revised cap. The States of Alderney said if activated in full, the measure could lead to an increase on typical domestic electricity bills of about 20% during 2023 - less than £25 per month for most households. Under the existing 50p price cap and rising world fuel prices, AEL would be unable to meet financial expectations and maintain its current infrastructure, the States said. It said improved network efficiency and station upgrades had helped to keep prices down. AEL managing director James Lancaster said: ""We have budgeted for a worst-case scenario and it may be that fuel prices will begin to return to normality enabling underlying electricity prices to be brought back below the level of the current cap. ""Projected growth in both capacity and functionality in line with the current upgrade plan, and future plans in line with Energy Policy objectives, will require that we deliver a net profit margin of twice the current targeted level.  ""Any benefit AEL may derive from lower than anticipated fuel prices or other costs next year can be targeted toward such improvements."" Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

market volatility,Asia shares up on multi-trillion dollar stimulus hopes,2024-09-15,2020-03-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52058984,"Shares in Asia have continued a global stock market rally on hopes global authorities will do more to combat the impact of the coronavirus. On Thursday top US share indexes capped their best three-day gains since the Great Depression. It comes as investors expect the US Congress to pass a massive stimulus package by the end of Saturday. The Group of 20 (G20) major economies has also pledged to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 1.6%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up by 1.6% and China's Shanghai Composite rose 1%. That followed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both climbing more than 6% on Wall Street, capping their best three-day streaks since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended higher for a second day, up 5.6%. The rally comes after weeks of stock market volatility, as investors weigh the effect of measures to slow the spread of the virus against actions taken by governments and central banks to ease the impact of disruption to the global economy. This month alone, the Dow has seen the six biggest one-day gains and five biggest one-day losses of its 135 year history. In Washington DC, leaders of the US House of Representatives have said they are determined to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill on Friday, or at the very latest on Saturday. The huge impact of the outbreak on the American economy was highlighted on Thursday as official figures showed that almost 3.3 million people registered to claim jobless benefits for the week ended 21 March. That is nearly five times more than the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. Also on Thursday, G20 leaders pledged to inject more than $5 trillion into the world economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and “do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic.” Their statement also contained the most conciliatory language on trade expressed by the group in years, promising to ensure the flow of vital medical supplies and other goods across borders and to resolve supply chain disruptions. “The G20 is committed to do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic,” along with the World Health Organization and other international institutions, it said."
market volatility,Bitcoin slump sees trades suspended,2024-09-15,2017-12-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42457983,"Bitcoin plunged on Friday, extending a fall that saw the crypto-currency lose almost a third of its value from a record of nearly $20,000 (£15,000). The crypto-currency's price dipped below $11,000 on Friday, according to the Coindesk exchange website, before recovering to above $13,000. Amid the swings, three Bitcoin-related exchanges suspended certain trades. Bitcoin has had a blistering trip over the past 12 months. Its price at the start of the year was about $1,000.  It has skyrocketed since - more than doubling in value since November -  drawing interest from major firms as well as private investors. But since Sunday Bitcoin has been on a losing streak, falling back to where it was at the start of December. Analysts said investors should be prepared for such rapid changes, which have characterised the asset from its start.  ""This is exactly how this asset trades and has done since the beginning,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of New York-based DataTrek Research. ""It has a lot of volatility and it will for the foreseeable future."" This week's plunge led to a flood of trades that swamped one of Bitcoin's major exchanges, Coinbase, on Friday. A technical slowdown prompted the firm to halt buying and selling twice. The CME and CBOE exchanges in the US also temporarily suspended trading of certain Bitcoin futures contracts, which allow investors to bet on where they expect the price of Bitcoin to be at certain points in the future.  The exchanges have automatic brakes that apply once a commodity or asset has moved by a certain amount - as happened in this case. The market remains driven by sentiment, according to Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive of industry website Cryptocompare. ""A manic upward swing led by the herd will be followed by a downturn as the emotional sentiment changes,"" he said. Some traders would have been cashing in on the spectacular gains made over the year, he added. Concerns about the infrastructure behind crypto-assets may also be spooking investors, said Nick Colas, himself a Bitcoin trader. In recent weeks, markets have been rattled by hacks and allegations of insider trading. He attributes some of this week's slump to the launch of a new crypto-asset that came earlier than planned. The surprise temporary shutdown of Coinbase on Friday was the kind of thing that could erode investor confidence, he argued. ""It is not OK to just take trading offline randomly through the day,"" he said. ""The robustness of that system is just as important to their confidence... as the price of crypto-currencies themselves."" A spokesman for Coinbase said the firm was working around the clock to ensure smooth trading. Friday's suspensions lasted for about two hours in total. ""We're doing everything within our power,"" the spokesman said.  A digital asset, Bitcoin is not backed by any governments. It is created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. There is a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day, with more than 16.5 million now in circulation. Supply is expected to peak at about 21 million.  Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undoing transactions. Regulators around the world have stepped up their warnings about its provenance as an investment.  One of this week's most striking comments came from Denmark's central bank governor, who called it a ""deadly"" gamble. Earlier this month, the head of one of the UK's leading financial regulators warned people to be ready to ""lose all their money"" if they invested in Bitcoin. Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC that neither central banks nor the government stood behind the ""currency"" and therefore it was not a secure investment. Despite the risk to individuals, US authorities have said they do not think it is a big enough part of financial markets to be a threat to broader economic stability."

The change, which will add about 80p per week on average, is in response to increases in European electricity prices.  Jersey Electricity delayed bringing in charges last year, at a cost of £1m. Jersey Electricity's CEO said islanders had been ""greatly shielded from the worst effects of this current period of unprecedented energy market volatility"".  ""This affords Jersey important shorter-term protection so the impact on our customers is not as pronounced as seen elsewhere,"" said Chris Ambler. The rise, which is slightly above the 3.5% inflation rate in Jersey, will come into place from 1 January.  This is the fourth time prices have risen in Jersey in seven years and the first increase for 15 months.  Jersey Electricity deferred its planned 2.5% rise in April 2020 by six months to help those affected financially by the pandemic.

Alderney Electricity Ltd (AEL) said although the cost of fuel had increased, it would keep the price of a unit of electricity below the 50p per unit price cap for islanders. AEL raised the price of fuel and electricity in May 2022, but introduced an electricity fuel cost relief for customers for three months from 1 May.  Managing director James Lancaster said its latest shipment had ""risen significantly"". He said: “As anticipated, the cost of fuel received in the latest shipment has risen significantly as a result of recent world events and the volatility of the global fuels market. ""The fuel cost component is now 24.46p, which would have raised the price of a unit of electricity on the A tariff above the 50p price cap.  ""As AEL has brought in a subsidy of 4.35p per unit to be applied across all tariffs, this will bring electricity prices back in line with the cap."" Bills due from the end of May 2022 would receive subsidies, the company said. The price cap of 50p per unit for electricity was set in 2008"
market volatility,US markets close higher after emergency virus deal,2024-09-15,2020-03-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52030034,"US markets gained again as Donald Trump and the Senate agreed a massive economic relief package worth more than $1.8 trillion (£1.5tn). The package includes money to bail out industries that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell described it as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the economy. The relief plans lifted financial markets around the world, but investors remained on edge. US markets, which surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the deal, teetered in the final moments of trade on Wednesday, closing below their peak for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.1%. The Nasdaq dipped 0.45%.  Shares in Boeing surged more than 23%, fuelled in part by expectations that it would benefit from the deal.  Earlier, shares rose in Europe and Asia on news of the relief package. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 8% higher, while London's FTSE 100 index gained more than 4.4%. Full details of the deal agreed in the US will not be published until later on Wednesday. However, it is expected to contain measures to help people pay bills if they are laid off because of the virus, expand unemployment assistance by $250bn and get $350bn in emergency loans to small firms. Mr McConnell said it would also ""stabilise"" key industrial sectors and give money to hospitals and other healthcare providers which were having difficulty getting equipment. ""We're going to pass this legislation later today,"" Mr McConnell added. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the package ""the largest rescue package in American history"". He said it was a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals. ""Help is on the way, big help and quick help."" Separately, President Trump on Tuesday said he wanted to get the economy up and running again by Easter. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped by 11.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since the Great Depression - as political leaders signalled a deal was close. The final package is estimated to amount to about 10% of US output, more than double the relief offered during the 2008 financial crisis. William Foster, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said it would ""help mitigate the depth and duration of the economic shock"". ""Nonetheless, we expect the virus to have a significant negative impact on growth and the fiscal deficit this year,"" he said. Governments around the world have responded to a surge in coronavirus cases by locking down societies in the hope of slowing the spread of the virus.  The International Monetary Fund has warned the hit to global growth is likely to be bigger than the financial crisis. Many countries are now working on stimulus packages to support their economies, but these plans have received mixed responses from investors, as markets experience unprecedented volatility as they grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This month alone has seen the Dow having the five biggest daily gains and five biggest falls of its 135-year history. Reacting to news of the stimulus package, Tom Stevenson, investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, said: ""It's good news, but we're not out of the woods yet. ""When markets are falling, you get these big rallies but you shouldn't get stuck on that. They do bounce around in these situations."" The US rescue package follows five days of intense negotiations to try to agree a deal that will provide aid for American workers and businesses. Before it becomes law the deal must get through the Republican-controlled Senate, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve has already announced $4tn in extra lending to help stimulate the economy in the face of the coronavirus. Nearly 19,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide since it emerged in China's Wuhan province in January, and more than 420,000 infections have been confirmed. Southern Europe is now at the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. The US has confirmed more than 55,000 cases, the third highest of any country after China and Italy. The US Congress has approved a $2tn rescue bill - the biggest package of support for the economy in modern American history. Like the UK's emergency economic measures, it offers $350bn in loans for small businesses to cover expenses for up to 10 weeks; it also offers $500bn in aid to airlines and other corporations. The government is also sending out cheques of $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. But there's concern that the package, for all its huge size, simply isn't big enough to soften the scale of the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 shutdown, now a global phenomenon. Some economists say US firms may need five times as much cash to prevent mass bankruptcy and unemployment."
market volatility,Oil output to see small hike to ease energy prices,2024-09-15,2022-08-01,By Sameer Hashmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62352272,"The world's biggest oil producers have agreed to raise production slightly in a bid help ease high prices. Members of oil producers' group Opec+ - which includes Russia - agreed on Wednesday to add 100,000 more barrels per day to the market from September. The latest production output increase is at a much slower pace than in recent months.  The decision is a blow to leaders who had called for production to be ramped up. They include US President Joe Biden, who travelled to Saudi Arabia in a bid to personally convince the country to pump more oil to help cool soaring prices. Crude has consistently traded at more than $100 a barrel since February, driving up the cost of living in many countries. Opec, which has 13 core members, was formed in 1960 as a cartel, with the aim of fixing the worldwide supply of oil and its price. Saudi Arabia is the biggest single producer in the cartel and after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, President Biden said he expected supply to increase.  Saudi officials stressed any decision to increase supplies would be done in consultation with Opec+. For July and August, Opec+ had agreed to add more than 600,000 barrels a day to the market. But after the latest meeting, Opec+ decided it would raise oil output by just 100,000 barrels per day from September in what some analysts described as an insult. ""That is so little as to be meaningless. From a physical standpoint it is a marginal blip. As a political gesture it is almost insulting,"" said Raad Alkadiri, managing director for energy, climate, and sustainability at Eurasia Group. Opec+ is a wider group of 23 oil-exporting countries including Russia, which meets every month in Vienna to decide how much crude oil to sell on the world market.  Back in April 2020, Opec+ introduced a series of cuts that continued throughout the coronavirus pandemic as demand dropped. Since 2021 it has slowly been restoring this missing supply.  At the group's last gathering Opec+ decided to increase the number of barrels it produces a little during the month of August.  But just turning the taps on full may not be all that easy. At least on paper, several members of the cartel, like Angola, Nigeria and Malaysia are already struggling to meet their existing monthly supply targets.  Simultaneously, Russian supplies have also dropped due to western sanctions. Moscow, meanwhile, has ramped up its shipments to customers in Asia like China and India. Lynchpin, Saudi Arabia, and neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, are the only two major players with some spare capacity.  Saudi's production target for August, however, is 11 million barrels of oil per day, which energy experts suggest is already at a very high level, leaving little wiggle room for more increases. Perhaps weighing more heavily on the pair's decision though, may be uncertainty over energy demand in the coming months.  Rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and looming recession in many western countries, could all seriously dent demand.  Experts think these factors are making the group cautious and unwilling to increase their output dramatically.  ""The concern for Saudi Arabia and Opec+ is that there are so many unknowns. No one knows where the oil markets will be six months from now, or next year,"" said Karen Young, senior fellow at Middle East Institute in Washington DC.  She added this means the Saudis and United Arab Emirates will want to use their spare supplies judiciously.  ""They don't want to be in a situation where they utilise their limited spare capacity to ramp-up production, and then suddenly, if demand shoots up or goes down in the future ...they are left with no room to make adjustments,"" she added. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia was the world's third largest producer of oil, behind the US and Saudi Arabia. It accounted for 8-10% of global oil supply.  Market analysts have suggested President Vladimir Putin wants to sustain high oil prices in order to keep paying for the Ukraine war and stave off the impact of crippling western economic sanctions.  For Saudi Arabia, unity among the Opec+ group is paramount, and it would avoid any decision that could jeopardise that. Opec itself is forecasting that global oil demand will rise in 2023 albeit at a slower pace than this year. Its analysts say this will be driven in part by progress in containing the coronavirus in China.  Estimates from the International Energy Agency and the US Energy Information Administration meanwhile suggest oil demand will continue rising strongly, despite growing fears over inflation in multiple countries and weakening economic growth. This means that oil producers may find themselves having to pump oil at the fastest pace in five years to balance out supply and demand - a tall order, given capacity constraints and the lack of investment in downstream and refining. ""There is a lot of volatility in the markets but not many people expect a sustained drop below $100 a barrel,"" said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Gasoline prices in the United States have already touched a 13-year high this year.  The US has been releasing about one million barrels per day from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) since April - as part of its plan to add some 180 million barrels to the market over a six-month period finishing at the end of October.  However, Mr Cahill warned once this roll-out stops supplies will become even tighter, putting greater pressure on prices.   ""We still haven't seen any signs of major investments towards increasing production. So, if demand goes up, we won't have sufficient supplies to balance the markets"" he added. "
market volatility,Energy bills pushed higher by electricity charge,2024-09-15,2023-02-01,By Andy Verity & Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64471262,"The way electricity prices are set has pushed UK household bills up by £7.2bn over two years, analysis suggests. Under existing rules, energy suppliers pay the highest price for wholesale electricity no matter how it is made. Gas-fired power stations are the most expensive way to generate electricity, but only make about 40% of all electricity used by UK homes. That means homes pay over the odds for power generated any other way, said the Carbon Tracker Initiative. If an average price was used instead the UK's electricity bill could be much lower, the not-for-profit climate think tank said.  The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis) said it had ""already launched a major review"" of the electricity market ""to radically cut costs"" for consumers in the long term. The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of power. When it's windy and sunny enough to meet demand for electricity through renewables, the wholesale cost drops to close to zero, according to Beis. But when it's not, the wholesale cost is set at the level that all providers will accept - which is the highest bid. In the past, gas powered generation was among the cheapest ways of producing electricity. For decades, wholesale gas was relatively cheap in the UK, and only started to soar in price in May 2021 as economies recovered from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted supplies. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply since August 2022, but are still about three times the price of May 2021. Charging an average price for wholesale electricity would have made the bill in the two years from 2021-22 £7.2bn lower, the Carbon Tracker Initiative said. According to BBC calculations that's about £250 per household. Due to the current system, firms that make renewable energy have been paid much more for their power than it costs them to generate.  For this reason the government introduced a temporary 45% tax in January on what it calls ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generators in the UK. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, which campaigns for warm homes, said ""injustice"" in the electricity pricing system was at a ""shocking scale"" ""It cannot be right that consumers have been prevented from benefiting from the reduced cost of generating electricity,"" he said. Jonathan Sims, an energy analyst who wrote the CTI report, said the findings showed how the global gas market over the last two years had skewed British power prices. He said these prices did not reflect the different technology the UK now uses to generate electricity.  The CTI's report takes into account the need for sources of power that can be fired up immediately such as gas-fired, or provide near constant output such as nuclear, whereas wind power for example is weather-dependent.  The analysis also suggested Europe's most gas power-dependent countries, the UK and Italy, had consistently paid the highest prices for electricity during the recent period of gas price volatility.  The business department said it was consulting on changes that ""would stop volatile gas prices setting the price of electricity produced by much cheaper renewables"". It also said its windfall tax on renewables generators would ""help fund energy bill support for households and businesses""."
market volatility,UK gas prices fall from high after Russia steps in,2024-09-15,2021-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58815665,"UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high before falling after Russia said it was boosting supplies to Europe. Russia President Vladimir Putin appeared to calm the market after gas prices had risen by 37% in 24 hours to trade at 400p per therm on Wednesday. UK gas was 60p per therm at the start of the year, but high global demand and reduced supply has driven prices up. The high cost of wholesale gas has seen several UK energy firms collapse and halted production across industries. Following Mr Putin's comments on supplies, gas prices dropped to about 257p a therm later on Wednesday. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changing gas prices underlined the ""volatility in the market and the nervousness amongst investors about low stockpiles of gas across Europe"". ""When Putin's promises help calm the storm of rising prices which was pummelling financial markets, it's clear investors are desperate for any gust of good news blowing in,"" she said. The surge in prices led to Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steel, chemical and fertiliser firms, calling on the government to help keep businesses and industries running. Industry leaders said surging costs had already resulted in steel production halting ""at times of peak demand"". Last month, US-owned CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies because of the rise in gas prices, before the government stepped in to meet its operating costs for its Teesside plant for three weeks. The shut down led to a shortage of carbon dioxide - a by-product of the fertiliser factories - which sparked warnings from food producers and supermarkets of shortages in the supply of fresh produce. The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf life. ""We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors,"" said Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group. ""Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter, given that UK EIIs [energy intensive industries] produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than £2bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs.  ""Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" Besides industry struggles, a total of nine energy suppliers have collapsed in recent weeks, which has affected nearly 1.73 million customers in September alone. The companies that have gone bust have been mostly smaller firms, which have been unable to deliver price promises to customers because of the surge in gas prices. Firms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, ""pausing"" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely. Flipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could ""no longer sustain the great savings"" its customers had ""come to expect"". Meanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was ""temporarily pausing"" its switching service, but would be ""back as soon as we can"" access energy deals ""right"" for customers. Affected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier. It has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. Jonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills. A higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by £139 to £1,277 a year. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff. However, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers. Analysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of £1,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023.  ""The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,"" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey."
market volatility,How a small Hong Kong firm saw its shares soar,2024-09-15,2022-08-04,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62417010,"A little-known Hong Kong company has seen its stock market value soar in recent days, for no apparent reason. AMTD Digital made its New York debut last month, priced at $7.80 a share. This week, the firm's shares have been on a rollercoaster ride, closing on Wednesday at $1,100. The meteoric rise in AMTD Digital's value has seen it likened by some commentators to ""meme stocks"", shares that gain popularity among retail investors through social media. Trading in the company's shares has been particularly volatile this week, as its value rose above $300bn on Tuesday. That meant that AMTD Digital briefly overtook technology giant Alibaba's New York stock market valuation. In Wednesday's trade it plunged by more than 30%, but that still gave it a higher US market value than Disney. On Monday, AMTD Digital thanked investors and said it ""noted significant volatility"" in trading. ""The company is also monitoring the market closely for any unusual trading activities or abnormalities,"" the statement said. AMTD Digital offers services to develop online businesses' financial services technology. It had 50 members of staff as of the end of February this year, according to a stock market filing. It makes money mainly by charging fees and commissions for its digital financial services business, which brought in just over $25m in revenue last year, according to a regulatory filing. A space-themed corporate video on the company's website highlights the range of digital services that the company offers. The company's website describes it ""as the fusion reactor at the core of the AMTD SpiderNet ecosystem, AMTD Digital is a one-stop digital solutions platforms in Asia with businesses spanning multiple verticals, including digital financial services, digital media, content & marketing, SpiderNet ecosystem solutions, and digital investments."" Some commentators have likened the rise in AMTD Digital's value to so-called ""meme stocks"". Due to the nature of their popularity, trading in meme stocks is often extremely speculative and volatile. US retailer GamesStop and cinema chain AMC were two of the most high profile meme stocks that saw their shares soar last year. ""This is a major head-scratcher and it shows that the era of meme stocks is not over with a $300bn market cap,"" Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities told the BBC. ""In a major risk off market in 2022 it's bewildering this meme dynamic can still happen but yet it has and Wall Street is watching this latest craze,"" he added. AMTD Digital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC."
market volatility,Is the honeymoon period over for Brazil's Bolsonaro?,2024-09-15,2019-04-10,By Katy Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47865386,"Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election last October on a platform of change.  He said he would deliver a safer Brazil to appease those worried about rising violence, an economic turnaround after several years of crisis and - perhaps most central to his campaign - an end to old-style corrupt politics which have seen dozens of high-ranking politicians, including a former president, jailed.  For millions of Brazilians fed up with the status quo, the gun-loving former army officer was the only man for the top job despite sexist, racist and a homophobic remarks he made during the campaign. While 100 days in office may not be long enough to judge the president's performance, some of his erstwhile supporters are now expressing doubts about his ability to lead the largest democracy in Latin America.  And among his detractors, there is definitely a feeling of ""I told you so"" after his first months were beset by a series of problems.  Late last month, the president caused outrage by suggesting the armed forces commemorate the start of military rule 55 years ago. His anti-corruption image has been tainted by allegations that his son Flavio was involved in financial scandals and death squads.  And then of course, there was that awkward time during carnival when he posted a video on Twitter of a sex act performed by two men at a street party that he felt was bringing the reputation of the country down.  He has now got the lowest approval rating recorded by a first-time president in the initial 100 days in power since the country returned to democracy in the 1980s. ""The feeling is that the situation is worse than it was before the elections,"" says Rafael Alcadipani, an associate professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. ""Everyone wanted change in society but the commander-in-chief hasn't shown himself to be capable of delivering any type of change.""  ""He's failed to show Brazilians confidence in his plan for government,"" says Roberta Braga, associate director at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Centre in Washington DC. ""He's losing a lot of support. It clearly takes time to implement these very complex reforms but Brazilians expected a lot from him.""  One of Mr Bolsonaro's campaign commitments was to bring down violence by making it easier for people to own guns. Within a couple of weeks of being sworn in, he had loosened regulations to make it easier to keep guns at home.  This was music to the ears of people like gun club member Natasha Imata, whom I met at LAAD Expo, Latin America's largest security and defence show in Rio de Janeiro last week.  But despite his swift action on gun ownership, Ms Imata thinks that the new president is ""not focussed on security"".  Her husband Vitor agrees. ""His whole campaign was focussed on helping Brazilians but that's not happened. It's been a weak start,"" he says. Brazil's stock market and currency soared after Mr Bolsonaro's election in what some dubbed the ""Bullsonaro wave"". But since he took over power on 1 January, signals have been more mixed.  While many in the industry point to a strong economic team led by market-friendly economy minister Paulo Guedes, unemployment levels have remained stubbornly high.  There is also a reluctant acceptance that the government may not be able to push through much-needed reforms such as pension cuts as easily as it had hoped. ""We have serious doubts about the capacity of the government to continue to do these reforms,"" says Andre Perfeito, chief economist at Necton brokerage in São Paulo. ""Bolsonaro's main promise was pension reform. And he's not doing the political job to deliver that."" Others though, are more upbeat.  Walter Maciel is the CEO of independent asset management company AZ Quest: ""Most of the old political leaders were not re-elected and went home. There is a major renovation in congress, a new government that was elected by people who desired a huge change, not only in the way the country was led but also in the way that politics was done.""  ""So you have a lot of new people coming in, many of them coming in without any political experience. Of course there's some kind of externality and undesired volatility but it's part of the learning process,"" Mr Maciel says.   Government worker Gabriel Moraes voted for Jair Bolsonaro but says he would not do so again. He thinks the president needs to be more statesman-like and has so far failed.  ""As a head of state, any message he sends out is a reflection of society today,"" Mr Moraes argues. ""Life in civil society isn't like an army barracks. Sure there has to be order and discipline but there have to be principles, rules and respect too."" But his cousin Alessandra Guadelupe Regondi disagrees. A big fan of President Bolsonaro, she says he represents something very different, something that Brazil needs. With a military background in her family, Ms Regondi warmed to the politician during the campaign.  His promises of cutting ministries in the government and making it more efficient, for example, appealed to her and she has even got a photo of the two of them together, in pride of place on her bookshelf in the living room.  Ms Regondi does not see any problem with the president's social media habit. ""It helps him get closer to the people,"" she argues.  ""Leaders were always from the same parties,"" she says. ""He's a new hope, like Donald Trump was. He went against everything - and still won."" "
market volatility,University pensions deficit could be £23bn,2024-09-15,2019-08-01,By Dominic O'Connell,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49194091,"The pension scheme for university academics would face a deficit of £23bn if it had to be rescued by a government-backed pension lifeboat, the scheme's annual accounts show. The figures will stoke a fierce debate about the Universities Superannuation Scheme's (USS) financial position. It has assets of more than £60bn and provides retirement incomes and savings for about 200,000 UK university staff.  The USS said it funds the scheme in a ""fair and balanced way"". In February and March 2018, academics at 64 universities took industrial action over plans by their employer Universities UK to reduce future benefits and introduce a less-generous pension arrangement. The University and College Union said the new plans would leave them up to £10,000 a year worse off in retirement, and younger staff would be worst affected, with some losing up to half their pensions. USS's accounts for the year to the end of March 2019, which were published last week, give several different figures for the size of the scheme deficit. The ""best estimate"" for the scheme is a surplus of £5.2bn, which the accounts say ""does not build in prudence and has a 50% chance of being more than is required to pay the benefits, and 50% of being too little"". The technical provisions estimate, which includes ""prudence"", is £7.5bn. The buyout deficit - arrived at by assuming that universities paid an insurance company like the Prudential to take the scheme off their hands and pay out all future benefits - is £63.9bn. The accounts contain another estimate, which follows the standard rules laid down by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is the backstop scheme for retirement plans that get into financial difficulty.  In recent years, the PPF has taken on the schemes of companies such as MG Rover, BHS, Carillion and Hoover. If the PPF took over the university scheme - which would see some academics receiving reduced payouts in retirement - the deficit would be £23.1bn.  The USS disagrees, however. A spokesman said: ""Our focus is on funding the scheme in a balanced and responsible way that ensures members' pensions are secure.  ""There has been intensive engagement to ensure the institutions in the scheme understand clearly, and are collectively able and willing to support, the levels of risk and volatility in the scheme. ""The PPF measure does not take into account the specifics of the scheme or the benefits of investing in a diverse range of assets."" John Ralfe, the independent pensions expert, said: ""The hard PPF numbers show how huge USS's deficit is, and how it has ballooned."" Whistleblowing In May, statistician Prof Jan Hutton, a USS trustee, told the Financial Times that she had been thwarted in her efforts to investigate whether the pensions deficit had been exaggerated to justify the cuts.  She claimed to have identified a calculation error in the ""retirement rate"" used to calculate the deficit in November 2017, and she took her concerns to the pensions regulator in March 2018. USS had claimed to have a £7.5bn deficit in November 2017, which prompted Universities UK to put forward proposals to reduce future benefits and introduce a less-generous pension arrangement. Universities dropped plans to move from a defined-benefit scheme, which gives a guaranteed retirement income, to a defined-contribution scheme, where their pensions would be subject to the performance of the stock market. However, defined benefit scheme members and universities have been asked to raise their contributions in order to fix the deficit. Unhappy with this, Prof Hutton went public, and as a result of the press coverage, in June more than 1,000 academics signed an open letter calling for an urgent inquiry into the governance of the USS fund.  New ballots are planned for September. Universities have said union demands for extra contributions to the scheme could bankrupt some institutions, and severely curtail academic activity at others.

market volatility,Covid sees share of women on India's stock market rise,2024-09-15,2020-11-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54873285,"More and more Indian women have turned to the stock market during the pandemic to bolster their savings, reports the BBC's Nidhi Rai in Mumbai.  Sakina Gandhi has found a new passion: stock market trading.  The 31-year-old works in public relations and until this year had only invested in mutual funds, generally seen as a safer bet than directly trading in stocks.  But when India went into a stringent lockdown in March to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Ms Gandhi found herself with a lot of time on her hands.  ""I had time to look at the market,"" she says. ""The first 15 days I only tracked the market. I made a list of stocks and analysed what kind of volatility they were showing. After consulting a few colleagues, I bought those stocks."" It proved to be a lucrative option.  Share prices plunged amid fears over the virus and stayed low as the lockdown battered the Indian economy. But they soon picked up as investor sentiment rallied. Trusted stocks braved the storm and some company valuations have since grown substantially. Prices remain at a high, buoyed by falling Covid case numbers and the promise of a vaccine.  This is despite heavy job losses, negative growth and other macro factors that have left the Indian economy reeling.  But that's also why working women such as Ms Gandhi are looking to make some extra money. And she is not alone.  ""There is a definite rise in new women investors,"" says Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha, a stockbroking company.  Of the more than 1.5 million clients the firm has added since the outbreak of Covid-19 in India earlier this year, some 235,000 are women. That's about half of their women investors, whose average age is 33 years, Mr Kamath says.  Another stockbroking firm, FYERS Securities, told the BBC it has seen a three-fold rise in active women traders.  This fits with the larger trend in India that appears to have been wrought by the pandemic - a surge in demat accounts, an electronic facility for passing virtual share certificates between investors. Some 6.3 million new demat accounts were opened in India between April and September this year, according to market regulator SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India). This is more than double of last year's tally for the same period (2.7 million).  And many of these investors are young women, says stockbroking firms.  Ritika Shah, 36, comes from a family that has long invested in the stock market but she had never done so - until this year. ""I was waiting for the right time to do it. The pandemic gave me time to plan my finances. I got time to research, study and follow up,"" she said.  Mr Khoday says women are typically more ""inclined to invest than trade"". That is, they buy traditional assets such as gold or park money in safe place such as fixed deposits and, more recently, tax-saving mutual funds.  The lockdown also turned out to be a good time to enter the market. Ms Shah, for instance, says the valuation for the market in March was a deciding factor.  Mr Kamat says fixed deposits, although safe, became less attractive and mutual funds dropped too, encouraging people to start investing directly in stocks. So, he adds, people's attention turned to capital markets because of the ""heavily discounted valuations of fundamentally strong large-capital companies"".  The surge has also been aided by technology and simplified processes.  Cheap data allowed investors to stay hooked to the stock market; and online banking and trading quickened buying and selling. Many broking firms are charging almost no fees, enticing new investors. Firms have also begun educating investors about the stock market and have seen an uptick in visits to their website.  The biggest encouragement came from market regulator SEBI, which eased the process of opening a demat account. It also allowed the e-signatures and digital lockers so paperwork can be processed fast and from within the confines of home during the pandemic.  And those who decided to give it a shot have even begun to enjoy it. Ms Gandhi says she tracks stocks in the newspaper daily and has also set up Google alerts for news of companies that interest her.  ""It's my money"" she says. ""My husband or anyone has no say in it. Therefore I thought why not take some risk and see what happens. It actually turned out to be good."" "
market volatility,India watchdog probing Adani fraud allegations,2024-09-15,2023-02-14,By Annabelle Liang & Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64633419,"India's markets regulator has confirmed that it is investigating allegations made by Hindenburg Research against companies owned by multi-billionaire Gautam Adani. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also says it is examining market activity around the report. Mr Adani's business empire had over $100bn (£82.3bn) wiped off its stock market value after the claims of market manipulation and financial fraud. Adani Group has denied the claims. On Monday, SEBI said in a Supreme Court filing that it was studying the allegations and ""the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report"". ""SEBI is strongly and adequately empowered to put in place regulatory frameworks for effecting stable operations and development of the securities markets,"" it added in a filing to the Supreme Court. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. But the group did tell the Reuters news agency that it had strong cashflows and its business plans were fully funded. ""We are confident in the continued ability of our portfolio to deliver superior returns to shareholders,"" it said. Meanwhile, the conglomerate's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, reported a net profit of nearly $100m for the October to December quarter, against a loss of $1.5m in the same period a year earlier. Its total revenue jumped by 42% to $3.3bn, owing to a strong performance in its airports, coal trading and new energy businesses.  ""Our fundamental strength lies in mega-scale infrastructure project execution capabilities… the current market volatility is temporary,"" said Mr Adani in the results statement. The company did not announce any cutback in growth projections or investment plans, or comment on the decision by France's TotalEnergies to put its partnership with Adani for a green hydrogen project on hold following the Hindenburg report. Shares in Adani Enterprises were up 5% on Mumbai's stock exchange after plunging nearly 50% over the past month.  Mr Adani's group has seven publicly-traded companies which operate across a wide range of sectors, including commodities trading, airports, utilities, ports and renewable energy.  Last month, a report by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that Adani Group companies had engaged in decades of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud. It also claimed its companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". Short-selling is betting that the value of an asset will fall. Adani Group has categorically denied the allegations. It has said previously that the Hindenburg report was intended to enable the US-based short seller to book gains, without citing evidence."
market volatility,Manx government could take control of gas firms,2024-09-15,2022-10-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-63400991,"Laws giving the Manx government the power to take control of struggling gas companies in an emergency have been progressed by the House of Keys.  The Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture's (DEFA) Energy Bill 2022 passed its second reading on Tuesday. DEFA Minister Clare Barber said the legislation ""strengthens government's power to intervene"" and ensure the island's gas supply is maintained. The consequence of losing supply was ""too dire to contemplate"", she added. The proposed laws would pave the way for powers allowing the Council of Ministers to temporarily take over a gas firm that had fallen into financial difficulty so that public energy supplies were not affected. Under that scenario, the government would be required to pay the firm ""reasonable compensation"" for the intervention, which was intended to be used as a last resort and only with the approval of Tynwald. The move mirrors laws in the UK, which allows the government there to put firms under similar pressure into administration.  Private firm Isle of Man Energy, formerly know as Manx Gas, is currently the island's monopoly gas provider. Ms Barber said energy suppliers had been facing ""major economic pressure"" in recent times, and it was important to have the laws in place to avoid the ""catastrophic outcomes"" a loss of supply would cause.  David Ashford MHK said he was concerned a lack of clarity over what was ""reasonable compensation"" could leave the government open to a ""messy court case"". In response, Ms Barber said the fee paid would have to be determined within ""the particular circumstances"" of the emergency. Recent volatility in the wholesale gas market has seen customers on the island face hikes bills this year, but tariffs are currently under review again by the island's regulator.

market volatility,"Mine e-waste, not the Earth, say scientists",2024-09-15,2022-05-07,By Victoria Gill,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-61350996,"The recycling of e-waste must urgently be ramped up because mining the Earth for precious metals to make new gadgets is unsustainable, scientists say. One study estimated that the world's mountain of discarded electronics, in 2021 alone, weighed 57 million tonnes.  The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) says there now needs to be a global effort to mine that waste, rather than mining the Earth.  Global conflicts also pose a threat to supply chains for precious metals.  The RSC is running a campaign to draw attention to the unsustainability of continuing to mine all the precious elements used in consumer technology. It points out that geopolitical unrest, including the war in Ukraine, has caused huge spikes in the price of materials like nickel, a key element in electric vehicle batteries.  This volatility in the market for elements is causing ""chaos in supply chains"" that enable the production of electronics. Combined with the surge in demand, this caused the price of lithium - another important component in battery technology - to increase by almost 500% between 2021 and 2022.  Current reserves of some key elements, researchers say, are simply running out.  ""Our tech consumption habits remain highly unsustainable and have left us at risk of exhausting the raw elements we need,"" said Prof Tom Welton, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, adding that those habits were ""continuing to exacerbate environmental damage"". All the while, the amount of e-waste generated is growing by about two million tonnes every year. Less than 20% is collected and recycled. ""We need governments to overhaul recycling infrastructure and tech businesses to invest in more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Prof Welton.  New research by the RSC also revealed a growing demand from consumers for more sustainable technology. In an online survey of 10,000 people across 10 countries, 60% said they would be more likely to switch to a rival of their preferred tech brand if they knew the product was made in a sustainable way. The survey also suggested that people did not know how to deal with their own e-waste. Many respondents said they worried about the environmental effect of unused devices they have in their homes, but did not know what to do with them or were concerned about the security of recycling schemes. Elizabeth Ratcliffe from the Royal Society of Chemistry, told BBC Radio 4's inside Science that many of us were ""unwittingly stockpiling precious metals in our homes"", in old phones and defunct computers.  ""Manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility,"" said Ms Ratcliffe. ""Like 'take-back' schemes, meaning people can return their electronics to a retailer and be assured they will be recycled securely. ""All this volatility in supply chains really just reinforces the fact that we need a circular economy for these materials. At the moment, we're just mining them out of the ground constantly.""  The society hopes to encourage people to take old and unwanted devices to recycling centres, rather than stuff them into drawers and forget about them. It points UK consumers to online resources where they can find the nearest centre that pledges to recycle computers, phones and other devices securely.  ""The thing we always say is reduce, reuse and recycle. So perhaps keep a phone for longer and maybe sell an old phone or give it to a relative,"" says Ms Ratcliffe. ""It will need everyone working together to scale up these processes and put the infrastructure in place, so we can all recycle our devices.""  Follow Victoria on Twitter"
market volatility,Steam stops accepting Bitcoin payments,2024-09-15,2017-12-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42264622,"Online game service Steam has stopped accepting payments made with the Bitcoin virtual currency. In a statement, development studio Valve, which runs Steam, said ""high fees and volatility"" had driven it to stop accepting them. It said that fees to process Bitcoin payments had ""skyrocketed"" in 2017, making the virtual currency much less attractive as an option. It said it may re-evaluate Bitcoin as a payment possibility in the future. In its statement, Valve said although Bitcoin had always been volatile, the rapid changes in value it had seen during the past few months had been ""extreme"". Steam started accepting payments in bitcoins in April this year.  At that time, each Bitcoin was worth about $450 (£335). Now, each coin is worth about $14,800. The moment-by-moment shifts in value were a problem, Valve said, because of the narrow window customers had to complete a purchase using bitcoins.  If a Bitcoin-based transaction was prolonged, the value of the coins being transferred could change ""significantly"", it said. In these cases, customers had to transfer more bitcoins to make the payment, or get a refund. And either option would result in the customer paying more exchange fees, currently about $20.  Some customers adding bitcoins had even been caught out a second time as the value changed again. ""This year, we've seen increasing number of customers get into this state,"" Valve said. Bitcoin continued to rise in value this week and looks set to break the $15,000 barrier soon. Valve's decision comes as crypto-cash mining market NiceHash reported a ""security breach"" had meant hackers had accessed its Bitcoin wallet, which had contained about $60m in bitcoins."
market volatility,Saudi oil giant breaks profit record with $48.4bn,2024-09-15,2022-08-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62539480,"Saudi oil giant Aramco has broken its own record with a $48.4bn (£40bn) profit for the second quarter of 2022. It is a 90% year-on-year increase and marks the biggest earnings for the world's largest energy exporter since its public listing three years ago. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen oil and gas prices skyrocket.  Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters but Western nations have pledged to curb their dependence on the country for their energy needs. According to Bloomberg, the Saudi oil giant's figure represents ""the biggest quarterly adjusted profit of any listed company"". As well as the record profits, the state-owned Saudi energy giant announced it would keep its dividend unchanged at $18.8bn for the third quarter. The company said it would keep expanding to satisfy demand. ""While global market volatility and economic uncertainty remain, events during the first half of this year support our view that ongoing investment in our industry is essential both to help ensure markets remain well supplied and to facilitate an orderly energy transition,"" Aramco president and chief executive Amin Nasser said. ""In fact, we expect oil demand to continue to grow for the rest of the decade, despite downward economic pressures on short-term global forecasts,"" he added. Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and demand outstripped supply. The world's biggest oil producers, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, have all posted huge earnings this year - leading to growing calls on governments to impose a windfall tax amid an alarming rise in living costs. In June, US President Joe Biden said Exxon had made ""more money than God this year"". Saudi Arabia is the largest single producer in Opec, a group representing the world's biggest oil producers.  Last week Opec+ agreed to raise production slightly in an effort to help ease high oil prices. However, the latest production output increase is at a much slower pace than in recent months.  The decision was a blow to leaders including Mr Biden, who have called for production to be ramped up. "
market volatility,Deutsche to take €1.5bn US tax hit,2024-09-15,2018-01-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42584658,"Deutsche Bank will take a €1.5bn (£1.3bn) charge following changes to the US tax code, meaning it will not make a profit for 2017. The bank said its trading revenue in the fourth quarter also declined about 22% year-on-year, amid lower market volatility and less client activity. Shares in Deutsche fell nearly 6% after the announcement. The German lender also posted annual losses in 2016 and 2015. Deutsche has grappled in previous years with hefty legal costs connected to money laundering charges, among other violations, but had hoped to turn a profit in 2017.  On Friday it said the tax changes would lead to a ""small full-year after-tax loss"". Several large companies have announced one-time hits due to the changes to the US tax code that cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the long run, corporations expect to benefit from lower rates. But the switch has led many companies to revalue deferred tax assets, which are tied to deductions for past losses and can be used to reduce future tax payments.  As well as Deutsche, Morgan Stanley said it expected the changes in its deferred tax assets to lead to a $1.25bn hit."
market volatility,Ryan Giggs headbutted ex-girlfriend - court hears,2024-09-15,2022-08-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-62423393,"Ex-Manchester Utd and Wales star Ryan Giggs ""deliberately headbutted"" his ex-girlfriend, a court has heard. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court Mr Giggs' private life involved a ""litany of abuse, both physical and psychological"". Mr Giggs, 48, denies a charge of coercive behaviour and assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her sister. His defence counsel said the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies"". Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville, 38, between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. Opening his case against Mr Giggs at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Mr Wright said this was a story of ""control and coercion"" of a woman who thought she was ""loved and respected"". He said his relationship with Ms Greville, 36, was ""punctuated by acts of violence and volatility"". He added Mr Giggs was ""idolised"" for his skills on the pitch but behind closed doors had ""a much uglier and more sinister side to his character"". He told the jury they will hear the relationship had ""ups and downs"" and that Mr Giggs was seeing someone else when he was with Ms Greville.  ""Eventually, after years of turbulence, when the scales fell from her eyes, she realised she needed to remove herself from his sphere of influence,"" he said. Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel.  ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen.  ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies.""  He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"".  Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself.  Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients.  She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers.  ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"".  Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues. "
market volatility,GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?,2024-09-15,2021-01-29,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55864608,"Financial markets have been riveted by the tale of novice investors taking on Wall Street pros by buying up shares of US video games retailer GameStop, which many hedge funds had seen as a losing bet. It's an apparently crowd-sourced attempt to beat billionaire traders at their own game. But who's really winning and losing this battle? GameStop, a loss-making chain of bricks-and-mortar shops, saw shares jump from being worth less than $20 each at the end of December to nearly $350 on Wednesday. The surge has been attributed to a swarm of independent traders, swapping tips on social media, who saw an opportunity to pressure Wall Street hedge funds that had made deals assuming GameStop's share price would fall - and would have to purchase shares to cover losses if the stock rose more than expected.  That, in turn, could generate a kind of buying frenzy - and chance for gains for the little guys. In recent weeks, they've deployed the strategy on behalf of other firms, such as struggling theatre chain AMC Entertainment, owner of Odeon Cinemas.  And the idea has caught on globally, fuelling activity in stocks traded in other parts of the world, including the UK, Brazil and Malaysia. The social media forums where the amateur day-traders stoked enthusiasm for GameStop are full of snapshots showing how their bets have performed -  in some cases growing from tiny sums to positions worth millions of dollars. But for many, these are just gains on paper - and could still end in big losses if the prices fall back. On Thursday, after the wacky market conditions prompted some trading platforms, such as Robinhood, to restrict purchases, shares dipped.  Some traders posted comments confessing to nerves at the prospect of losses, while rallying their fellows to hold the line and avoid selling, staving off a sudden price collapse. And on Friday, GameStop shares rose again, climbing 68% to $325 apiece, even as the market overall dropped. If prices drop back, however, some who bought in too late will be hurt. The buying frenzy has reportedly led to losses for some big name hedge funds, including Point72, a firm run by infamous investor Steve Cohen, a billionaire art collector and owner of the New York Mets baseball team whose first hedge fund, SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and shut down.  Some of the losses this week stemmed from Point72 money being managed by Melvin Capital, a company founded by a former SAC star trader, which had made big bets against Gamestop and was forced to pull out of the trade. Other firms reportedly hit include Maplelane Capital and DI Capital, while other prominent short sellers have said  they - and their families - have been subject to harassment. Analysts also say the pressure on hedge funds is one force behind broader declines in US markets in recent days, as firms sell other investments to cover their losses. Mr Cohen, whose firm helped provide rescue funding to Melvin Capital amid the upheaval, has appeared to allude to the strains caused by the Reddit army, writing on Twitter: ""Hey stock jockeys keep bringing it"". That's not to say there aren't investing pros benefiting from the battle against the short-sellers - many of which are still betting stocks will fall. Firms like investment giant Fidelity and BlackRock, which own more than 10% of GameStop shares, have seen the value of their holdings rise.  The surge also benefited Ryan Cohen, an entrepreneur who sold his online pet retail company Chewy to Petsmart in 2017 and revealed a major investment in GameStop last year. Executives at some companies favoured by the day traders, such as BlackBerry, have gotten windfalls from selling their shares. It's creating opportunities for other kinds of companies too. For example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  In other ways, however, the episode could bode ill for Wall Street in Washington, where Democrats now claim slim majorities and Congress was already eying tax hikes for hedge funds.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent voice in favour of tougher rules, has said the episode warrants wider investigation, pointing to fault on both sides of the battle, which she said was a sign of market distortions that could put the rest of the economy at risk.  Regulators already had their eyes on Robinhood, an app used to buy and sell shares that has seen its popularity explode amid the pandemic.  The Silicon Valley company, which makes money in part from fees charged to Wall Street funds that execute customer orders, is accused of courting inexperienced investors and encouraging them to trade frequently and deploy risky strategies - even if it goes against customer interests. This episode has only intensified regulator scrutiny. Meanwhile, the firm said late Thursday it had raised more than $1bn amid questions about financial strains on the firm created by the buying frenzy.  It's also facing outrage from customers - and lawmakers - angry after Robinhood was among the trading platforms to limit purchases of Gamestop and others' stocks, citing market volatility and risk. Many of the companies whose shares have been championed by day traders in the battle against the short-sellers are what have been dubbed ""90s nostalgia stocks"" - firms buffeted by changes wrought technology, like the decline of traffic to bricks and mortar shops and cinemas.  The pandemic has only hammered them harder. GameStop, which was founded in 1996 and now has more than 5,000 stores in the US, Canada, Australia and elsewhere, saw sales fall 30% in the first nine months of 2020.  AMC Entertainment, the owner of Odeon Cinemas, meanwhile, warned last month it risked running out of cash, after traffic to its theatres plunged last year. Some of those firms have seized opportunities created by the recent trading to ease financial strains. AMC, for example, raised more than $300m by selling shares this week and has said it is exploring additional offerings. American Airlines has said it is also planning to sell shares. But regardless of what happens next in the financial markets, the challenges facing them in the real world aren't going away."
market volatility,Offshore projects restart 'could take three years',2024-09-15,2020-11-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-54905615,"Restarting offshore oil and gas projects stalled by the pandemic and the sharp drop in energy prices could take three years, it has been claimed. Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said drilling activity was at its lowest level for nearly 50 years. The industry body said price volatility was putting off decisions on new projects. It said UK gas demand fell by 16% in the second quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2019. OGUK's market intelligence manager Ross Dornan said: ""New projects and investments are crucial to providing secure energy, sustaining supply chain capabilities, and ensuring the UK is viewed as a good place for these companies to anchor their resources.  ""It is estimated that companies could continue to take a conservative approach in 2021, reflecting the ongoing challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and the wider economic downturn."" OGUK said last month that the number of people working offshore in the North Sea fell by more than a third at the start of the coronavirus lockdown. Figures said the average weekly workforce dropped from 11,000 to 7,000, during March. A halt in drilling and engineering construction was blamed for the sudden loss of 4,000 jobs. Although numbers offshore have since risen steadily they only peaked at 9,000 in August."
market volatility,Amazon 'plots shipping expansion',2024-09-15,2018-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43008428,"Amazon is reportedly embarking on further expansion of its shipping services with a programme to pick up from companies that sell on its site. The firm is considering offering the service to other businesses as well, according to the Wall Street Journal. Investors dumped shares of existing shipping companies FedEx and UPS in response to the news. Amazon already offers shipping services to merchants that use its warehouses. Under its Fulfillment by Amazon and other programmes, Amazon handles delivery of products that merchants store in the firm's warehouses, including to non-Amazon customers. The new programme goes a step farther, including pick-up from the vendor, according to the Wall Street Journal.  It has started in London and expects to launch soon in Los Angeles, with the aim of expanding to other cities this year, the report said. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. The e-commerce giant has long focused on speeding delivery of online purchases, eliminating the lag time that provides traditional stores an edge, while trying to reduce the costs of shipping, which hit $21.7bn (£15.7bn) in 2017. The focus has led the firm to invest billions in its logistics network, building warehouses, deploying aircraft and hiring delivery trucks. Amazon also purchased upmarket grocer Whole Foods last year. This week, the firm said it would start making two-hour grocery deliveries from the stores for Prime customers in some cities. As Amazon's network expands, it has led to increased questions about how well longstanding shipping companies such as FedEx and UPS - which count Amazon as a customer - will compete. FedEx and UPS shares fell by more than 2% on Friday morning as the market volatility continued."
market volatility,Three reasons why markets are hitting record highs,2024-09-15,2018-01-05,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42579028,"Not too hot, not too cold - but just right. Goldilocks' requirements for the perfect bowl of porridge are similar to the requirements of an attractive economy. Not too hot - growth busting out the lights raising fears about sustainability and rampant inflation. And not too cold - economic slowdowns and recessions pulling down business profitability and weighing on equity valuations. Market investors certainly sense that 2018 will see a continuation of a global ""Goldilocks economy"". Why? Firstly, there is the gentle recovery in economic growth and increasing demand for companies products across the major drivers of the world economy - Japan and the Asian emerging markets; the Eurozone and, most importantly, America. Secondly, there is the continuing stable expansion of that other engine of the world economy - China. It is the first time since the financial crisis that such a growth ""synchronisation"" has happened. Thirdly, there is little evidence of increasing inflationary pressures, meaning interest rates are likely to remain at close to historically low levels. That leads to the economically benign sum: growth (leading to higher company profits) + low inflation + easy monetary policy. Which equals good news for equities. On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average in America pushed through 25,000 for the first time in its history. And on Friday the FTSE 100 index of leading companies listed in the UK closed at a new record high. There's another codicil to this story, which is minimising investor jitters over when does ""very high"" turn into its well-known cousins ""scarily high"" and ""unsustainably high"".  Although markets are hitting record levels, the day-by-day increases are relatively modest. Unlike at the time of the dotcom boom in the late 1990s, when we last saw such a sustained run of market growth, overall volatility (the rate of increase or decrease) is low. That is easing any fears that there is a sudden correction downwards around the corner. Now, it is of course just at the time of heightened calm that we need to be at our most vigilant. And anyone who says ""it is different this time"" should be gently pointed towards the rapid stock market sell-offs of 2015 and early 2016, led by the precipitate collapse of the Chinese markets. And the fact that the dotcom boom and the supposed ""new normal"" of sustained growth in the 2000s ended in crisis and market carnage. Bear markets follow bull markets like seagulls follow trawlers, ready to feast on the overconfident exuberance of investors chasing valuations ever higher. For now, the bulls are in charge and the bears are quiet. And Goldilocks is enjoying her porridge, at just the economically right temperature."
market volatility,The rollercoaster ride of Scotland's first gold mine,2024-09-15,2020-12-02,By Magnus Bennett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-54886709,"After 35 years of highs and lows, production is finally under way at Scotland's first commercial gold mine. The journey has been fraught with difficulty for prospectors - but it looks like their investment may be about to pay off. Extracting gold from Cononish, near Tyndrum, in the west of Scotland was never going to be an easy proposition. The technical challenges - and costs - of accessing the precious metal from halfway up a mountain were a daunting prospect for those willing to try.  But try they did. Early attempts from the mid-1980s saw prospectors come and go, as they struggled - and failed - to raise sufficient cash for what was always going to be a capital-intensive project. Their efforts to attract backers were also undermined by the volatility of the precious metals market, which often saw gold prices slump.    By 2006, the mine had changed hands several times and was up for sale once more. That seemed to spell the end of Cononish and Scotland's hopes of producing its own gold for the first time. However, in 2007, Australian-listed firm Scotgold Resources entered the scene and revived the mine.  It has been a rollercoaster ride ever since. By 2013, Scotgold had obtained planning permission and put a funding plan in place, only for the gold price to collapse, making the project less palatable for potential investors. Costs were also spiralling, as the mine had fallen by that point within the boundaries of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, which meant much more stringent planning and environmental conditions. An earlier application had been turned down due to conservation concerns. The problems were compounded by the fact that Scotgold couldn't raise money from traditional banking sources, given its small-scale nature. That seemed to be that - until Edinburgh-born businessman Nat le Roux arrived on the scene and recapitalised the company in 2014. Since then, he has pumped in millions of pounds of his own money to keep the project alive.  Mr le Roux, who is a former independent director of the London Metal Exchange, said there was ""a certain romance"" about the idea of a Scottish gold mine. ""But when the mine was brought to my attention seven years ago, it seemed to me to have interesting investment potential. ""When I came into it, the problem was one of finance.  ""By world standards, this is a very small mine. At full production, we will be producing about 2,000 ounces of gold a month.  ""At the same time, the amounts of money needed to finance the operation have been quite substantial."" Scotgold anticipates that over the expected nine-year life of the mine it will cost about £25m in capital expenditure and a further £81m in operating costs. That's a whopping sum - but the owners still stand to make millions if all goes according to plan. Gold prices have soared from as low as £700 an ounce in 2015 to more than £1,300 today. Scotgold believes it can recover 175,000 ounces in total from Cononish, worth £236m at current prices.  Repeated feasibility studies have also shown gold deposits at Cononish to be high-grade - and its rarity as ""authentic Scottish gold"" has already attracted a premium from buyers. In 2016, the company auctioned off 10 limited edition 1oz fine Scottish gold rounds formed from initial extractions from the mine.  They raised an average of more than £4,550 per ounce - a premium of 378% over the then spot price of about £950. Scotgold chief executive Richard Gray has steered the company through turbulent times in recent years, but describes the team working on the project as ""inherent optimists"".  ""There are always issues and problems to overcome but we have this belief that we will overcome them and the mine will be very profitable,"" he says. ""I have always been confident in the merits of the project. ""However, without the support of Scotgold's shareholders to stay the course, there was always a risk in the worst case scenario that the company would be forced to sell the asset to someone who would develop it and subsequently reap the rewards."" There are still challenges ahead. These include the impact of Covid-19, which forced Scotgold to delay production of first gold earlier this year. The company is looking to increase its workforce from 25 to 70 as production ramps up, but finding the people to handle the highly technical aspects of gold extraction has also proven a problem.  Mr Gray explains: ""Expertise is needed and you obviously can't find all the people already existing in the area. Some people will have to come from further afield and hopefully settle nearer by."" Scotgold expects to produce 10,000oz of gold next year before ramping up production to an average of 23,500oz a year for the rest of the mine's life. Cononish may yet prove to be the start of a golden era for prospectors in Scotland. Scotgold remains optimistic that it will discover extensions to Cononish, which would lengthen the life of the mine. And it has identified potentially significant gold deposits in other areas of Scotland where it holds option agreements with Crown Estates Scotland. Mr le Roux says: ""It is not like Cononish is one fortuitous discovery in the middle of an otherwise barren landscape. ""My view, and that of others, is that we will end up with a number of gold mines in the west of Scotland, either on the same scale as Cononish or perhaps a little bit bigger, assuming the gold price holds up."""
market volatility,Gove predicts Brexit boost for farmers,2024-09-15,2017-06-22,By Gavin Stamp,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40348845,"Brexit offers an ""historic"" chance to reshape agricultural policy for farmers and consumers, Michael Gove says. The new environment secretary said leaving the EU was a chance to remove ""cumbersome bureaucracy"" and replace ""inefficient subsidies"" with a better form of financial support for farmers. Mr Gove was recalled to the front bench after the general election. He was addressing a meeting in Parliament organised by the National Farmers' Union. The NFU has warned that the ""wrong"" kind of Brexit deal could result in seasonal labour shortages and the government having to pay billions in direct financial assistance to help farmers cope with market and price volatility. Mr Gove said while EU membership had helped improve environmental standards and encouraged rural diversification, it had had a harmful impact in other areas and the UK's exit from the common agricultural policy meant the UK would no longer be ""dictated to"" by Brussels. ""We now have an opportunity to put things right,"" he said. He pledged to listen to and learn from the industry as the Brexit process unfolded and be their ""energetic champion"" in government. While farmers were excellent custodians of the environment, he said, he recognised that the industry had to be financially viable because people were ""running businesses not just providing scenery"". Mr Gove, whose appointment was criticised by some environmental campaigners, also said combating air pollution would be a priority for him in his new role since clean air was a vital resource for the countryside."
market volatility,Delayed A6 road estimated to be £30m over budget,2024-09-15,2023-02-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-64485977,"The A6 between Londonderry and Dungiven is likely to exceed its original £220m budget by £30m, a Department for Infrastructure (DfI) official has said. Work on the road started in 2018 and was due to be completed in the Autumn but has been beset by delays.  The DfI's Kaine Lynch told BBC Radio Foyle he now estimates the project to run £30m over their initial budget.  Earlier on Wednesday, he said work on the road will likely be finished ""by the end of April"". Mr Lynch said that estimated date is ""subject to any unforeseen circumstances"". The 15-mile (24km) stretch is part of the A6 road that links Derry and Belfast. It was due to open last Autumn but there has been concerns over continued delays to the scheme. The new stretch of road mostly runs parallel to the existing road and includes of a bypass of Dungiven. ""When we originally started the project we estimated it would cost around £220m, we know that it is likely to be in the region of £250m today,"" Mr Lynch told BBC Radio Foyle's News at One.  ""But there are a number of outstanding disputes and unagreed items with the contractor which would need to be resolved before we could get a final figure. ""In a construction project of this nature there is inevitably things that will arise that the contractor would not have reasonably foreseen or accounted for in the price. ""There are a large a number of minor issues that are yet to be resolved, but that is normal on a project of this scale so my best estimate is now around £30m extra."" The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday morning, Mr Lynch said he understood the concerns of ""local people and the travelling public"" about delays to the project.  ""They have waited a long time for the upgrade and understandably want to know when it will open,"" he said.   He said ""the end of April"" was the target the DfI was now working towards to open the road to the public. "
market volatility,Commodities' volatility continues,2024-09-15,2011-05-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13305462,"This video can not be played Watch: Harold Wheeldon says 'oil reflects slight easing of tension in Middle East' Commodity prices have seen large swings, falling sharply at first before fully recovering. Brent crude oil initially fell 5.8% to $105.15 a barrel, adding to an 8.6% drop on Thursday, before recovering to above $110 by mid-afternoon. The rebound in the price of major raw materials was given a boost by strong US jobs data, which also pushed European stock markets up by nearly 1%. The volatility comes a day after one of the biggest market sell-offs in years. The sell-off affected most types of commodity. Industrial metals saw further sharp swings on Friday. Copper futures fell a further 1.75%, following a 6% slide a day earlier, before recovering. Meanwhile, the price of US sweet, light crude oil fell a further 5.5% on Friday morning to $94.63 a barrel, but then recovered to around $98, where it remained steady until late into the evening.  Prices of precious metals - such as gold and silver - held steady during the morning, despite having previously followed other commodities sharply lower during Thursday's market rout. However, silver prices suffered another wobble, briefly down 5%. The price of silver has fallen more than 30% since it hit an all-time high last week. Stock markets also proved resilient. After falling slightly at the start of trade, European stock markets recovered and pushed higher, rising further when figures showed that more jobs than expected had been created in the US in April. Thursday's commodity price rout was prompted by disappointing data on US benefit claims and German industrial orders. The dollar also remained stable against other currencies on Friday, in contrast with Thursday, when a sharp rise in the greenback contributed towards the fall in commodity prices, which are measured in dollars. Analysts warn the volatility in the markets could remain. ""When you have this kind of damage, it will take several weeks, or maybe several months... for confidence to be rebuilt,"" said Dennis Gartman, author of a markets guide. ""It's not the end of the commodities cycle, not even close. You still have to call this a correction. It's a sizable one and scared the heck out of everybody."" However, other analysts suggest that it could mark the beginning of a more sustained fall. Emma Pinnock, energy analyst at Inenco, sees the oil price dropping back below $100 a barrel within days if not sooner, as markets realign supply and demand. ""Ultimately the price increases that we saw of almost 12% since the beginning of 2011, due to instability in the Middle East, the Japanese earthquake and the nuclear crisis, were not sustainable,"" she said. ""The poor economic data released from the US and Europe has confirmed fears that the recent high commodity prices could affect global demand."""
market volatility,Obituary: Robert Hardy,2024-09-15,2017-08-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-13783739,"With his instantly recognisable voice and British bulldog manner, Robert Hardy enjoyed a distinguished acting career which spanned eight decades. By the time he endeared himself to television audiences in the BBC's All Creatures Great and Small, he had already carved out a reputation as one of Britain's most versatile actors. While his earlier career gave him a firm grounding in the theatre his best known roles were in front of the camera - particularly in television, a medium he obviously enjoyed.  He became something of a specialist in the role of Sir Winston Churchill, playing the great man on half a dozen occasions as well as being in demand to reproduce the wartime leader's voice. Timothy Sydney Robert Hardy was born in Cheltenham on 29 October 1925. The youngest of a large family, he was a self-professed ""odd child"". His father was the headmaster of Cheltenham College and Hardy himself went to Rugby School before going up to Magdalen College, Oxford to read English. It was while at Oxford that he struck up an enduring friendship with a fellow student, Richard Burton and both men found their studies interrupted when they were called up and posted to an RAF station in Norfolk. Robert Hardy as Henry V in a 1960 BBC production Unlike Burton, Hardy returned to Oxford after his war service and gained a BA (Hons) in English as well as having enjoyed the opportunity to study under two of Oxford's most eminent names, JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis. He had always been fascinated by Hollywood films and had determined to become an actor, joining the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1949.  He was once asked what was needed to be successful in such a competitive profession. ""A certain amount of talent, luck, a spine of steel, a ruthlessness of mind that does not jib at murder and patience,"" he replied. He was much in demand as a stage actor during the 1950s mainly playing Shakespearean roles, although he did make his first foray into cinema in 1958 playing a naval officer in the Glenn Ford film Torpedo Run.  He turned down Sir Peter Hall's offer of a contract with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960, complaining that it was for middle-of-the-roadish parts. ""I stormed at him one day and I behaved extremely badly,"" he said. He was reunited with his friend Richard Burton in the 1965 film, The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, where he played the role of Dick Carlton.  A year later he was given his first continuing role as the ruthless businessman Alex Stewart in the BBC production, The Troubleshooters, a drama based on a fictitious oil company called Mogul.  In 1978, Hardy took the part of the irascible but good-natured Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small, the long-running BBC series based on James Herriot's best-selling books. As the senior vet of the small Yorkshire Dales practice, Robert Hardy became one of the best-known faces on British television. Robert Hardy, Carol Drinkwater and Christopher Timothy in All Creatures Great and Small Full of animals, nostalgia and rural scenery, the show became a massive hit, attracting audiences of up to 20 million.  The original run ended in 1978 but the series was revived 10 years later after the BBC obtained permission to write new storylines, having exhausted the original James Herriot books. But the new scripts failed to meet with Hardy's approval and he rewrote large parts of his dialogue. ""All they did was make Siegfried explode and be bad-tempered. I kept changing things."" Hardy cornered the market in the role of blustering aristocrat, often dressed in tweed.  He appeared in The Far Pavilions, The Cleopatras, Bramwell and Middlemarch, and on the big screen in The Shooting Party and Sense and Sensibility. He explained: ""When you've lived a goodish span as I have, it's a case of roaming round the attic and borrowing a few characters."" Despite this range, Robert Hardy's own volatility and ability to express his wrath were channelled most successfully into his many portrayals of Britain's most revered premier.  He played Winston Churchill many times, even once in French on stage in Paris, but most memorably in the 1981 mini-series The Wilderness Years.  Hardy said himself of his complete immersion into the character, ""My family complained loudly about my behaviour while I was playing him.""  Hardy played Sir Toby Belch in the BBC's Twelfth Night He was married twice and had three children. Awarded a CBE in 1981 for his services to acting, Hardy was also a keen student of military history and supported the project to raise the Mary Rose.  In 1995, he gave up his long-time home in Oxfordshire, to become laird of a Scottish mansion, a 13th Century miniature castle situated near Edinburgh, complete with a walled garden and 50-foot tower.  The actor had visited the place as a child and sworn always to return, following in the footsteps of a previous visitor, Sir Walter Scott, one of Hardy's personal heroes.   In later years he suffered from cancer of the colon, but recovered to resume as busy a career as ever, including film work.  Although he failed to make the lasting impact on Hollywood enjoyed by some British actors, his face became known the world over when he appeared as the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, in several of the Harry Potter films.  He was dropped from the role after the studio balked at paying a £1 million life insurance premium which was demanded because of his advancing age. Off screen he became something of an authority on the English longbow, his interest having been stimulated when, as a child, he found two of the weapons in the family attic .  He wrote two books on the history of the weapon as well as presenting a BBC documentary on the subject.  Hardy's on-screen temper was matched by a famously short fuse away from the camera and he admitted that, as an actor, he belonged to a set of ""difficult people"". He once reflected: ""The ego may be essential for survival in the wilderness of acting, but it's something that requires a great deal of control if you're going to make a success of life.""

market volatility,G20 fail to agree economy targets,2024-09-15,2011-02-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12499214,"The role of the yuan, and China's accumulation of US dollars, lies at the heart of the impasse Negotiators have failed to agree targets to reduce global economic imbalances on the first day of the two-day G20 meeting in Paris. The countries want to better coordinate economic policies to avoid a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis. Most back a list of five targets, but China is said to oppose exchange rate and currency reserve criteria. Beijing has been accused of buying up dollars in order to keep the yuan cheap and gain an unfair trade advantage. Some economists say that China and other ""mercantilist"" countries contributed to the 2008 financial crisis by accumulating excessive foreign currency reserves, especially US dollars. By buying up dollars, these countries hold down the value of their own currencies, making them more competitive and helping them to run surpluses. And by investing this money in US government debt, they are accused of having helped to make borrowing costs in the US too cheap during the last decade, helping to fuel the housing bubble. ""We think it is not appropriate to use real effective exchange rates and reserves,"" said Chinese finance minister Xie Xuren, speaking to his counterparts from Brazil, Russia and China. ""Emerging markets, to deal with financial crises and economic shocks, need to set up a certain amount of reserves,"" he said. Many Asian countries began building up their reserves in the wake of a crisis in 1997 that saw many of them forced to painfully devalue their currency. Finance ministers will meet on Saturday to try to hammer out a compromise. One idea being floated is that China could focus on its trade surplus instead of its current account surplus. This would mean the country could ignore the effect of all the income it earns from the multi-trillion dollars-worth of US government bonds and other foreign financial assets it owns. However, Germany and Canada are opposed to this idea. Meanwhile, the Canadian and Brazilian governments have backed the idea of including the yuan in the IMF's ""special drawing rights"" (SDRs), as a step towards making the Chinese currency into a reserve currency. What to do about the rising price of basic goods like food is likely to preoccupy the G20 meeting Most countries agree that central banks have become too reliant on buying up just dollars, and many favour a bigger role for SDRs, which comprise a broader bundle of major currencies. However, Beijing does not allow foreigners to freely buy yuan in the currency markets. And China's trade surpluses mean that other countries find it impossible to accumulate the currency in return for the exports they sell to China. Meanwhile, the G20 is being urged to tackle the issue of price inflation affecting basic goods. Ahead of the meeting, the International Monetary Fund warned food price rises have increased economic imbalances. And earlier this week, the World Bank said food prices were at ""dangerous levels"", saying that forty-four million people have been pushed into poverty since last June. John Lipsky, first deputy managing director of the IMF, told the BBC that the G20 needed to work to remedy the instability: ""There is great concern over the obvious high volatility of basic commodity prices especially food."" This video can not be played G20 meeting urged to curb prices French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is currently the head of the G20, has argued that commodity speculators should be reined in in order to reduce food price spikes and volatility.  Meanwhile, more than 100 European and international organisations led by  the World Development Movement (WDM) have signed a statement warning the G20 of what they see as the dangers of unchecked speculation. Julian Oram of the WDM said: ""By taking action now to curb excessive speculation on food, G20 leaders could save lives, reduce chronic hunger and prevent civil and political unrest."" Some analysts have pointed to the difference between speculation, which can provide up-front money to a farmer to plant new crops, for example, and market manipulation, which is designed purely as a play on prices. Mr Lipsky said the market for food and other basic commodities was heavily burdened by controls and subsidies: ""I think it would be very useful for the G20 to look at these markets in much better detail and see if they can be improved to better serve the global community and not be a source of instability and worry.""

market volatility,Why Nigeria is a global leader in Bitcoin trade,2024-09-15,2021-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56169917,"More cryptocurrency trading goes on in Nigeria than almost anywhere else in the world, reflecting a loss of faith in more traditional forms of investment, as Ijeoma Ndukwe reports. Tola Fadugbagbe recalls moving to Lagos from his small south-western town 10 years ago with dreams of brighter prospects.  Instead, the 34-year-old ended up in a series of odd jobs earning the minimum wage to survive - a typical story for many young Nigerians who are just trying to get by. It was not until 2016 that online adverts for Bitcoin piqued his interest and he began his cryptocurrency journey. ""I started intensive research,"" Mr Fadugbagbe told the BBC.  ""I was spending hours every day watching videos on YouTube and reading articles about Bitcoin. I didn't have much money so I started with $100 to $200.""  It was a decision that transformed his life.  At the time that we spoke, Mr Fadugbagbe, who now trades full time and teaches budding investors, said he had cryptocurrency worth more than $200,000 (£140,000) in his possession.  ""I'll soon be moving into my own house, which I'm building. I have a farm - a very big one - courtesy of cryptocurrency,"" he laughs gleefully, unencumbered by concerns that he could be inflating an investment bubble that will one day burst. ""No Nigerian comes to cryptocurrency and wants to look back. It's a big opportunity."" Success stories like Mr Fadugbagbe's have attracted millions of Nigerians to digital currencies such as Bitcoin.  A 2020 online survey by data platform Statista found that 32% of those Nigerians who took part used cryptocurrencies - the highest proportion of any country in the world.  Estimates show that of the top 10 countries for trading volumes, Nigeria ranked third place after the US and Russia in 2020, generating more than $400m worth of transactions. Although Nigeria has eased out of its second recession in less than five years, the challenging economic climate remains, making alternative sources of income and alternative currencies attractive. The Central Bank of Nigeria devalued the currency, the naira, by 24% last year. There are fears of a further fall in value by as much as 10% this year. Meanwhile prices continue to rise, with food inflation climbing to its highest point since July 2008. When Michael Ugwu, the founder of a media company in Lagos, sold land he owned in 2018, he realised he needed to explore new investment opportunities. Although his naira earnings had gone up, he was worse of in US dollar terms because of the devaluation. ""I'd made naira but lost US dollars. That's when I realised we're hustling backwards. It was then that I started to look into Bitcoin.""  The move to invest in digital currencies has paid off.  ""On some of my currencies I've made 50 times what I invested. On Bitcoin it's easily grown 10 times in the last year,"" he says. The former banker sees cryptocurrency as an evolution of finance, describing it as ""finance 2.0"".  Despite the currency's volatility, Mr Ugwu sees it as a valuable tool to ""hedge"" or reduce the risk of living in what he describes as a high-risk environment.  His wife Onyeka started to invest when faced with high commission charges to transfer cash between her Nigerian and British accounts. ""For me it's a banking system,"" she says.  ""It wasn't about making money. It was about how [to] have a better banking experience. Look at it as saving your money in a currency that can keep the value of the money."" Despite its appeal, economists around the world warn that Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are high-risk investments.  There are legitimate concerns that Bitcoin's soaring value is a speculative bet that will one day leave many in ruins. An international banker based in Nigeria, who asked to remain anonymous, says it is a financial product that carries significant potential regulatory risk.  He says that ""governments and central banks have not decided whether they can, or should, regulate it"". ""On a technical level I'm not 100% sure that the security that it uses is entirely foolproof. I think there are still some technical uncertainties,"" he adds. In an effort to regulate the market, Nigeria's central bank banned banks from facilitating cryptocurrency-related transactions in 2017, but the ban remained largely unenforced.  However, this year the institution doubled down on its stance.  In a statement released on 7 February it cited the need to protect the general public and safeguard the country from potential threats posed by ""unknown and unregulated entities"" that are ""well-suited for conducting many illegal activities"". Since then, many Nigerians have reported that their bank accounts have been frozen due to cryptocurrency-related activity.  Mr Fadugbagbe's bank manager called to advise him that his account would be closed, giving him a day to transfer his funds.  However, not everyone has been so fortunate.  One source says his bank account was frozen two weeks ago with tens of thousands of naira in it.  The software engineer says the bank would not disclose the reason for its actions.  He suspects he was targeted for running a cryptocurrency remittance business.  Furthermore, the BBC was shown a customer's bank correspondence, which contains the warning: ""We strongly advise that you do not use your account for cryptocurrency-related activities so you don't get into trouble with the law"".  However many investors with the possibility say they will continue to trade using their overseas bank accounts.  They say they can easily revert to peer-to-peer transactions. This means that rather than transferring funds between a financial institution and a cryptocurrency online trading platform, investors transfer funds directly to each other or through a middle person as they buy and sell.  This is the method the cryptocurrency community used before the development of the virtual currency marketplace ecosystem in Nigeria. Mr Ugwu has also heard many in the business of cryptocurrency talk of relocating to potentially more hospitable environments such as Ghana, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. The concerns of the authorities when it comes to cryptocurrencies being used for illegal purposes are legitimate but some argue that they are being too heavy handed. A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Kingsley Moghalu, believes that the country should engage and manage the risks ""rather than just shutting it off completely - especially to the extent that it provides livelihoods for many people in a depressed economy"".  There are also fears that cryptocurrency could become a missed opportunity, according to Gbite Oduneye who heads EGM Group, a Lagos-based brokerage firm.  ""Nigeria is the third largest place for cryptocurrency trade in terms of volume,"" he explains. ""If you don't take advantage, someone else will. Build an ecosystem round it. Put in rules and regulations."" Nigerians also see cryptocurrencies as a way to get around foreign currency restrictions. ""There are a lot of restrictions on what we can and cannot do with our foreign exchange,"" Nena Nwachukwu from popular trading platform Paxful explains.  ""Nigerians find it easier to use [cryptocurrency] as an investment tool."" She saw awareness of their service grow in October 2020 during the #EndSars protests against police brutality.  Attempts to crack down on the organisers by freezing their bank accounts led to the increased use of digital currencies, which saw Bitcoin trend on Twitter.  Ms Nwachukwu says this resulted in a wave of new sign ups and an increase in transactions.  At the heart of the rise of Bitcoin is a distrust of centralised financial systems and top-down economic control, investors say.  Many express their frustrations with government policy and the decline of the Nigerian economy.  None more so than Mr Fadugbagbe, who spent years struggling to scrape by as what he describes as a ""minimum-wage slave"".  ""I don't do shares and government bonds"", he says. ""Those are scams. I trust cryptocurrency more."" Clarification 1 March 2021: This article has been amended to make it clear that the Statista survey of Nigerians was carried out online, and so does not reflect the whole population."
market volatility,Bernanke signals economic action,2024-09-15,2010-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11551993,"This video can not be played Ben Bernanke says there is a ""case for further action"" US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has opened the way to a new round of quantitative easing. ""There would appear, all else being equal, to be a case for further action,"" he said, in a speech to the Boston regional federal reserve. The US central bank is expected to back a move to buy up US government bonds in order to lower borrowing costs at its next meeting on 3 November. Mr Bernanke said unemployment and low inflation lay behind his view. However, some colleagues at the Fed have expressed much more hawkish views, and Mr Bernanke was careful not to pre-empt the decision of the rate-setting committee due next month. In his speech, external, he did not give any indication of the size or timing of any new quantitative easing, but did confirm it was likely to target US government bonds. Previously the Fed has bought up billions of dollars of US mortgage debts. Mr Bernanke warned that prolonged high employment would put recovery at risk, while the inflation rate has been trending downwards. The Fed has a dual mandate to maintain price stability and full employment. He played down a view expressed by some of his colleagues that high unemployment was ""structural"" in nature - for example because US workers do not have relevant skills for available jobs - and therefore something the Fed could not help. Instead he blamed the continuing high level of joblessness on the sharp contraction in demand in the economy - something that further monetary easing should ameliorate. He also raised concern that the inflation rate was falling below what he considered consistent with the Fed's mandate. He said some measures suggested the underlying inflation rate - which ignores short-term price volatility - may have fallen as low as 0.5% in recent months. Most analysts believe the Fed targets a rate of 2%. The speech contained no major surprises for markets, as it largely repeated views expressed in the minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting. The dollar dropped about 0.3% against most major currencies following the speech's release, before bouncing back strongly when stronger-than-expected retail sales were announced 15 minutes later. Against the yen, it briefly hit a new 15-year low of 80.89, only 1.5% above its all-time low of 79.7 yen. Quantitative easing is partly aimed at weakening the dollar's value, by increasing the amount of dollar cash in circulation. A weaker dollar helps the Fed achieve its dual mandate, by making US exporters more competitive - stimulating job creation - and by increasing inflation through higher import prices. The dollar has lost 15% of its value against the euro since early June, on growing speculation that a slowdown in the US economy in the second half of the year would force the Fed to ease monetary conditions further.

market volatility,Shares of India's 'family silverware' go on sale,2024-09-15,2022-05-04,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61296184,"Shares in the Indian state-run insurance giant Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) went on sale this week in a $2.75bn (£2.18bn) initial public offering, witnessing strong demand from investors. The government is offering a 3.5% stake in what will be India's largest share sale, despite both the size and valuation of the issue being slashed significantly to reflect current market conditions. The issue was fully subscribed on Thursday, a day after it opened for sale to retail investors, employees and policy holders. The date for share listing is 17 May, the government's Department of Investment and Public Asset Management said. Bids for anchor investors opened on 2 May but share sale for the public opened on 4 May and would close on 9 May. General investors can buy equity shares at a price band set at $11.75-12.36 (£9.38-9.87) per share. The company's policyholders, employees as well as small mom and pop investors will be entitled to an additional discount of up to 60 rupees, according to papers filed by the company with India's securities watchdog.Broking firm Zerodha expects at least 8-12 million additional online trading accounts to be opened by investors keen to apply for the IPO, a 10-15% bump up from the 80 million accounts currently in operation. LIC is nearly as old as independent India. Formed by nationalising and merging 245 private insurance companies, it started issuing policies in 1956, holding a monopoly on India's insurance sector until the turn of the millennium.   More than two decades after private competition was allowed, LIC continues to hold a leadership position, with 66% market share as of 2021.   Its sheer size makes the insurance behemoth a systemically important company for India.    At over $500bn, its asset base is bigger than the GDP of several countries. And with nearly 280 million policies in force, it manages four times more policies than the entire population of the UK.   It is also India's largest asset manager, with massive investments in state and central securities as well as the stock market.   According to the ratings agency CRISIL, LIC's equity investments in listed companies represented 4% of the total market capitalisation of the National Stock Exchange. It has also been the default financier of the government in trying times, bailing out flailing state-run companies.   LIC also owns a sprawling portfolio of real estate across India.   With 1.3 million distributors selling policies across pretty much every nook and corner in India, the ubiquitous ""LIC agent"" has held a unique place in independent India's public consciousness.   Srinivasalu Naidu, a septuagenarian who has sold policies door to door for the past 30 years, told the BBC he was known in his heyday as ""LIC Naidu"", a much revered figure in his village in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.    Agents like him have been critical to the company's growth and mission to build trust and create a savings culture across the remote corners of the country.   ""People didn't buy policies from me just as insurance, they did it as an investment. For their kids' education or wedding. They trusted their life savings with me,"" said Naidu.   Private banking giant UBS estimates 10 out of every 100 rupees saved by Indian households go into LIC, a much larger amount than even the deposits attracted by India's largest bank, the State Bank of India.   Given LIC's social relevance and scaled-down valuation, India's opposition politicians have accused the government of selling ""family silverware"" and prioritising shareholders over politicians.  According to analysts, even at the upper price band, LIC's issue has been valued far lower by the government than its three listed private peers - HDFC Life Insurance Co., SBI Life Insurance Co. and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co.   ""It is not justified at all. You should also involve the opposition (in deliberations), when you are disinvesting something like the LIC which is a social security net,"" Dr Shama Mohamed, a spokesperson of the Congress party, told the BBC.   Last month, PM Narendra Modi's government decided to defer the mega IPO amid global stock market volatility due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It had initially planned to raise about $8b by selling 5% of LIC to fund its widening fiscal deficit - the gap between earnings and expenditure.   Amid surging fuel costs and lower growth projections, the pruned fundraising target is expected to put additional pressure on New Delhi's already stretched finances.  But analysts say the size and price are appropriate given the current environment, with foreign investors pulling out nearly $20bn from Indian equities since October 2021. And the government is confident that LIC's dominant leadership position and fair valuation will attract significant investor interest.    ""Even if we have a bit of a constrained environment, we can still pull it off because that's the kind of optimum demand scenario which exists,"" Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary at the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, told journalists in Mumbai last week.   In the long run, a stock market listing is expected to improve how the firm is run and bring in more transparency.  But at a time when its competitors have all gone digital, LIC's overt dependence on physical distributors has been flagged as a cause of concern by analysts, who believe it will continue losing market share in the years ahead.   ""On the margin front, it will be kind of hard for LIC to compete if it sticks to the distributor model. They will have to re-innovate the company and become relevant for what the insurance market will be tomorrow,"" says Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha.   According to economic commentator Vivek Kaul, LIC pays agents twice as much in commissions in the first year, compared to private insurers, which is not sustainable in the longer run.   Covid-19 has also had an impact on the company. Its growth in new business premiums declined significantly as lockdowns disrupted operations, reiterating the need for LIC to significantly leverage technology to drive operating efficiency.   But analysts expect India's young population and massive under-penetration of life insurance to give LIC a long runway for expansion.   According to analysis from the broking firm Anand Rathi, India's protection gap - or the difference between the insurance required and actually available - was 83% or US$16.5 trillion in 2019, the highest in Asia-Pacific, ""thereby presenting a huge potential for growth""."
market volatility,What is the US Federal Reserve doing?,2024-09-15,2017-09-20,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41320675,"The US Federal Reserve has decided to start running down the stock of financial assets it bought in its quantitative easing scheme. Quantitative easing was a policy that the Fed, and other central banks, used to prevent the recession that followed the financial crisis from becoming an even deeper downturn.  It involved buying financial assets with money newly created by the central bank. In the US the assets were bonds or debts issued by the Federal government and by official agencies that support lending to home buyers. One aim of the policy was to reduce the interest rates paid by businesses and households borrowing money.  Normally central banks try to do that by using their own interest rate policies, which in the case of the Fed means a target it sets for overnight borrowing between commercial banks, known as the Federal Funds Rate. But when that official rate got to almost zero, as it did in December 2008, the Fed's policy makers thought that it couldn't, or shouldn't go any lower.  The Fed's own research suggests that its QE policy has helped reduce long term interest rates. The consequence of all that QE is that the Fed now holds about four and a half trillion dollars of assets. Before it started the programme the figure was less than a quarter of that amount.  Assessments of the impact of QE vary, but many economists take the view that it has helped the US economy.  Many also fear it has created a new danger of financial market instability.  Share and bond prices are high. Some argue that there is a bubble that could burst and trigger a new financial crisis.  The Fed's asset purchases mean there has been more demand for the assets it is buying which tends to push the prices up. In addition, the sellers of those assets need to do something with the money they receive. They may repay debt, but in many cases they buy other assets, often assets with more risk of losing money - such as shares or assets in emerging economies. That in turn tends to push their prices up.  That is what lies behind the concerns about possible financial instability.  All the major developed world central banks, apart from Canada's, have used quantitative easing and several are still actively buying financial assets. In the US however, the Fed stopped in 2014.  But that doesn't mean that it stopped buying assets at the time.   Bonds are debts which (mostly) have a repayment or maturity date when the holder receives the face value of the bond from the borrower or issuer of the bond.  The debt is in effect repaid to whoever owns the bond on the date it matures. In the case of US government bond, it's the Treasury that would repay the central bank.  So far, the Fed has used the proceeds of these repayments to buy more bonds in the financial markets keeping its holdings roughly constant.  Now it is going to reduce the amount that it 'reinvests' in that way. So over time, as more bonds mature its holdings of them will decline.  It also means that over time the extra money it created in the first place to buy the bonds will decline.  As an aside it's worth emphasising that the newly created money is not something that can be spent on goods and services. It is money called reserves, which is held in accounts owned by commercial banks at the central bank.  It's used for transactions between banks and is an important part of the financial and monetary system. But other types of business and households can't use this type of money. Having said that, adding to the total amount of reserves can lead to an increase in money held by the public but it is an indirect effect.  Running down the Fed's holdings of assets will also mean that the amount of reserves held by the banks will decline too.  As with interest rate increases the Fed's approach is cautious. There is no hurry to get things back to what might be considered normal. The decline in its bond holdings in the first month will be no more than ten billion dollars, rising gradually over the course of the following year.  We haven't been told what the ultimate level will be. But the Fed has said that the amount of reserves held by the banks when this process is complete is likely to be higher than before the crisis. All the time there is a degree of wariness among central bankers in the US and other developed economies that they could set back the recovery if they were to raise interest rates or change their QE policies too quickly.  There was a warning in 2013 with an episode that came to be known as the ""taper tantrum"". That was a time when the Fed's QE bond purchases were in full swing. The then Chair of the Fed, Ben Bernanke suggested that it might start to slow down the purchases - or taper its QE. That led to significant volatility in financial markets.  It most likely didn't too much lasting economic damage, but it has probably reinforced the cautious instincts of the current Fed Chair Janet Yellen. She certainly doesn't want to see another tantrum. She has said she wants the Fed's unwinding of its QE to be like ""watching paint dry"". "
market volatility,University admissions could see emergency controls,2024-09-15,2020-03-29,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52086932,"Universities in England could face fixed limits on how many students they each recruit, in a bid to create more stability and reduce financial threats. There are concerns that the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus could leave some universities with too few applicants to stay financially viable. It is understood that emergency controls are being considered to stop a free-for-all in student recruitment. But Universities UK said any ""stability measures"" had not yet been decided. ""Financial support from government for universities is necessary,"" said the university group's chief executive Alistair Jarvis. But he said any response such as controls on student numbers would need ""more detailed consideration"" and so far had not been approved by Universities UK. ""There would need to be a clear case of the benefits, any proposal would have to be sector-led not imposed, strictly time-limited and carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences,"" he said. A government source described the idea as ""speculation"". But the vice chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, Sir Chris Husbands, said student number controls were necessary during the current crisis ""to ensure that institutions have a viable first-year-student population"". Sir Chris, in a paper for the Higher Education Policy Institute, says ""radical action is needed on university admissions for the foreseeable future. This means suspending the market in admissions"". The aim would be to encourage more stability in an admissions round caught up in the coronavirus outbreak, which has closed schools and universities and cancelled exams. More students than usual might defer entry and take a gap year - with universities uncertain about whether they will be able to re-open campuses for the autumn. Universities are also expecting a fall in overseas student numbers - making funding from home students even more important. Last week the higher education watchdog intervened to stop universities making unconditional offers, after fears that some were recruiting large numbers of students by promising places regardless of their grades. With A-level exams scrapped and grades set to be based on teachers' assessments, the Office for Students and the universities minister Michelle Donelan were concerned that anxious students might switch to the promise of an unconditional offer. But there were also concerns that the volatility around this year's applications could leave some universities with such a shortage of students that it would threaten their financial stability. Universities are understood to remain divided over a response. Introducing student number controls would mean individual universities would not be allowed to expand. This would ensure that the share of students between universities stayed similar to the current levels, providing them with more security over tuition fee income. But student number controls would also mean a limit on student choice - so that popular universities would not be able to add extra places. It will also raise questions about what will happen if universities have offered more places than they will be allowed to provide. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: ""The crisis is fast becoming the catalyst for the return of student number caps."" He warned that it might bring short-term stability, but at the expense of stopping the expansion of university places and limiting the choices of individual students. A Department for Education spokeswoman said the department would ""continue working closely with the sector to manage the impact of coronavirus""."
market volatility,Isle of Man electricity prices set to rise,2024-09-15,2023-03-06,By Ashlea Tracey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-64836764,"Electricity bills on the Isle of Man are set to rise by 51% on average, Manx Utilities (MU) has announced. The increase will by applied in two stages, in April and in July, following a six-month price freeze. It means an average customer's annual bill could go up by more than £380. MU chairman, Tim Johnston MHK, said the firm could no longer shield customers from price hikes due to volatility in the wholesale gas market. ""We are very conscious of the impact that this will have on our customers and the decision... is not one the Manx Utilities board has made lightly,"" he added. MU said it had been absorbing price changes by using £25m of reserves and saving £40m by forward purchasing gas, which is used to produce most of the island's electricity. But the state-owned energy provider said it was no longer sustainable to do so with a deficit of about £50m anticipated for the next financial year. The increase will mean that a customer who lives in an two or three bedroom house, and does not use electricity to heat their home, will see their annual bill rise by more than £380. The energy provider explained this type of household could expect an increase from £751 to £942 from April, and then to £1,133 from July.  Politicians backed plans to freeze tariffs for the winter months in September and provide a £26m loan to MU, to be taken from treasury reserves. Mr Johnston said MU had not used the loan as temporarily reducing tariffs would mean higher tariffs in the future, and a higher overall cost for customers. ""The aim has been to minimise the cost to our customers whilst ensuring Manx Utilities can continue to meet its financial obligations,"" he added.

market volatility,Trump calls for end to quarterly reporting,2024-09-15,2018-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45226228,"Donald Trump has called for US companies to issue financial reports just twice a year rather than four times. The US President said he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider altering rules requiring firms to report every quarter. The move would improve ""flexibility and save money"", Mr Trump said. Some analysts have criticised the idea, which they say would ""keep investors in the dark for longer"". Mr Trump tweeted: ""In speaking with some of the world's top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the US. 'Stop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system,' said one"", he tweeted. President Trump said he had ""asked the SEC to study"" such a move. Analysts said the idea of having companies report less frequently was not new, with some suggesting it could make markets less transparent and more volatile when financial data is released after such a long period. ""If you reduce transparency, including the frequency of reporting, it is thus likely to increase uncertainty, which is the enemy of investors,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Sterling Capital Management. Stan Shipley at Evercore ISI said: ""[If] you give investors less information on what's going on, there's a risk of injecting volatility in your stock price because investors are not guided the right way.  ""You're more likely to surprise investors when you're reporting just twice a year instead of quarterly.""  However, other analysts said reducing the frequency of financial reporting to twice a year could potentially reduce ""short-termism"" in listed companies' strategies. ""The difficulty in making better long-term decisions away from a quarterly reporting cycle certainly stands out as being beneficial,"" said Art Hogan at investment bank B. Riley FBR. Randy Frederick at Charles Schwab argued that such a major change for both companies and traders would be ""like trying to turn around the Queen Mary in a swimming pool"". ""This is not something he can change with an executive order,"" he added. The SEC requires listed US companies to issue quarterly and annual financial reports to keep investors informed about their financial position.  The Trump administration wants to cut red tape that it says is responsible for a 50% drop in companies coming to market over the past two decades, including relaxing some of the disclosure and compliance requirements for listed companies and those looking to go public.  In a report published by the US Treasury last year, the administration outlined policies it hoped would revitalise listings - but did not go as far as suggesting quarterly reporting requirements be scrapped. The SEC was not immediately available for comment."
market volatility,Building material costs affect public projects,2024-09-15,2021-08-03,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58070738,"Northern Ireland construction companies facing big rises in the cost of building materials could be allowed to increase the prices of previously agreed public sector contracts. Building firms are dealing with surging global prices for products like timber. The Stormont Executive has agreed guidance for government departments dealing with contractors. It includes the possibility of agreeing cost increases or later completion dates.  Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the impact of the pandemic on supply chains has ""had a huge impact on the availability of construction materials with global demand, product shortages and delivery delays leading to market volatility and increased prices"". ""Government contractors are experiencing escalating costs and delays in getting materials which they could not have foreseen when they tendered for government work."" The executive has agreed a ""procurement advisory note"".  It says that where a contractor can ""provide compelling evidence on an open book basis"" that it has experienced a significant delay in the supply of a product that impacts on a completion date then the department and contractor should work together ""in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation"" to identify alternative materials or agree a change to the completion date. On prices, it says it is reasonable to expect contractors to absorb price fluctuations ""within moderate tolerances"".  However it acknowledges that in the current environment contractors may be able to show they are facing cost increases that are higher than that ""which a diligent contractor could reasonably have anticipated"".  In that situation the department should consider adjusting the price of the job. The note emphasises that firms will have to provide ""full transparency"" on how they originally priced a job and how material costs have changed. Mr Murphy said: ""I am pleased the executive has agreed my proposals to make provision to manage delays in supplies and to include mechanisms in existing and new contracts to make allowances for inflationary prices."" The move has been welcomed by the construction industry which has been warning that some firms were facing difficulties in completing contracts at previously agreed prices. Mark Spence, managing director of the Construction Employers Federation, said: ""We welcome this vital lifeline for local contractors who for many months have been shouldering the escalating burden of unforeseen global price increases and material shortages whilst ensuring public works continue to be delivered."" The measures will be reviewed at the end of September."
market volatility,House of Fraser slumps to £44m loss,2024-09-15,2018-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44068513,"Department store group House of Fraser lost almost £44m in 2017 as sales fell.  The department store's potential new Chinese owner, C.Banner, said the loss of £43.9m reversed a pre-tax profit of £1.5m for the previous year, while sales fell 6.3% to £787.8m.  It blamed Brexit, terror attacks and online for damaging the performance of the group, which owns 59 UK stores.      The Chinese group has agreed to take a 51% stake in House of Fraser if the chain pushes through a turnaround plan.  The extent of the chain's financial problems were revealed in a document submitted by C.Banner to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, announcing its proposal to acquire the stake in House of Fraser.  It pointed out that the annual loss figure for the House of Fraser group included the start-up and operating costs of House of Fraser China, but excluded the licence fee payable from the Chinese business to House of Fraser UK for the use of the name in that market. Separate figures for the UK business have yet to be reported.  However, the document said: ""The Brexit referendum and the UK's resultant decision to leave the European Union and the terrorist attack in London, combined with a rapidly evolving retail market, produced a period of uncertainty and volatility that resulted in a difficult trading environment for the whole retail industry in the UK.""   However, C.Banner said House of Fraser would become ""more stable"" after completing its restructuring plan and ""take advantage of its well-known brand to capture growth potential"". Earlier this month, C.Banner said it would take a controlling stake in the retailer from another Chinese firm, Nanjing Cenbest, but only if House of Fraser agreed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with its creditors.  The chain expects to make a formal CVA proposal next month, with a full restructuring in place by early 2019. Store closures are planned and the chain wants to renegotiate rents on others.  A CVA is designed to help a struggling company to pay back a proportion of its debts over time. It involves a strict repayment scheme overseen by an insolvency practitioner and must be approved by at least three quarters of the firm's creditors. "
market volatility,SSE Airtricity natural gas prices to rise by 39%,2024-09-15,2022-03-04,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60620138,"SSE Airtricity will increase its natural gas prices for households and businesses by 39% from April.  It will add about £244 onto the typical household bill, which the Consumer Council says is the biggest rise in gas prices in their network since May 2011. The move will affect about 186,000 gas customers throughout Northern Ireland. SSE Airtricity said the continued pressure on global energy markets has had a significant impact on energy suppliers' ability to keep prices down. Their tariffs are independently scrutinised and approved by the Utility Regulator in consultation with the Consumer Council and the Department for the Economy. Andrew Greer, SSE Airtricity general manager, said: ""We understand this news will be unwelcome, if not unexpected, to our customers, given the extensive media focus on wholesale markets over the last six months. ""The cost of purchasing natural gas on the wholesale market has reached record highs this winter and regrettably, a proportion of this must be reflected in our prices,"" he added. ""In March 2021 gas cost around 50 pence per therm, today that cost is around £2 per therm after hitting as high as £4.50 per therm late last year."" Raymond Gormley of the Consumer Council said the company had no option but to increase costs.   He also said the invasion of Ukraine will push costs up. ""Energy prices could be volatile for a number of weeks and will remain high for the foreseeable future,"" he added. ""This situation shows the importance of the Department for the Economy's energy strategy that aims to tackle affordability in the long term and move us away from our dependence on fossil fuels."" John French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said the conflict in Ukraine has significantly exacerbated the volatility and price movements within the market. ""The cost of wholesale gas has increased significantly over the last seven months largely due to Russia reducing the supply of natural gas into Europe,"" he said. ""However, today's announcement does not take into account the further upward wholesale price pressures we have seen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  ""Regrettably, it is highly likely that a further increase to tariffs will be needed at some point."""
market volatility,How shops are coping with a weaker pound,2024-09-15,2017-06-27,By Suzanne Bearne,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40352908,"""I really shop when the pound falls in value,"" says American Jian DeLeon. The 31-year-old editorial director at online US fashion website Highsnobiety is unsurprisingly passionate about clothes. He says his favourite luxury brands are now substantially cheaper in London.  ""Like anything from Comme Des Garcons. I got a jacket last time I was there for 40% less than I would have paid here,"" he says.  Before June last year, when the UK voted to leave the EU, he rarely went shopping on his regular work trips to the UK.  ""The littlest things from a pint at the pub to a short Uber ride were murder on my bank account because of the exchange rate.""  Now that some brands are significantly cheaper, he spends about $350 (£274; 310 euros) each time he comes, but thinks the favourable exchange rate means he saves around $100. ""It's easier for me to splurge and sometimes I do it too much for my own good,"" he confesses. Mr DeLeon isn't the only one indulging.  Just over a year on from the EU referendum, the pound is still around 16% lower against the dollar. The weakness has lured over a flock of international tourists hungry for high-end brands at relatively bargain prices.  Payments firm WorldPay says non-UK consumers' card spending at department stores rose by a fifth in the first three months of the year, while spending on electrical goods rose 22.7%.  US shoppers like Mr DeLeon have been amongst the biggest spenders, splashing out an extra 21.5% on their cards during the same period, it said. ""The extreme currency fluctuations encourages shoppers to buy more,"" says Honor Strachan, principal retail analyst at GlobalData.  ""They're getting more for their money."" But how do companies manage this kind of discrepancy; with precisely the same product priced significantly differently depending on where in the world it is bought? After all a boom in revenues in one market, can seriously dent demand in the markets international shoppers are coming from.  Many of the world's most famous brands — such as Burberry and Apple — simply raised their UK prices to try and make sure what they sold cost broadly the same across their international markets. But luxury footwear brand Crockett & Jones, which has 12 stores worldwide across locations including London, Paris and New York as well as global wholesale partners, says it has deliberately left prices unchanged.  ""The last thing we want to do is abuse our customer confidence and raise prices in the UK. ""We certainly don't increase our prices at a whim to take advantage of said currency fluctuations,"" says James Fox, export sales director at the firm.  Mr Fox believes that in the long term it's best to keep pricing simple. ""We strive to have a level playing field as and where we can.  ""We offer sterling, euro and dollar price lists, which gives our customers piece of mind that they are buying in their own currency at a level price to the potential competitors within their market."" He says generally any discrepancies tend to average out across currencies, and that re-pricing is only possible ""once or twice a year"" due to the upheaval it causes for the business overall. So is he concerned that the firm could be losing out financially? ""We are fortunate to be in a position that we have a few very strong 'Brexit proof' markets which underpin the company when the UK is trying its best to screw up international trade,"" says Mr Fox. By selling both through its own stores and through wholesalers the firm's risk is already spread out, he adds.  Crockett & Jones is not the only retailer which has kept prices steady.  Ray Clacher, executive vice-president at Trinity - owner of premium brands Gieves & Hawkes, Kent & Curwen and Cerruti 1881 - says non-EU tourists using either the US dollar or a currency that trades in line with the dollar, have driven up sales at its London stores. Nonetheless, these sales are still just a small percentage of Trinity's total revenue. ""We certainly have not adjusted our retail prices to reflect the influx of tourism, in fact, quite the opposite as we want to encourage more UK [sales],"" he says. However, he admits this strategy could change if costs continue to rise.  ""If inflation continues to rise and sterling continues to struggle against the euro and dollar, we will have no choice but to pass on the cost to our customers - but not at present,"" says Mr Clacher.

But it is also important not to be too greedy. Many US retailers that have come to the UK have simply swapped their dollar signs on their US price tags for pounds - betting that British consumers will be willing to pay a premium for their goods. Banana Republic is one such example. After eight years in the UK, it announced last year it would close all eight of its stores. The decision followed six consecutive quarters of falling sales.  ""They thought that because they were a big brand, they could demand higher prices. But UK consumers ""are savvier than that,"" says Ms Strachan. Yet for retailers doing a straight currency conversion from their local currency to the country where they are selling their goods also doesn't necessarily work.  ""Asos made a big thing about launching local websites with a straight currency conversion and it didn't work - local pricing didn't fit in line with competitors.  ""Brands need to look at who else is operating in that space, the wealth of consumers there, and what they're willing to pay, and then price accordingly using localised pricing structures,"" says Ms Strachan. Many firms, particularly larger brands such as Hermes also use currency hedging to protect themselves. This involves working with a bank to buy currency at the current rate to protect themselves against adverse future volatility. In the end, though Ms Strachan says a company's ability to cope with currency volatility comes down to how much people want to buy what they sell. ""If they still want it customers will buy it,"" she says."
market volatility,UK to discuss oil stability with Saudi Arabia,2024-09-15,2022-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60739690,"The UK government is to discuss how to diversify energy supply following disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, Downing Street has said. Petrol prices for UK drivers have reached record highs of more than £1.60 a litre in recent days. The PM's spokesman said discussions with Saudi officials would look to tackle market volatility but there were no ""quick fixes"" available. It comes after 81 men were executed in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Foreign Office Minister Amanda Milling said the British government was ""deeply shocked"" by the executions, and opposed the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Replying to an urgent question from Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, she said the issue had already been raised with the Saudi authorities, and the government would continue to ""speak frankly"" about human rights.  Mr Blunt said the executions were ""appalling"" and had presented the prime minister with ""exquisite difficulties"" when asking Saudi Arabia for help in easing oil shortages.  Ms Milling told MPs the UK was phasing out Russian oil, adding that it was important to have stability in energy markets, and there was a role for OPEC - of which Saudi Arabia is a key member - in this.  Human rights groups say many of those executed did not receive fair trials, but the Saudi government denies this. The average price of petrol for UK drivers hit £1.63 a litre on Sunday, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushing up costs. Asked whether the UK wanted Saudi Arabia - the world's second-biggest oil producer - to increase supplies, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We will be speaking to the Saudis about a range of issues, not just energy supply. ""Diversifying our energy supply is important, as is boosting renewable energy. There are no quick fixes but we do want to reduce the volatility and bring prices down."" Boris Johnson held a meeting with ministers and leaders of gas and oil companies - including Shell, Esso and BP - on Monday, during which he voiced a ""firm commitment"" to continuing extractions from the North Sea. They agreed to work to ""remove barriers facing investors and developers, and help projects come online more quickly"", Downing Street said. Saudi Arabia says those executed on Saturday, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian national, had been convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, torture, rape and weapons smuggling. The number put to death exceeded the 69 who faced that fate during the whole of 2021. ""The UK is firmly opposed to the death penalty in every country as a matter of principle,"" the PM's spokesman said.  ""We continue to raise human rights issues with other countries including Saudi Arabia. We do not shy away from raising these issues with our partners."" In the Commons, Labour's spokesman Bambos Charalambous said it was no coincidence that the Saudis had carried out the mass executions while the world's attention was elsewhere.  Responding to reports that Boris Johnson is to visit Riyadh, the SNP spokesman, Alyn Smith, said no such visit should take place, after what he described as an ""atrocity"". "
market volatility,US shares steadier after wild swings,2024-09-15,2018-02-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42970283,"Wall Street shares slipped on Wednesday, but were somewhat steadier than in recent days, which saw sharp trading swings. The Dow Jones dipped less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 fell about 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.9%.  Declines in technology and energy shares weighed on the markets, which have seen a sudden increase in volatility.  Investors are worried by policy shifts, including higher interest rates. European stock markets also recovered ground on Wednesday, but a rally in Asia faded. The volatility marks a turn for the markets, which rose steadily for much of last year. But analysts and economists, who for months have forecast that rapidly-rising markets were due a correction, said investors should get used to choppier markets. ""It's not like this is going to be one and done,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade. Signs of volatility have been rising in recent weeks, as investors digest the impact of new tax cuts and tighter central banking policies, among other shifts. A US Labor Department report of strong wage growth in January triggered a market sell-off last week, as investors saw a sign that inflation could rise faster than expected and lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly. The market plunge spread globally as investors rushed to redistribute assets in reaction to the shift. Wednesday's declines came after US lawmakers announced a budget deal, which would lift spending caps and could add to the inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, soft demand for US Treasuries at an auction on Wednesday sent yields higher - typically a signal of higher rates. London's FTSE 100 closed 1.9% higher, in Paris the Cac-40 rose by 1.8% and Frankfurt's Dax was up by 1.6%.  In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index pulled back from early highs to add 0.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.8%.  Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended up 0.8% while South Korea's Kospi index dropped 2.3%. During this week's market mayhem you probably heard a lot about volatility - and in particular, this thing called the Fear Index, or Vix. But what is it? Technically, the Vix is a measure of the expected amount of gyration in stock prices on the S&P 500 over the next month. A low level indicates investors don't expect prices to fluctuate that much - a spike implies choppy waters ahead. But it's only recently that investors could trade on - or against - fear. Well, fear of change, specifically. The Vix, technically the Cboe Volatility Index, was first launched in 1993. But you could only bet on it - using options - in 2006.  A key thing about the Vix is that the volatility that the index predicts tends to be worse than actual volatility. In other words, we think the future will be worse than it is. That pessimism is something a group of investors have exploited - they bet that the future would be calmer than the Vix model suggested. And over the years, that has made them a lot of money.  The only problem for them is when that calm evaporates, like now."
market volatility,Energy prospects blow hot and cold,2024-09-15,2022-12-29,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64116488,"As the year turns, and the economy turns downwards, the revolution in energy picks up pace. This time last year, oil and gas prices were rising on the back of economic recovery and rising tensions on Russia's border with Ukraine. The subsequent invasion, in February, turned energy markets upside down. The surge in fossil fuel prices, with subsequent declines but far greater volatility, changed the financial calculations on alternative sources of energy. One of the biggest accelerations we've seen has been towards hydrogen energy.  What seemed some way over the horizon just a year ago is now getting much closer. Whether blue hydrogen, derived from gas, or the green variety, from using renewable power to split hydrogen from oxygen in water, it could be a big part of the energy mix in the north-east of Scotland. Where wind generation is far from conventional markets, on the Hebridean and northern islands for instance, hydrogen can be shipped out, to markets around the world. The market for receiving hydrogen and using it in heavy transport and in industry is being fast prepared on continental Europe. The Scottish government talks up the prospects of exporting to Germany, which fits with the political agenda of integrating into European energy markets. Meantime, on the Moray Firth horizon, I'm watching shipping busy with supply of equipment to the massive windfarms being constructed off the east coast. Far bigger ones were included in plans that won competitive bidding for ScotWind - the next and much bigger wave of offshore wind. Paying Crown Estate Scotland, and therefore its shareholder the Scottish government, £755m upfront for the right to develop designated sea areas was only the start. That kind of money shows developers are serious. With a requirement that they install within a decade, they are busy planning. Next comes assessment of impact and securing of finance. Following criticism that much of the current build-out of projects has been done by distant manufacturers, with too little benefit to Scottish industry, the ScotWind auction secured enormous commitments to local content. That now requires Scottish industry to step up to the challenge and opportunity, requiring investment at scale. The challenge is with sequencing that investment with a flow of orders, and then managing a flow of orders to avoid boom and bust. The order books could be even larger when you consider a parallel track of offshore wind developments to provide green energy to offshore oil and gas installations.  They are very heavy users of fossil fuels in the process of extracting oil and gas, and decarbonising that process is a high priority for an industry keen to show willing in the great energy transition. INTOG - Innovation and Targeted Oil and Gas - is a big part of the answer.  It is the innovation and bidding process for leasing rights through which offshore wind developers can power those platforms.  Earlier this month, Crown Estates Scotland announced a healthy level of interest: 19 bidders at the first stage, 10 of those for the smaller innovation part of the process. Expect to hear more in April, as this bidding round is being run at quite a pace. This is likely to be even more about floating wind turbines than ScotWind. That is a technology at which Scotland - with Norwegian investment - has a lead. The first floating offshore wind farm, near Peterhead, has just passed its fifth anniversary. With 54% of capacity achieved, the five Hywind Scotland turbines have achieved the most efficient windfarm rating anywhere. Using that lead to generate jobs in manufacturing, even with a new technology, is continuing to prove difficult. To compete at scale with established fabrication yards requires big investment and, again, that is hard to justify until it's clear that the orders will follow. Putting further pressure on developers and the supply chain is the expectation of cost.  Securing an area of seabed to develop is only the start. The finances stack up only when companies also secure Contracts for Difference from the UK government.  These are a form of subsidy, at which UK energy customers, represented by the UK government, guarantee to pay a minimum price per unit of energy. That reassures investors. And if operators make profits above that price, they give it back to the customer. An important stage was reached earlier this month, when the UK government set out its ""administrative strike prices"".  These are the maximum levels of payment per unit that the industry can expect to receive for each technology - much more for tidal, biogas, energy from waste and hydro than for offshore wind. They are designed to drive down prices, when they are followed by industry bidding to offer energy at the lowest price. So far, they've been very successful at doing that. The price of offshore wind has plummeted. Now, the government expects it to fall further - so much further that they think offshore windfarms can produce energy at lower prices than onshore windfarms. That may reflect the cost of trying to develop an onshore windfarm when the UK government has put so many obstacles in the way of placing them in the English countryside. The industry is alarmed that prices are being driven down so hard. The response to these administrative strike prices from Scottish Renewables was a warning that driving down costs is increasingly hard to achieve while also delivering on local content. And if there is so little headroom, added to rising interest rates on corporate debt, some of the hoped-for projects may not stack up financially.  There is, says chief executive Claire Mack, a ""very real risk of stalling developments"". Investments are already being stalled by the long delay in announcing where Scotland's green free ports will be. After an impasse, the Scottish and UK governments agreed to work together on this last February. Bids had to be submitted by June. A decision was taken in early September on which two bidders will get these low-tax, tariff-free carve-outs. There's a high expectation that the Cromarty Firth and several sites in the Firth of Forth bid have won. But mainly because of turmoil in Downing Street, there has been no point at which a ministerial statement could be co-ordinated. There have also been talks about the consolation prizes for those that didn't win: Aberdeen, the Clyde and Orkney. Four months on, due to political delays, developers are ready to invest, but having to wait."
market volatility,US stock plunge sparks global sell-off,2024-09-15,2018-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42942921,"US stocks suffered their worst falls in more than six years on Monday in a sell-off sparked by concerns of higher interest rates.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75.  The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". Signs of improvement in the economy had driven US markets to record highs.  Ever since he was elected in November 2016 President Donald Trump has tweeted a number of times about the increase in US stock markets, using the gains since he took office to illustrate market improvement. ""Economic news from the US has been stronger than anticipated,"" said David Kuo, chief executive of financial services advisory Motley Fool.  ""So, perversely, the market correction has been caused by positive economic news"".  Monday's decline is the largest decline in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US.  The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%.  In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading companies also fell to close down 1.46% or 108 points lower. In Tuesday's early Asian trade, stocks were following Wall Street's lead. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 4.8% before recovering slightly, while Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was down 2.7%. In South Korea, the Kospi lost 2.3%. Asian markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why? Investors are reacting to changes in the outlook for the American and global economy, and what that might mean for the cost of borrowing.  The stock market sell-off accelerated on Friday when the US Labour Department released employment numbers which showed stronger growth in wages than was anticipated. CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy said the wage numbers ""blew lower interest rates out of the water"". ""The share selling....reflects a higher than previously anticipated interest rate environment,"" Mr McCarthy said.  In response to that, investors moved to sell out of stocks and put money into assets like bonds which benefit from higher interest rates.  ""This isn't a collapse of the economy. This isn't a concern that markets aren't going to do well,"" said Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate,"" she said. What has driven the Dow's surge? Stronger global growth has prompted central banks in Europe, Canada and elsewhere to ease away from policies put in place to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis. Analysts say investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets in the months ahead. But the Dow closed Monday having shed about a third of its gains since Mr Trump took office in January 2017. It marks a dramatic turnaround from January, when it raced past the 25,000 and 26,000 point milestones in less than a month. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. But he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said.  ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" Investors have been bracing for a downturn after months of seemingly unstoppable gains. Amid the market plunge on Monday, websites for several large money management companies suffered slowdowns or crashes.  Wall Street firms also said they have been fielding calls from people worried about their investments.  Boasting about stock market gains is a dangerous game that most presidents avoid playing. Barack Obama did it occasionally, but only after the US economy had climbed significantly from the wreckage of the 2008 collapse. After warning of a market bubble during the campaign, however, Donald Trump became the Dow Jones's biggest cheerleader- in tweets, at rallies and even during last week's State of the Union address. That set up the jarring visual of the president boasting about the benefits of his tax cuts in a speech as the markets headed south. US cable news channels, which had been airing the president live, cut into their coverage to report on the record-setting day. It was a highly visible hiccup in the recent US economic success story that will be hard for most Americans to miss. The president will make the case that the fundamentals in the economy are still strong. Wages are up and unemployment is down - possibly contributing to stock drop. If growth continues, this could be chalked up as yet another rhetorical mis-step by a non-politician. If it's the beginning of a larger correction in an election year, however, the president's words could come back to haunt him."
market volatility,Alderney set to raise electricity price cap,2024-09-15,2022-12-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64053213,"Electricity prices in Alderney could go up in 2023, depending on market volatility for diesel which the island's generators use, the States has warned. The Policy and Finance Committee has agreed to raise the price cap from 50p to 60p per unit. The cap sets a maximum price Alderney Electricity Ltd (AEL) can charge for each kilowatt hour of electricity. The increase is subject to approval by the full States of Alderney next year. AEL raised its prices earlier this year, but also introduced a cost relief for customers for three months from 1 May. The draft Ordinance to be placed on the Billet does not commit to an increase in electricity prices, but allows AEL the flexibility to quickly respond to market forces, within the constraints of the revised cap. The States of Alderney said if activated in full, the measure could lead to an increase on typical domestic electricity bills of about 20% during 2023 - less than £25 per month for most households. Under the existing 50p price cap and rising world fuel prices, AEL would be unable to meet financial expectations and maintain its current infrastructure, the States said. It said improved network efficiency and station upgrades had helped to keep prices down. AEL managing director James Lancaster said: ""We have budgeted for a worst-case scenario and it may be that fuel prices will begin to return to normality enabling underlying electricity prices to be brought back below the level of the current cap. ""Projected growth in both capacity and functionality in line with the current upgrade plan, and future plans in line with Energy Policy objectives, will require that we deliver a net profit margin of twice the current targeted level.  ""Any benefit AEL may derive from lower than anticipated fuel prices or other costs next year can be targeted toward such improvements."" Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

market volatility,"Fuel prices still cause for concern, says watchdog",2024-09-15,2023-11-09,By Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67368097,"Drivers are still not getting a fair price on fuel at the pumps, the UK's competition watchdog has warned. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said prices had risen by as much as 13.9p per litre since the end of May, partly due to wholesale costs. But it said, more recently, while those costs have fallen, the retail price for petrol and diesel has not.  CMA boss Sarah Cardell said there was ""cause for concern"" that competition is not working. The findings are contained in the watchdog's first report on fuel prices following an investigation into competition in the market, which recommended a body be created to monitor what retailers are charging drivers.   The CMA found that petrol prices had increased from 142.9p per litre at the end of May to 154p per litre at the end of October, up 11.1p.  For diesel, prices rose from 147.9p per litre to 161.8p per litre over the same period, an increase of 13.9p. Wholesale oil prices rose between June, July and August, said the CMA, largely due to global pressures on the energy market.  But it said: ""Wholesale prices then reduced in September and October while retail prices did not. ""While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, this could indicate a lack of competitive response from fuel retailers if this trend continues.""  Higher food and fuel prices have been big drivers in the soaring cost of living and official figures also suggest that the price paid by drivers at the pump rose sharply in September. The CMA examined the so-called ""retail spread"" - the difference between what retailers pay to buy fuel and the price consumers are charged - between May and last month.  It discovered that there had been ""significant increases"" in the retail spread for petrol and diesel.   ""More recent trends give cause for concern that competition is still not working well in this market to hold down pump prices,"" said the CMA's Ms Cardell.  She cautioned, however, that the information contained in the report is based on voluntary information and is missing some big fuel retailers. Off the back of its investigation into the fuel market in the UK, the watchdog is calling for a new monitoring body to be created, which would have powers to demand pricing information from all retailers. The RAC said that the latest figures suggested that drivers were still ""being taken advantage of at the pumps"".  The RAC's Simon Williams said: ""It's very disappointing that the CMA has found that major fuel retailers are still taking far bigger margins than they have done in the past. ""We believe the situation is currently worse than ever as the wholesale fuel market is down significantly, yet forecourt prices are falling like the proverbial feather,"" he said, adding that any new body responsible for tracking prices would need to have the power to take action against big retailers. ""We fear little will change even then,"" he said. Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers' Association, said that he would always encourage drivers to shop around to make sure they are getting the best deal. ""With the volatility of the global fuel market, it is important that motorists are given the opportunity to search for the cheapest prices available to them,"" he said. The trade association also said that it would work closely with the competition watchdog on developing the new scheme for monitoring prices."
market volatility,How one estate creates its own energy to cut bills,2024-09-15,2022-10-30,By Paul Pigott,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63300680,"Access to solar panels and a home battery has reduced energy bill worries for Nikita Harris on one of Europe's largest green retrofit projects.  ""Where I used to worry going to bed, I don't have to worry now,"" said Nikita, 26, whose home in Swansea now runs partially on a battery. Some 644 properties are being connected to a unique energy-sharing scheme, social housing provider Pobl said. Housing Minister Julie James has called the scheme ""transformational"". Power from linked solar panels on roofs across the Penderi estate is used to charge batteries in homes.  Nikita's battery is fitted to a wall just inside the entrance of her terraced property. By limiting the use of her big appliances to when the sun is up, the mother-of-two said she had cut her electricity bills significantly. ""I used to spend £20 a week on my electric,"" she said, ""now with the solar panels and battery I'm putting in £10 a week. ""By having the battery in my home... I feel calmer,"" she said, explaining how sad she is for other people faced with having to limit their electricity use.   ""It's hard watching people say they're struggling to get food or do they get electric,"" she said. ""It is worrying times for everybody, but this has helped. "" With energy storage and smart energy management technology now installed in 200 homes, Pobl said the estate had already started to cut the amount of power being drawn from the national grid.  The project was funded by £3.5m from the European Union, £1.5m from Pobl, and a £900,000 infrastructure upgrade by Western Power. Retrofitted homes on the estate are expected to generate up to 60% of their own electricity, reducing bills, and cutting carbon emissions by as much as 350 tonnes per year. ""The aim is to... protect our customers from the peaks and troughs in the volatility in the market that we currently see now,"" said Pobl director of regeneration Solitaire Pritchard. Despite the size of the retrofit, which Pobl described as Europe's largest, Penderi represents a tiny fraction of the 19,000 properties owned by the social housing provider.   ""We hope to learn how people live with this technology,"" Ms Pritchard said, explaining how using a battery to power your home is new for most people.  ""We're hoping that what we've learned here can be shared across the sector and obviously then applied across all homes in Wales."" The company doing the retrofit is renewable energy supplier Sero, and project manager Anne-Marie Ratcliffe said a key part of the work was teaching residents how to get the most out of the technology.  ""This is the biggest energy retrofit project of its kind in the UK so it's something incredibly innovative and incredibly exciting to be a part of,"" she said. ""It's incredibly important, given both the climate crisis and the energy fuel cost price crisis at the moment,"" she added. ""The really innovative part... is the sharing scheme whereby if you can't have [solar panels] on your home you can still benefit from the installations that are happening around the community.  ""Every person who's participating in this scheme will see a benefit to their energy bills and their energy usage in their homes,"" she added. In the coming months, she said, any excess power produced at Penderi will be fed back into the network grid, generating rebates on participants' electric bills.  ""This project is reducing the amount of energy being drawn off the grid,"" she said. ""That is reducing the amount of carbon that has been produced by the community as a whole and by individuals within their homes."" She said that if the project helped to ""prove"" the technology, it will ""hopefully then roll out to more communities"". Lessons learned from the project will also inform the wider spread of renewable energy technology in thousands of homes throughout the Swansea Bay City Region, as part of the £1.3bn City Deal, in the Homes as Power Stations project - subject to the approval of the UK and Welsh governments. This would see energy efficiency technology retrofitted to 7,000 homes with a further 3,300 new build homes also benefiting as part of the project, which is led by Neath Port Talbot council."
market volatility,The biggest threat to India’s growth?,2024-09-15,2017-05-19,Edd Gent,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170510-why-automation-could-be-a-threat-to-indias-growth,"Smart machines, robots, and other forms of automation could either be an economic poison or cure in a developing country like India – and this change will affect how businesses worldwide outsource work. Ravi is one of thousands of Indian IT workers who will lose their jobs this year, caught between a slump in India’s previously booming IT industry and new technology threatening to replace human workers. Until last month he worked at Cognizant Technology Solutions – a firm headquartered in the US but with the bulk of its workforce in India. The company is under pressure to cut costs and is expected to shed between 6,000 and 10,000 'underperformers' this year. Market volatility and rising protectionism in countries like the USA, where much of India’s IT outsourcing work comes from, saw Cognizant’s revenue grow at its slowest pace in two decades last year, and its peers in the Indian IT industry are in the same boat. But at the same time, rapidly improving automation technology is allowing software to carry out routine IT support work and repetitive back office tasks previously performed by humans – the very tasks global companies originally outsourced to India to take advantage of cheaper labour. In February, Cognizant’s CFO said it would “aggressively” employ automation to “optimise” its services. Meanwhile, India’s third-largest IT firm, Infosys, said automation allowed it to shift 9,000 workers from low-skill jobs to more advanced projects, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, last year. Its competitor Wipro redeployed 3,200 in 2016, and predicts it will move another 4,500 this year. Yet this has been accompanied by a significant slowing in hiring. IT body Nasscom’s annual review predicted a 20-to-25% reduction in jobs in the industry over the next three years. “Cognizant has not conducted any layoffs,” a Cognizant spokesperson said. “New machines and technologies are about helping cut costs, improve efficiencies, and increase sophistication in building and delivering services. They are not about altogether replacing the human element, but about elevating the role people play and the value they bring to their roles.” But it can be hard to pinpoint exactly whose jobs have been lost to automation. Researchers in the UK, for example, have shown that some roles in today’s global economy are more at risk than others.  Ravi, whose name has been changed, worked as a software tester – a role particularly vulnerable to automated takeover. ""In testing, already it has been introduced and it's coming in very fast,” he says. ""If a job requires four manual testers, automation can reduce it to one.” He’s now job hunting, but says opportunities for the kind of work he was doing before are limited and he will probably have to adapt: take a course on automated software testing and then try to secure a position. He worries this may be a repeating pattern. ""Maybe after five years some new technologies are coming and we have to learn those, too,” he says. India’s IT weak spot? Since the 1990s Indian firms have carried out back office tasks, and IT services like data entry, running call centres and testing software for foreign companies at cut-price rates by throwing cheap labour at them. But as machines become adept at this repetitive, rule-based work, the low-skill jobs – where the bulk of Indian IT workers are employed – are the most at risk. “It’s been happening for the last two or three years in an accelerated fashion,” says Gopinathan Padmanabhan, head of innovation at IT company Mphasis. “It’s a reality you can't shy away from.” This shift will go hand-in-hand with new opportunities in emerging areas – data science, artificial intelligence and big data – but these will require new skills and probably fewer employees. ""They will have to find new roles and train themselves to become relevant in the new age,” says Padmanabhan. “And we're not talking about too far into the future… the next three to five years.” Of course, losing jobs to automation is a concern across the developed world. But India’s case is unique. A stable job at one of the big IT companies is a major aspiration for many Indians, which probably explains why fears of technological unemployment have featured so prominently in newspapers here in recent months. But despite contributing 9.3% of the country’s GDP, according to Nasscom, the IT industry only employs 3.7 million of the nation’s roughly half a billion working adults. So how big of a threat is it actually to the Indian workforce? World Bank data estimates 69% of today’s jobs in India are threatened by automation. And India isn’t alone: China’s figure was 77% and other developing countries also scored highly. India is already struggling to create jobs amid rapid growth. Its working-age population increased by 300 million between 1991 and 2013, according to UN figures, but the number of people employed only rose by 140 million. Still, robots replacing jobs en masse is unrealistic in the medium term in India – or anywhere else – but the effects are already being felt. Last September, Indian textiles giant Raymond said it would replace 10,000 jobs with robots over three years. Union leader Vinodh Kumar works at BMW’s factory in Chennai – India’s automotive hub. His facility isn’t in danger of automation, but he knows union leaders at Hyundai’s plant where the entire body shop and most of the paint shop was automated. “The majority of the body shop employees lost their jobs,” he said. “The permanent employees they tried to relocate, but the contract labourers and the trainees lost their jobs.” Other sectors at risk include pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, logistics and security. Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys, says it is unlikely to impact high-skill jobs like architects or high-quality coders, or even lower-end jobs in the service industry like restaurant staff and hairdressers. ""The fat middle is at threat, which is rule-based work. Like work in banks, work in offices, work in factories,” he says. ‘Hollowing out’ the middle class The World Bank’s 2016 World Development Report noted a global trend towards “hollowing out” of the labour force. As technology streamlines routine tasks, middle-skill jobs like clerical workers and machine operators decline while both high-skill and low-skill ones increase. And in developing nations like India, that can be a huge problem. ""Those middle-skill jobs have traditionally been the path out of poverty,” says World Bank senior economist Indhira Santos. “So that polarisation into the labour market could translate into a polarisation of society and income.” This trend isn’t down to technology alone – globalisation and urbanisation contribute. But pulling away “the ladder to the middle class”, as the report puts it, could be particularly damaging in a developing country like India. After all, there is a reason why companies are turning to new technologies. “Automation is an imperative to improve competitiveness, quality and efficiency,” says CEO of Siemens’ India Sunil Mathur. That helps compete against cheap imports, boost exports and increases domestic demand and therefore jobs, he says. Samay Kohli, co-founder of home-grown warehouse robotics company Grey Orange, agrees. India lags well behind the developed world on labour productivity, which acts as a major handbrake on growth. “You have to automate to be globally competent,” he says. “If we don't improve our infrastructure, our productivity we will not have a chance to compete globally.” Grey Orange builds ‘Butler’ robots that fetch and store products and ‘Sorters’ that automatically scan and sort packages in the warehouses of e-commerce and logistics giants like Flipkart, Jabong and DTDC. Kohli says the Butler can pick up to 600 items an hour. That eclipses the 100 items a human worker can manage – invaluable efficiency in a country where supply chain costs are double those of Western countries. Increasing worker productivity could stifle employment, but Kohli claims they are simply filling gaps. Annual staff turnover in warehousing is 300%, he says. Rural Indians come looking for better earnings, but onerous targets, low wages and urban living costs mean they rarely last long. But robots are harder to sway. Kohli claims job numbers in their facilities have stayed level, but attrition has reduced. “This labour is just brute labour,” he says. “Even though they're doing jobs, they never get out of poverty. When they start using these kinds of collaborative robots in the mix they work better, more efficiently and are happier with their jobs."" Heads of IBM Research India Sriram Raghavan agrees that in a developing country like India, automation normally fills gaps rather than replacing people. India has 330,000 fewer doctors than the WHO’s minimum recommendation, but Raghavan says automation can help plug this kind of talent shortage. Smart machines combined with the internet could allow doctors and teachers to provide personalised services to many more people than they can today. The plight of IT workers like Ravi, though, demonstrates that automation is already encroaching on areas without gaps to be filled. Pai says India has the luxury of time compared to developed countries, as labour will remain cheaper than automation for a decade, and huge unmet demand for infrastructure and services can produce lots of jobs. But the World Bank report highlights an ever-accelerating race between skills and technology and that countries like India need to act now to future-proof their populations’ capabilities. Future-proofing jobs from robots With automation taking on the routine tasks at the heart of today’s workplace, the jobs of the future will focus on skills like critical thinking, collaboration and creativity. India’s education system has a reputation for learning by rote and Indian Institute of Technology Madras engineering professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala agrees most institutions aren’t adequately preparing young people. But things are changing. He leads a government-sponsored pilot where professors from leading colleges use virtual labs to teach students at struggling engineering colleges. And start-ups are introducing extra-curricular robotics classes teaching problem-solving skills vital for future jobs. Most importantly, he says the country’s young population is sharp, adaptable, and future-oriented. ""If automation displaces one thing they move to another,” he says. “They are recognising the need to continually upskill.” IBM’s Raghavan says smart machines that automatically analyse students' performance and preferences can help guide them through this fast-moving terrain by combining data on their skills with job opportunities and available courses. He says: ""Then it’s less about a race, but getting people on a journey. Maybe the skill profile changes every five years rather than every 10, but at the same time technology is helping navigate that landscape."" That may sound like blue-sky thinking, but in February, Microsoft and LinkedIn announced Project Sangam – a programme providing LinkedIn training, with progress automatically added to profiles so companies can shortlist candidates, as well as personalised job recommendations. Resistance is futile Jhunjhunwala thinks India’s development challenges are so large, it needs all the help it can get. And fighting automation is futile anyway. ""The changes going on in the world, including automation, are not something decided by us – but it's going to happen,"" he says. ""We don’t want to be passive and let automation impact us. We want to develop something with this automation."" And in the race between technology and skills – as India tries to keep pace with the very technology that helped launch its economy on the world stage – he thinks the country has a secret weapon: a deeper value placed on education than in the West. After all, the pinnacle of India’s ancient caste system was the educated Brahmin priest – not the Kshatriya warrior. ""It's part of our Indian heritage,"" says Pai. ""India is the only civilisation in the world where the educated gurus were placed on the totem pole higher than the king. In all other nations, soldiers and might ruled and knowledge bowed to the mighty. In India, knowledge is above the might of the state.""

What’s likely to change? Australian flag carrier Qantas made history recently by ferrying passengers nonstop between South America and Australia. The aeroplane – a Boeing 787 Dreamliner – departed Buenos Aires shortly past noon local time. Some 9,300 miles (14.973km) and 17-plus hours later, QF 14 landed in Darwin. In doing so, the carrier set two internal records: longest distance covered and longest time in the air for a commercial flight. Captain Alex Passerini, who commanded QF 14, later said: ""Qantas has always stepped up to a challenge, especially when it comes to long-haul travel, and this flight is an excellent example of the capabilities and attention to detail of our flight planning team."" Contrary to popular belief, flying for so many hours isn't entirely new. In the 1930s, Pan Am airliners hopscotched across the Pacific Ocean with regularity. Passengers on board the Honolulu clipper could expect 20-hour flight times when shuttling between Hawaii and the continental United States. Qantas followed suit a decade later. In 1943, the Flying Kangaroo launched service between Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Australia, its flying boats taking up to 33 hours to complete the trip. Passengers who did were subsequently admitted to ""The Rare and Secret Order of the Double Sunrise"", so named because of the two sunrises they would see during the trip. The 21st Century has seen the long-haul, nonstop trend continue. In 2004, Singapore Airlines made headlines when it launched service between New York and Singapore; a 9,500-plus mile (15,289km) haul that can – depending on prevailing winds – take up to 19 hours. Less punishing (though not by much) is Qatar Airways’ Doha to Auckland, New Zealand service which clocks in at 9,000 miles (14,484km). Passengers on board the Boeing 777 cross 10 time zones and virtually the entire length of the Indian Ocean, continental Australia, and the Tasman Sea before arriving in the City of Sails. Trip time? 18 hours. Similar feats of flight are expected later this year when United and American Airlines launch services between the United States and India. You might also like: Fun stuff, minus the indignities of air travel of course. For one thing, there is nothing appealing about being sealed in a long metal tube. Do so for ever-longer periods and you are likely to end up grumpy. When passengers are grumpy, flying becomes less fun; and if something isn’t fun, why do it? Early flyers were more fortunate. High fares limited who could fly, the result being a select few could experience luxurious service for hours. Today’s flyers want to fly further, faster, and in style, all while paying less. Catering to these demands requires innovative thinking and airlines are increasingly investing in products that will keep long-haul passengers happy. Here are three of them. Engine technology Jets need fuel, lots of it. The Boeing 747 – an icon of the long-haul travel era – burns jet fuel at an astounding rate of one gallon per second (4.54 litres per second). Consequently, to keep jets like this flying for hours, you need a large petrol tank. Aeroplanes like the Boeing 747 carry upwards of 57,000 gallons (259,127 litres) of fuel (the record holder is the Antonov An-225 which can carry nearly 100,000 gallons, or 454,000 litres). By comparison, the average four-door Sedan holds closer to 15 gallons (62.2 litres). A bigger tank may help you go further but expect your gas bills to be heftier. At current gas prices, topping off the average Sedan will cost you $50 (£37.30); a Boeing 747, upwards of $140,000 (£104,480). Such weighty expenses bode badly for passengers, much of whose cash goes toward paying airline fuel costs. Making things worse is volatility in the energy market which can cause massive swings in fuel prices. For example, a one cent change in fuel prices can produce a $40m (£29.8m) profit (or loss) for carriers.   But help is on the way. Engine manufacturers are studying – and succeeding – at making their products more efficient. A more efficient engine means less fuel burn, and less fuel burn lowers airline costs and (ideally), fares. Agnes Jocher, a professor of sustainable future mobility at the Technical University of Munich, says improvements in so-called ‘bypass ratios’ are key to lowering fuel use. This ratio indicates how much air flows around the engine versus through it. Jocher says, ""generally speaking, the higher the ratio, the more efficient the engine. The more efficient engine, the lower its fuel consumption."" Today’s jets burn on average 60% less fuel than the first generation of commercial aircraft, thanks in large part to bypass ratios improvements. Jocher expects this trend to continue as airlines keen to go long-haul, nonstop explore ways to trim costs. When it comes to saving fuel, she notes, ""higher bypass ratios are key"". Losing weight An efficient engine can help you burn less gas. But so can shedding weight. The reason comes down to simple physics. It takes more energy to move more mass. A heavier aeroplane will – all else being equal – burn more jet fuel than a lighter one. A lighter jet can also fly faster, shaving precious minutes off a flight. That bodes well for the airline (keen to maximise aeroplane productivity) and passengers (eager to arrive at their destination sooner). One way to curb aircraft weight is foregoing wiring and cables. These devices act as the connective tissue for jetliners, forming crucial links between the cockpit and aircraft systems like the landing gear, door sensors, and life support systems. The problem? They are heavy. By one estimate, wires, switches, and sockets can add over 16,000 lbs (7.2 tonnes) to a wide-body passenger jet. And more weight means more fuel burn. The solution? ""Fly-by-wireless"" systems, lightweight electronic technology which connects the cockpit and crucial aircraft control systems via the airwaves. Qantas recently took a more creative approach to shedding pounds. The carrier tasked industrial designer David Caon with creating a new line of in-flight cutlery and crockery. A key requirement? The assortment of plates, dishes, and utensils would have to be lighter than their predecessors. Achieving this feat was – to put it mildly – challenging. Caon says he and his team were ""not able to reduce the thickness of the crockery as this would affect its durability"". Instead, the team redesigned each piece to""“reduce profiles and minimise sections and use less material overall"". Caon describes the effort as a delicate balancing act to preserve ""functionality, durability, and weight"". These efforts paid off. The tableware – which debuted on Qantas’ 17-hour-long Perth to London route – was 11% lighter than its predecessors, producing ""great fuel saving benefits"". The new tableware was so popular Qantas subsequently used it across its entire network. Finessed food Aeroplanes are – despite the best mechanical innovations – cramped, noisy flying chunks of metal. And despite the inherent wonder of flight, if you've ever flown for hours, you know how boring plane travel can be. Airlines have responded by beefing up onboard amenities (including showers), entertainment (imagine having 4,500 TV and audio channels to choose from), and most notably, improved cuisine. For example, some passengers on the 17-hour trek between Los Angeles and Singapore are treated to a food spectacle, one that would rival dining at the best Michelin-starred restaurants. Orange-braised baby beet salad with endive, cherry tomatoes, and pine nuts? Perhaps citrus salmon over pumpkin dal, basmati rice and cilantro ghee? And spiced apple cake to finish? It's a far cry from the unrecognisable, reheated meals of the past. But just because food sounds good doesn’t mean taste follows suit. When flying high above the clouds, your normal sense of taste goes out the window. The often touted culprits are pressure drops (there’s less air at altitude) and plummeting humidity (cabin air is generally drier than the Sahara Desert). By one estimate, the combination of low pressure and dryness dulls your taste buds by 30%. However, there’s less talked about reason for waning palate sensitivity. A recent study found loud noise can cause savoury taste to be enhanced, and sweetness dulled. The study’s authors chalk it up to the noise-induced suppression of intense flavours which ultimately ""alter the perception of the foods we eat"". Their proposed fix? Rethinking menus to match taste preferences at altitude so passengers can – despite the constant buzzing of jet engines – better taste their food. Given the billions airlines are investing in going long-haul, spending a little more on ""menu diligence"" may well be a bargain. The Covid-19 pandemic has understandably depressed air travel demand. Closed borders and ever-changing testing requirements are less than enticing for any traveller. But as border restrictions ease, and as demand picks up, expect renewed interested in long-haul flight. Qantas – sensing passenger appetite for arriving sooner rather than later – has already renewed its commitment to ""Project Sunrise"", an ambitious effort to fly nonstop from its Sydney hub to prized markets like London, New York and Paris. With rivals sure to follow suit, innovation will discern which carriers make it and which ones don’t.

market volatility,Is it worth joining the Bitcoin boom?,2024-09-15,2017-09-07,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170906-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-latest-bitcoin-boom,"Crypto-currencies are soaring to market highs drawing in new investors – but some experts have concerns about the future. You may have noticed reports about Bitcoin’s value recently – its price is headed into the stratosphere. The crypto-currency’s recent meteoric price rise over the summer has seen one Bitcoin go from being worth $1,500 in early May to more than $5,000 over the weekend, before dropping to $4,654 at the time of publication. And that has got all kinds of people interested – people like Andrew Beckwith, a DJ who goes by the name Supersede. “I play restaurants, lounges, nightclubs, corporate events,” he says. You may also like: - Inside a secret Chinese Bitcoin mine - Loneliness often follows sudden wealth - Turning water into gold But he also invests. Beckwith has just taken his first step into the world of crypto-currencies, having converted $100 into Bitcoin. “I don’t know how far it’s going to grow,” he explains, “but if something is growing at hundreds of per cent, that’s a pretty valuable return.” Bitcoin is notorious for its volatility, but the recent peaks are unprecedented. In late 2013 its value jumped from around $100 to $1,000 – a bigger percentage increase – but it is worth more than four times that today. “Recently there’s been a lot more talk in the media and others have been investing,” explains Kiran Varughese, another amateur investor, who works for an elevator company in Dubai. A friend’s experiments with Bitcoin piqued his curiosity so he clubbed together with another pal to invest $1,000 in August. If they lose it, he says they won’t be too worried – the potential for a big return within the next few years is too tantalising for Varughese to resist. But are investors like Varughese and Beckwith taking too much of a risk by buying into Bitcoin, and other crypto-currencies like Ethereum, Litecoin or Dash? Is there something about these digital currencies that underpins their soaring prices or are they simply subject to whims in the market that can make fortunes but also devastate them? While the market capitalisation of all crypto-currencies now stands at $150 billion, they still occupy a strange space in the world of finance. “Every year Bitcoin continues to exist is something to take note of,” says Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge. “It’s a significant achievement for Bitcoin to have survived the many setbacks and challenges that it has faced.” One of these challenges occurred recently when Bitcoin split in two. It happened after the Bitcoin community became divided over how to allow more transactions to be processed with the currency. Because Bitcoin has no over-arching authority that controls it, any decision to alter the system that underpins it needed to gather enough support from Bitcoin users to go ahead. The system itself is called the blockchain – a huge digital ledger that records every single Bitcoin transaction in history. As computers on the Bitcoin network verify transactions, “blocks” of data are added to the ledger, storing this information. Computers that do this work receive a small sum of bitcoins as a reward – this is the process known as mining. Every single computer on the network has a copy of the blockchain and their copy of it is constantly updated. But until recently, Bitcoin blocks were limited in size to a megabyte every 10 minutes, meaning that the rate at which the blockchain could grow was capped. In early August, a new version of the crypto-currency – Bitcoin Cash – was mined for the first time. Its blocks can be up to eight megabytes in size. Some believe the smooth transition through this “fork” without any technical disasters has contributed to renewed confidence in Bitcoin, in turn helping to pump the price up. One “coin” of Bitcoin Cash is worth less, around $630 today, but that’s up $200 since its inception a month ago. Another fork to upgrade the block size further is expected in November and if successful, it might have a similar impact on Bitcoin’s buoyant price. But “currencies” like Bitcoin aren’t really playing the role of a traditional currency at the moment, says Vili Lehdonvirta, an economic sociologist at the Oxford Internet Institute, which is part of the University of Oxford. “When I called up a restaurant in Helsinki earlier this year to ask if they accept Bitcoin, the response was that they tried it a few years ago, nobody ever used it, and thus they no longer accept it,” he explains. BBC Capital contacted 10 businesses in London that have advertised an ability to accept Bitcoin in the past. Four of them said they had stopped accepting and two that did accept them reported hardly ever processing such payments. Instead, it appears many people are simply speculating on Bitcoin – investing in what is a relatively high-risk asset in the hope of a short-term gain in profit. But lucrative outcomes are by no means guaranteed – and many still think that Bitcoin is just a bubble. In the short-term there may be various reasons why people are buying in while the price is buoyant. Some may like investing in a currency unconnected to nation states, suggests Hileman. It could be seen as good insulation against uncertain political developments that can cause traditional currencies to plummet dramatically – as happened to the British pound in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Volatile international disputes, such as those involving North Korea, could be driving people to put their money elsewhere. “If you’re in South Korea and you’re concerned about a geopolitical event, do you trade in the US dollar?” asks Hileman. “Maybe that’s not a great idea because the US will be involved, as will China and Japan, so it’s not surprising to see people look for alternative currencies,” he says. Applied cryptography consultant and Bitcoin-watcher Peter Todd says some are also attracted by Bitcoin’s independence for broader political reasons, too. In an uncertain world, people’s financial freedom is sometimes limited by their governments. Take India, which recently tried to curb public investments in gold as this was harming the nation’s economy. Bitcoin is a global entity, no one government can fiddle with it – although there are countries where trading it is illegal. Still, crypto-currencies remain associated with plenty of risks that go beyond their volatility. Many people store their bitcoins in online exchanges and should these be hacked or go bust, which has happened more than once, then the money is often lost forever. With all the technical ups and downs of crypto-currencies – their changes and potential to split into new currencies for example – there is also a significant degree of complexity that can leave less informed investors bewildered. A new area of excitement, known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), are also beginning to worry some experts. ICOs allow owners of crypto-currencies to invest in fledgling companies, with many using Ethereum as their digital coin of choice. However, ICOs have already been associated with a number of scams and hacks, and China just banned them, calling ICOs 'illegal fundraising'. “I think the main thing we’re seeing in ICOs is straight-up fraud,” says Todd. He is concerned about efforts by regulators to clamp down on this because such an approach could backfire and encourage scammers to become more sophisticated. “It’s when things look legit that they get dangerous,” he says, pointing out that a few years ago Bitcoin and other digital tokens had more of a “Wild West” feel to them, which perhaps meant people were less likely to be duped since scams were crude and easy to spot. As more and more investors get involved in crypto-currencies, scams can get slicker and the natural wariness that can keep people cautious may also diminish. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are gradually cementing their stated position – providing a radical new alternative to the investment options that existed before them. But there is no certainty as to how this massive experiment will play out. Though when did that ever stop hopeful investors taking a punt?

market volatility,Ambitious Aussies take the wheel,2024-09-15,2016-01-05,Phil Mercer,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20151222-meet-australias-new-go-it-alone-investors,"It’s not for the faint-hearted, going solo with your life savings. But in search of a more prosperous retirement, that’s exactly what two million Australians have decided to do. They’ve taken matters in to their own hands, ditching traditional professional investment services in favour of (either completely or partially) running their pension plans by themselves. They’re hoping to hit the jackpot: a comfortable retirement. To be sure, taking this kind of risk may offer big rewards but the downside can be devastating. There’s some indication that what’s happening down under could be the start of a wider global trend for self-directed retirement savings. Government measures, known as “pension freedoms” came into force in Britain in April 2015 giving individual a lot more control over their retirement cash.   The number of go-it-alone investors in Australia has been climbing over the last decade, according to Lisa Greig, from Taxpayers Australia, a nonprofit organisation representing tax accountants and small businesses. Official statistics show self-managed funds now account for almost a third of all superannuation, or pension, nest-eggs in Australia. A decade ago that figure stood at just 10%. The reason? Australia’s ageing population and rising living costs are putting huge pressure on household budgets, (as people live longer lives they still need to accumulate enough savings to pay for food, utilities, insurance.) In addition, more Australians want a greater say in how their finances are managed. These self-funded retirees believe they can get better returns by spreading their money between assets such as property, debentures (debt products issued by large firms) vintage cars or even fine art, in addition to stocks. Large pension funds don’t offer investors this breadth of investments and often rely more heavily on equities performance to generate returns. While the majority of Australians trust their retirement income to funds run by specific companies or industries (education and health care account for 19% of the superannuation market), or retail funds managed by financial institutions or the insurance sector (around 28% of all superannuation), doing it yourself is clearly not for everyone. Those taking the plunge must be financially literate and willing to do their research, Greig said. “It comes down to the effort you want to put in,” she explained. “You’ve got to put the training in if you want to run a marathon, well, you’ve got to put the training in if you want to get the right result from your self-managed superannuation fund. The buck stops with you so you’ve got to take that responsibility.” Tim Harcourt, an economist at the University of New South Wales Business School said, “The main pitfall is you have to do the administration yourself and be more vigilant in watching the markets — instead of sitting back and letting the professionals do it for you. It’s not necessarily more risky — self-managed super funds (SMSF) have been performing well compared to industry and retail funds but you have to be engaged and have a good grasp of financial information to be successful.” Pensions deconstructed Australia has various provisions for those approaching old age. Most people over the age of 65 are entitled to an age-pension, which is means-tested and they don’t have to contribute to. Designed as a measure to prevent poverty, about a quarter of retirees aren’t eligible to receive the benefit because they are too wealthy. In 1990 Australia introduced a compulsory pre-funded pension plan called superannuation, a scheme that employers must pay in to on behalf of their workers. Those contributions currently equate to 9.5% of an employee’s wage, this will likely rise to near 12% by July 2025. The scheme was created by the government to provide the country’s ageing and longer-living population with a decent income in retirement. It’s a similar structure to schemes run in Chile and Sweden. Compulsory superannuation, introduced more than 25 years ago, has thrown up new challenges for retirees. Never before have so many older Australians had the opportunity to shape their financial futures. Since the compulsory system came into effect the superannuation industry has amassed funds worth more than A$1tn (US$717.8bn), and laws allowing self-managed funds handed over power to Australians that previous generations never had. In their own hands These self-funded retirees say caution is key and a clear long-term strategy and an aversion to unnecessary risk are crucial. A sense of calm is needed, too. Arnie Bates, who migrated from Britain in 1985, said it has been important to learn not to panic. “You must not be too nervous when things go the wrong way in the market,” Bates said. “Yeah, you win some, you lose some. On average we are ahead but at the moment to make more than the cost of living is very, very hard and it is pushing a lot of retirees into risky investments, unfortunately.” Bates, in his late 60s, retired after a long career in the textile, footwear and clothing industry in 2011. It was a five-year stint working in Indonesia that convinced him that he had the knowledge and confidence to take control of his money in retirement. Bates said he holds at least two year’s worth of living expenses in cash to weather downturns in the stock market. Not everyone is so fortunate or so savvy. For those who want to learn more about investing, the Australian Tax Office offers advice to retirees, while information services such as the Eureka Report and professional financial advisers offer guidance. The risks For many investors, the thought of handling their own finances may fill them with fear. “The real risk is people taking control of their [superannuation] funds without any formal or appropriate advice, and thinking they know a little bit about everything, which is dangerous,” explained Jason Sourasis, managing director of Strategic Financial group, which encourages self-managed portfolios for Australians with funds only in excess of A$500,000 (US$360,000). In Australia, many retirees who go solo with their finances hand-pick an advisor to help them navigate through a complex maze of regulations and rules, and tax legislation that can be hard for outsiders to follow. “A lot of people probably take [on] too much risk at the wrong times not knowing anything about the investment markets or the volatility that comes with different asset classes,” Sourasis told BBC Capital. Professor John Piggott from the University of New South Wales Business School worries that some self-funded retirees might find themselves out of their depth. “It is not a responsibility that previous generations have faced. That contributes to its lack of familiarity amongst people of this age and its scariness.  It leads to a lot of apprehension and, in some cases, very poor decision-making,” he said. Successes and failures Neville Daynes, a former school principal in Melbourne, says his portfolio, which comprises cash accounts, property and shares, incurs accounting and audit costs of less than 1%, well below the 2.5% charged by larger institutions. Daynes says he is organised and stays on top of his paperwork.  Like fellow retiree Arnie Bates, he takes a cautious approach and says he never holds more than 5% of his portfolio in any one share or investment. “There were a couple of times when I got hit during the credit squeeze …,” said Daynes. “It takes quite a bit of work and you have to work on a strategy, so it is not for everybody.” Though taking the driving seat is an increasing popular approach to retirement planning, there are horror stories. A decade ago, Kerry Koliadis, an immigrant from Greece, retired after a 44-year career in the cardboard-box making industry. After seeing friends and colleagues lose money in the stock market, the 74-year old retiree from Sydney ploughed most of his retirement money into the local taxi industry, buying licences that allow him to run taxi services. Koliadis said competition from ride sharing service Uber has had a catastrophic effect.  “I bought three taxi licences for approximately A$250,000 (US$179,000) each but now the price has dropped by more than A$100,000 (US$72,000) each,” he explained. “This is not the right thing for somebody in retirement to face, and I say my prayers, my friend.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."

market volatility,Snapshot shows economic strategy progress,2024-09-15,2023-12-24,By Alex Blake,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-67801940,"The Manx government's economic strategy has shown ""signs of growth"" in its first year, the chief minister has said. The 10-to-15-year plan was launched in November 2022 with a number of targets to grow the working population. Alfred Cannan said the report was an ""overarching snapshot"" of  ""early indicators of progress"".  He said despite the ""economic challenges"" the report had shown things were moving forward positively. However Mr Cannan said there was ""still work to do over the coming years to ensure long term security, vibrancy and sustainability"", and the ""full value"" of the strategy would be ""felt over the long-term"". Government hopes to grow the population to 100,000 by 2037 and create 5,000 new employment opportunities.  The report said jobs had risen by 3% since November 2022 with 1,500 new roles, and there was a ""general trend of population growth"" with an average 90 to 100 more people each quarter. The plan's next target is to reach 1,800 new jobs by 2026. The first year report outlined that government had received an estimated £40m ahead of what was budgeted in income tax receipts, however a final figure on that would be announced in February's budget. It also stated market volatility and ""some large expenditures"" had effected the government's ""externally invested reserves"", which had fallen from more than £2bn in 2021 to £1.7m in 2023. Next year's focus was redesigning the Department for Enterprise's support schemes, which were ""a key factor"" in attracting and growing businesses, the report stated. Treasury Minister Alex Allinson said the year had seen ""growing numbers of people employed, new housing developments going through planning approval, and increasing tax receipts"". While the island had tackled cost of living challenges throughout 2023, he said there were positive signs of economic strength. The report will be presented to Tynwald in January.

market volatility,The biggest threat to India’s growth?,2024-09-15,2017-05-19,Edd Gent,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170510-why-automation-could-be-a-threat-to-indias-growth,"Smart machines, robots, and other forms of automation could either be an economic poison or cure in a developing country like India – and this change will affect how businesses worldwide outsource work. Ravi is one of thousands of Indian IT workers who will lose their jobs this year, caught between a slump in India’s previously booming IT industry and new technology threatening to replace human workers. Until last month he worked at Cognizant Technology Solutions – a firm headquartered in the US but with the bulk of its workforce in India. The company is under pressure to cut costs and is expected to shed between 6,000 and 10,000 'underperformers' this year. Market volatility and rising protectionism in countries like the USA, where much of India’s IT outsourcing work comes from, saw Cognizant’s revenue grow at its slowest pace in two decades last year, and its peers in the Indian IT industry are in the same boat. But at the same time, rapidly improving automation technology is allowing software to carry out routine IT support work and repetitive back office tasks previously performed by humans – the very tasks global companies originally outsourced to India to take advantage of cheaper labour. In February, Cognizant’s CFO said it would “aggressively” employ automation to “optimise” its services. Meanwhile, India’s third-largest IT firm, Infosys, said automation allowed it to shift 9,000 workers from low-skill jobs to more advanced projects, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, last year. Its competitor Wipro redeployed 3,200 in 2016, and predicts it will move another 4,500 this year. Yet this has been accompanied by a significant slowing in hiring. IT body Nasscom’s annual review predicted a 20-to-25% reduction in jobs in the industry over the next three years. “Cognizant has not conducted any layoffs,” a Cognizant spokesperson said. “New machines and technologies are about helping cut costs, improve efficiencies, and increase sophistication in building and delivering services. They are not about altogether replacing the human element, but about elevating the role people play and the value they bring to their roles.” But it can be hard to pinpoint exactly whose jobs have been lost to automation. Researchers in the UK, for example, have shown that some roles in today’s global economy are more at risk than others.  Ravi, whose name has been changed, worked as a software tester – a role particularly vulnerable to automated takeover. ""In testing, already it has been introduced and it's coming in very fast,” he says. ""If a job requires four manual testers, automation can reduce it to one.” He’s now job hunting, but says opportunities for the kind of work he was doing before are limited and he will probably have to adapt: take a course on automated software testing and then try to secure a position. He worries this may be a repeating pattern. ""Maybe after five years some new technologies are coming and we have to learn those, too,” he says. India’s IT weak spot? Since the 1990s Indian firms have carried out back office tasks, and IT services like data entry, running call centres and testing software for foreign companies at cut-price rates by throwing cheap labour at them. But as machines become adept at this repetitive, rule-based work, the low-skill jobs – where the bulk of Indian IT workers are employed – are the most at risk. “It’s been happening for the last two or three years in an accelerated fashion,” says Gopinathan Padmanabhan, head of innovation at IT company Mphasis. “It’s a reality you can't shy away from.” This shift will go hand-in-hand with new opportunities in emerging areas – data science, artificial intelligence and big data – but these will require new skills and probably fewer employees. ""They will have to find new roles and train themselves to become relevant in the new age,” says Padmanabhan. “And we're not talking about too far into the future… the next three to five years.” Of course, losing jobs to automation is a concern across the developed world. But India’s case is unique. A stable job at one of the big IT companies is a major aspiration for many Indians, which probably explains why fears of technological unemployment have featured so prominently in newspapers here in recent months. But despite contributing 9.3% of the country’s GDP, according to Nasscom, the IT industry only employs 3.7 million of the nation’s roughly half a billion working adults. So how big of a threat is it actually to the Indian workforce? World Bank data estimates 69% of today’s jobs in India are threatened by automation. And India isn’t alone: China’s figure was 77% and other developing countries also scored highly. India is already struggling to create jobs amid rapid growth. Its working-age population increased by 300 million between 1991 and 2013, according to UN figures, but the number of people employed only rose by 140 million. Still, robots replacing jobs en masse is unrealistic in the medium term in India – or anywhere else – but the effects are already being felt. Last September, Indian textiles giant Raymond said it would replace 10,000 jobs with robots over three years. Union leader Vinodh Kumar works at BMW’s factory in Chennai – India’s automotive hub. His facility isn’t in danger of automation, but he knows union leaders at Hyundai’s plant where the entire body shop and most of the paint shop was automated. “The majority of the body shop employees lost their jobs,” he said. “The permanent employees they tried to relocate, but the contract labourers and the trainees lost their jobs.” Other sectors at risk include pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, logistics and security. Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys, says it is unlikely to impact high-skill jobs like architects or high-quality coders, or even lower-end jobs in the service industry like restaurant staff and hairdressers. ""The fat middle is at threat, which is rule-based work. Like work in banks, work in offices, work in factories,” he says. ‘Hollowing out’ the middle class The World Bank’s 2016 World Development Report noted a global trend towards “hollowing out” of the labour force. As technology streamlines routine tasks, middle-skill jobs like clerical workers and machine operators decline while both high-skill and low-skill ones increase. And in developing nations like India, that can be a huge problem. ""Those middle-skill jobs have traditionally been the path out of poverty,” says World Bank senior economist Indhira Santos. “So that polarisation into the labour market could translate into a polarisation of society and income.” This trend isn’t down to technology alone – globalisation and urbanisation contribute. But pulling away “the ladder to the middle class”, as the report puts it, could be particularly damaging in a developing country like India. After all, there is a reason why companies are turning to new technologies. “Automation is an imperative to improve competitiveness, quality and efficiency,” says CEO of Siemens’ India Sunil Mathur. That helps compete against cheap imports, boost exports and increases domestic demand and therefore jobs, he says. Samay Kohli, co-founder of home-grown warehouse robotics company Grey Orange, agrees. India lags well behind the developed world on labour productivity, which acts as a major handbrake on growth. “You have to automate to be globally competent,” he says. “If we don't improve our infrastructure, our productivity we will not have a chance to compete globally.” Grey Orange builds ‘Butler’ robots that fetch and store products and ‘Sorters’ that automatically scan and sort packages in the warehouses of e-commerce and logistics giants like Flipkart, Jabong and DTDC. Kohli says the Butler can pick up to 600 items an hour. That eclipses the 100 items a human worker can manage – invaluable efficiency in a country where supply chain costs are double those of Western countries. Increasing worker productivity could stifle employment, but Kohli claims they are simply filling gaps. Annual staff turnover in warehousing is 300%, he says. Rural Indians come looking for better earnings, but onerous targets, low wages and urban living costs mean they rarely last long. But robots are harder to sway. Kohli claims job numbers in their facilities have stayed level, but attrition has reduced. “This labour is just brute labour,” he says. “Even though they're doing jobs, they never get out of poverty. When they start using these kinds of collaborative robots in the mix they work better, more efficiently and are happier with their jobs."" Heads of IBM Research India Sriram Raghavan agrees that in a developing country like India, automation normally fills gaps rather than replacing people. India has 330,000 fewer doctors than the WHO’s minimum recommendation, but Raghavan says automation can help plug this kind of talent shortage. Smart machines combined with the internet could allow doctors and teachers to provide personalised services to many more people than they can today. The plight of IT workers like Ravi, though, demonstrates that automation is already encroaching on areas without gaps to be filled. Pai says India has the luxury of time compared to developed countries, as labour will remain cheaper than automation for a decade, and huge unmet demand for infrastructure and services can produce lots of jobs. But the World Bank report highlights an ever-accelerating race between skills and technology and that countries like India need to act now to future-proof their populations’ capabilities. Future-proofing jobs from robots With automation taking on the routine tasks at the heart of today’s workplace, the jobs of the future will focus on skills like critical thinking, collaboration and creativity. India’s education system has a reputation for learning by rote and Indian Institute of Technology Madras engineering professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala agrees most institutions aren’t adequately preparing young people. But things are changing. He leads a government-sponsored pilot where professors from leading colleges use virtual labs to teach students at struggling engineering colleges. And start-ups are introducing extra-curricular robotics classes teaching problem-solving skills vital for future jobs. Most importantly, he says the country’s young population is sharp, adaptable, and future-oriented. ""If automation displaces one thing they move to another,” he says. “They are recognising the need to continually upskill.” IBM’s Raghavan says smart machines that automatically analyse students' performance and preferences can help guide them through this fast-moving terrain by combining data on their skills with job opportunities and available courses. He says: ""Then it’s less about a race, but getting people on a journey. Maybe the skill profile changes every five years rather than every 10, but at the same time technology is helping navigate that landscape."" That may sound like blue-sky thinking, but in February, Microsoft and LinkedIn announced Project Sangam – a programme providing LinkedIn training, with progress automatically added to profiles so companies can shortlist candidates, as well as personalised job recommendations. Resistance is futile Jhunjhunwala thinks India’s development challenges are so large, it needs all the help it can get. And fighting automation is futile anyway. ""The changes going on in the world, including automation, are not something decided by us – but it's going to happen,"" he says. ""We don’t want to be passive and let automation impact us. We want to develop something with this automation."" And in the race between technology and skills – as India tries to keep pace with the very technology that helped launch its economy on the world stage – he thinks the country has a secret weapon: a deeper value placed on education than in the West. After all, the pinnacle of India’s ancient caste system was the educated Brahmin priest – not the Kshatriya warrior. ""It's part of our Indian heritage,"" says Pai. ""India is the only civilisation in the world where the educated gurus were placed on the totem pole higher than the king. In all other nations, soldiers and might ruled and knowledge bowed to the mighty. In India, knowledge is above the might of the state.""

market volatility,Why batteries are the new power plants,2024-09-15,2020-12-18,Cheryl Katz,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201217-renewable-power-the-worlds-largest-battery,"The advent of ""big battery"" technology addresses a key challenge for green energy – the intermittency of wind and solar. The twin smokestacks of the Moss Landing Power Plant tower over Monterey Bay. Visible for miles along this picturesque stretch of the north Californian coast, the 500-foot-tall (150m) pillars crown what was once California's largest electric power station – a behemoth natural gas-fired generator. Today, as California steadily moves to decarbonise its economy, those stacks are idle and the plant is largely mothballed. Instead, the site is about to begin a new life as the world's largest battery, storing excess energy when solar panels and wind farms are producing electricity and feeding it back into the grid when they're not. Inside a cavernous turbine building, a 300-megawatt lithium-ion battery is currently being readied for operation, with another 100-megawatt battery to come online in 2021. These aren't the only super-sized batteries that will soon be operating at the Moss Landing plant. An additional 182.5 megawatts produced by 256 Tesla megapack batteries are scheduled to begin feeding into California's electric grid in mid-2021, with plans to eventually add enough capacity at the site to power every home in nearby San Francisco for six hours, according to the Bay Area utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, which will own and operate the system. Elsewhere in California, a 250-megawatt storage project went online this year in San Diego, construction has begun on a 150-megawatt system near San Francisco, a 100-megawatt battery project is nearing completion in Long Beach, and a number of others are in various stages of development around the state. California is currently the global leader in the effort to balance the intermittency of renewable energy in electric grids with utility-scale batteries, but the rest of the world is rapidly following suit. Recently announced plans range from a 409-megawatt system in South Florida, to a 320-megawatt plant near London in the UK, to a 200-megawatt facility in Lithuania and a 112-megawatt unit in Chile. Driven by steeply falling prices and technological progress that allows batteries to store ever-larger amounts of energy, grid-scale systems are seeing record growth. Many of the gains are spillovers from the auto industry's race to build smaller, cheaper, and more powerful lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. In the US, state clean-energy mandates, along with tax incentives for storage systems that are paired with solar installations, are also playing an important role. The mass deployment of storage could overcome one of the biggest obstacles to renewable energy – its cycling between oversupply when the sun shines or the wind blows, and shortage when the Sun sets or the wind drops. By smoothing imbalances between supply and demand, proponents say, batteries can replace fossil fuel ""peaker"" plants that kick in for a few hours a day when energy demands soar. As such, widespread energy storage could be key to expanding the reach of renewables and speeding the transition to a carbon-free power grid. ""Energy storage is actually the true bridge to a clean-energy future,"" says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. You might also like: How quickly that future arrives depends in large part on how rapidly costs continue to fall. Already the price tag for utility-scale battery storage in the US has plummeted, dropping nearly 70% between 2015 and 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. This sharp price drop has followed advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry to significantly improve performance. Battery capacity has expanded too, with facilities able to store and discharge energy over ever-longer periods of time. Market competition and rising battery production also play a major role; a projection by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory sees mid-range costs for lithium-ion batteries falling an additional 45% between 2018 and 2030. ""We're almost entirely piggybacking on the growth of lithium-ion battery technology, which is driven mostly by electric vehicles and consumer electronics,"" says Ray Hohenstein, market applications director for Fluence, an energy storage technology provider with projects totalling nearly 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) set to come online in California within a year. The money put into research for those applications is driving down costs across the board, says Hohenstein. ""It's just like what we saw with solar panels."" In California, falling battery prices, coupled with the state's aggressive push toward a carbon-free electrical grid by 2045, have led to a packed pipeline of storage projects. A 2013 bill set a target of 1.325 gigawatts of storage to be commissioned for the state's grid by 2020. With 1.5 gigawatts of projects now approved – including more than 500 megawatts installed so far – that goal has already been surpassed, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. When the gigantic Moss Landing project becomes fully operational in mid-2021, it will more than double the amount of energy storage in California. Several other states are also now embarking on major energy storage projects. Among them: New York's 316-megawatt Ravenswood project will be able to power more than 250,000 homes for up to eight hours, replacing two natural gas peaker plants in the New York City borough of Queens. And the 409-megawatt Manatee system planned for South Florida will be charged by an adjacent solar plant. The facility, which utility Florida Power and Light says will be the world's largest solar-powered battery system, replaces two aging natural-gas-fired units. As a whole, the US's utility-scale battery power is set to grow from 1.2 gigawatts in 2020 to nearly 7.5 gigawatts in 2025, according to Wood MacKenzie, a natural resources research and consulting firm. Kelly Speakes-Backman, chief executive of the US Energy Storage Association, says that battery storage additions doubled in 2020, and would likely have tripled had it not been for construction slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Europe has been slower to get on board with storage. ""In general, Europe is a bit more conservative"" when it comes to such developments, says Daniele Gatti, analyst for IDTechEx, a UK-based market research firm specialising in emerging technology. Energy storage development in Europe has been hindered by a restrictive electricity market dominated by government auctions that tend to undervalue storage, she says. Still, some big-battery projects are now taking shape, including the 320-megawatt Gateway system to be built at a new port facility near London. Globally, Gatti projects rapid growth in energy storage, reaching 1.2 terawatts (1,200 gigawatts) in the next decade. Key players include Australia, which in 2017 became the first nation to install major battery storage on its grid with the 100-megawatt Hornsdale Power Reserve, and is now planning to add another 300 megawatts near Victoria. The new system will dispatch electricity between states on an as-needed basis, maximising the efficiency of existing transmission infrastructure and reducing the need for building new power lines that would sit idle most of the time. A similar projects are gearing up in Baden-Württemberg, south-west Germany. And while the US's Moss Landing is set to be the world's largest battery, it may be so for long. Saudi Arabia has just announced a bid for that title, with a massive solar-plus-storage system on the country's west coast. The facility will provide 100% renewable energy around the clock to a resort complex of 50 hotels and 1,300 homes being built along the Red Sea. With a recent report concluding that most fossil fuel power plants in the US will reach the end of their working life by 2035, experts say that the time for rapid growth in industrial-scale energy storage is at hand. Yiyi Zhou, a renewable power systems specialist at Bloomberg NEF, says that renewables combined with battery storage are already an economically viable alternative to building new gas peaker plants. Pairing electricity generation with storage works especially well with solar energy, which generally follows a predictable daily pattern. And, says Zhou, as more solar energy enters the grid, the cost of operating gas plants actually goes up. ""That's mainly because [gas plants] are forced to cycle on and off much more now because of solar penetration,"" Zhou says. ""This adds wear-and-tear, and shortens their lifetime."" Batteries are even beginning to reach a size – around 200 megawatts – that enables renewables to replace small- to medium-sized natural gas generators, says Fluence's Hohenstein. ""Now we're able to truly build these hybrid resources – solar, storage, wind – and do the job that was traditionally done by fossil fuel power plants,"" says Hohenstein, whose company is seeing a surge of interest in large projects. Adding storage also makes renewable energy more profitable, says Wesley Cole, an energy analyst with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ""One of the challenges of renewable energy is the more you put on the grid, the more the value declines,"" Cole says. Storage helps deal with that by soaking up excess energy that would have been lost in the middle of the day, when electricity demand is lower, and moving it to a time when it is more valuable. While energy storage is thriving in high-value markets, such as California, battery prices still need to come down more to reach large-scale global deployment. Yet analysts are optimistic that battery prices will eventually drop low enough for widespread energy storage use. ""We see storage being a large player across effectively every future we look at,"" says Cole. ""And not just one or two gigawatts… but tens to hundreds of gigawatts."" -- This article was originally published by Yale e360, and is republished with permission – read the original story here.

market volatility,How long-haul travel may change,2024-09-15,2022-05-16,Ashley Nunes,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220513-how-long-haul-travel-will-change-post-covid,"Airlines are rethinking long-haul travel as passengers cautiously return to flying. What’s likely to change? Australian flag carrier Qantas made history recently by ferrying passengers nonstop between South America and Australia. The aeroplane – a Boeing 787 Dreamliner – departed Buenos Aires shortly past noon local time. Some 9,300 miles (14.973km) and 17-plus hours later, QF 14 landed in Darwin. In doing so, the carrier set two internal records: longest distance covered and longest time in the air for a commercial flight. Captain Alex Passerini, who commanded QF 14, later said: ""Qantas has always stepped up to a challenge, especially when it comes to long-haul travel, and this flight is an excellent example of the capabilities and attention to detail of our flight planning team."" Contrary to popular belief, flying for so many hours isn't entirely new. In the 1930s, Pan Am airliners hopscotched across the Pacific Ocean with regularity. Passengers on board the Honolulu clipper could expect 20-hour flight times when shuttling between Hawaii and the continental United States. Qantas followed suit a decade later. In 1943, the Flying Kangaroo launched service between Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Australia, its flying boats taking up to 33 hours to complete the trip. Passengers who did were subsequently admitted to ""The Rare and Secret Order of the Double Sunrise"", so named because of the two sunrises they would see during the trip. The 21st Century has seen the long-haul, nonstop trend continue. In 2004, Singapore Airlines made headlines when it launched service between New York and Singapore; a 9,500-plus mile (15,289km) haul that can – depending on prevailing winds – take up to 19 hours. Less punishing (though not by much) is Qatar Airways’ Doha to Auckland, New Zealand service which clocks in at 9,000 miles (14,484km). Passengers on board the Boeing 777 cross 10 time zones and virtually the entire length of the Indian Ocean, continental Australia, and the Tasman Sea before arriving in the City of Sails. Trip time? 18 hours. Similar feats of flight are expected later this year when United and American Airlines launch services between the United States and India. You might also like: Fun stuff, minus the indignities of air travel of course. For one thing, there is nothing appealing about being sealed in a long metal tube. Do so for ever-longer periods and you are likely to end up grumpy. When passengers are grumpy, flying becomes less fun; and if something isn’t fun, why do it? Early flyers were more fortunate. High fares limited who could fly, the result being a select few could experience luxurious service for hours. Today’s flyers want to fly further, faster, and in style, all while paying less. Catering to these demands requires innovative thinking and airlines are increasingly investing in products that will keep long-haul passengers happy. Here are three of them. Engine technology Jets need fuel, lots of it. The Boeing 747 – an icon of the long-haul travel era – burns jet fuel at an astounding rate of one gallon per second (4.54 litres per second). Consequently, to keep jets like this flying for hours, you need a large petrol tank. Aeroplanes like the Boeing 747 carry upwards of 57,000 gallons (259,127 litres) of fuel (the record holder is the Antonov An-225 which can carry nearly 100,000 gallons, or 454,000 litres). By comparison, the average four-door Sedan holds closer to 15 gallons (62.2 litres). A bigger tank may help you go further but expect your gas bills to be heftier. At current gas prices, topping off the average Sedan will cost you $50 (£37.30); a Boeing 747, upwards of $140,000 (£104,480). Such weighty expenses bode badly for passengers, much of whose cash goes toward paying airline fuel costs. Making things worse is volatility in the energy market which can cause massive swings in fuel prices. For example, a one cent change in fuel prices can produce a $40m (£29.8m) profit (or loss) for carriers.   But help is on the way. Engine manufacturers are studying – and succeeding – at making their products more efficient. A more efficient engine means less fuel burn, and less fuel burn lowers airline costs and (ideally), fares. Agnes Jocher, a professor of sustainable future mobility at the Technical University of Munich, says improvements in so-called ‘bypass ratios’ are key to lowering fuel use. This ratio indicates how much air flows around the engine versus through it. Jocher says, ""generally speaking, the higher the ratio, the more efficient the engine. The more efficient engine, the lower its fuel consumption."" Today’s jets burn on average 60% less fuel than the first generation of commercial aircraft, thanks in large part to bypass ratios improvements. Jocher expects this trend to continue as airlines keen to go long-haul, nonstop explore ways to trim costs. When it comes to saving fuel, she notes, ""higher bypass ratios are key"". Losing weight An efficient engine can help you burn less gas. But so can shedding weight. The reason comes down to simple physics. It takes more energy to move more mass. A heavier aeroplane will – all else being equal – burn more jet fuel than a lighter one. A lighter jet can also fly faster, shaving precious minutes off a flight. That bodes well for the airline (keen to maximise aeroplane productivity) and passengers (eager to arrive at their destination sooner). One way to curb aircraft weight is foregoing wiring and cables. These devices act as the connective tissue for jetliners, forming crucial links between the cockpit and aircraft systems like the landing gear, door sensors, and life support systems. The problem? They are heavy. By one estimate, wires, switches, and sockets can add over 16,000 lbs (7.2 tonnes) to a wide-body passenger jet. And more weight means more fuel burn. The solution? ""Fly-by-wireless"" systems, lightweight electronic technology which connects the cockpit and crucial aircraft control systems via the airwaves. Qantas recently took a more creative approach to shedding pounds. The carrier tasked industrial designer David Caon with creating a new line of in-flight cutlery and crockery. A key requirement? The assortment of plates, dishes, and utensils would have to be lighter than their predecessors. Achieving this feat was – to put it mildly – challenging. Caon says he and his team were ""not able to reduce the thickness of the crockery as this would affect its durability"". Instead, the team redesigned each piece to""“reduce profiles and minimise sections and use less material overall"". Caon describes the effort as a delicate balancing act to preserve ""functionality, durability, and weight"". These efforts paid off. The tableware – which debuted on Qantas’ 17-hour-long Perth to London route – was 11% lighter than its predecessors, producing ""great fuel saving benefits"". The new tableware was so popular Qantas subsequently used it across its entire network. Finessed food Aeroplanes are – despite the best mechanical innovations – cramped, noisy flying chunks of metal. And despite the inherent wonder of flight, if you've ever flown for hours, you know how boring plane travel can be. Airlines have responded by beefing up onboard amenities (including showers), entertainment (imagine having 4,500 TV and audio channels to choose from), and most notably, improved cuisine. For example, some passengers on the 17-hour trek between Los Angeles and Singapore are treated to a food spectacle, one that would rival dining at the best Michelin-starred restaurants. Orange-braised baby beet salad with endive, cherry tomatoes, and pine nuts? Perhaps citrus salmon over pumpkin dal, basmati rice and cilantro ghee? And spiced apple cake to finish? It's a far cry from the unrecognisable, reheated meals of the past. But just because food sounds good doesn’t mean taste follows suit. When flying high above the clouds, your normal sense of taste goes out the window. The often touted culprits are pressure drops (there’s less air at altitude) and plummeting humidity (cabin air is generally drier than the Sahara Desert). By one estimate, the combination of low pressure and dryness dulls your taste buds by 30%. However, there’s less talked about reason for waning palate sensitivity. A recent study found loud noise can cause savoury taste to be enhanced, and sweetness dulled. The study’s authors chalk it up to the noise-induced suppression of intense flavours which ultimately ""alter the perception of the foods we eat"". Their proposed fix? Rethinking menus to match taste preferences at altitude so passengers can – despite the constant buzzing of jet engines – better taste their food. Given the billions airlines are investing in going long-haul, spending a little more on ""menu diligence"" may well be a bargain. The Covid-19 pandemic has understandably depressed air travel demand. Closed borders and ever-changing testing requirements are less than enticing for any traveller. But as border restrictions ease, and as demand picks up, expect renewed interested in long-haul flight. Qantas – sensing passenger appetite for arriving sooner rather than later – has already renewed its commitment to ""Project Sunrise"", an ambitious effort to fly nonstop from its Sydney hub to prized markets like London, New York and Paris.

market volatility,The battle over an accent mark,2024-09-15,2016-02-16,Agnès Poirier,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160215-the-circumflex-a-battle-over-an-accent-mark,"A controversy brewing in France over a decision to eliminate the circumflex highlights fears about ‘English taking over’. Agnes Poirier takes a closer look. It took France completely by surprise. On 4 February the French learned that a spelling reform  – approved in 1990 but never implemented – would be taught in schools starting in September and will be featured in all new school manuals. The French are notoriously touchy, or sentimental, about their language but on realising that the circumflex accent was at risk of disappearing from 2000 French words (ie 3% of the French lexicon), they reacted with anger. Social networks were suddenly inundated with the hashtag #Circonflexe and #JeSuisCirconflexe, in a nod to #JeSuisCharlie, which became a rallying cry of defiance after the 2015 terrorist attacks against the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo. What the French quite literally meant was that they took this spelling reform as an attack on their language, which they deem as serious as an attack on their freedom of speech. Used by the state as a unifying tool, the French language was instrumental in the birth of the modern French nation. It is a powerful ingredient of the French identity and one the French people have always felt passionate about. What is the circumflex accent? Indicated by the sign ^, it is placed over a vowel to show that the vowel or syllable containing it must be pronounced in a certain way. In French, the vowel so marked has a certain grave and long sound quality. The circumflex accent adds a certain musicality to a word; some would argue it confers poetry to words. More practically, it can also change the meaning of a word. ‘Mûr’ means ‘mature’, while ‘mur’ means ‘wall’; ‘jeûne’ means fasting while ‘jeune’ means young.The spelling reform put forward in 1990 by the Conseil supérieur de la langue française (High Council of the French Language), and vetted by the Académie Française, never actually aimed to kill the circumflex or to become compulsory. It originally proposed to “fix some anomalies” and to somehow standardise and simplify certain quirks of the French language. For instance, it suggested to remove the circumflex from above the letters ‘i’ and ‘u’ where the accent does not change the pronunciation nor the meaning of the word, as in ‘paraître’ (to appear) or ‘coût’ (cost). It also recommended to regroup compound nouns and get rid of the hyphen as in ‘porte-monnaie’, thus becoming ‘portemonnaie’ (purse). ‘Compound nouns without a hyphen? Looks ugly and lazy’ was the universal reaction on social networks, as if it was an admission that textspeak is now the norm.Word warThe French felt a pang in the heart at the thought of the disappearing circumflex and hyphens but the last straw came when they heard the suggestion that the ‘i' in ‘oignon’ (onion) should be dropped. The controversial Education Minister Najat Vallaut-Belkacem, attacked and accused on social networks of wanting to dumb down the French language, fought back by replying that the reform didn’t come from the Ministry but the Académie Française itself.The Académie, in turn, snapped back that it had only approved certain aspects of the proposal issued by the High Council of the French Language, an independent body. It reminded the French public that it was always on the side of the language, against all spelling simplifications for the sake of it, and that the actual usage of a language couldn’t simply be passed by decrees and laws. In football, they would call this argument a draw.

In football, they would call this argument a draw. In fact, French dictionaries already carry both old and new spellings, and teachers have been advised to accept both old and new spelling as correct. So many ask, “Why change?” “It will only confuse teachers and pupils even more,” deplored the well-known French literary critic Bernard Pivot. “And further confusion will spring from the fact that pupils will be taught one thing at school and will read another in novels.” Who will they trust more: their manuals or Balzac? This very French controversy however travelled fast and far, and seemed to strike a chord with France’s neighbours. The German media, for instance, seemed fascinated by the French circumflex. Perhaps because it reminded them of their own botched spelling reform of 1996, the Rechtschreibreform, opposed by a majority of teachers, writers and newspapers such as the prestigious Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The reform originally aimed to systematise the correspondence between sounds and letters and simplify hyphenated spellings. A battle ensued, international committees of German language experts were formed, campaigners even brought the matter to the courts and in 2004, a purged version of the reform was implemented and old and new spellings were both deemed acceptable. The passion and volatility around languages may also increasingly have to do with the creeping presence and use of English terms in European languages. Italians, for instance, have always been very liberal in their use of English words, and seemingly unconcerned by the slow impoverishment of their language. They now feel however, that they might have gone too far. Their Prime Minister, the 40-year-old Matteo Renzi, has an English word for every reform he proposes, and almost every financial topic he debates in Parliament: ‘Jobs Act’, the ‘Stepchild Adoption’, ‘Bail In’ and ‘Spending Review’ to name but a few. This is beginning to get on many Italians’ nerves. In February, Italy’s daily centre-left newspaper La Repubblica ran a double page with the headline “In altre parole” (in other words), suggesting that Anglicism should be nipped in the bud, and not be used by politicians and legislators in official texts, especially when Italian equivalents exist. This only encourages the wider public to use them too, and it becomes impossible to counter them. A campaign and petition with the hashtag #DilloInItaliano (Say it in Italian) gathered 70,000 signatures in just a few hours. There was one time though in the early 17th Century when the Italian language was considered the malevolent influence. If Cardinal Richelieu founded the Académie Française in 1635, it was primarily to fight back the rampant Italianisation of the French language.

market volatility,Click Energy set to up electricity prices by 16%,2024-09-15,2021-09-09,By Richard Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58505592,"Click Energy is increasing electricity prices by 16% from 1 October, according to the Consumer Council.  The rise affects customers on a variable rate tariff and is expected to increase the average bill by about £100 a year. The company is the latest energy provider to announce price hikes.  On Wednesday, Firmus energy announced a 35% increase on gas tariffs in the Ten Towns Network, to take effect from the same date. SSE Airtricity customers will also see a price rise from October. The Consumer Council said it was the second increase by Click Energy this month.  A 9% price rise came into effect on 1 September.   Raymond Gormley, Consumer Council head of energy policy, said the news would ""adversely impact all Click Energy customers already experiencing financial pressures on their household budget especially considering it is the second increase by the supplier in one month"". ""Any consumers who are experiencing financial difficulty and are struggling with their energy bills should contact Click Energy to find out how they can help during this time. The Consumer Council said it would encourage all consumers to shop around to get the best energy deal.  ""Click Energy have stated that there will be no exit fee applied to customers who switch supplier before 30 September 202,"" he said.  A spokesperson for Click Energy said the wholesale energy market was experiencing ""unprecedented volatility with prices at all-time record highs for extended periods of time"".   ""This unparalleled environment means that energy suppliers have to make difficult decisions which unfortunately negatively impact consumers."""
market volatility,Dow sheds more than 4% twice in week,2024-09-15,2018-02-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42991310,"Wall Street shares slid sharply again on Thursday, compounding losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 which started last week.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, plunging 4.15% to 23,860. The S&P 500 dropped 100.6 points or 3.75% to 2,581, while the Nasdaq slid 274.8 points or 3.9% to 6,777.1. The moves follow a day of losses on all key European exchanges. The 100 share index in London closed down 1.49% at 7,170.69 points. Germany and France fell 2.6% and 2% respectively. The dive extends a sell-off that started last week, as investors started to worry that inflation might rise more quickly than expected, leading policymakers to raise interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for that view. The bank left interest rates where they were at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying markets was a government budget proposal US lawmakers in Congress have announced, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Shares in financial, technology and consumer companies led the declines on Thursday, which infected every sector. American Express and Intel were the two biggest losers on the Dow. Analysts, who have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices, urged calm. ""The latest decline takes us back to where we were 17 November,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. ""We've just given back some recent gains, not wiped out anyone's life savings.""  But the declines have led to questions for President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly boasted of the market's rapid rise in value last year. The White House said on Thursday markets were reacting to data that is good news for the broader economy, including low unemployment and signs of wage growth. ""The president like the rest of the White House is concerned about long term economic indicators and factors,"" a White House spokesman said. ""The fundamentals in terms of the long term are very strong."""
market volatility,"Fuel prices still cause for concern, says watchdog",2024-09-15,2023-11-09,By Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67368097,"Drivers are still not getting a fair price on fuel at the pumps, the UK's competition watchdog has warned. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said prices had risen by as much as 13.9p per litre since the end of May, partly due to wholesale costs. But it said, more recently, while those costs have fallen, the retail price for petrol and diesel has not.  CMA boss Sarah Cardell said there was ""cause for concern"" that competition is not working. The findings are contained in the watchdog's first report on fuel prices following an investigation into competition in the market, which recommended a body be created to monitor what retailers are charging drivers.   The CMA found that petrol prices had increased from 142.9p per litre at the end of May to 154p per litre at the end of October, up 11.1p.  For diesel, prices rose from 147.9p per litre to 161.8p per litre over the same period, an increase of 13.9p. Wholesale oil prices rose between June, July and August, said the CMA, largely due to global pressures on the energy market.  But it said: ""Wholesale prices then reduced in September and October while retail prices did not. ""While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, this could indicate a lack of competitive response from fuel retailers if this trend continues.""  Higher food and fuel prices have been big drivers in the soaring cost of living and official figures also suggest that the price paid by drivers at the pump rose sharply in September. The CMA examined the so-called ""retail spread"" - the difference between what retailers pay to buy fuel and the price consumers are charged - between May and last month.  It discovered that there had been ""significant increases"" in the retail spread for petrol and diesel.   ""More recent trends give cause for concern that competition is still not working well in this market to hold down pump prices,"" said the CMA's Ms Cardell.  She cautioned, however, that the information contained in the report is based on voluntary information and is missing some big fuel retailers. Off the back of its investigation into the fuel market in the UK, the watchdog is calling for a new monitoring body to be created, which would have powers to demand pricing information from all retailers. The RAC said that the latest figures suggested that drivers were still ""being taken advantage of at the pumps"".  The RAC's Simon Williams said: ""It's very disappointing that the CMA has found that major fuel retailers are still taking far bigger margins than they have done in the past. ""We believe the situation is currently worse than ever as the wholesale fuel market is down significantly, yet forecourt prices are falling like the proverbial feather,"" he said, adding that any new body responsible for tracking prices would need to have the power to take action against big retailers. ""We fear little will change even then,"" he said. Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers' Association, said that he would always encourage drivers to shop around to make sure they are getting the best deal. ""With the volatility of the global fuel market, it is important that motorists are given the opportunity to search for the cheapest prices available to them,"" he said. The trade association also said that it would work closely with the competition watchdog on developing the new scheme for monitoring prices."
market volatility,Investors see bargains in BRICs,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Constance Gustke,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130906-investors-tiptoeing-into-brics,"Where some see dross, others spy gold. Case in point: BRICs. BRICs — primarily Brazil, Russia, India and China — comprise some of the largest and most-developed global emerging markets, not fared well overall this year. But they are once again being considered by investors as they take a closer look at some battered, and possibly bargain-priced, stocks. Overall, many investors have been fleeing emerging markets. For the first seven months of the year, emerging market equity funds had a net outflow of $4.5 billion, as global investors scurried back to the US and Europe, lured by the idea that US interest rates could rise — a boon to investment returns — if the Federal Reserve winds down its long-running stimulus program, as widely expected. But the decline among emerging markets stocks may be leaving some golden buying opportunities, say some experts, especially among the BRICs. Those powerhouse economies, including the core four BRIC countries, have strong fundamentals that can insulate them from some of the broader volatility. Those fundamentals include a large and expanding middle class and increasingly sophisticated, acquisition-minded companies. They also have strong gross domestic production (GDP), the measure of the value of goods and services produced within the country’s borders.  Overall, measured by purchasing-price-parity adjusted GDP, emerging markets will create $1.6 trillion more goods and services than advanced markets in 2013, according to the International Monetary Fund. “Cheap” A recent JP Morgan Asset Management emerging market research report noted that BRIC stocks currently look quite “cheap,” as country valuations hover near the bottom end of historical valuation ranges. All four BRIC countries will have higher GDP growth than the US this year, according to JP Morgan. China and Russia have relatively low debt, 31% and 12%, respectively. And China’s ample international reserves total nearly $3.5 trillion. Both countries’ GDPs are also growing: China’s growth will hit 8% this year, Russia’s 3.4%. Though there’s no sign of a comeback yet — for the first seven months of this year, the MSCI BRIC Index has plummeted 11.21% — some investors and big emerging market mutual funds, like ones run by T Rowe Price, are bargain hunting. “We accept some risk in short-term pain,” said Todd Henry, emerging market equity portfolio specialist at Maryland-based T Rowe Price. “But opportunity is there in growth.” BRIC stocks make up nearly 50% of The T Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock Fund’s $7.2 billion in assets. The fund is adding to its BRIC holdings, especially the Russian and Indian stock allocations. Chinese stocks also don’t look expensive right now, Henry said. In late August, the MSCI China Index price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) — a measure of how expensive a stock is — was only 9.75, versus 11.90 for emerging markets. Currently, the fund favours environmental companies such as wind producer China Longyuan Power Group Corp Ltd and gas company Beijing Enterprises. Despite India’s plummeting rupee, the country is also high on some investors emerging market stock lists. “India is becoming a huge buying opportunity,” said Peter Kohli, president of Pennsylvania-based DMS Funds. “The stock market is just taking a breather, but it will come back again.” The reason, he added, is that India has about 10 years of above-average growth left, partly driven by a huge, acquisition-minded middle class. Indian multinational companies such as Tata Group, Wipro Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd will have strong earnings, he said. A depreciated rupee means these companies are now on sale for emerging market investors, he added. Who should invest? Bedevilled by wild swings, emerging markets are typically best as part of well-diversified portfolios, or for value-hungry investors with reasonably long investment horizons. The small sizes of most emerging market economies mean they are vulnerable to the vagaries of global investors. “In the past, these huge investor inflows have helped prop up countries like Thailand and Vietnam,” said Jonathan Galaviz, a managing director at the Nevada-based strategy and research consultancy Galaviz & Co. “For this reason, economies in Asia have been over-heating for the past five years.” That is beginning to change. For instance, Thailand’s GDP growth is expected to slow to 4.2% in 2014 from 5.9% this year. Unlike smaller emerging markets, BRICs benefit from being big, diversified economies with highly liquid markets. Even so, they’re best played by using ETFs, say many experts. There are several BRIC ETFs to choose from, including country-specific ones like Market Vectors Russia ETF or the iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF. Alan Miller, chief investment officer at the London-based investment management firm SCM Private, also prefers ETFs. A contrarian investor, he is eyeballing investments in emerging market BRICs like Russia. One reason: The MSCI Russia Index P/E is only 5. “Yet Russia’s earnings growth isn’t falling off a cliff,” he added. Some other emerging market experts are looking further afield. Philippe Carre, global head of connectivity for SunGard’s Global Trading Business, says that some Eastern Europe countries, especially Poland and Rumania, are becoming star performers. These post-Soviet countries are seeing their exchanges grow, as more companies are listed. Yet even Carre isn’t immune to the lures of some of the BRICs. “It’s hard to avoid economic locomotives like China,” he said."
market volatility,Where does Rishi Sunak stand on the NI Protocol?,2024-09-15,2022-10-25,By Luke Sproule & Jessica Parker,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63384244,"Boris Johnson promised to ""Get Brexit Done"" but his successor inherited a bogged-down dispute about special arrangements that were agreed for Northern Ireland.  Liz Truss lasted just 49 days in office, during which time talks with the EU restarted. Now Rishi Sunak has the keys to 10 Downing Street, he too will face the ongoing row over the Northern Ireland Protocol - part of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and EU. Mr Johnson's government introduced a bill in Parliament which could override parts of the protocol - and make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. It was passed by the House of Commons and is currently being debated in the House of Lords. If passed, the bill would not only affect the UK's relationship with the EU, but also rules for businesses in Northern Ireland and the future of Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont. It collapsed in February after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) walked out in protest against the protocol, pledging not to return unless its concerns were addressed. So where does Mr Sunak stand on the protocol? The Northern Ireland Protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. But it means new checks and controls on commercial goods which come into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. It is opposed by Northern Ireland's unionist parties, who say it undermines their place in the UK. Other parties - including Sinn Féin, Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) - say the protocol is a necessary compromise to mitigate the effects of Brexit in Northern Ireland. The treaty was signed by Boris Johnson in January 2020, as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  The EU has put forward its own proposals to ease checks, insisting a wholesale renegotiation is neither possible nor necessary.  For the first time since February, meaningful talks between Brussels and London got under way in early October. It's understood progress is being made in some areas, such as trade data, but both sides are deliberately keeping discussions low key. Mr Sunak has previously been critical of the protocol and garnered recent endorsements from high-profile Brexiteers in the Conservative Party. However it has also been suggested that he favours a more conciliatory approach than some more hard-line Eurosceptic Tory MPs. In May, Mr Sunak told Bloomberg the way the protocol was operating was posing enormous challenges to ""the stability of the situation"" in Northern Ireland. He said it had become a barrier to re-establishing power sharing at Stormont. Mr Sunak said the government's preference was a negotiated settlement and added that he wanted to ensure Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom was secure. At the end of 2021, the Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Sunak urged Boris Johnson and his former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost not to ""blow up"" talks with the EU about the protocol. The paper said Mr Sunak raised concerns over the potential impact this would have had on the economy and that he did not have the same sense of ""urgency"" as others in cabinet about dealing with the protocol. The Treasury, Mr Sunak's ministry at the time, declined to comment. He did not vote on the protocol bill at its second reading but he later voted in favour at its third reading. After initially backing a return for Boris Johnson, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, a strong supporter of Brexit, supported Mr Sunak's bid for prime minister, and on Tuesday he was reappointed as secretary of state. Mr Sunak also garnered the support of prominent Eurosceptic and former chairman of the European Research Group Steve Baker, a junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office before the reshuffle. Rishi Sunak only made his first visit to Northern Ireland in the summer, attending the Tory leadership hustings at a hotel outside Belfast. While he spoke briefly about wanting to renegotiate the protocol, there was zero detail during a half-hour Q&A and he has yet to be tested on virtually all policies relating to Northern Ireland. Despite a view in Brussels that Rishi Sunak is more ""pragmatic"" than his two predecessors, there's not exactly a rush of joy at his arrival.  For one thing, diplomats are waiting to see whether this government can actually manage to stay in power, given the recent volatility.  If it can, officials aren't sure what they'll get from Mr Sunak, who backed Leave in the 2016 referendum. There's a belief he won't want the protocol dispute to escalate into a trade war, given his emphasis on economic stability. But there's also a fear he may still pursue a hard-line approach because of pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs.  Talks on how to fix issues with the protocol have been quietly bubbling along in recent weeks. And while the UK's tone did markedly soften, if you look at their purest demands it still appears impossible the EU would agree to them.  All the while, the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol Bill continues its passage through parliament.  It's part of Britain's twin-track approach; trying to re-write the treaty through talks with a back-up plan of unilaterally changing the rules if those talks don't work out (although some critics see the bill more as a crass, albeit high stakes, negotiating tactic).  But the faster that bill moves through parliament, the faster we head towards this row hotting up again.  If the legislation however gets conveniently stuck, discussions between the two sides could drag on accordingly.  The other alternative is a breakthrough in negotiations but that will, in the end, require some serious compromises, not to mention real focus from Mr Sunak who - if you go by his words on Downing Street - doesn't seem to have put this issue at the top of his in-tray.  Brussels views the protocol bill as a clear breach of international law and has urged the UK to ""step back"" from its approach.  Senior EU figures have warned that Britain risks damaging trust as well as its reputation abroad. The European Commission has launched legal action over Britain's alleged failure to implement parts of the treaty. If the bill becomes law and ministers do start changing parts of the treaty, the EU has suggested it could also impose trade sanctions.  This is why you might have heard warnings of a possible ""trade war"".  UK access to the EU's Horizon research programme has also been described as collateral damage in the dispute. There is currently a block on the UK re-joining the £81.2bn funding scheme. "
market volatility,UK exports to Ireland show 'sharp improvement',2024-09-15,2021-06-11,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-57443434,"Trade between the UK and Ireland showed a sharp improvement in April, official figures suggest. UK goods exports to Ireland were worth just over £2bn according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That was up 11% from £1.8bn in March and up by 43% on April last year. The April 2020 performance will have been unusually low due to the pandemic, but the April 2021 figure was still higher than that month in 2019 or 2018. The ONS figures do not break down UK exports between those originating in Great Britain and those coming from Northern Ireland. Ireland's Central Statistics Office does provide that breakdown and its figures suggest that since the start of the year a steep fall in imports from GB is being partly compensated by a rise in imports from NI. NI is still in the EU's single market for goods meaning that, unlike GB, it still has frictionless trade with Ireland. UK imports from Ireland were worth £1.1bn in April, little changed either on a monthly or annual basis. The ONS figures suggest that Ireland-UK trade has not suffered the same volatility as trade flows in the other direction. That may be because the UK has not yet started implementing border controls on goods."
market volatility,SSE to cut gas prices by 22.8% from April,2024-09-15,2024-03-01,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68444511,"Northern Ireland's largest provider of natural gas, SSE, is cut to its prices by 22.8% from April. SSE says a typical household customer will save £320.47 a year as a result.  Wholesale natural gas prices have fallen sharply since they peaked after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - those price falls are now starting to feed through to consumer prices. NI's largest electricity supplier Power NI is also to cut prices. They will drop by 6.3% (2p per unit) from the start of April. The company said the move reflected a fall in wholesale market costs and would save the average household customer £64 per year. Other electricity suppliers have also been cutting prices as wholesale costs fall from record levels. Power NI's prices are regulated by the NI Utility Regulator. Power NI customer solutions director William Steele said: ""As wholesale prices in the global market have fallen, Power NI has been able to deliver yet another decrease in unit prices for our customers, with our fourth consecutive tariff reduction."" Andrew Greer, SSE Airtricity general manager (NI) said he was pleased by the gas price cut. ""We know energy costs are a primary concern for customers across Northern Ireland, and that wholesale market volatility has impacted households and business so this price reduction will no doubt provide some welcome relief,"" he said. As the largest incumbent gas supplier SSE prices are regulated by the NI Utility Regulator. The Utility Regulator welcomed the decrease to energy bills, adding that an announcement around Firmus Energy's regulated gas tariff will be made in the coming. Colin Broomfield, Utility Regulator director of markets, said: ""While this is good news for consumers, we recognise that many households and businesses are still struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. If you are worried about paying their electricity or gas bill, help is available."""
market volatility,Cap on Irish electricity revenues 'to protect households',2024-09-15,2022-11-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g17dzvxeyo,"A﻿ new windfall tax on non-gas electricity generators in the Republic of Ireland will help to protect households against rising costs, the Irish government has said. E﻿xcess profits collected by companies beyond a capped amount will be used to support consumers. The cap on market revenues will be set at €120 (£103) per megawatt-hour (MWh) for wind and solar and at least €180 (£155) per MWh for oil-fired and coal-fired generation.  T﻿he cap will be in effect from December until June 2023. I﻿f electricity suppliers can prove they are passing on lower prices on revnues made in excess of the cap, those revenues will not be subject to the cap. The change was introduced by Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.  A﻿ temporary solidarity contribution, as set out in the European Council Regulation, will also come into effect. “This has not been done to raise revenue for the State, for the general Exchequer,” Mr Ryan explained. “It is to give us a pool of funds that will help us to take further measures when it comes to protecting people from energy costs.” Mr Ryan said given the volatility of gas prices, the level of proceeds from the cap on market revenues and the temporary solidarity contribution cannot be estimated with any certainty. Proceeds from the cap on market revenues are expected to be collected in 2023, with proceeds from the temporary solidarity contribution to be collected in 2023 and 2024. I﻿n the UK, the government has extended the windfall tax on oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea.  The levy was introduced in May, but will now carry on for longer at a higher rate.  There had been calls to increase the tax after Shell and BP reported huge profits.   What is a windfall tax?  A windfall tax is a extra levy imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms which benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Energy firms are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year. This is because demand increased when Covid restrictions were lifted and the Ukraine war led to concerns about energy supply. "
market volatility,BP profits soar as calls for windfall tax grow,2024-09-15,2022-05-03,By Jennifer Meierhans,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61304001,"BP's profits for the first three months of this year have more than doubled after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant reported an underlying profit of $6.2bn (£4.9bn) compared to $2.6bn in the same period last year - ahead of expectations. BP said the increase was due in part to ""exceptional oil and gas trading"". Rising profits have prompted calls for a one-off windfall tax on energy companies to help UK households grappling with rising bills. This type of charge targets firms that are lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. BP's profits have been driven by a sharp rise in oil prices, initially led by increased demand as economies reopened following Covid lockdowns. Last November, BP chief Bernard Looney described the energy market as ""a cash machine"". Oil prices rose further after war broke out in Ukraine and western countries imposed sanctions on Russia following its invasion. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. UK inflation is currently at its highest rate for 30 years, lifted by the rising cost of oil and gas which has inflated fuel prices as well as the cost of household energy.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC that BP's profits - which beat analysts' expectations of $4.5bn - ""reinforce the case that we've been making which is that, with so many people struggling to pay their energy bills, we should have a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in the North Sea who have made more profit than they were expecting"". Italy has said it will increase its tax on energy companies' windfall profits from 10% to 25%, but the UK government is not in favour of such a charge. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a windfall tax would hamper investment and keep oil prices higher over the long term. He told ITV: ""If you put a windfall tax on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy prices lower for everybody."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said energy companies should ""pay a little more to help the most vulnerable"". ""The Conservative government's refusal to introduce a windfall tax on the super profits of oil companies is becoming impossible to justify,"" he said. ""BP is raking in eye-watering profits while millions of people struggle to pay the bills."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has previously said he would explore a windfall tax policy if companies did not invest enough in the UK's energy supply. On Tuesday, BP announced plans to invest £18bn in green and fossil fuel operations in the UK by the end of the decade. But it also said it would buy back another $2.5bn of its shares and keep dividends - payments to shareholders - at 5.46 cents a share. BP says it expects to pay £1bn in taxes for its 2022 North Sea profits, on top of around £250m that it has paid annually in other taxes in the UK in recent years. Mr Looney said: ""We're backing Britain. It's been our home for over 110 years, and we've been investing in North Sea oil and gas for more than 50 years. ""We're fully committed to the UK's energy transition - providing reliable home-grown energy and, at the same time, focusing on the drive to net zero."" BP's promise to invest £18bn in UK over the remainder of this decade and its estimate it will pay about a billion pounds in UK tax this year seems to have headed off the threat of being hit by a windfall tax. While the £18bn figure is just totting up investments already planned, it is a larger proportion of their global investment than in previous years. While the final decision on tax is the chancellor's, the investment was welcomed by the business secretary and the prime minister again played down talk of a swoop on oil and gas profits.  Opposition parties are not convinced and pointed to BP's target of using 60% of excess profits to buy back shares and the rest to pay down debt. With Shell expected to post even higher profit numbers later this week, the debate is sure to continue.   Russ Mould from investment platform AJ Bell said it was ""no surprise"" to hear BP pledging billions of pounds worth of investment in projects to boost domestic energy security. ""Whether this will be enough to stave off a new levy remains to be seen. The political pressure to do so is only likely to escalate as the cost of living continues to surge in the UK,"" he said. Nick Butler, a former vice president at BP, told the BBC's Today programme it was possible the government would impose a greater tax burden on the energy giant. The visiting professor at Kings College London said: ""I think the company can answer that by showing that they are actually contributing to energy security."" BP said it had taken a $24.4bn hit on its decision to exit its shareholding in Russian energy giant Rosneft following the Kremlin's assault on Ukraine.  Including the cost of exiting its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft, BP reported a loss of $20.3bn for the first quarter. ""In a quarter dominated by the tragic events in Ukraine and volatility in energy markets, BP's focus has been on supplying the reliable energy our customers need,"" said Mr Looney. He added that the oil market would continue to be volatile and he did not expect ""any let off on prices any time soon"". Rival energy giant Shell is scheduled to report its results for the first quarter of the year on Thursday. "
market volatility,EU clubs together on energy and invites UK,2024-09-15,2022-09-08,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62822368,"""Gasmageddon"" is bearing down on Europe this winter.  It may sound like the stuff of nightmares. But this is no science fiction. The number of households facing energy poverty has doubled across the EU, according to financial services provider Allianz.  Gas shortages could drive up retail prices by 200%. Three-quarters of companies in the bloc's economic powerhouse, Germany, say they're experiencing ""severe strain"" from spiralling energy prices. In the UK, energy bills have gone up 80%. The word ""recession"" is whispered everywhere.  Vladimir Putin is not only using conventional military weapons in Ukraine, he is also weaponising energy to try to intimidate the West, as he seeks to readjust the balance of power in Europe to Russia's favour.  On Wednesday, he railed: ""We will not supply anything at all if it is contrary to our interests. No gas, no oil, no coal, no fuel oil, nothing."" Squeezing the EU had looked to the Kremlin like a piece of cake. The bloc relied on Russia for 40% of its gas and a third of its oil before Mr Putin invaded Ukraine. Big EU powers Germany and Italy were even more dependent. The Russian president has been switching gas supplies on and off at whim for months and the colder months are fast approaching. Even countries traditionally less reliant on Russian energy, such as France, Spain and non-EU UK, are affected by the volatility and price hikes on the global energy markets.  With businesses threatened with bankruptcy and vulnerable voters facing a choice of paying for food or fuel this winter, political and social tensions have soared alongside prices. Prague saw mass demonstrations last weekend, with angry crowds protesting against the cost of living crisis and demanding an end to sanctions against Russia.  Bear in mind that the Czech Republic has, till now, always been hawkish towards Russia and outspoken about the need to defend Ukraine. But the economic pain at home is biting hard. As they did at the start of the Covid crisis, EU countries tried to find their own, national, solutions.  Spain slapped limits on air conditioning in public buildings and Germany tried to discourage people from using their cars by reducing fares on public transport, while in Italy, a Nobel prize-winning physicist sparked a furious cultural debate, suggesting people could cook pasta with the heat off to save energy and cost.  A number of member states have hastily assembled financial packages to help struggling households and/or businesses. Their aim: both to reduce energy consumption and to keep costs down for consumers.  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has become fond of peppering his (German-language) news conference with the English words of the song You'll Never Walk Alone, popularised by Gerry and the Pacemakers.   But the focus now is on finding a European solution. And not a few EU figures, French President Emmanuel Macron included, have said they'd love the UK to be part of a plan. More on that later. The drive for the common EU approach is manifold. In part, it comes from the same post-Covid crisis realisation that as part of a single market, when the economies of some member states suffer, it pulls everyone down.  There's also an appreciation that there's strength in numbers. Countries such as Italy and Germany have been busy trying to find alternative energy suppliers - in Algeria and the UAE, for example. But if the EU as a whole, with its economic clout, makes the energy deal, the conditions are likely to be more favourable.  ""We have to achieve that we only pay the world market price, rather than a higher price,"" said Mr Scholz on Wednesday. His Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo, pointed out that gas prices in Europe are currently double those in Asia and 10 times as much as in the US. EU purchasing power would also avoid one member state trying to outbid another in their scramble for energy. Not a good look when it comes to EU unity. There is, too, a very sincere desire in the EU to stop pouring energy money into Russia's war chest. It's true, the majority of member states have drastically reduced their reliance on Russia by now. But as one very irritated EU diplomat pointed out to me, sky-high energy prices mean EU countries still pay almost the same daily amount of money to Moscow, although they currently receive so much less. ""Putin has to be roaring with laughter at us,"" he said.  EU energy ministers have been summoned to an emergency meeting in Brussels on Friday to discuss a raft of proposals to jointly combat the crisis.  ""Russia is manipulating our energy markets,"" tweeted EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, ""[but] we have the economic strength, the political will and unity to keep the upper hand.""  EU countries have already reached agreements on reducing Russian oil imports and Russian gas reliance. The Commission established joint gas purchasing capabilities back in April and planned sufficient energy storage ahead of this winter.  Proposals for this Friday include: But EU leaders are far from united in their priorities or energy planning. Unanimous or immediate agreement is unlikely on Friday. Germany is still iffy about capping Russian gas prices, for example. Poland wants all extra-EU gas sources to have a price cap.  And there are other tricky issues such as if/when to decouple the gas and electricity markets (a similar debate rages in the UK) and how to ensure consumers understand the long-term need to change habits and consume less energy, even if governments intervene to keep prices lower. European Green parties are also extremely uneasy about the EU rush to replace Russian fossil fuel supplies with others elsewhere. The German Green Party is a senior government coalition partner. Its co-chair, Robert Habeck, is deputy prime minister and economics minister.  He's been travelling cap in hand to the United Arab Emirates, keen as keen for fossil fuel deals - an irony not lost on his opponents. German Green MEP Ska Keller admitted to me that yes, Green politicians had big plans, ""but then governing happens."" She insisted that polls in Germany indicate voters understand that the Greens are being ""responsible and pragmatic"" in a time of energy crisis, but that they haven't forgotten the climate emergency. European Commission energy spokesman, Tim McPhie, is quick to underline when that it comes to energy, there are ""short-term fixes and longer term fixes"". The EU Green Deal and climate goals are a huge source of pride in Brussels.  Mr McPhie says long-term European security is not about replacing Russian gas with gas from somewhere else - it's about renewables' energy efficiency.  And what about that invitation for UK co-operation on energy that I mentioned earlier, repeated to me again this week by the French Europe Minister, Laurence Boone? Her predecessor, Nathalie Loiseau, says that in these times of crisis, co-operation makes more sense than post-Brexit ""splendid isolation"". But while it could make economic sense for the UK to join together with the EU to try to benefit from lower prices on the global market, new PM Liz Truss, even if tempted, might find that co-operation politically awkward with some parts of her Conservative party. There is, though, an aspect of energy and the EU that Prime Minister Truss won't be able to ignore. And that's to do with Northern Ireland. The island of Ireland has a single electricity market, interconnected to Great Britain, says Mary Starks, former director at GB energy regulator Ofgem, now energy specialist at Flint. But the Republic of Ireland is an EU member state, theoretically subject to EU common energy regulations. ""So what this means for both Northern Ireland and the Republic will come into focus at some point,"" says Ms Starks. And if wholesale energy prices are successfully reduced on one side of the Channel, but not the other? Ms Starks told me that normally, energy flows very freely across electricity and gas interconnectors, but if the EU, for example, managed to lower prices before the UK, then Brussels would ""need to take steps to ensure its cheaper power and gas did not 'leak' to the UK"". While Ms Starks says it would be highly unlikely that the EU would shut the interconnectors unilaterally, there would have to be some sort of regulation of trading and flows, in order to prevent leakage. And that would necessitate dialogue. "
market volatility,Musk loses world's richest title as Tesla falters,2024-09-15,2021-02-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56174404,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has lost his title as the world's richest person after a recent slide in the electric carmaker's shares, the main driver of his wealth. Tesla shares have tumbled more than 20% since hitting a high of more than $880 in early January. They suffered especially steep falls this week, tied to the firm's recent risky $1.5bn (£1bn) investment in Bitcoin. The drop returned Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to the top spot on the rich list. The risk of being associated with the notoriously volatile Bitcoin - which has fallen sharply in recent days - may have prompted some Tesla investors to sell their shares, even if the firm has not been hurt by the declines, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. ""By Musk and Tesla aggressively embracing Bitcoin... investors are starting to tie Bitcoin and Tesla at the hip,"" he said.   ""The recent 48-hour sell-off in Bitcoin and added volatility has driven some investors to the exits on this name in the near-term.""  Bitcoin's value jumped nearly 50% in the weeks after Tesla revealed it had purchased $1.5bn of the currency and planned to accept it as payment.  But since climbing above $57,000 on Sunday, the cryptocurrency has dropped nearly 20%. It was trading at less than $48,000 on Tuesday - still higher than when Tesla disclosed its bet. Just as Mr Musk was credited with helping to fuel Bitcoin's rise, he may also have himself to blame for some of the recent Bitcoin declines.  In an exchange on Twitter over the weekend Mr Musk wrote that the price of Bitcoin did ""seem high lol"". Also driving the cryptocurrency lower were comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who sounded a warning on Bitcoin on Monday. She called it an ""extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions"". The comments follow a recent surge of interest in Bitcoin, after major US firms such as Mastercard and Bank of NY Mellon followed Tesla's lead in announcing plans to incorporate the digital currency into their operations. Mr Musk's attention to Bitcoin comes as Tesla faces other challenges.  The firm recently halted most sales of the lowest-priced version of its Model Y SUV, with Mr Musk citing a desire to improve the car's range. Earlier this month, Chinese regulators summoned the firm over safety and quality issues, after reports of battery fires and abnormal acceleration. Rival carmakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen have also stepped up their focus on electric vehicles in recent months. The struggles follow an astonishing rise in Tesla shares in 2020, when prices leapt from less than $90 to more than $700. The increase propelled Mr Musk past Amazon boss Jeff Bezos in the world's richest rankings for the first time in January, while also raising questions about whether that value made sense for a firm that produces a fraction of the cars of its rivals.  The two billionaires have been vying for the top spot in the weeks since.  The more than 8% decline in Tesla's share price on Monday was the biggest since September and wiped more than $15bn off Mr Musk's net worth, according to Bloomberg. Shares fell a further 2% on Tuesday. Mr Musk's tweets have also famously triggered sharp moves in Tesla shares, including last year when the firm lost $14bn in market value after he wrote that its share price was too high."
market volatility,Can a rubberstamp parliament help China's economy?,2024-09-15,2024-03-04,By Stephen McDonell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-68402147,"The Chinese government is under massive pressure to come up with solutions for its troubled economy. So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer as it kicks off on Tuesday.  Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates are now gathering inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year. It is, for the most part, a week-long political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors.  But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world. For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules. Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life. This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year. But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough.  It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,"" says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government. He told the BBC that ""there is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"". In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC.  But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping. Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"".  Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector.  ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said. A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well. But what does it mean? Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"". He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"". He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"". One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party. According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"". Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"". This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on.  Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon. During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed.  Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the side lines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor. This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments. According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"". These are trying times for China, he said.  The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"". There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it."
market volatility,House prices see biggest drop in 14 years - Halifax,2024-09-15,2022-12-07,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63886983,"UK house prices saw their biggest drop in 14 years in November, falling 2.3%, reflecting ""volatility"" in the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax. November marks the third month in a row during which prices have fallen with potential buyers playing safe by delaying purchases. The average UK house price in November was £285,579. Higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty, and the rising cost of living are all affecting the market. The annual rate of growth in property prices has now dropped from 8.2% to 4.7%. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: ""While a market slowdown was expected given the known economic headwinds - and following such extensive house price inflation over the last few years, this month's fall reflects the worst of the market volatility over recent months. ""Some potential home moves have been paused as homebuyers feel increased pressure on affordability and industry data continues to suggest that many buyers and sellers are taking stock while the market continues to stabilise."" However, she said that the falls should be put into context, given the rapid increase in property prices in the last few years. Property prices were up more than £12,000 compared with this time last year, and £46,403 higher than in March 2020 when the Covid pandemic began. The Halifax said Wales and the South West of England had recorded particularly sharp slowdowns in annual house price growth.  Both had been at the forefront of house price inflation during the pandemic, when the so-called race for space among buyers boosted demand for rural or coastal properties. The Halifax survey, based on the lender's own data, comes shortly after the rival Nationwide Building Society said prices fell 1.4% from October to November - the largest month-on-month fall since June 2020. Mortgage rates are much higher than at any time during the last decade, although earlier this week, the average rate on a new, fixed-rate two or five-year deal fell below 6% for the first time for two months. Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, said: ""With another fall in property prices in November, buyers and sellers are clearly demonstrating more caution due to higher mortgage rates and the ever-rising cost of living.  ""As with any fall in pricing, buyer sentiment and confidence is key. But considering the macro-economic and seasonal factors affecting all consumers, along with the month-on-month increases seen over the past 18 months or so, the decline needs to be put into context as it is still minimal."""

market volatility,UK economy shrinks after rain and strikes hit,2024-09-15,2023-09-13,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66785572,"The UK economy shrank more than expected in July, driven by strike action by NHS workers and teachers, according to official figures. Wet weather also hit the construction and retail industries, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, causing the economy to contract by 0.5%. The figures were worse than analysts had predicted and continue a trend of weak economic growth in the UK. But the ONS said the ""broader picture"" for the country looked ""more positive"". Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said that while July saw the economy shrink, output across the services, production and construction sectors had grown 0.2% in the three months to July. He said ""a busy schedule"" of sporting events and increased theme park visits had provided a slight boost to the economy. The drag on the economy for July was partly due to a fall in output from the services sector, which includes the NHS. The ONS said the drop was driven by the industrial action, with senior doctors and radiographers striking over pay on two days each, and junior doctors walking out on five days in the month. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the latest economic figures showed ""many reasons to be confident about the future"" and that the UK economy was now on course to grow faster than Germany, France and Italy. The figure produced by the ONS to show the health of the UK economy is known as gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in a country. If the figure is increasing, it means the economy is growing and people are doing more work and getting a little bit richer, on average. But if GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking which can be bad news for businesses. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, it is typically defined as an economic recession. The UK is currently not in recession, but there have been concerns over the economy's weak performance in recent months. Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, said the new statistics on Wednesday marked ""another dismal day for growth"" and that the ""Conservatives' low growth trap"" was ""leaving working people worse off"". Annie Rose, owner of horse riding company Cumbrian Heavy Horses, said July's wet weather affected her business because about 40% of her customers are tourists. ""When they have consistently poor weather, they'll go and do other things that are inside or they'll go on low level walks around a lake, that's not going to cost them a lot of money. Not sit on a horse in the pouring rain,"" she told the BBC. She said many recreational riding stables had closed in the UK ""simply because horse riding is expensive"" and keeping the animals is proving too costly. She said the cost of hay to feed her horses had trebled from around £4,000 to more than £12,000 last winter, piling further pressure on her budget. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at forecaster Capital Economics, suggested that July's economic figures could mean a ""mild recession"" has begun. but added he expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates a final time from 5.25% to 5.5%. The Bank has been hiking rates in a bid to control the rate at which consumer prices in the UK have been rising, known as inflation.  The economic theory behind increasing rates is that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money, they will then have less excess cash to spend, meaning households will buy fewer things and then price rises will ease. But it's a balancing act as raising rates too aggressively could cause a recession. Inflation fell to 6.8% in the 12 months to July, but the level is still more than three times the Bank's 2% target. Households have been grappling with higher prices for everything from food to energy in recent times and wage growth, on average, has only just caught up with the rate of inflation for the first time in nearly two years. But with interest rates at the highest level for 15 years, the cost of borrowing including for loans such as mortgages has soared, although people with savings should benefit and get better returns on their money. The latest GDP figures released are an estimate of how the economy is doing by the ONS. It produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the world's major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question.  At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised when more information comes in, and can change at a later date. Much as we all like to moan about the weather, there was more than abnormally heavy rainfall impacting July's GDP figures. While these are just an initial stab at estimating what activity was up to based on limited data, and could be a blip, the numbers are a reminder that we may be looking at a dampening for the economy.  Strikes - in health, education - impacted certain sectors. The pattern of bank holidays this year has caused some volatility in monthly numbers too. A wetter July for activity was perhaps inevitable after an economically glowing June. Such volatility is why economists prefer to look at trends over quarters - and activity did still perk up between May and July as a whole. It was consumer spending that drove a resilient economy in the first half of the year - and that continued in some areas in July. Attendance at the likes of sporting activities and festivals did well. But was that partly down to true grit, a determination to brave the weather after splashing out on tickets and to treat ourselves after the lockdown years? Or could it be a last splash? As fixed rate mortgages deals end, over half of residential mortgage holders and a bigger slice of landlords with buy-to-let loans have been exposed to higher interest rates, monthly repayments rising typically by hundreds of pounds. The forthcoming data will be scrutinised as closely as meteorologists do their weather charts. "
market volatility,UK economy shrinks for the first time since 2012,2024-09-15,2019-08-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49290926,"The chancellor has told the BBC that he does not expect the UK to slide into recession after data showed the economy shrank by 0.2% between April and June. Sajid Javid was speaking after the Office for National Statistics said the economy had contracted for the first time since 2012. The surprise decline came after Brexit stockpiles were unwound and the car industry implemented shutdowns. The pound sank after the data was released, raising fears of a recession. Against the dollar sterling fell to $1.2025. Against the euro, it dropped throughout the day to €1.0736, a level not seen since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said manufacturing output fell and the construction sector weakened. A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters. This is the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2012. Economists had not been forecasting a contraction in the economy in the second quarter, but had expected it to stagnate, with the consensus forecast for 0% growth. The economy had shown 0.5% growth in the first quarter after manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost output, when the manufacturing sector recorded its biggest quarter rise since the 1980s. The ONS said GDP had been ""particularly volatile"" so far this year because of the changes to activity sparked by the original Brexit date of 29 March.  The statistics body said its latest figures showed that those increased stockpiles had been partly run down in the second quarter and that a number of car manufacturers had brought forward their annual shutdowns to April as part of contingency planning, which also hit growth. Mr Kent-Smith said: ""Manufacturing output fell back after a strong start to the year, with production brought forward ahead of the UK's original departure date from the EU."" He added that ""the often-dominant service sector delivered virtually no growth at all"". Mr Javid told the BBC: ""I am not expecting a recession at all. And in fact, don't take my word for it. There's not a single leading forecaster out there that is expecting a recession, the independent Bank of England is not expecting a recession. And that's because they know that the fundamentals remain strong."" The Bank said earlier this month it expects the economy to grow by 1.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.5% in May. Asked about the impact of Brexit, he said: ""We saw some significant stockpiling by British businesses in anticipation of the Brexit that never was, and now they're using those stockpiles, they're coming down.  ""Of course, there are businesses out there that are taking Brexit into account when they're making decisions."" He said: ""No one will be surprised by today's figures."" The data comes at a time when there are signs other economies are slowing. For instance, data on Friday showed that French industrial output fell more than expected in June. Mr Javid said: ""This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries.  ""But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong - wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we're forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year."" But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the ""dismal economic figures are a direct result of Tory incompetence"". ""The Tories' Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy."" The Liberal Democrats were also concerned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. ""Pursuing a no-deal Brexit is a political choice without a mandate: these figures show people's jobs and livelihoods are being sacrificed at the altar of political extremism, "" said Chuka Umunna, the party's Treasury and business spokesperson. Mr Javid said the best way to deal with Brexit uncertainty was to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. ""We're seeing volatility in the figures and one of the best ways to actually end this volatility is to bring certainty around Brexit and make sure we leave on 31 October."" The employers' body, the CBI, said the contraction was ""concerning"". Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, said: ""Growth has been pushed down by an unwind of stockpiling and car manufacturers shifting their seasonal shutdowns. ""Nonetheless, it's clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty.  ""As a result, business sentiment is dire."" The Federation of Small Businesses - which is calling for an emergency Budget - said that if the Treasury delays action until after 31 October, the date for Brexit, its efforts are likely to prove too little, too late.    ""Time is of the essence. Unless the chancellor steps in imminently with radical action, we could be heading for a chaotic autumn - and a very long winter,"" said the FSB's policy and advocacy chairman, Martin McTague.  Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the data showed ""an economy in decline and skirting with recession  as headwinds from slower global growth are exacerbated by a Brexit-related paralysis"". Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management said that while the global picture was ""becoming more gloomy"", anyone looking for positive signs for the economy could look to ""robust private consumption, reflecting a healthy labour market"". Household spending rose 0.5% on the quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that household spending was still growing at a ""robust rate"" and said it was not time to panic. He said the stockpiling was dragging on the economy, which was ""sluggish and had not stalled"". The pound - which has been at two-year lows following Brexit uncertainty - fell after the data was released. The currency also falls if there are expectations that interest rates will be cut. Mr Tombs said the market now sees a 70% chance of an interest rate cut in January, when Mark Carney is due to leave as the Bank of England's governor."
market volatility,New mortgage deals being pulled within days,2024-09-15,2024-03-18,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68574065,"Mortgage deals are typically on offer for just 15 days before being pulled, despite homeowners and buyers having the widest choice for 16 years. This is the shortest shelf-life in six months, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. As a result, people have little time to decide when rates are volatile. One adviser said the situation was adding extra stress to a huge financial commitment and making customers feel pressured to make a decision quickly. ""When I recommend a rate - or sometimes a choice of rates - to a client, it's quite understandable and unsurprising that they want time to consider which one to apply for,"" said Jo Jingree, from Mortgage Confidence.  ""Some lenders only give a few hours' notice of a rate change. That creates a situation which is less than ideal because taking out a mortgage can be a huge financial commitment that could impact them for years to come."" The interest rate on a fixed mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it. Doing nothing would leave people on a variable rate, which is very expensive. About 1.6 million existing borrowers have relatively cheap fixed-rate deals expiring this year, so need to make their minds up.  Johnny Abbott, from Loughborough, falls into that category and is watching deals with increasing concern.  The 39-year-old and wife Sophie, who have three children, are weighing up whether to get a new mortgage when their current deal comes to an end in July. The alternative is to move to a slightly bigger home that needs renovating, and where the mortgage is only slightly higher. Everything, Mr Abbott admits, feels like a gamble at the moment. Unless rates start to fall soon, they will have to cut back on costs whichever option they choose. That means no holiday, fewer swimming lessons for the children, no gym or TV subscription. ""We don't have a massive income, but we feel grateful to be where we are - able to manage costs, and not drowning in them,"" the charity debt centre manager said. ""We will just have to do what we can to make things stretch."" Meanwhile, potential first-time buyers require a new mortgage deal to be secured before they can think about setting up home. Many are left frustrated by trying to predict the direction of mortgage rates - the interest that is charged on a home loan. Lenders have been switching rates at a rapid pace as the markets try to predict whether or not the Bank of England will cut the benchmark interest rate, the key influence on the cost of many types of borrowing. Investors expect the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee to hold rates on Thursday and to make fewer, and later, changes to the base rate of 5.25% this year than previously anticipated. Cuts in this rate, which is at a 16-year high, makes borrowing cheaper. For those looking for a new mortgage, the current situation is like shopping in a hypermarket, but where everything on the shelf is soon going out of date. Previously, the choice has been more one of a convenience store. At the start of March, there were 6,000 mortgage products to choose from, according to Moneyfacts, which is the widest selection since 2008.  Lenders have extended their ranges, may offer various extras such as cashback, and - crucially for many first-time buyers - have more products for those who can only offer a relatively small deposit. The trouble is, the volatility in the market means deals are only around for a few days. The average of 15 days is well down from 28 days at the start of February, and only just above the record low of 12 days last July.  Lenders, aware of what rivals are doing, may pull deals at short notice. There has been huge upheaval in the mortgage market, not least after the mini-budget of September 2022, during the premiership of Liz Truss, and with plummeting activity from buyers last year. Homeowners actually repaid more money on mortgages than they took out in new lending in the year to January - the first time this has happened since comparable records from the Bank of England began 30 years ago. Mortgage broker Aaron Strutt, from Trinity Financial, said some calmness had returned, but the average interest rate had been going back up. ""It is good news that borrowers have so many [mortgage deals] to choose from again. The only shame is that they are so much more expensive than they were,"" he said. The average rate of a two-year fixed deal is now 5.8%, according to Moneyfacts. This had been well above 6% late last year, fell to 5.55% in late January, but has been creeping up since.

market volatility,Anger over 'unfair' A-level results,2024-09-15,2020-08-12,"Sean Coughlan, Katherine Sellgren, Judith Burns ",https://www.bbc.com/news/education-53759832,"There is anger among schools, colleges and students, after nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded on Thursday were lower than teachers' predictions. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades, in results after exams were cancelled by the pandemic. School and college leaders are calling for a review and say all fees for appeals should be waived. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"". The overall results, across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, show record highs for A* and A grades. But David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said he had heard from a number of colleges where more than half of their school-assessment grades have been adjusted downwards following moderation. Paul Whiteman leader of the heads' union  NAHT said: ""The government must make sure that there is no financial barrier to a school or college making an appeal."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""While there had been an overall increase in top grades, there was a ""great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level."" He said students felt grades had been pulled down ""in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable"". He called on the government and exams watchdog Ofqual to review the moderation process in England ""as a matter of urgency"". ""We would warn them against simply digging in their heels, and insisting all is well. ""This results day must have been an absolute nightmare for many schools, colleges, and young people - it is a shambles."" For the top  A* and A grades, independent schools in England saw the greatest improvement on last year - up 4.7 percentage points. This compares with a 1.7, 2 and 0.3 percentage points improvement for top grades for England's academies, comprehensives and colleges respectively. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said pupils would be able to sit exams if they feel they could have done better.  ""Where pupils are disappointed, where they feel that they could have done better, where they feel that there's an injustice been done to them, there is the possibility of appeal and they can re-sit, they can take a re-sit this autumn as well."" ""But looking at the big picture, I think overall we've got a very robust set of grades, plus you've got the situation in which more pupils than ever before are getting their first choice course at university and more kids from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the ""majority of young people will have received a calculated grade today that enables them to progress to the destination they deserve, with the added safety net of being able to appeal on the basis of their mock results, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Something has obviously gone horribly wrong with this year's exam results. ""Nearly 40% of young people have had their grades marked down and that's thousands of young people whose opportunities could have been dashed."" The exam results show: The proportion of entries getting an A* or A grade is at a record high this year - with the 27.9% above the previous highest of 27% in 2011. And there are increases in those getting A* to C - as the exam regulator had promised a more lenient approach. At Wilberforce Sixth Form College in Hull, while some students were celebrating, others were very disappointed. Abbi is one of those students who is not happy with her results, saying she had missed out on her place at Durham University to study engineering. She said she would now have to consider retakes or finding a clearing place at another university. ""It seems like some unfair grading. When I opened them I had a bit of a cry,"" she told the BBC. ""My future has been set back completely,"" she said. ""I had my heart set on Durham and it's now not an option for clearing because there's no clearing for my course."" ""I would have happily sat the exams but it was up to the government,"" she said, adding that she was angry her results had been affected by something out of her control. Principal Colin Peaks said he had never seen ""such a negative feeling"" on results day in all his years of teaching. Mr Peaks said there was ""something worrying across the board"", with many good students not getting the grades they would have expected. ""The anomalies within the system aren't right - I'm seeing anomalies across the piece that do not make sense to me."" He said basing results, in part, on last year's students' results was wrong because ""they're different"". ""We are going to see lots of appeals,"" he added. Students taking vocational exams have been getting estimated results over recent weeks - with more than 250,000 receiving their grades in BTec and Cambridge Technical qualifications which are equivalent to A-levels and strong GCSE passes. The Department for Education says vocational results are ""broadly in line with previous years"". Figures from the admissions service, Ucas, show that more students have been accepted onto UK degree courses this year. Among UK applicants, 358,860 have been accepted - a 2.9% rise compared with 2019. Of these, 316,730 have been accepted on to their first choice, up 2.7% on the same point last year. Clearing is an increasingly popular route for students to find a degree course, with leading universities among those offering last-minute places through the system, Ucas said. By Sean Coughlan, education correspondent  This is a strange year for A-level results in every way, with grades arriving for exams that were never taken. In more usual times the headlines would have been about this being a record year for top grades - with almost 28% getting A*s or As. But instead this has been an exam results day full of uncertainty, with head teachers warning about volatility below the surface of rising grades. Almost two out of every five results were lower than the grades predicted by their teachers - and heads are warning of a confusing pattern of where results have gone down. But, at the same time, those trying to get to university might find that they're able to get in with lower grades than in previous years, with the promise of ""super-flexible"" admissions. The confusion extends to what happens next. Because for those getting bad news today, it could still be good news through the appeals process. Have you got your A-level or BTec results today?

market volatility,Typical energy bill set to rise by £800 a year,2024-09-15,2022-05-24,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61562657,"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about £800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to £2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices.  Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy.  The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to £1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra £700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of £2,800.""  It means the typical household bill could rise by £800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond £2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased.  ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying £700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of £800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is £3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward £9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"".  ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record £7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made £5bn, the highest for 10 years.

market volatility,Toilets charity faces 433% rise in energy costs,2024-09-15,2022-08-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-62589778,"A charity that runs public toilets in a Highland village says its annual electricity bill has gone up by more than 430%. Community Out West took over the running of Kinlochewe's loos after they were closed by Highland Council as part of wider cuts five years ago. The charity found out on Monday its energy costs would go up from £1,500 to £8,000 per year.  It relies on donations to keep the toilets open.  Community Out West's supplier, EDF, said the market was ""unfortunately volatile"" but that the charity had signed up to a a two-year fixed ""peace of mind contract"". Karen Twist, a director at the charity, said an email was received from EDF at 13:28 on Monday about the increased costs as part of a 24-month contract. She said: ""We were expecting our energy prices to rise, but we found out it was going to rise from about £1,500 a year to £7,753 a year. That was a big shock."" Mrs Twist said the charity was told it needed to make a decision on the quote by 16:00, or incur an additional £250. Being a charity, all members of its trust needed to be involved in the decision making and the deadline was missed. Mrs Twist said the current levels of donations would not cover the costs of running the toilets, including lighting and hand driers. She said other sources of additional funding would have to be sought. She added: ""We're deeply worried about it, we don't know if we can continue to keep the facility open."" The toilets are used by tourists and include facilities for disposing of chemical toilet waste from motorhomes. People living around Kinlochewe also use the toilets when visiting the village to attend appointments. Mrs Twist, who runs the Kinlochewe Hotel with her husband David, said: ""We had thought everything was going well. We had got through Covid and we've got lots of visitors to our area, which is great."" She also said Community Out West's situation had left the trust wondering what increased energy costs other charities were now faced with. EDF said: ""All of our business contracts are bespoke and raised based on the individual company's circumstances.  ""Unfortunately, due to current unprecedented market volatility, our contract quotes can only be valid for a short period of time. ""We're pleased to confirm the customer, Community Out West, has now signed up to a two-year fixed 'peace of mind' contract with EDF."""
market volatility,Higher energy bills 'almost inevitable' says Ofgem,2024-09-15,2022-03-08,Oliver Smith & Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60665284,"Households are heading for an ""almost inevitable"" rise in energy bills in the autumn, the boss of energy regulator Ofgem has said. Spikes in wholesale gas prices, which were rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will be passed on to consumers, Jonathan Brearley said. He called for the shift to green energy to speed up the move away from gas. The UK government has previously said the energy price cap would ""insulate"" customers from gas price rises. Mr Brearley warned in a speech that the gas price volatility caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine would lead to higher costs being passed on to consumers. ""While it is too early to predict what the price cap will be in October, a price increase is almost inevitable,"" he said. The energy price cap is the maximum amount that suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales can charge customers for each unit of energy. It is set to rise in April when millions of households will face an increase in average energy bills of nearly £700.  In October, the price cap will be reset, and Ofgem warned last week that average bills could reach £3,000. Wholesale gas prices, which were already rising rapidly as economies were emerging from the coronavirus pandemic, will be pushed higher by the Ukraine crisis, Mr Brearley said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine underlined that ""it is not in consumers' interests for their energy sources or prices to be so exposed to international gas markets"". Britain's oil and gas supplies are secure due to North Sea reserves, he said. But oil and gas extracted from the North Sea is not owned by the UK itself, but by the oil and gas companies which drill for it. Those products are then sold on the global market which has been volatile, even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We started winter with an international gas price shock of unprecedented pace, scale and duration,"" Mr Brearley said. ""However, this gas crisis is not over. We are entering a second, more serious phase that will have further consequences for customers and further financial strain for retail companies,"" he added, saying gas had gone up to nearly £7 per therm this week alone. ""It is not in customers' interests for their household bills to be beholden to the uncertainties of geopolitics,"" he said. Some Conservative MPs, most notably the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, have argued for a greater reliance on fossil fuels. But Mr Brearley said we must move away from fossil fuels not only to tackle climate change, but also to move away from volatile prices. He said the UK must move as quickly as possible to low carbon energy. Mr Brearley said it was Ofgem's priority to manage and mitigate the ""inevitable consequences"" of rising energy prices on British consumers but he said that ""as an industry, we cannot pretend that our actions can mitigate the full impact of future price rises"". He said that anyone struggling to pay their bills should contact their energy provider to find out what help was available, but also urged companies to ""reach out"" to their most vulnerable customers and support them where possible.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said that the government will soon set out an ""energy supply strategy"" amid concern over western reliance on Russian gas and oil.  He said the government was looking at using more UK energy resources: ""One of the things we're looking at is the possibility of using more of our own hydrocarbons."" ""That doesn't mean that we are in any way abandoning our commitment to reducing carbon dioxide [emissions]."" ""You can do that, but you've got to reflect the reality that there is a crunch on at the moment and we need to intensify our self-reliance as a transition with more hydrocarbons."""
market volatility,Energy bill help to cost billions more from January,2024-09-15,2022-11-24,Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63740945,"The government will have to pay billions of pounds more to support households with their energy bills from January, after the regulator increased its energy price cap. But it will not affect households as the government is limiting their bills.  Under the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG), the typical household is currently paying £2,500 a year for energy. But Ofgem said that without government support households would have paid £4,279 from January.  Energy research firm Cornwall Insight said the increase would worry the government, which is ""shouldering the billions of pounds needed to compensate suppliers the difference"".  But the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on people on low-to-middle incomes, said the price cap was needed to stop an ""acute cost-of-living crisis getting dangerously worse over the cold winter months"".  In normal times, the energy price cap would set the maximum amount suppliers can charge households per unit of energy.  But since October it has been superseded by the EPG, which is protecting people as energy prices soar in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Under the EPG, suppliers can charge a maximum of 34p per unit for electricity and 10.3p for gas until the end of March.  This rate will go up slightly in April after the new chancellor scaled back the support, and remain in place until the end of March 2024, leaving the typical household paying around £3,000 a year.  Ofgem's announcement, however, shows that without the government's help, consumers would have had to pay 67p per unit for electricity and 17p for gas from January. It means the government's support will save typical households around £1,779 a year compared with what they would have had to pay under the regulator's cap.  The total cost of someone's bill will vary depend based on how much energy they use, however. On Wednesday, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said that people should cut their energy use to stop the UK being ""blackmailed"" by people like Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Hunt said ""in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills"" and consider how to cut their consumption. The most important point to make about today's announcement is that it does nothing to affect the price per unit of energy that we all pay in our domestic gas and electricity bills, owing to the government guarantee that is in place. Price caps can be confusing at the best of times, and this adds an extra layer of complexity. However, there are some issues raised in the finer details of what has been said. Firstly, it allows a better estimate of the cost to the government of its policy - even though events in Ukraine, for example, could still have a massive impact on the final bill. Secondly, there is a reminder that paying a bill monthly by direct debit remains a much cheaper option than being on a prepayment meter, and significantly cheaper than paying your supplier every three months for the energy you have used. There is concern about the cost of the EPG at a time when the government's debts are rising.  Speaking earlier this month, Mr Hunt said the scheme was costing government the same ""an entire second NHS"" and added: ""It's not possible to subsidise people's energy bills indefinitely."" Cornwall Insight estimates the full cost of 18 months of the scheme will be £42bn - although this is up from £38bn only a week ago due to the volatility of wholesale energy prices. ""This highlights the nature of the wholesale market risk that the government is taking on by deciding to extend the EPG... with the consequence that the full costs may be potentially higher than currently budgeted for,"" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight.  He added that the government was ""exposed to variables and factors over which they crucially have no control"". The EPG scheme was originally announced by former Prime Minster Liz Truss, who intended it to run for two years.  But Mr Hunt said in October that he would scale it back so it cost taxpayers ""significantly less than planned"", and there are no plans to keep it beyond March 2024. "
market volatility,Watchdog blamed as energy firm failures push up bills,2024-09-15,2022-06-21,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61881981,"Energy watchdog Ofgem has been accused of allowing an industry to develop on ""shaky foundations"" in which a series of supply companies collapsed. All billpayers will pay £94 more a year each to cover the £2.7bn cost of the failure of 28 suppliers which folded after wholesale prices soared. The National Audit Office (NAO) said Ofgem had allowed a market to develop that was vulnerable to large shocks. The regulator said it was already addressing the issues raised. Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""Ofgem's approach created an energy market built on shaky foundations. As a result, many companies simply collapsed under the shock of energy price increases. ""Once again, it's the public who has to pay for the mistakes of those charged with protecting them. It's unacceptable."" The result of last year's shock was that 2.4 million customers were automatically moved to a rival company when their own supplier collapsed. Typically, according to Citizens Advice, they had to pay an extra £30 a month for the duration of their original contract, as they were shifted to a more expensive tariff. In addition, the cost of these failures totalled £2.7bn - a tab which was spread across all billpayers in Britain, not just those of the failed companies. This is before taking into account the potentially multi-billion charge that households could face due to the collapse of Bulb Energy, which is in special administration. The NAO said that Ofgem had decided on a ""low bar"" approach for allowing new domestic energy suppliers into the market to encourage competition and choice for customers after the market had been dominated by six big companies. The regulator had then introduced tighter rules for new entrants from 2019, but not for existing suppliers until 2021. As a result, many suppliers lacked the financial resilience to deal with the six-fold increase in wholesale prices seen last year, the NAO said. ""By allowing so many suppliers with weak finances to enter the market, and by failing to imagine that there could be a long period of volatility in energy prices, Ofgem allowed a market to develop that was vulnerable to large-scale shocks,"" said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO. ""Consumers have borne the brunt of supplier failures at a time when many households are already under significant financial strain having seen their bills go up to record levels. A supplier market must be developed that truly works for consumers,"" Mr Davies said. Ofgem is making changes after a review it commissioned came to many of the same conclusions. ""We are already working hard to address all of the issues raised,"" a spokesman for the regulator said. ""While the once-in-a-generation global energy price shock would have resulted in market exits under any regulatory framework, we have already been clear that suppliers and Ofgem's financial resilience regime were not robust enough.  ""While no regulator can, or should, guarantee companies will not fail in the future, we will continue to take a whole-market approach to further strengthen the regulatory regime, ensuring a fair and robust market for consumers which keeps costs fair as we move away from fossils fuels and towards affordable, green, home-grown energy."" The NAO said concerns had been raised that Ofgem's reforms could limit new entrants and innovative ideas in the future. A typical household gas and electricity bill - governed by the energy price cap in England, Wales and Scotland has risen sharply, and now stands at about £2,000 a year. Analysts Cornwall Insight have predicted that the bill could hit about £3,000 a year this winter."
market volatility,Typical energy bill set to rise by £800 a year,2024-09-15,2022-05-24,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61562657,"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about £800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to £2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices.  Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy.  The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to £1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra £700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of £2,800.""  It means the typical household bill could rise by £800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond £2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased.  ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying £700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of £800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is £3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward £9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"".  ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record £7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made £5bn, the highest for 10 years.

market volatility,Toilets charity faces 433% rise in energy costs,2024-09-15,2022-08-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-62589778,"A charity that runs public toilets in a Highland village says its annual electricity bill has gone up by more than 430%. Community Out West took over the running of Kinlochewe's loos after they were closed by Highland Council as part of wider cuts five years ago. The charity found out on Monday its energy costs would go up from £1,500 to £8,000 per year.  It relies on donations to keep the toilets open.  Community Out West's supplier, EDF, said the market was ""unfortunately volatile"" but that the charity had signed up to a a two-year fixed ""peace of mind contract"". Karen Twist, a director at the charity, said an email was received from EDF at 13:28 on Monday about the increased costs as part of a 24-month contract. She said: ""We were expecting our energy prices to rise, but we found out it was going to rise from about £1,500 a year to £7,753 a year. That was a big shock."" Mrs Twist said the charity was told it needed to make a decision on the quote by 16:00, or incur an additional £250. Being a charity, all members of its trust needed to be involved in the decision making and the deadline was missed. Mrs Twist said the current levels of donations would not cover the costs of running the toilets, including lighting and hand driers. She said other sources of additional funding would have to be sought. She added: ""We're deeply worried about it, we don't know if we can continue to keep the facility open."" The toilets are used by tourists and include facilities for disposing of chemical toilet waste from motorhomes. People living around Kinlochewe also use the toilets when visiting the village to attend appointments. Mrs Twist, who runs the Kinlochewe Hotel with her husband David, said: ""We had thought everything was going well. We had got through Covid and we've got lots of visitors to our area, which is great."" She also said Community Out West's situation had left the trust wondering what increased energy costs other charities were now faced with. EDF said: ""All of our business contracts are bespoke and raised based on the individual company's circumstances.  ""Unfortunately, due to current unprecedented market volatility, our contract quotes can only be valid for a short period of time. ""We're pleased to confirm the customer, Community Out West, has now signed up to a two-year fixed 'peace of mind' contract with EDF."""
market volatility,Oil price eases as Iran downplays attack,2024-09-15,2024-04-19,Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2vwl91qe6do,"Oil and gold prices have eased after Iranian authorities appeared to downplay reports of an attack from Israel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell after jumping briefly to over $90 a barrel after reports emerged of an attack. Gold briefly came close to a record high before settling below $2,400 an ounce. There are concerns a worsening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt oil supplies. Investors have been closely watching Israel’s reaction to Iran's direct drone and missile attack last weekend. Oil prices had jumped by as much as 3.5% initially. But Brent then fell back to roughly $87 a barrel after Iranian state media claimed that there was ""no damage"" in Isfahan province where there had been reports of explosions.  Sharp and sustained rises in oil prices risk fuelling inflation. Countries are heavily reliant on the commodity, which is used to produce fuels such as petrol and diesel. Fuel and energy prices have been a major driver behind the higher cost of living worldwide in the past couple of years. Randeep Somel, fund manager at M&G Investment Management, told the BBC's Today programme: ""The concern for markets would mainly be the inflationary one, that this would actually add to inflation."" While the pace of inflation has been slowing, in the UK it is still above the Bank of England's 2% target and some economists have forecast that a cut to interest rates may not happen until summer or later on in the year.   ""In the UK, the inflation rates is still around 3.2% - still someway off the target – and it is becoming a bit of a concern for policy makers,"" said Mr Somel. ""It is good to see that this hasn’t escalated any further and that hopefully the disruption to markets is short-lived.” The price of Brent is far below the heights reached after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 when a number of major economies imposed sanctions on the oil-producing nation. Oil hit $125 a barrel in the weeks that followed, leading to a sustained period of higher household energy bills. The gold price often rises at times of uncertainty as it is seen as a safe investment. The heightened tension in the Middle East has led to concerns about whether shipping through the Strait of Hormuz between Oman and Iran will be affected. It is a crucial shipping route, as about 20% of the world's total oil supply passes through it. Members of the oil producers' cartel Opec - Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq - send most of the oil they export through the strait. Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and the third-largest member of Opec. The initial spike in oil prices was ""a knee-jerk reaction to fears of a renewed escalation of warfare between Israel and Iran,"" said energy market expert Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights. ""What the latest events underscore is the heightened fragility and volatility in the Mid East situation,"" she added. Stock markets were mixed as investors reacted to the latest events.  In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly 0.5% higher in mid-day trade, while the S&P 500 fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq was down 1.3%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 share index closed 0.2% higher while the FTSE 250 ended down 0.3%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 2.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.9%.  "
market volatility,Japanese yen touches 32-year low against US dollar,2024-09-15,2022-10-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63252034,"The Japanese yen touched a 32-year low against the US dollar after official figures showed that prices had risen faster than expected in America. The yen fell to 147.66 against the US dollar before regaining some ground. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government will take ""appropriate action"" against the currency's volatility. In a rare move last month, Japan spent almost $20bn (£17.6bn) to prop up the country's struggling currency. ""We cannot tolerate excessive volatility in the currency market driven by speculative moves. We're watching currency moves with a strong sense of urgency,"" Mr Suzuki told reporters after attending a G7 finance meeting in Washington, DC. Last month, Japan intervened in the global currency market to help support the weakening yen. That move came after the yen hit a fresh 24-year low against the dollar, marking the first time that Japanese authorities had intervened in the currency market since 1998. However, analysts have warned that interventions like this would have little effect as long as Japan's interest rates remain far lower than those in the US. The Japanese currency has come under increasing pressure in recent months, mainly due to the very different approach taken by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in comparison with the US Federal Reserve. On Thursday, official figures showed that consumer prices in the US rose more than expected last month in a sign that the inflation fight in the world's largest economy is far from over. Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, was 8.2% in the 12 months to September, down from 8.3% in August. Rising consumer prices in the US are being closely watched as the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool inflation push up the value of the dollar as well as global borrowing costs. America's central bank has been aggressively raising its interest rates to combat soaring prices, which has made the dollar more attractive to investors. In contrast, the BOJ kept rates very low. The dollar's strength on the global financial markets is also having an impact on other major currencies around the world, including the pound and the euro."
market volatility,Risk of £50bn bond sale sparked emergency Bank move,2024-09-15,2022-10-06,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63161404,"The aftermath of the mini-budget could have seen a £50bn fire sale of UK government bonds by funds connected to the pensions industry, the Bank of England has said. There was risk of a downward ""spiral"", it said, as increases in the cost of government borrowing hit the funds. The Bank feared these funds would be forced to sell their government debt holdings, adding to the market turmoil. The cost of borrowing saw record increases for two days, the Bank said. The rise in borrowing costs over four days was ""three times larger than any other historical move"". The Bank stepped in to calm markets last week following fears that some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse.  It pledged to buy up to £65bn of government bonds after the mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged. Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. The Bank said that the market in long-term loans to the government lasting three decades, known as 30-year gilts, saw two days where the effective cost of borrowing saw record increases, on its data which starts in 2000.  A letter from the Bank's deputy governor John Cunliffe to the Treasury Select Committee contains a diagram depicting the trigger for the interest rate shock as the ""fiscal event"", another name for the mini-budget, and that the nature of the move in the UK was not seen in the US or eurozone. Jonathan Haskell, a member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, also said in a speech on Thursday that ""there was undoubtedly a UK-specific factor"" in the market turmoil. This contradicts the claims made by some government supporters that the mini-budget had nothing to do with last week's turmoil, which was instead caused by ""global factors"". The UK's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had offered to prepare a draft forecast in time for the mini-budget, but the government did not take this up. Mr Haskell added that the Bank uses OBR data in its own forecasts, and a ""sidelined"" OBR ""generates more uncertainty by worsening everyone's information base"". The risk the Bank feared was that the funds connected to the pensions industry, known as Liability Driven Investments, would become forced sellers of their holdings of UK government debt, in an already troubled market. A £50bn sale would represent four times the normal daily trade in the market, and would have pushed the effective cost of borrowing, or yield, even higher than 5%, leading to further problems. Before the mini-budget, this yield had stood at about 3.7%. While individual defined benefit pension funds were not at risk, because they are guaranteed by the sponsoring company, it could have led to a wider financial stability challenge. The Bank of England decided to intervene in the market last Wednesday, bringing down the effective borrowing cost from over 5% to under 4%. As the Bank has eased off its interventions, on Thursday these costs had risen notably again, as high as 4.4%. These rates feed into the costs of long-term mortgages and business lending. The Bank emergency intervention is due to end next week and it has so far bought a fraction of the government bonds it could have, spending just £3.7bn. On Thursday, the Bank said it would wind down its bond buying in ""a smooth and orderly fashion"" once it felt the market was functioning normally again. The Bank also said it is working with the UK's pensions and financial regulators to make sure that that investment strategies used by certain types of pension schemes can withstand market volatility."

market volatility,Jobs market recovery continues in NI,2024-09-15,2022-02-15,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60386379,"The jobs market recovery in Northern Ireland was sustained into the new year, new official figures have suggested. Payroll data for January 2022 suggests companies in Northern Ireland have continued to hire staff.  The number of payrolled employees increased by 5% year on year and only London performed more strongly among the UK regions. However on other measures the jobs market is yet to fully recover. The statistics agency Nisra said: ""The number of payrolled employees and level of payroll earnings continue to be above the pre-pandemic levels.  ""Total employment, which includes self-employed, and hours worked have yet to return to pre- pandemic levels and similarly claimant count, unemployment and economic inactivity all remain above,"" it said. The number of payrolled employees in NI in January was 774,900, the highest on record and the eighth consecutive month that employee numbers have been above pre-pandemic levels.  A closer look at the annual increase in employee jobs shows that all sectors, with the exception of finance and insurance, reported an increase over the year.   The accommodation and food sector reported the largest percentage increase over the year (+14%), with employee numbers in this sector just above (1%) those recorded pre-pandemic. The number of self-employed people has not recovered in the same way as employment. There were an estimated 134,000 people in self-employment in the period October-December 2019, but in the same period in 2021, that had fallen to 104,000. That means there were still an estimated 20,000 fewer people in employment at the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2019. Meanwhile, data on pay in Northern Ireland suggests it is keeping up with the rate of inflation. The experimental data suggests that typical monthly pay was £1,941 in January, an increase of 1.7% on the previous month and up 8.7% from January 2021. In December, the rate of inflation rose to 5.4% and is expected to peak at around 7% in spring, according to the Bank of England. Nisra cautions that there has been some volatility in the pay data in recent months."
market volatility,Energy makes its move,2024-09-15,2019-03-27,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-47717237,"Oil majors have long been trying to mix some greenery with the black stuff, but it's clear now that the pace of that transition is picking up. There was an audible jolt in the industry when Norway's vast pension fund - built up from tax revenue and profits from offshore drilling - announced it is pulling out of investment in oil company equities. The Global Pension Fund is seen worldwide as a leader in shaping investment with ethical, environmental and social considerations. Yet - understandably, for a country that still has a lot more oil and gas to extract - the Norwegian investors said they were not joining the ""leave it in the ground"" movement, but instead that they did not want to be over-exposed to oil price volatility. This came a few months after Statoil - the largely state-owned driller in Norwegian waters and many other basins besides - rebranded with the less statist and polluting moniker of Equinor. It is reported on Tuesday, by Fortune news website, that the company is pouring $180m into a battery research programme. It is also one of the major investors in UK windfarms, from the humongous Dogger Bank project to the world-leading Hywind floating turbines off the coast at Peterhead. Shell is making very clear moves towards a more electric future.  Having bought First Utility last year - one of the larger challengers to the Big Six supplying British households and businesses - on Tuesday, it announced a rebrand to Shell Energy. Renewable power will be standard for its customers and (with a somewhat mixed message), it's offering discounts at its forecourts, along with signs that it wants to take on other utilities with an interest in bundling telecoms as well. Shell has also been buying up technology, including a German battery storage manufacturer and a British tech firm, Limejump, focused on improved flexibility in matching power demand with supply. BP is investing in solar power. It's reported to be looking at a shift to renewable energy at its US operations.  Extracting oil and gas from the ground can be very intensive in its use of hydrocarbons.  So companies such as BP want to reduce their carbon footprints at the same time as producing the goods with which the rest of us can keep plodding on with ours. It's reported in Texas that the company is ploughing $100m into ideas from its staff and supply chain that can reduce its carbon footprint. Chief executive Bob Dudley told a Houston audience earlier this month that the world's energy use is not on a sustainable path. Oil majors say the power sector has to take much of the blame, but they know they have to do more. Closer to home, there are moves afoot to get back into the technology for carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS).  This has been proven in pilots, and offers the possibility of letting us keep burning fossil fuels so long as the carbon emissions are treated and buried deep under the seabed. The central North Sea, off the Scottish coast, is one of the more promising locations for developing the technology at a commercial scale - reckoned to have 75% of the capacity estimated so far. You may recall that there was £1bn of UK government money being offered in a competition between different CCUS projects (it's added ""usage"" since then). Scottish Power was in a strong position to put that to work at Longannet power station in Fife, but lost patience, and closed the coal-burner down.  Peterhead was still burning gas, and was in the final two when, in November 2015, that billion quid was quietly snaffled by the Treasury and put into a more pressing political priority. It hasn't killed off the dream. Four years on, Whitehall has just set up an advisory group of businesses, including BP, Shell, Drax and Tata Steel to advise on how best to get CCUS moving again. The group's budget: £1m.  That is, a thousandth of what was available before. Meanwhile, there are still projects afoot at a Yorkshire biomass plant owned by Drax. And under new management, Crown Estate Scotland has put some Strathclyde University economists to work on the impact that could yet be derived from developing CCUS.  The Crown Estate licences the seabed for such storage, and wants to plan ahead. Its study was published on Tuesday, with some large numbers in terms of economic impact. The main thrust of a dessicated piece of economic writing is to shift the measure of CCUS from its environmental positives, set against its very high costs, and to account also for its economic impact. Thus, the Strathclyde Centre for Energy Policy observes that CCUS would allow the UK offshore oil and gas sector to keep pumping from its subsea wells, while offsetting its climate harm by pumping processed carbon gunge into the emptied rock formations. If it does so, this study is talking about 26,000 directly linked jobs in the on-shore support industry and another 18,000 supply jobs downstream.  It's further reckoned that this could help process industries de-carbonise to support the ""just transition"" from carbon emissions which was pledged in the Paris Agreement. So although CCUS has been one of the most expensive ways of cutting carbon emissions (using less energy in better insulated buildings is the cheapest way), it offers one of the highest returns per pound invested in terms of jobs created or sustained. And like long-awaited buses, Tuesday also brought news from Wood group in Aberdeen, that it has been contracted to do the design concept stage of a ""first-of-a-kind"" gas power plant with CCUS built into its processes. The programme will initially cover five principal industrial emitters of carbon dioxide, in the production of hydrogen, fertiliser, petrochemicals, cement, and steel. Wood is another company that has moved sharply to avoid over-exposure to the volatility of the oil price, and particularly to the oil industry in the North Sea. To underline the mood of an industry that is preparing for a change of gear and direction, the Oil and Gas Authority - also in Aberdeen, as regulator of the UK industry - recently set out its plans to link the business of hydrocarbon extraction with the business of replacing it.  That is, it wants the oil and gas sector to work imaginatively with the offshore wind and marine power sector. In addition to carbon capture and storage, the ideas it's floated include: Yet more developments: the OGA has just dumped a vast amount of seismic surveying data in the public domain (""equivalent to eight years of high definition films"") which ought to help industry to identify the best places for carbon storage.

The agreement, worth £428m over five seasons, is said to have fallen through at the ""last moment"", amid concerns about increased crypto regulation. The cryptocurrency exchange site was set to replace Gazprom after Uefa severed links with the Russian energy provider over the war in Ukraine. The concerns are thought to relate to potential legal trading restrictions.  Over the past few years digital assets have moved from the fringes of the economy and have entered the mainstream, with more and more football sponsorship deals being confirmed. Both Chelsea and Atletico Madrid signed an agreement with trading platform WhaleFin and Manchester City have OKX as their training kit partner.  Watford have previously had Bitcoin as a club sponsor and accepted the cryptocurrency at the club.  Last year, Spanish striker David Barral made football history when his move from Real Madrid to DUX International de Madrid was paid for using Bitcoin.  According to Uefa, the cryptocurrency sector has partly helped clubs to fill the revenue streams that were lost as a result of the pandemic. But critics say there are concerns about the volatility of the crypto market - particularly that the plummeting price of tokens can expose fans to potential debts. Despite these lucrative sponsorship deals, Bitcoin is down almost 70% from its historic November 2021 high, Ethereum is down more than 70%, and several crypto exchanges have laid off workers en masse. In June, Crypto.com cut almost 5% of its workforce - about 260 employees - according to chief executive Kris Marszalek. Crypto.com is the fastest-growing crypto platform with more than 10 million users around the world.  The site, which has global headquarters in Singapore, also has sponsorship deals with Formula 1, the Ice Hockey World Championship and the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. It also has many major sponsorship deals in American sports, topping off its marketing efforts earlier this year with an advert featuring basketball legend LeBron James that aired during TV coverage of the Super Bowl. The collapse of the Champions League deal with Crypto.com, first reported by SportBusiness, is said to have been because of fears that regulatory concerns in European countries could create legal problems for the company's ability to trade and operate. Haider Rafique, global marketing chief at OKX, the second-largest global crypto exchange, told the BBC: ""The European regulatory landscape as it applies to the crypto space is nuanced and still evolving.  ""The changing regimes focus on regulatory concepts, like consumer protection and anti-money laundering, that are generally welcomed by the industry. ""Keeping abreast of any changes to these frameworks and adjusting internal practices accordingly will help crypto businesses succeed in the region long-term."" Uefa declined to comment to the BBC.

market volatility,Oil's up: What does it mean?,2024-09-15,2018-04-24,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43886953,"There's no magic price for oil at which investment is switched off or on, depending on the direction of travel. Investment depends on each project and its break-even point, and no two oil fields are the same - least of all those that require drilling offshore. But at $75 a barrel, and on an upward trend, this seems a milestone at which to catch some breath and ask a) what's going on with the market for Brent crude? And b) what are the implications? So first, what's going on? That's simple, perhaps deceptively so. It's about our old friends, supply and demand. The latter is rising with economic growth, notably in Asia, but around the world.  Growth is not as closely aligned to demand for oil as it once was. But in India, for instance, development means a big boost to industrial production, demand for electricity and transport. Symbolic of India's economic position, Saudi Arabia announced this month it is investing big in a refinery and petro-chemicals complex on a beach resort south of Mumbai. Ratnagiri will be one of the world's largest, processing 1.2 million barrels per day.  Saudi Aramco (state-owned while aiming to float) is taking a 50% stake in the £32bn ($44bn) project, while a consortium of state-owned energy firms in India own the other half. Supply is a more complex picture.  American stocks of oil influence the market, and the official numbers are expected to show they've fallen. That puts upward pressure on the price. More significant in the longer term, the Opec exporters' cartel, working with non-member Russia, has been holding back on production in order to pull the price up. Saudis are among those straining at the loss of market share, particularly to Americans.  The market gyrated a bit last week when the Saudi oil minister said the rising price didn't seem to be doing much harm to demand, so he reckoned out loud that oil at $80 to $100 might be a possible sustainable target zone.  The Saudi government has, remember, a war to fight. And hostilities with Yemen, partially as a proxy for Iran, are one of the reasons for markets being nervous about security of supply. The Straits of Hormuz are an oil supply choke point which could also be a flash point between Saudi and Iran. After the Saudi minister had hinted, Russia's energy minister counter-hinted that the constraints might come off the cartel, which would push the price down again. His comments did precisely that. America is the most dynamic part of the supply story, for two main reasons. Fracking technology extracts oil and gas for a limited period before new rock has to be fractured. It's a repeated process, and if, as in 2014-15, the price drops, the process is stopped. Only when the price rises again does fracking restart. That's what is happening. America is producing more oil now than ever. The other unpredictable dynamic sits in the Oval Office. Donald Trump wants to break from the Iran nuclear deal, which would involve a return to sanctions on Tehran's oil exports - that is, a cut in its supply into the world market.  The US president tweeted last Friday: ""Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!"" That, Mr President, is absolutely correct. Controlling supply and prices is precisely what cartels exist to do. That's the point of Opec.  And though oil prices may look too high from Washington DC, they probably don't look too high in mid-Texas or the Dakotas. ""No good"" for oil users, but very good for oil producers. And when you say this ""will not be accepted"", we look forward, nervously, to finding out if this is another threat of trade war. Put all that together, and the price of a barrel of oil delivered in three months has risen from a low below $30 at the start of 2016 to 150% more than that. However, the current price remains 43% below the peak in 2014. So what does it mean? Higher fuel prices? Well, not necessarily. At the same time the oil price, measured in US dollars, has been rising, the US dollar itself has been weakening against sterling. If like me, you'll find currencies easiest to understand by thinking of travelling abroad. If you want to vacation in America now, you'll be able to buy 12 more dollars for £100 than you could a year ago.  The same goes for dollar-denominated oil. A year ago, a pound bought you $1.28 on currency markets (without all those transaction charges). It now buys $1.40. That is, the pound buys 9% more in dollars than it did last year. The other factor is that UK forecourt prices have a lot to do with tax rates. VAT runs at 20%, so it is as volatile as the price. For heating fuel, VAT is 5%. Fuel duty for transport is fixed, currently sitting at 58p per litre. Take all that together, and the AA's price-monitoring tells us that the average price of a litre of unleaded fuel, at pumps across the UK, rose 1p between December and March, while diesel fell by 1p. For Scotland in particular, it's worth watching for three different effects. One is the risk of rising oil prices boosting costs for those who use fuel, in homes and in businesses. For those reasons around sterling, there's no sign of inflation resulting yet. But where economies are already doing well, analysts are concerned that the rising price of Brent crude could push up prices more widely. The other side of the coin in Scotland is the industry that extracts oil. Investment decisions have to take big gambles on the future price of Brent crude. In general, business plans don't like volatility or heightened uncertainty. It comes at a cost. They prefer to see a reasonably stable price and a market environment which looks like continuing that for the foreseeable. They don't have that yet, but they'll like the upward trend for more than two years. After a very harsh downturn, with the price slump from September 2014, much of the offshore industry has stabilised. It has a number of big final investment decisions - the gateway or green light for a project - which are helped by raised prices and an upward trend. Oil and Gas UK, the trade body, reckoned at the start of the year that at least 12 major investment projects were expected to be approved during 2018, worth around £5bn. So if there's more profit, there ought to be more tax revenue? Correct. But how much more?  Not as much as you would have found with other price revivals, because the UK Treasury has cut tax rates. The main tax take is at 30% of profits. The Supplementary Charge was cut in 2016 from 20% to 10%. And the Petroleum Revenue Tax rate, levied on profits from older fields, was cut from 35% to zero. The Office for Budget Responsibility last month raised its estimate of what the tax take might be as a result of the rising price, as it has had to do repeatedly.  It was a sharp increase, but to a level that remains low by previous standards - up from £500m this year to £900m.  Tax revenue from oil and gas is expected to average under £1bn annually for the five years of its forecast, which assumes the price of oil and of gas will fall again in the later three years. Production and profits are then expected to continue their decline. For the purposes of arguing the case for Scottish independence, a geographic share of that tax revenue is dwarfed by the scale of the public sector deficit calculated by Scottish government statisticians in their annual expenditure and revenue tables. Likewise, for those who want a national oil fund, less than a billion pounds per year might be nice to have but wouldn't go far.  That said, they are brave people who stick their necks out with assumptions about the oil price five years ahead. Sometimes, however, economic forecasters have nowhere to hide."
market volatility,News Daily: Oxfam meeting and Grand Canyon crash,2024-09-15,2018-02-12,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43023380,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Oxfam bosses will meet International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt later to discuss allegations the charity's staff used prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. Four people have been sacked since the claims emerged and three have resigned. Oxfam has denied any cover-up and it's announced new measures for the prevention and handling of sexual abuse cases. But Ms Mordaunt told the BBC the charity had failed in its ""moral leadership"" and that she was questioning whether government funding - worth £32m in the last financial year - should continue. US police have named three British tourists killed in a helicopter crash in Arizona's Grand Canyon. They were Becky Dobson, 27, Jason Hill, 32, and Stuart Hill, 30, officers said. Images show flames and thick smoke rising from the boulder-strewn site, but no cause has been given for the crash, in which three other Britons and the pilot were injured.

market volatility,How much market chaos did the mini-budget cause?,2024-09-15,2022-10-13,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/63229204,"New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has reversed almost all of the tax measures outlined by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng three weeks ago.  The mini-budget of 23 September - included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - and was followed by days of turmoil on the markets, a fall in the value of the pound and rises in the cost of UK government borrowing and mortgage rates.  Prime Minister Liz Truss subsequently sacked Mr Kwarteng and acknowledged that ""it is clear that parts of our mini-budget went further and faster than markets were expecting"".  Previously, Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng, Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg and other ministers had defended the mini-budget, focusing on the effect of global factors like rising inflation and interest rates rather than acknowledging that the 23 September announcement had a profound impact. So, what has been going on?  It is true that interest rates have been rising around the world as central banks, including the Bank of England (BoE), try to control inflation, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the energy price shock which followed. On 22 September, the BoE announced it was increasing the UK's base rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.25%. This is the interest rate on which commercial banks base the amount you pay for borrowing money, and what banks pay you for saving money with them.  The day before, the US central bank had raised its interest rates by more - 0.75 percentage points to between 3% and 3.25%. Following the BoE's decision, the UK government's long-term borrowing costs - the interest rate the government has to pay to borrow money on the international markets - rose immediately. By the BoE's own analysis, long-term gilt yields were 0.2 percentage points higher at the end of the day as compared with the start. The next day - 23 September - Mr Kwarteng delivered his mini-budget starting at 09:35 BST. This included the government's support scheme for energy bills - which had already been announced. This was due to last two years for households and the Treasury estimated it would cost £60bn for the first six months. It also included a cut in National Insurance and the reversal of a planned rise in corporation tax. These tax changes were pledged by Ms Truss during her Conservative leadership campaign and were widely expected to happen. But Mr Kwarteng went further, announcing he would cut the basic rate of income tax a year earlier than expected and get rid of the top rate altogether.  The package of tax cuts announced in the mini-budget totalled £45bn and were unfunded in that the government did not set out what savings it might make.  The mini-budget was not accompanied by an assessment of its plans by the government's official spending watchdog - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - as happens at every budget.  Following the chancellor's statement, the UK government's cost of long-term borrowing rose sharply. According to the BoE, long-term gilt yields rose 0.3 percentage points over the course of the day.  The markets were closed over the weekend, but in a BBC interview on Sunday 25 September, Mr Kwarteng indicated there were more tax cuts to come.  On Monday 26 September, the pound fell to record lows against the dollar in early trading in Asia. There was also a sharp rise in the cost of long-term government borrowing. Long-term gilt yields had gone up 0.5 percentage points by the end of the day, according to the BoE. Comparing the cost of government borrowing - on this measure - across the G7 group of advanced economies, it is clear that there was a sharp spike in UK long-term borrowing costs following the mini-budget - which wasn't seen in the other countries.  If you just look at the changes to the cost of government borrowing since 1 September (Liz Truss officially became prime minister on 6 September) the trend is even clearer. The cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen considerably more in that period than it has in other G7 countries. This increase fed through into rising mortgage rates with hundreds of products withdrawn from the mortgage market.  It also had an impact on UK pension funds - which trade in government debt (30-year gilts). The BoE described the speed and scale of movements in interest rates on UK government bonds as ""unprecedented"". It had to step in to safeguard the pensions sector with a support scheme - worth a potential £65bn. The change to corporation tax was a key pledge Liz Truss made during her Conservative leadership campaign. On 11 August, she said she wanted to scrap the planned rise because, ""I don't think that's a good way to get our economy going and to attract investment into our country.""  The National Insurance cut was another of her campaign promises that made it into the mini-budget. On the scrapping of the top rate of income tax, Ms Truss was asked who had come up with this - she said it was the chancellor's decision. Mr Kwarteng was asked whether he had got her backing for it before the announcement and replied, ""of course"". On the absence of the OBR from the mini-budget, Ms Truss said the government didn't have time to wait for its forecast. The OBR wrote in a letter that it would have been in a position to produce an updated forecast for the 23 September announcement.  On the morning of 14 October, a Number 10 source told the BBC that the prime minister and chancellor were ""in lockstep"" - hours before she sacked him.  Speaking on 29 September, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said the turmoil on the markets in part ""reflects broader global developments... but there is undoubtedly a UK-specific component"". On 12 October, Sanjay Raya, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, told a committee of MPs that Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as high inflation were causing global instability and volatility in the markets.  But he added that there was ""absolutely a UK component here"". Mr Raya said: ""You throw on the 23 September event, you've got a sidelined fiscal watchdog, lack of a medium-term fiscal plan, one of the largest unfunded tax cuts that we've seen... since the early 1970s and it's sort of the straw that broke the camel's back."" Institute for Government chief economist Gemma Tetlow told the same committee that part of the problem had stemmed from the government undermining key economic institutions, ""questioning their credibility and not asking for a forecast from the OBR"". She added that while the temporary emergency measures to limit energy prices probably could have been announced without an OBR forecast, ""permanent changes to the tax system, which didn't need to be announced so quickly"", could have waited for OBR assessments and ""a full briefing from Treasury officials"".  Gerard Lyons, an economist who advised Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng during the leadership contest, speaking on the BBC's World at One programme admitted that the mini-budget ""misread"" the country's financial situation. However, he argued that everything that has happened was not ""solely due to the mini-budget"" but also down to parts of the financial system that were vulnerable to interest rates going up. On 3 October, Mr Kwarteng U-turned on plans to scrap the top rate of income tax.  On 14 October, Ms Truss sacked Mr Kwarteng and announced a U-turn on corporation tax, confirming it will rise after all. On 17 October, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that ""almost all"" the tax measures of the mini-budget will be reversed - apart from the National Insurance cut and the changes to stamp duty. The energy bills support scheme will last for six months, rather than two years.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate? Get in touch Read more from Reality Check"
market volatility,Markets rise after lockdowns prompt oil price plunge,2024-09-15,2020-11-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54775143,"Markets have turned higher as investor optimism rises ahead of the US presidential election on Tuesday. The three main share indexes in the US all gained ground on Monday, reversing course after sharp falls last week. Oil prices also turned positive in US trading hours, after earlier hitting a five-month low following fresh virus-induced lockdowns.  The falls followed countries including the UK, France and Germanytightening restrictions on social activity. The news hit financial markets, worried that the new lockdown measures would further dent economic growth and cause demand for oil to slump. In Asia trading hours, the price of Brent crude fell to a low of $35.74 per barrel, a level not seen since late May.  But it later recovered, rising more than 3%, helped by strong manufacturing data.   The price of US crude oil was also hit hard, falling as much as 7% on Monday to a low of $33.64 a barrel before also rising more than 3%. But the price of Brent, the main benchmark for oil prices, remains down 45% from the start of the year. The virus-induced slump has weighed heavily on energy companies, with BP and Shell among those announcing thousands of job cuts this year. BP plans to cut 10,000 jobs after a slump in demand while Royal Dutch Shell has said it expects to cut 7,000 to 9,000 jobs. Exxon Mobil last week said it planned to cut 14,000 jobs - or about 15% of its global workforce. The rise in oil prices joined a broad market rally, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 1.6% higher. The S&P 500 - which suffered its biggest weekly loss since March last week - rose 1.2% while the Nasdaq gained 0.4%. Shares in Europe and the UK also climbed.  Concerns that the results of the US presidential election would not be known for weeks have weighed on markets.  But hope that the US will avoid a messy and contested election outcome has risen among investors, as polls show challenger Joe Biden maintaining his lead over President Donald Trump in key states on the eve of election day.  Investors are also optimistic that the conclusion of the campaign will return attention to the debate over economic stimulus, ultimately pushing Washington to advance spending plans to help the US economy recover from the pandemic downturn. ""Whichever way you look at it, this coming week will be huge for US and global markets,"" said Simon Ballard, chief economist at First Abu Dhabi Bank.  ""We see the potential for a sharp rise in volatility around these events and all in the context of a still deteriorating Covid-19 situation across much of the US, Europe and elsewhere."" China remains the most upbeat market for economic growth this year. The world's top crude oil importer said on Monday it would raise its quota for 2021 by 20% for non-state owned companies. This came after activity in China's factory sector accelerated at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in October as domestic demand surged. This was according to the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a private survey which focuses on smaller to medium-sized companies. Last month, China continued its recovery from the pandemic with strong economic growth during the third quarter, according to its official figures. The world's second-biggest economy reported growth of 4.9% between July and September, compared to the same quarter last year."
market volatility,Scotland's homes: One cost that's falling,2024-09-15,2022-12-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64110041,"A tip for 2023: keep an eye on the market for homes. You may have more pressing issues around the cost of living, but the housing market both reflects and drives wider changes in the economy. A rising market creates at least an illusion of growing wealth, driving expenditure beyond housing, and a falling one - as you might expect - does the opposite.  It should, however, help to make homes more affordable for those who would like to enter the market, many of whom have been priced out in the past two decades or more. If you don't own your home, but rent in the private sector, it may matter even more that you keep an eye on what's going on. Supply and demand matters a lot there too, and there are supply problems. The forecast from the Scottish Fiscal Commission is that the price of the average private home in Scotland is going to fall 5% during next year. In the Scottish market, that's very unusual. Previous downturns have seen prices stall but rarely fall. This reflects the more steady, plodding nature of the market.  It doesn't rise with the same exuberance as you might find in London and south-east England. John Boyle, an economist specialising in the private housing market with estate agency Rettie & Co, also foresees a 5% fall next year. He points out that it won't be that sharp a correction in prices, because there hasn't been a house price bubble to burst. There were, however, some sharp increases coming out of the shutdown of the market in the first months of Covid, so you could see it as a correction on inflated prices rather than a fall. The sharp annual increases of well over 10% over 2021 into 2022 have fallen back, and the more reliable indexes across the UK are showing month-on-month falls in price during autumn. During lockdown, some people with growing families had quickly found out that they could use more space, including a garden. That led to a pent-up surge in demand, particularly for homes with more space.  The other theme emerging from then was a surge in demand for homes at a greater distance from workplaces. Working From Home meant many people learned how not to commute to work, and showed employers that it could be made to work for them too. So up went the prices for rural, and notably coastal, properties. I've moved in to one such property in the Highlands, about 150 miles from the BBC Scotland head office. Our neighbour did likewise, selling in Surrey and buying a house three times the size, while he works online with colleagues in an office near Gatwick airport. A further trend that estate agencies noticed was people who commute less regularly. So they may not move hundreds of miles, but a flit to the Ayrshire coast offers more space and quality of life, while a reasonable distance to travel into Glasgow once or twice a week. So what are they noticing now? Not so much a fall in prices as a fall in the number of transactions. For years, prices have been helped upwards by the shortage of supply coming into the market. That's partly new builds falling short of demand for them, and partly people holding back on older homes being put up for sale. Estate agents and surveyors report that recent months have seen demand ease off as well, taking the upward pressure off prices where homes go to competitive bids, and meaning there are fewer transactions. Expectations on price, among the membership of RICS, the surveyors organisation, are weighted heavily towards declines. They don't measure by how much, but balance those surveyors who expect to see falls against those who expect to see rises.  Some 29% last month said they foresee increasing prices, but 69% forecast falls. Of course, nine consecutive rises in mortgage rates over the past 12 months are having an impact.  Younger people who have known mortgages when they're exceptionally cheap and competitive are learning that you shouldn't bank on it staying that way.  A normalisation of interest rates, from the low levels post-2008 financial crisis, was long overdue, though it didn't have to happen so sharply this year.  And it really didn't have to happen with the shock to the system from the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng budget in late September, which spooked markets and sent the cost of borrowing sharply up. That ""moron premium"" - a term coined somewhere in the City of London to describe the spike in borrowing costs during these daft days of autumn - has since subsided. But it was a sharp wake-up call to borrowers and home-buyers.  Around 80% of mortgage holders are on fixed rate mortgages, and are protected from such volatility - until they have to refinance. And a lot of people are going to see a steep increase in monthly bills over the next year. John Boyle says taking on the average Scottish mortgage, with an average two-year term, costs £500 more per month than it did a year ago. That helps explain why the sharp annual increase in the price of a home, of well over 10% over 2021 into 2022 have fallen back. The more reliable indexes across the UK are showing month-on-month falls in price during autumn. The Nationwide index has fallen from a peak of 14% to 4.4% in the year to November. Halifax saw a peak of 13% and in the year to October, prices were up 8.8%. Savills, at the premium end of the market, issued its new year market update on Wednesday, noting a divergence in markets that are most dependent on mortgages and those that are not.  Across its portfolio, a 0.7% price fall in the past three months in Scotland is less of a fall than other parts of the UK, and coastal Scotland is among several markets near the coast which it forecasts will be most robust over the next five years. John Boyle notes that the new-build market is showing most signs of disruption already.  The costs of materials and labour have gone up steeply, and with demand weakening, housebuilders are slowing up the pace at which homes come on to the market.  Boyle says you are more likely to find discounting and incentives such as help from the housebuilder with offloading your current home. And what of the private rental market? The proportion of Scots who depend on private landlords for their housing has nearly doubled in the past 15 years or so. Those who might previously have bought their homes have seen that opportunity lifted out of reach by rising prices. But rent prices have been rising as well. They, too, depend on demand, which has been rising, and supply, which is problematic. Changes in the tax on owning a second home for rental have squeezed smaller-scale landlords. Growing regulation of the private rented market has also made it more costly to rent out, and those who have depended on short-term lets, through platforms such as AirBnB, now face further hurdles to register with councils. If they don't get permission, that business plan may no longer stack up. A further blow to landlords this autumn came with the Scottish government's freeze on rents until next April, to help tenants handle other rising costs, notably of energy and food.  This plays well with the notion that landlords are lordly and loaded and can afford to take more of the widespread cost of living pain.  But they are businesses which invest in assets, and their cost of borrowing has been going up.  Plus the draft Holyrood budget for 2023-24 includes a hike in the Additional Dwelling Supplement to Land and Buildings Transactions Tax.  In addition to any LBTT that a buyer may have to pay in slabs of different rates on a property (5% over £250,000, rising to 10% over £325,000, etc, with no change in those thresholds as prices have risen), any purchase of a rental, second or holiday home carries a 6% supplement. That rate has doubled in three years. So we're being told that landlords are getting out of that market.  That may help subdue prices for buying the kind of home that is typically rented. That's good news for first time buyers. But with lower supply of rental homes, expect to see rents going up.  The better news for renters is that you can see build-to-rent blocks under constructions in cities, including a vast one, with 400 units, on the Broomielaw side of the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow. That is part of a transition from the landlord business moving from small-scale investors in one flat or a cluster of them to big financial institutions. That private rented sector is the one most in need of maintenance and repair, and it has the least energy efficient standards. And that's where the other emerging element of the property market is worth watching: with energy bills so much higher in 2023 than they were a year ago, prices may increasingly reflect the cost of heating older, draughtier homes. Where Scotland's governments - local, Holyrood and Westminster - step in to improve the dire state of heating insulation in many homes, will have an influence on calculating a valuation of what they're worth."
market volatility,Bank of England steps in to calm markets,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,By Daniel Thomas & Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63061614,"The Bank of England has said it will step in to calm markets after the government's tax-cutting plans sparked a fall in the pound and caused borrowing costs to surge. It warned that if the market volatility continued there would be a ""material risk to UK financial stability"". The Bank will start buying government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore ""orderly market conditions"". The pound, which has been volatile, rose 1.4% against the dollar to $1.08.  It comes after the currency hit a record low on Monday following the chancellor's mini-budget, which pledged $45bn worth of tax cuts, funded by borrowing, as part of a plan to boost economic growth.   The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets.  The investor then gets to receive a stream of future payments, or ""yield"", based on the interest rate the government has offered.  Due to concerns over whether the government's plan will work, investors have been demanding much higher interest rates to lend to the UK government. But the Bank now hopes to lower these prices by buying its bonds.  The government's long-term borrowing costs fell after the bank's intervention on Wednesday, although still remains high. The Bank of England was forced to intervene after the market turmoil put pressure on pension funds, which invest in government bonds because they are usually so stable. So called Liability Driven Investment funds - which support defined benefit pensions schemes - were facing a collapse in the value of the bonds they hold, which in turn could have forced them to rush to sell other assets, sparking yet more market panic. However, industry group the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) said that ""pension schemes are long-term investors and moments like this come from time to time"". ""While this is a complex situation as there has been a lot of volatility in the gilt markets in recent days, we would not expect any significant issues for savers,"" said Joe Dabrowski, deputy director of the PLSA. Nevertheless, he said there will be ""some operational challenges and pressures on liquidity"" in the short term. Mr Dabrowski added that ""this is not ideal, [but] they are challenges that can be overcome and the statement from the Bank of England is a helpful step to achieving that"".  The Bank has already said it will ""not hesitate"" to hike interest rates to try and protect the pound and try and stem surging prices. Some economists have predicted the Bank of England will raise the interest rate from the current 2.25% to 5.8% by next spring.  The projection has led hundreds of mortgage products to be taken off the market.  The Bank said its bond purchases would be ""time limited"" and carried out on ""whatever scale is necessary"" to ease investor concerns. It will also postpone the planned start of a gilt sale programme that was only announced last week.  Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank had been forced to step in to avoid the early stages of a financial crisis and warned fears over the economic outlook were growing.  ""This shows that the Bank is going to do all it can to prevent a financial crisis and it is already working. While this is welcome, the fact that it needed to be done in the first place shows that the UK markets are in a perilous position.  ""It wouldn't be a huge surprise if another problem in the financial markets popped up before long."" Despite the Bank's action, the pound continued to fall with some analysts warning it could even reach parity with the dollar.  ""What today shows us, is that the market doesn't see this as a problem that just the Bank of England can clean up,"" she said. ""This is just firefighting,"" said Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank. She said pressure was growing on the government to make clear the financial cost of its tax cut and spending plans. There has been widespread criticism of the government's plan, with International Monetary Fund warning on Tuesday that the measures are likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis and increase inequality. The government says it will not reverse its tax cuts, but has promised to release further plans to boost growth and reduce public debt on 23 November. In a statement, the Treasury acknowledged global financial markets had seen ""significant volatility"" in recent days. It said Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was ""committed"" to the Bank's independence, adding: ""The government will continue to work closely with the Bank in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives."" But Labour called on the chancellor to urgently clarify how he planned to stabilise the economy. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said people would be ""deeply worried"" about the cost of their mortgage, about their pensions, and the cost of living. ""The Chancellor must make an urgent statement on how he is going to fix the crisis that he has made."" This is an immense show of force from the Bank of England trying to calm borrowing markets. It does raise some questions. It underlines that this is a crisis, and the Bank has responded in emergency mode. The clear cause of this crisis was the chancellor's mini budget, leading to a loss of market confidence and spiralling borrowing rates on government debt, which it says could become a ""material risk to financial stability"". So it will now, for a temporary period, buy up those loans in unlimited quantities. The effective interest rate being charged to the UK government in these markets was spiralling to 20 year highs. That has now fallen back. But it was not a decision made by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, who were informed of the decision after it was made by the Bank's financial experts. It actually comes as the Committee had been set to enact the exact reverse policy - selling government debts. The process was due to start next week and has been delayed. It is a massive intervention, but it could confuse markets about the clarity of policy making and lines of accountability. Sterling has fallen sharply again, close to all time lows. This will not solve the government's problems. It might buy them some time."
market volatility,Farmers facing price rises fear volatile times,2024-09-15,2022-03-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-60663031,"There are fears food supply could be affected as a result of the war in Ukraine, according to members of the farming industry. Farmer Guy Smith, from Essex, said the price of fertiliser had trebled and it felt like ""very volatile times"". The National Farmers' Union (NFU) warned farmers were facing rapidly increasing prices.  The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was trying to find ""long-term solutions"". Mr Smith, who farms in St Osyth, said nitrogen fertiliser was becoming more expensive and so was using 25% less than normal on his wheat crops. He said he feared prices would increase as a result.  ""Food will become more expensive. And what is really worrying is that for parts of the world where people aren't as well off as they are in this country, food could become short and that's very worrying,"" he said. ""I've been farming now for 30 to 40 years and I have never seen fertiliser treble and never seen the wheat price double. ""These are very volatile times."" Russia and Ukraine, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, such as seeds and oil. Andrew Dewing who manages and owns a grain trade business in Aylsham, Norfolk, said the increased price was a short-term benefit for suppliers in the UK, but the lack of fertiliser could cause problems for future crops. ""It's important to say that a farmer might benefit price-wise this year but they're not going to benefit in future years if this is ongoing.  ""[They] may not be able to produce crops at the same level or might not get the supply of fertiliser anyway,"" he said. An NFU spokesman said: ""The impact of the conflict has seen prices rise even further for everyone.  ""For farmers, prices of fertiliser and animal feed in particular is increasing rapidly.  ""To maintain confidence and stability in the supply chain, we have highlighted some short and long-term asks of government that can help navigate the extreme volatility we are seeing today and will grow in the coming months."" The NFU is calling on the Government to prioritise food security and sustainable food production, preserve and protect gas supplies for food production and processing and create a market monitoring group to identify and resolve potential problems.  Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary, George Eustice, said the Government was taking a number of steps including setting up a group to work with industry to ""identify better, long-term solutions that rely less on the price of gas"". He also said they had been working with the UK's producer of fertiliser to maintain production. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

market volatility,Fact-checking Liz Truss at PMQs,2024-09-15,2022-10-19,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/63316608,"Liz Truss apologised and admitted to having ""made mistakes"" as she faced MPs at Prime Minister's Questions. It follows weeks of turmoil on the markets after her government's mini-budget and the subsequent U-turns over most of its key measures. The prime minister defended her record though, making claims about government support on energy bills, the economy and the NHS.   We've examined them.  Ms Truss has used this figure repeatedly since announcing the Energy Price Guarantee, but the duration of this support scheme has now been scaled back meaning the figure is no longer certain.  When it was announced on 8 September, there was a cap on the price of a unit of energy until 2024.  A government press release on this date said: ""From 1st October, a new 'Energy Price Guarantee' will mean a typical UK household will now pay up to an average £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years."" But on 17 October, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the scheme would be scaled back, to six months (with a review to decide what support to offer after that). The cap will now only cover prices up to April 2023 and, at the moment, we do not know how much people will be paying per unit of energy after that. So the government needs a new calculation for typical bills. Until they come up with one, they can't say with any certainty that the typical household won't be paying more than £2,500.  Therese Coffey has announced a plan for patients, with measures on backlogs and waiting times.  But the pandemic didn't create the NHS backlog, it already existed. Covid-19 made it worse. As of August 2022, the NHS backlog - the number of people waiting for NHS treatment in England - stood at around seven million. According to the British Medical Association, ""demand for hospital treatment was outstripping capacity even before the pandemic"".  Its figures show that just before the pandemic in February 2020, the NHS backlog already stood at 4.43 million people.  NHS rules state that patients needing non-urgent treatment should not wait any longer than 18 weeks to be seen by a healthcare professional.  Prior to the pandemic, figures show that 17% of people were waiting longer than this time, compared with 36% of people in December 2021.  The prime minister said this after being accused by Labour of ""crashing the economy"" and causing people's monthly mortgage payments to go up by hundreds of pounds. But she didn't mention the mini-budget. Interest rates have been rising around the world and there are gloomy forecasts about the world economy from organisations such as the International Monetary Fund.  But her government's mini-budget of 23 September - with its £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - also had a significant impact on the UK. In a letter on Tuesday, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe said: ""there has been a particular increase in volatility in UK markets"" and pointed out that: ""the five largest daily moves in the 30 year inflation-linked gilt, in data that dates back to 2000, have all been since the 23 September"". You can see that in this chart of borrowing costs for G7 countries. It shows the increases in government borrowing costs since 1 September, the spike after the 'fiscal event' or mini-budget and the cost coming back down as measures were reversed. These borrowing costs have fed into things like higher mortgage rates for homebuyers and had an adverse impact on the pensions sector which forced the Bank of England to step in with a £65bn support scheme. We've looked in more detail at how far the mini-budget caused the ensuing market chaos in this piece. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

While minsters say they must not move too early to prohibit large gatherings in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says the decision to hold back is ""surprising and concerning"". Measures announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson included advising anyone with a ""new, continuous"" cough or high temperature to self-isolate for seven days. Testing will now only focus on identifying people with the virus in hospital. He says closing schools or cancelling sporting events at this point could do more harm than good, should people tire of the restrictions.  But the Scottish government has advised the cancellation of gatherings of more than 500 people, while Ireland has shut schools. And Mr Hunt says the UK is in a ""national emergency"", with just four weeks until it reaches the stage that Italy is currently at. ""You would have thought that every single thing we do in that four weeks would be designed to slow the spread of people catching the virus,"" he argues. Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, suggests ""nobody has the right answer"". The effects of the virus continue to be felt around the globe. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie are in 14-day isolation after she tested positive. Australia is stopping gatherings of 500 or more people, not including transport or schools. Ghana and Gabon are reporting their first cases, while India has recorded its first death.

market volatility,"Energy bills forecast to rise above £4,000 in April",2024-09-15,2022-10-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63298057,"Typical household energy bills could reach £4,347 a year from April after the government said it would scale back support, an analyst has estimated. Cornwall Insight's forecast comes after the chancellor said the energy bill help, which had been due to last for two years, would be cut in April. The government said the most vulnerable would continue to be protected from soaring energy prices. The forecasts could change depending on movements in wholesale energy prices. The new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced the change to the energy price support as part of a package of measures designed to save money after the government's mini-budget left a big projected hole in the public finances. On Monday, he said ""it would not be responsible to continue exposing public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices"".  The government's Energy Price Guarantee, which limits the price that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, was originally put in place for two years from 1 October.  Now it will only be in place for six months, covering this winter, with the Treasury reviewing the support given from April. Under the current cap consumers still pay for the gas and electricity they use. A typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year and 2,900 kWh of electricity - currently faces an annual bill of £2,500. That is up from £1,277 last winter. The details of support from April will be decided following a review, Mr Hunt said. He said those on lower incomes would be supported and there will be incentives to be more energy efficient. Predictions from Cornwall Insight suggest that, for households that do not receive any support, a typical annual energy bill could be £4,347 in the spring, dropping to £3,722 next winter. The loss of the two-year cap will introduce a ""considerable amount of anxiety about the future again"", Nigel Pocklington, boss of renewable energy supplier Good Energy, told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Pocklington, whose firm has about 300,000 customers, said that his reassurances to people were based on the government ""buffering them from the high levels of energy market through the winter"".  However, on ""current calculations without the government support"", he estimated that the average energy bill would reach around £4,300 in April, dropping below £4,000 by the summer.  ""These are extraordinarily high levels compared with what we are used to paying,"" he said.   Sharing this concern, Mary Starks, former executive director for consumers and markets at energy regulator Ofgem, told the Today programme that the move had put people back into a position of ""great uncertainty"".   On the promise of targeted help, Ms Starks criticised the government for being ""very unclear"" because who will be affected and how it will work has not been explained.  ""Even extending eligibility to everyone on universal credit is administratively complicated. ""The number of households who will be struggling will be a lot bigger than that so there is more work needed to do the targeting,"" she added.  The original plan to cap prices for two years - thought to cost up to £150bn - was to be funded through government borrowing after the prime minister rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. However, former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng followed it with plans to cut taxes by some £45bn. Concerns about rising borrowing sparked turmoil on financial markets which spilled over into the mortgage market, where interest rates on loans have surged to 14-year highs. On Monday, as he announced the review of the energy support, while also reversing £32bn worth of the planned tax cuts, Mr Hunt said he was doing ""what is necessary for economic stability"". He added that the Energy Price Guarantee had been ""the biggest single expense"" of Mr Kwarteng's growth plan."
market volatility,Adani calls off share sale after price plunges,2024-09-15,2023-02-01,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64490221,"India's Adani Enterprises has called off its share sale after the share price plunged on Wednesday. The Adani Group's flagship company confirmed the $2.5bn (£2bn) raised from the sale would be returned to investors after shares fell 26%. The group's companies have seen more than $90bn wiped off their value since a US investment firm made fraud claims. Adani denies the allegations. Gautam Adani, the founder, has fallen out of the top 10 richest in the world. According to the Forbes real-time billionaires list, Mr Adani is now the 15th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $74.7bn. He was third on the list last week. The billionaire runs Adani Group, one of India's biggest companies. The flagship company Adani Enterprises has operations in a wide range of industries including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy.  Last week, Hindenburg Research, a company that specialises in ""short-selling"", or betting against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall, released a report that accused Mr Adani of ""pulling the largest con in corporate history"".  It also alleged the Adani Group had engaged in decades of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, and claimed its companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". The group has dismissed the allegations as malicious and untrue, calling them an ""attack on India"". The report came days ahead of a planned sale of Adani shares to the public, and on Tuesday, the $2.5bn share sale in the group's flagship company managed to scrape through to be fully subscribed despite the controversy.  But shares plunged 26.7% on Wednesday, taking the total fall in market value for the group over $90bn, according to Bloomberg. After the market closed, Adani Group said the company would return the share sale proceeds due to ""the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility"". ""Given these extraordinary circumstances, the Company's board felt that going ahead with the issue would not be morally correct,"" said Mr Adani. ""The interest of the investors is paramount and hence to insulate them from any potential financial losses, the Board has decided not to go ahead with the FPO (follow-on public offer)."" Mr Adani said the company's balance sheet was ""very healthy with strong cashflows and secure assets"" ""We have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt,"" he added. ""This decision will not have any impact on our existing operations and future plans."" Adani Group has hit back at the allegations against it and said it was evaluating ""remedial and punitive action"" against Hindenburg Research in the US and India. It said it had always been ""in compliance with all laws"". In an interview with Mint newspaper, the group's chief financial officer compared Hindenburg Research to General Dyer, the British officer of the Bengal Army responsible for a massacre that killed hundreds of Indians in the city of Amritsar in 1919. Hindenburg responded saying the group was stoking a nationalist narrative to obfuscate the fraud allegations."
market volatility,Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices,2024-09-15,2022-02-24,By Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60509453,"Severe sanctions on Russia aim to isolate the country and create a deep recession there, but the economic fallout will also be felt by people around the world. The sharp rise in the prices of things from oil and metals to wheat is expected to push up the cost of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating. People in the UK and Europe are already paying high prices for energy and fuel. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has so far driven these even higher and caused the price of oil to jump to level in almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices have more than doubled.  If gas prices stay at that level, energy analysts have warned that household fuel bills in the UK could reach as much as £3,000 a year, while average UK petrol prices have repeatedly hit record highs, with the latest price at 155p and diesel at 161p.  Russia is the second-biggest exporter of crude oil, and the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital to heating homes, powering planes and filling cars with fuel. The UK gets only 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but the EU sources nearly half of its gas from the country. If one country reliant on Russian supplies receives less gas, they have to replace it, impacting the supplies of gas for other countries - that's why British energy prices and bills are still affected in a similar way to European ones. There are fears President Vladimir Putin might ""weaponise"" Russia's natural resources by reducing supplies of gas to Europe in response to sanctions. Politicians in Germany are calling for a ""national gas reserve"" to be created to protect consumers from price shocks. Meanwhile, the US is discussing a potential ban on buying Russian energy which has also fuelled price rises. Plane fuel is also linked to the price of crude oil and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has warned tickets for this summer will be higher than 2019, partly because of the rise in the price of oil. UK food producers don't import many items from Russia or Ukraine, but prices here may still rise because of an increase in associated costs, such as tinned cans and packaging and transport. Meanwhile, the cost of everyday food items might rise in places like Turkey and North Africa, which rely on wheat and corn from Ukraine and Russia. Both countries, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally. Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices. More than 40% of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas. The UK, by contrast, typically produces more than 90% of the wheat consumed in the country. But farmers here might find themselves paying more for fertiliser, which is one of Russia's biggest exports. Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, hit 7.5% in January in the US - the highest level seen there since February 1982 - and rose by 5.5% in the UK.  But one economist has warned it could rise close to 10% in major Western economies if the cost of energy and food is pushed up by dwindling supplies cause by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Such a figure might encourage the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast. But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living. Russian stocks crashed by as much as 45% in the wake of the Ukraine invasion with trading subsequently suspended, with banks and oil companies among the worst affected.  It also led to steep falls on stock markets elsewhere around the world: in Europe the UK's FTSE 100 index has fallen over 6% since Russia crossed into Ukraine while Germany's Dax index is nearly 10% lower. Many people's reaction to stock market changes is that they are not directly affected, because they don't invest money in stocks and shares. But there are millions of people with a pension whose savings are invested in the stock market. If widespread falls in share prices are sustained then it's likely to be bad news for pension savers because the value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of investments. Some investors or savers might look to protect their money or assets by moving them to traditional ""safe havens"", like gold, especially as the markets are likely to see more volatility as the crisis develops. But pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet and advisers say it's important not to panic about short-term movements up or down. As a leading commodities exporter, Russia is one of the world's largest suppliers of metals used in everything from aluminium cans, to copper wires, to car components, such as nickel, which is used in lithium-iron batteries, and palladium, which is used in catalytic converters. Everyday goods - which may seem far removed from the conflict - may rise as a result of it. ""When you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure,"" the boss of the London Metals Exchange has warned. If Vladimir Putin decided to cut off supplies of these metals in retaliation to sanctions, existing supply problems could worsen, with car firms having to find alternative sources. Russia is also home to manufacturing hubs for brands like Stellantis, Volkswagen and Toyota. Some production has already been paused at Russian car plants, while shipping and delivery companies halting activity to and from the country is likely to impact the availability of new cars."
market volatility,Oil's bubble trouble,2024-09-15,2023-09-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-66861746,"It's pointing northwards again: the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is a weathervane for the global economy.  The world benchmark has reached the highest level for 10 months, with the spot price peaking on Tuesday lunchtime at $95.72 before falling back a dollar. That's lower than a year ago, and still $25 short of the peak reached in the turmoil of summer 2022, as many countries sought to pivot away from Russian energy supplies and to secure supplies for last winter. In addition, the value of sterling has been sliding against the US dollar, from $1.31 to $1.24 since July 13, and the combined impact has pushed up the cost of fuel for transport and heating. Market analysts think the co-ordinated supply constraints by Saudi Arabia and Russia will keep the price around $95, if not up to the $100 mark.  The oil market was surprised not that these two major exporters were continuing to dial back on production in order to keep the price up, but that they agreed to do so to the end of this year. Rystad Energy published market analysis on Tuesday, saying the current price should be seen as the new normal for oil, with demand continuing to grow through to the end of this decade. The consultancy says the lower prices associated with the recent cycles of boom and bust investment, which brought a glut of oil from fracking in the USA and prices in the mid-fifty dollar range, should be seen as abnormal. The US was able, for a while, to control the dial on world prices, but that power to control supply seems to have passed back to the Saudi-led OPEC export cartel with its Russian friend. The less clear part of the market is whether demand is heading up or down. There are numerous conflicting signals, and for now, market sentiment is listening to the more positive ones for Chinese growth, and therefore increased energy demand. This is a much more complex picture than it used to be. Economic growth required the fuel of oil, so demand went up. But that has been at least partly de-coupled.  It's possible to grow the economy while using less energy more efficiently, and sometimes because the transition to new energy sources is itself helping the economy. The market is tangled with the politics and finance of net zero, in which this most important and influential of commodities is being shunned, for environmental reasons, by some of those people, countries and economies which are set to continue relying on it for years to come. In the UK, the windfall profits from recent spikes in both oil and gas prices continue to mean much higher tax rates, currently at 75% of profits from UK waters, and continued tax uncertainty about whether a future Labour government will tighten investment allowances, or if lower prices, at least for gas, could see the tax eased. And it is likely to play as one of the big issues separating the main parties in the Westminster election campaign, in which the SNP is trying for ambiguity: continued oil and gas if emissions are minimised or mitigated while trying to show leadership on the ""just transition"" to renewables energy.  It's not such an easy message for Humza Yousaf to sell at the United Nations in New York while, back home, former SNP leader Alex Salmond says the approach is folly: ""It would be plain daft to sacrifice such an overwhelming bounty for Scotland when Scotland's oil and gas can be the engine room of an independent Scotland and the resource which is used to fund the development of a Net Zero future.""  Meanwhile, the politics of energy have got creatives in a spin. According to The Drum, news website for the advertising industry, influencers are shunning renewable energy for fear of being accused of green-washing, but at the same time, the oil and gas industry wants to use their media power to further its arguments. One analysis of numerous contracts awarded in the PR industry, by the campaign group Clean Creatives, illustrates just how hard the oil and gas sector is working to fight its corner.  That group is putting pressure on advertising agencies to distance themselves from such work under a threat of being tainted in the eyes of anti-oil campaigners and other clients. We know the big public brands that drill worldwide and sell from the forecourt, such as Shell and BP, are struggling to avoid brand damage from campaigns against the industry. A month ago, Bernard Looney, BP's chief executive, was saying the industry required ""stability and predictability"" from government. That looked an unfortunate irony last week when he left abruptly over inappropriate relationships with staff. The company, meanwhile, was quietly pocketing a UK government licence to re-develop the Murlach field, 125 miles east of Aberdeen - one of around a hundred licences Rishi Sunak says he wants to award. The bigger players can claim to mitigate some of this drilling activity with 14 companies gaining 21 licences, also granted last week, for the storage of captured carbon.  It's claimed these could be storing a tenth of the UK's emissions by the end of the decade, in carbon sinks covering a sea area the size of Yorkshire. Others in the industry are sceptical about that timescale. While majors see a $95 oil price as the time to get back to investing, the battle over their brands opens up opportunities for smaller oil and gas companies. They have less reason to worry about their public images while private equity and other countries' wealth funds continue to back them. For a flavour of what's going on, here is just some recent news from big though less well-known UK drillers, mostly based in Scotland: But without such brand and public pressure, Ithaca now has 100%, and will only pay out to Shell once production starts and the earnings start to roll in, or if it sells on that stake. But without mentioning the election, it warned that beyond next year lies uncertainty.  It is looking to diversify away from its exposure to Britain's tax volatility, with mergers and acquisitions. Harbour is one of those firms pushing into carbon capture and storage, including a role in the Acorn project based around north-east Scotland. It published half-year figures that put it into the red, which is quite an achievement at recent prices. In the first half of last year, as commodity prices soared, it made a profit of $203m (£164m), but this year, that became a $21m (£17m) loss. A key contributor to that was the $76m (£61m) bill for the Energy Profits Levy, the UK windfall tax. Those financial results took 13% off the share price. In the past year, it has halved. That contributes to the difficulty of continuing to invest in UK waters.  Said the chief executive: ""The UK's oil and gas sector faces significant challenges and loss of competitiveness due to uncertainty following the adverse changes to the fiscal regime"". But a shareholder revolt earlier this year has seen a sharp change of direction. Again, higher UK tax has encouraged it to exit British investment.  New management has sold all its assets apart from reserves in Egypt, handed shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars from its drilling war-chest, and shed 80% of its UK-based staff. Only 30 remain in a smaller Edinburgh headquarters.  The London office is being closed, and there are only 20 more staff, in Cairo - another Scottish corporate success story that is running, literally, into the sand."
market volatility,Electricity bills to rise after increase approved,2024-09-15,2023-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-65707754,"Bills are set to rise after the States allowed Guernsey Electricity to increase its revenues by 13%. The States' Trading Supervisory Board (STSB) said the increase would be split between the charge per unit and the daily fixed standing charge. The rise is below the 14.25% increase the company requested. STSB President, Deputy Peter Roffey, said the increase was ""regrettable but unavoidable"". The additional revenue will fund ""essential investment in the island's electricity infrastructure and offset the escalating cost of electricity import and generation arising from the market volatility caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine"", the States said. In the past 12 months, those costs incurred by the company have increased by £3.3m above what had been forecast in 2022, it added. Karl Brouard, Guernsey Electricity's chief financial officer, said: ""For the average usage customer on the standard or economy tariffs, both without electric heating, the combined impact of these changes is a rise of around £200 per year per household. ""We understand that this comes at a time when the cost of living is increasing for everyone, but we cannot delay much needed investment and upgrading of the network, along with the requirement to maintain the security of electricity supply to the island."" Deputy Roffey said: ""It is regrettable that Guernsey Electricity had to apply for such a significant increase in tariffs, but this is a nettle that had to be grasped."" He said ""a rise is unavoidable. We recognise the timing is bad, but to put it off could simply store up even greater challenges in the years ahead"". In deciding on a lower increase than the company had requested, the STSB said it had considered the impact on consumers ""in particular during the current economic climate"". ""The STSB has therefore acted responsibly in approving an increase, although not to the level that Guernsey Electricity had requested, which will require the company to continue focusing on improving efficiency,"" he said. The STSB also took independent advice and considered the results of a public consultation. Electricity bills will increase from 1 July. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

market volatility,US banks report gains but shares sink,2024-09-15,2018-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43758938,"Profits at JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo rose in the first three months of the year, but their shares slumped on Friday despite the gains. JP Morgan's profits soared 35% year-on-year, with more modest increases reported at Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Analysts said the share decline was a sign investors had already factored in some of the rise. They were expecting more active stock markets and a lower tax rate to boost results. Shares in all three banks sank more than 2% in early trading, providing a sour start to earnings season, when companies report quarterly performance to investors.  JP Morgan reported profits of $8.7bn (£6.11bn) in the period from $6.4bn last year, despite a decline in investment banking. Revenue increased 10% to $28.5bn, as a strong economy boosted activity at its consumer banking unit and the return of market fluctuations boosted trading, leading its equities unit to a record quarter. Citigroup's profits rose 13%, reaching $4.6bn in the quarter from $4.1bn last year.  Revenues in the quarter were $18.4bn, a 3% increase from the same period in 2017. The firm said volatility boosted its equity trading unit, helping to offset a fall in bond trading. As with JP Morgan, investment banking took a hit. Wells Fargo reported preliminary profits of $5.9bn in the quarter, rising 5% from the same period last year. The results were overshadowed by the firm's ongoing problems with watchdogs. Wells said US regulators have proposed to resolve investigations of vehicle insurance and might force it to restate its results. ""At this time, we are unable to predict final resolution ... and cannot reasonably estimate our related loss contingency,"" the bank said. The firm has been under a cloud since revelations that the bank created more than two million fake accounts to meet sales goals and ignored or punished whistleblowers. Then last year, the bank said it had wrongly charged customers for car insurance, among other problems.  In February, the US Federal Reserve, which regulates banks, said it would restrict the firm's growth until it improved its risk management oversight. Revenue slipped from $22.3bn in the first quarter of 2017 to $21.9bn this period, hurt in part by ""customer-friendly"" changes the bank made to card and overdraft fees. "
market volatility,Adani calls off share sale after price plunges,2024-09-15,2023-02-01,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64490221,"India's Adani Enterprises has called off its share sale after the share price plunged on Wednesday. The Adani Group's flagship company confirmed the $2.5bn (£2bn) raised from the sale would be returned to investors after shares fell 26%. The group's companies have seen more than $90bn wiped off their value since a US investment firm made fraud claims. Adani denies the allegations. Gautam Adani, the founder, has fallen out of the top 10 richest in the world. According to the Forbes real-time billionaires list, Mr Adani is now the 15th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $74.7bn. He was third on the list last week. The billionaire runs Adani Group, one of India's biggest companies. The flagship company Adani Enterprises has operations in a wide range of industries including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy.  Last week, Hindenburg Research, a company that specialises in ""short-selling"", or betting against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall, released a report that accused Mr Adani of ""pulling the largest con in corporate history"".  It also alleged the Adani Group had engaged in decades of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, and claimed its companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". The group has dismissed the allegations as malicious and untrue, calling them an ""attack on India"". The report came days ahead of a planned sale of Adani shares to the public, and on Tuesday, the $2.5bn share sale in the group's flagship company managed to scrape through to be fully subscribed despite the controversy.  But shares plunged 26.7% on Wednesday, taking the total fall in market value for the group over $90bn, according to Bloomberg. After the market closed, Adani Group said the company would return the share sale proceeds due to ""the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility"". ""Given these extraordinary circumstances, the Company's board felt that going ahead with the issue would not be morally correct,"" said Mr Adani. ""The interest of the investors is paramount and hence to insulate them from any potential financial losses, the Board has decided not to go ahead with the FPO (follow-on public offer)."" Mr Adani said the company's balance sheet was ""very healthy with strong cashflows and secure assets"" ""We have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt,"" he added. ""This decision will not have any impact on our existing operations and future plans."" Adani Group has hit back at the allegations against it and said it was evaluating ""remedial and punitive action"" against Hindenburg Research in the US and India. It said it had always been ""in compliance with all laws"". In an interview with Mint newspaper, the group's chief financial officer compared Hindenburg Research to General Dyer, the British officer of the Bengal Army responsible for a massacre that killed hundreds of Indians in the city of Amritsar in 1919. Hindenburg responded saying the group was stoking a nationalist narrative to obfuscate the fraud allegations."
market volatility,US spies peer into the future - and it's not rosy,2024-09-15,2021-04-08,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56683852,"The US Intelligence Community has issued a survey of where the world may end up in 2040. It warns of a political volatility and growing international competition or even conflict.  The report entitled A More Contested World is an attempt to look at key trends and outlines a series of possible scenarios. It is the seventh such report with one coming every four years since 1997 from the National Intelligence Council. The Global Trends 2040 report does not make comfortable reading if you are a political leader or international diplomat - or hope to be one in the coming years. The latest attempt by the US National Intelligence Council to understand what may happen within and between countries points to uncertainty and instability. It firstly focuses on the key factors driving change. One is political volatility. ""In many countries, people are pessimistic about the future and growing more distrustful of leaders and institutions that they see as unable or unwilling to deal with disruptive economic, technological, and demographic trends,"" the report warns.  Vulnerable democracies It argues people are gravitating to like-minded groups and making greater and more varied demands of governments at a time when those governments are increasingly constrained in what they can do.  ""This mismatch between governments' abilities and publics' expectations is likely to expand and lead to more political volatility, including growing polarisation and populism within political systems, waves of activism and protest movements, and, in the most extreme cases, violence, internal conflict, or even state collapse."" Unmet expectations, fuelled by social media and technology, could lead to risks for democracy.  ""Looking forward, many democracies are likely to be vulnerable to further erosion and even collapse,"" the report warns, although adding that these pressures will also affect authoritarian regimes. Pandemic a massive 'global disruption' The report says the current pandemic is the ""most significant, singular global disruption since World War II"", which has fuelled divisions, accelerated existing changes and challenged assumptions, including over how well governments can cope. The last report in 2017 included such a possibility - imagining that ""the global pandemic of 2023"" dramatically reduced global travel to contain its spread.   The authors acknowledge they did not expect Covid-19, which they say has ""shaken long-held assumptions about resilience and adaptation and created new uncertainties about the economy, governance, geopolitics, and technology"".  Climate change and demographic shifts will also be key drivers, as will be technology, which could prove disruptive but also empower those who harness it fastest and first. Geopolitical competition Internationally, the analysts expects the intensity of competition for global influence to reach its highest level since the Cold War over the coming two decades amid the continuing weakening of the old order as institutions like the United Nations struggle.  Non-governmental organisations, including religious groups and what are called ""technology superstar firms"" may also have the ability to build networks that compete with - or even - bypass states. The risk of conflict may increase, with it becoming harder to deter new weapons being used.  Jihadist terrorism is likely to continue but there is a warning that extreme right- and left-wing terrorists promoting issues such as racism, environmentalism and anti-government extremism could revive in Europe, Latin America and North America.  Groups could use artificial intelligence to become more dangerous or use augmented reality to create ""virtual terrorist training camps"". The competition between the US and China lies at the heart of many of the differences in the scenarios - whether one of them becomes more successful or whether the two compete equally or divide the world into separate silos. Read more by Gordon Corera A 2004 report also predicted a caliphate emerging out of the Middle East, much as the Islamic State group tried to create in the last decade, although the same report - looking ahead to 2020 - did not quite capture the competition with China which now dominates US security thinking.  The overall aim is to look at possible futures rather than predict with certainty. Stronger democracies or 'the world adrift'? There are some optimistic scenarios for 2040 - one called ""the renaissance of democracies"".  This involves the US and its allies harnessing technology and economic growth to deal with domestic and international challenges, while China and Russia's crackdowns (including in Hong Kong) stifle innovation and strengthen the appeal of democracy.  But others are bleaker.   ""The world adrift scenario"" imagines market economies never recovering from the Covid pandemic, becoming domestically deeply divided and living in an international system that is ""directionless, chaotic and volatile"" as international rules and institutions are ignored by countries, corporations and other groups. One scenario, though, does manage to combine pessimism with optimism.  ""Tragedy and Mobilisation"" imagines a world in the midst of a global catastrophe in the early 2030s thanks to climate change, famine and unrest - but this in turn leads to a new global coalition, driven in part by social movements, to address the problems. Of course, none of the scenarios may come to pass or - more likely - a combination or something entirely novel may emerge. The aim, the authors say, is to prepare for an array of possible futures - even if many of them look far from rosy."
market volatility,Lessons must be learned from A6 delays - Campbell,2024-09-15,2023-04-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65172930,"Lessons must be learned from the delays to the long-awaited A6 road upgrade, DUP MP Gregory Campbell has said.  The 16-mile (25.5km) stretch of road between Londonderry and Dungiven will open on Thursday. Work started in 2018 but has been beset by continual delays.  Mr Campbell also reiterated his calls for a public inquiry into the project.   The Department for Infrastructure's (DfI) Kaine Lynch said the project had to be delivered ""in extremely challenging circumstances"". He added there were many factors as to why there had been delays to the road opening, citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the increased costs of building materials and some materials being in short supply. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 16-mile section of dual carriageway will include a bypass around Dungiven. The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's Breakfast Show, Mr Campbell said it was ""exceptionally good news"" that the project will be open before the Easter break.  ""It is great news but we should have had more information throughout - this was due to be finished more than a year ago,"" the East Londonderry MP said.   Mr Campbell said a public inquiry should happen, but added ""what is probably more important now is that the lessons of the delay over the past 18 months need to be learned for any future projects"". In Dungiven, local people welcomed the news.  Sheila McCartney from local clothing and giftware shop Nora & Katie said there was ""huge potential"" for businesses and tourism. ""We're just really looking forward to a nicer, less polluted, quieter Dungiven,"" she said. Local butcher Dessie McAleese said he was looking forward to the road's opening on Thursday. ""It's brilliant for the town because it is very congested, especially at the weekends, and the parking facilities are terrible."" Kaine Lynch said the DfI was ""delivering the largest road infrastructure project ever in Northern Ireland. ""We experienced the war in Ukraine, Covid-19, material shortages and supply chain issues.""   Mr Lynch said that in terms of scale of the project, they had more than 600 people working on the site in peak periods, have excavated enough material to fill Wembley Stadium in London and planted close to 750,000 trees. He conceded that ""people have waited a long time for this road"" but said that he is delighted that road users will be able to reap the benefits of it from Thursday.  Mr Lynch said 15,000 vehicles use the route each day and it will reduce journey time from Drumahoe to Dungiven by about 45% and be a ""significant benefit"" to improving road safety. The DfI had previously said the initial estimate of £220m was now likely to be in the region of £250m.  ""That is in the region of 12% over where we originally estimated,"" Mr Lynch said.  ""I know £30m is a lot of money, but given the scale of the project and the scale of the challenges that we faced I think that is a pretty good outcome."""
market volatility,Warning over fuel prices as oil hits 10-month high,2024-09-15,2023-09-19,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66852329,"Drivers have been warned of rising fuel costs after global oil prices surged to their highest level for 10 months. Brent crude, a benchmark for prices, breached $95 a barrel on Tuesday amid predictions of shorter supplies. It came as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said a decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut production could cause a ""significant supply shortfall"" by the end of this year. The RAC motoring group warned drivers were ""in for a hard time"" at the pumps. Latest figures show UK drivers are now paying £1.55 on average per litre of petrol, with diesel at £1.59.  Since the start of August, average petrol prices have increased by 10p per litre and diesel prices by 13p. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year. They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market. Saudi Arabia and Russia, members of the Opec+ group and two of the world's largest oil-producing nations, decided to reduce production earlier in August. At the same time, the US Energy Information Administration said on Monday that US oil output from its top shale-producing regions was set to decline in October for the third straight month, reaching its lowest level since May.  As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. However, the West has accused Opec, whose members regularly meet to agree on production levels, of manipulating prices. Petrol and diesel prices have jumped in recent months, and further rises could lie ahead due to crude oil being the main component of fuel, motoring groups say.  The AA warned rising prices were coming at a time when fuel efficiency typically drops as a result of darker evenings due to engines needing to work harder with heaters and lights being used more. ""Drivers have been lashed by a 10p-a-litre rise in the cost of petrol since the beginning of August,"" said Luke Bodset, the AA's spokesman on pump prices. ""The only things in their favour have been daylight still in the rush hour and mild weather, which means less fuel consumption. The drivers now beginning to feel happier are those with electric cars."" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said with oil heading back towards $100 a barrel, drivers were ""in for a hard time at the pumps"", but he added that a rise to three figures ""should really only take the average price up by another 2p"". But he warned: ""If retailers are intent on making more money per litre with increased margins then this could [take the average petrol price] closer to 160p."" Analysts warn rising global oil prices could impact inflation - the rate at which prices rise - in many countries. Inflation soared in 2022 and has only recently started to come down. ""The symbolically important $100 [a barrel of oil] mark is now being considered once more,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This is a difficult development, with fuel accounting for a significant portion of overall inflation."" The latest inflation figure for the UK will be released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday. Inflation has fallen in recent months but remains high at 6.8%. Over the last few years households have been hit by higher fuel and energy bills, while businesses have put up prices to cope with rising costs. A recent fall in the pound may have made fuel even more expensive. As well as supply and demand, oil prices are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as Brent crude is traded in dollars.  Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman defended Opec+'s moves to restrict supply on Monday, saying energy markets needed light-handed regulation to limit volatility."
market volatility,Can India's Adani Group recover from $100bn loss?,2024-09-15,2023-02-07,By Archana Shukla,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495573,"India's Adani Group has seen its market value plunge after a US investment firm made fraud allegations against it. Can its ambitious growth plans survive?  Until two weeks ago, the ports-to-energy conglomerate which operates seven publicly traded companies had a combined valuation of $220bn.  But since 24 January, when short seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, its valuations have nearly halved. The group's founder Gautam Adani has seen billions wiped off his personal wealth and has dropped out of the list of the world's top 20 richest people. The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious"" and ""baseless"" and says it plans have not changed. But investors are clearly still nervous.  On Monday, the group said in a statement that it would prepay loans worth $1.1bn, taken using shares as collateral, ahead of their maturity date next year. This, it said, was partly due to ""continued market volatility"" and to assure investors that the group's promoters would ""prepay all shares-backed financing"". The announcement led to a rally in the flagship company's stock - on Tuesday, shares of Adani Enterprises closed 15% higher on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Last week, the group also called off its secondary share sale. The 2.5bn (£2bn) it had raised was meant to pay off debt and fund projects, including airport renovation, expressway construction and an ambitious green hydrogen ecosystem. They indicate investors are losing confidence in a company. Analysts are now watching to see how the stock price slide affects the company's operations, cash flow and expansion plans. ""Most of their ambitious projects will have to be heavily scaled back in ambition and timetable, because they will have next to no capacity to raise funds right now,"" says Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance, a think-tank that works on financial issues related to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy. It could borrow money to fund projects and acquisitions - a common strategy for infrastructure companies, which helped fuel the Adani Group's rapid growth. But the group's debt has grown at a faster pace than revenues and profitability, which some fear could raise risks of a default - a concern flagged by both the Hindenburg report as well as some analysts. The group already has total debt of nearly two trillion rupees ($24bn; £20bn) - it almost doubled over the past three years as Mr Adani's ambitions extended to areas such as 5G and green hydrogen. Nearly two-thirds of Adani's debt is from overseas sources such as bonds or foreign banks, according to a report by global brokerage Jefferies. Until now, the group has mostly raised funds by using its infrastructure assets or shares as collateral. But with stock prices plunging, the value of this collateral has also dipped. The private wealth units of two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, Bloomberg has reported.  Many Indian banks have also loaned billions of dollars to companies linked to the group and state-owned insurance firm Life Insurance Corporation of India has invested in it. Market observers say that the Hindenburg report and the reaction to it will make lenders cautious - which means loans could become costlier. ""There is pressure on the company's credibility. It will make it extremely difficult to raise fresh loans, especially in the overseas market,"" an Indian corporate banker said on condition of anonymity as he didn't want to be seen commenting on the Adani Group. Another observer, a former banker with an international wealth fund, said that the group may be forced to delay some projects until the issue settles down. He also did not want to be named. The BBC sent a list of questions to the Adani Group. A spokesperson replied: ""All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group's core fundamentals remain unchanged.""  Scrutiny on the group has now increased. Investors and credit rating agencies are closely assessing its ability to raise money and repay loans. S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its outlook on two Adani companies to negative. ""New investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,"" it said.   In a video statement after the group's share sale was called off, Mr Adani had said that its balance sheet was ""healthy and assets robust"". He added that the group has an ""impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations"". But credit rating agency ICRA said in a statement last week that the group's large, debt-funded capital spending programme remains a key challenge. Most of the group's capital-guzzling new businesses such as green energy, airports and roads are housed under flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and depend on it for funds. AEL has enough cash but could come under pressure if it has to pay interest for even its subsidiaries. Some of the group's firms will be shielded from the current volatility because they own and operate strong physical assets such as ports, airports and factories. ""Adani Ports and Adani Power are the strongest and most well-capitalised [firms], which means their assets are backed by long-term government contracts. Most of the loans taken by these companies are against these revenue and profit-accruing assets,"" says the corporate banker quoted above. However, this isn't the case for some of the group's newer businesses. Companies such as Adani Gas and renewable energy arm Adani Green already have immense debt on their books and are still building up their cash flows. This could make them more vulnerable to market shocks and reduce their creditworthiness. The banker points out that while the prices of bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have fallen only marginally, those issued by Adani Green had lost more than a quarter of their value in three days. Deferring new projects and selling some assets to raise money could be a way out. ICRA has said that some of the planned capital spending is discretionary in nature and can be deferred, depending on how much liquidity it has. ""The company has built assets that are valuable to a developing country like India, and there will be many strategic investors interested,"" said a corporate adviser who didn't want to be named. Some analysts remain optimistic. ""I have seen varied operating [Adani] projects from ports, airports, cements to renewables which are solid, stable and generating a healthy cash flow. They are completely safe from the ups and downs of what happens in the stock market,"" says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert who is founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.  Analysts are also watching to see if there will be a regulatory enquiry into the group's corporate governance. The issue has also set off a political row over Mr Adani's perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which both deny.  On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi from the main opposition Congress party brought up the allegations in parliament, accusing Mr Modi of helping the Adani Group - his comments caused uproar, with a federal minister accusing Mr Gandhi of levelling ""wild allegations"" without proof.    A day earlier, the party had held protests across the country, demanding an investigation into the allegations. Mr Buckley says that as pressure mounts, the Adani Group's ability to win government contracts easily to ramp up revenues will be challenged. It will also find it difficult to restore its credit credibility.  Since the group has to repay a significant amount, it will have to do a strategic asset sale, he says. "
market volatility,Bitcoin trading gets another big boost,2024-09-15,2017-12-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42386893,"Bitcoin has moved another step towards mainstream investing with the start of trading on the huge Chicago Mercantile Exchange financial futures market. It comes as the value of the digital currency approached $20,000 on Sunday, before drifting below $19,000. Last week, Chicago's CBOE exchange began Bitcoin futures trading - bets on a future price - but CME is far bigger. On Sunday, the chairman of UBS bank and former Bundesbank head Axel Weber joined the chorus of Bitcoin warnings. ""Bitcoin is not money,"" he said in an interview, and urged regulators to intervene.  Meanwhile the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called for the issue to be discussed at the G20 summit of major economies in April.  ""There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how... with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin"", Mr Maire told the French news channel LCI.  Bitcoin prices have surged this year: a single bitcoin stood at less than $1,000 in January and hit a record $19,783 on Sunday, according to Coindesk. Analysts believe CME's entry into the Bitcoin market will generate more interest in the crypto-currency, possibly pushing the price higher.  The CBOE futures contract is based on a closing price of Bitcoin from the Gemini exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. However, the CME contract price will be culled from multiple exchanges, potentially offering investors more transparency about the value.  ""The CME [futures] contract is based on a broader array of exchanges,"" said Matt Osborne, chief investment officer of Altegris, which has $2.5bn in alternative investments.   ""So there is a possibility that the CME contract may generate more interest and more volume. ""Volumes are going to slowly increase as professional traders get comfortable with the price action and more importantly get comfortable with the volatility."" Institutional investors are prohibited from buying Bitcoin directly because the market is unregulated, but they can buy futures contracts. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date.  Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value.  CBOE Bitcoin futures surged nearly 20% on their debut last Monday, and more than 4,000 contracts changed hands by the end of the day. But as interest in the digital currency increases, so do the warnings.  Mr Weber told the Swiss Sunday newspaper that investors should resist jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon, saying the bubble would inevitably burst. He said Bitcoin does not fulfil the three main functions of money because, in his view: it is not an effective means of payment; it is not a good measure of value (since prices are not written in Bitcoin); and it is not an effective way to store value, since it is inherently unstable. UBS advises clients against investing in the virtual currency, he said, because the bank does ""not consider it valuable and not sustainable"". To protect investors who do not take the bank's advice, ""regulators are needed,"" Mr Weber said. However, many people say financial regulation is difficult, if not impossible, because transparency was not part of Bitcoin's creation. Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden. "
market volatility,New York Stock Exchange trading floor reopens,2024-09-15,2020-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52803390,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has reopened its trading floor after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. But as new social distance rules come into effect, the exchange looks and feels very different. The NYSE is one of the few bourses to still feature floor trade - most have shifted to fully-electronic trading. New York City has been hit hard by the outbreak with some 200,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths. Financial markets have continued to trade throughout the pandemic, but the exchange's trading floor was closed from 23 March and activity temporarily moved to fully-electronic trading to protect workers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on hand to ring the bell that re-started in-person trade, a sign of the symbolic weight attached to the reopening. US shares gained on Tuesday amid investor enthusiasm about economic rebound, but the new NYSE rules are a reminder that a full return to business will take time. ""It's not about returning to normal,"" NYSE president Stacey Cunningham told the BBC. ""It's about living with this global pandemic until there's a vaccine."" She added that she had faced ""no pressure"" from the Trump administration, which follows financial markets closely and has generally supported a rapid reopening.  Under the NYSE changes, only a quarter of the normal number of traders will be allowed to return to work. Traders must also avoid public transport, wear masks and follow strict social distancing rules, with newly fitted transparent barriers to keep people apart. They will also be screened and have their temperatures taken as they enter the building. Anyone who fails pass the check will be barred until they test negative for coronavirus or self-quarantine in accordance with US government guidelines. To return to their jobs, floor traders also have to sign a liability waiver that prevents them from suing the NYSE if they get infected at the exchange.  Some large financial companies, such as Morgan Stanley, have reportedly balked at signing, but Ms Cunningham defended the waiver as a way to ensure that traders, which are not employed by the exchange, abide by the new rules.  ""We need to make sure that they're committed to following this new norm,"" she said. NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of the total market capitalisation of listed companies. The 228-year-old exchange last closed its doors on 29 October 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy. It also shut for four sessions in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.  But the bourse resisted closing at the start of the pandemic and the closure reignited debate about the necessity of the floor in an era dominated by electronic activity. Ms Cunningham said trading has functioned smoothly with the floor closed, but she believed reopening will further ease volatility and help smaller firms that rely on in-person trades for their business. ""We are relevant we are necessary and WE ARE BACK,"" floor trader Peter Tuchman wrote on Twitter ahead of the reopening. For most people outside the financial world, NYSE's trading floor is a rare glimpse into the seemingly opaque workings of the global markets as well as being a colourful setting for companies to showcase their stock market debuts. The new regulations mean that the NYSE's high-profile opening bell events and stock market debut celebrations have been put on hold as visitors are banned. Media organisations that usually broadcast from the trading floor won't be allowed back until further notice. In the BBC interview, Ms Cunningham also addressed a proposal by US lawmakers to require companies that sell shares in the US to abide by American accounting rules and audits, or face de-listing.  The move, which comes as US-China tensions increase, is aimed at Chinese companies. The Senate passed the measure last week and the House is expected to take up the measure before the end of the summer.  Ms Cunningham in the past has said de-listing Chinese companies generally would simply shift their business elsewhere.  On Tuesday, she said lawmakers should ""balance"" investor protections and investor choice, but that the exchange backs efforts that would enhance the information supplied to investors. ""Any measures to enforce that are highly supported by us,"" she said. Trading - but not as we know it Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC reporter New York Before the coronavirus, I was a regular on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  It may be one of the great symbols of US capitalism, but it's also, just a workplace for hundreds of traders, market makers, and various bystanders such as journalists. And like so many offices and shop floors it's not somewhere that you would ever associate with social distancing, keeping two metres apart and wearing masks. Quite the reverse - face-to-face stock trading is sometimes close to a contact sport, as is reporting from the floor.  So the NYSE has to take its reopening very slowly. It will be a relief for some traders to be back to work, but it's not going to look like the trading floor we're all used to seeing for quite some time."

market volatility,Future of US bank in doubt as investors flee,2024-09-15,2023-04-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65403307,"Shares in First Republic have tumbled nearly 30% to close at a new record low amid renewed fears the US bank could be the next to collapse. The sell-off extended steep declines from a day earlier after the bank said customers had pulled $100bn in deposits from the bank in March. First Republic has been under pressure since a series of US bank failures last month sparked fears of a wider crisis. Its shares have shed 95% of their value in a matter of weeks. Shares ended Wednesday trading at less than $6 each, compared with more than $120 at the start of March. Founded in San Francisco in 1985, the bank is known for having a big mortgage lending business and a large stable of wealthy clients, many of whom had saved more money with the bank than would be guaranteed by the government. It was seen as vulnerable to a bank run - and being squeezed by higher interest rates, as it is forced to pay more to keep deposits, while earning less on the home loans made when rates were lower.  Last month it received a $30bn influx from some of America's biggest banks, a rescue plan aimed at shoring up confidence in the lender, which had seemed to calm fears. But the scale of the withdrawals revealed this week was even worse than investors had expected.  On Wednesday, the stock swung sharply and trading was repeatedly halted amid the volatility.  The bank - which was the 14th largest in America at the end of 2022 - has said it is exploring its options.  US media outlets have reported it is trying to convince the banks that supported it before to buy more of its assets to help prop up the business. They also say regulators are on alert but not prepared to step in yet. ""There can be no certainty that the bank will be able to take actions to strengthen our business within a time frame that is acceptable to the market or our regulators,"" the bank said on Monday.  ""There can be no certainty as to the future of the bank if we are not able to do so."" Problems in the banking sector surfaced in the US earlier last month when Silicon Valley Bank, which was the country's 16th-largest lender, collapsed in the biggest failure of a US bank since 2008. That was followed two days later by the failure of New York's Signature Bank. Authorities stepped in to guarantee deposits beyond typical limits in an effort to head off further runs on bank deposits. But the move, which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp has estimated cost roughly $20bn, did not immediately prevent concerns from spreading.  In Europe, Swiss officials also brokered a rescue for troubled banking giant Credit Suisse, which saw 61.2bn Swiss francs ($69bn; £55.2bn) leave the bank in the first three months of the year.  Central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - have sharply increased interest rates as they try to curb inflation. The moves have hurt the values of the large portfolios of bonds bought by banks when rates were lower.  Customers worried about the financial implications for Silicon Valley Bank abruptly pulled funds from their accounts, leading to its collapse. The episode also raised fears about the situation at other firms."
market volatility,Energy firms face stricter tests after collapses,2024-09-15,2021-12-15,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59664188,"Energy companies will face more robust financial checks from January after a host of companies failed owing to a wholesale price surge, the regulator Ofgem has announced. Bosses of firms will also undergo more stringent vetting. More than 20, mostly small, suppliers have collapsed following a spike in wholesale gas prices. Nearly four million other households have seen their supplier fail since the start of the pandemic. The regulator also said it was consulting on the future set up of the energy price cap, designed to protect customers who have not switched. It has been highlighted as part of the problem by some failed companies.  ""I am setting out clear action so that we have robust stress testing for suppliers so they can't pass inappropriate risk to consumers,"" said Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley.   ""Our priority has been, and will always be, to act in the best interests of energy consumers. The months ahead will be difficult for many, and we are working with the government and energy companies to mitigate the impact as much as we can, particularly for the most vulnerable households.""  A significant rise in bills for 15 million people is inevitable in April, but Ofgem is also consulting on possible changes to the way tariffs are offered in the longer-term. Options include customers being tied in to a standard tariff for six months, like a fixed term mortgage. If they left early for a cheaper deal, they would be charged an exit fee, unlike now. The argument is that suppliers and remaining customers would not be left picking up the cost of their departure, although exit fees would be controversial. Other suggestions include forcing companies to offer the same price to existing customers as they do to new customers. A similar rule is being introduced for home and motor insurance in January. There might also be a charge paid by a supplier each time it takes on a new customer.  The price cap may also be reviewed every three months, rather than the current six, or an interim price cap introduced if market conditions changed dramatically. When a host of energy companies collapsed, Ofgem was heavily criticised for having been asleep at the wheel, and unprepared for such a crisis. Citizens Advice, the official advocate for energy customers, recently published what it described as Ofgem's ""catalogue of errors"" in recent years, that was now ultimately leaving customers having to pick up a multi-million pound bill. That included an accusation that poor practice was rife, with many companies showing clear evidence of financial unsustainability, ""including firms run out of the owners' living rooms and kitchens"". These latest announcement by Ofgem will address some of those concerns. They include: The regulator is also consulting on whether to block firms from taking on new customers once they hit certain milestones - such as 50,000 and 200,000 accounts - until it is happy with their balance sheet strength. ""What we want to say to suppliers is either get some insurance, buy your energy ahead or have enough money in the bank to weather a storm like this,"" Mr Brearley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Customers of collapsed firms now have to pay more for their energy, because their original tariff was not protected. Those on the price cap also saw prices rises in October. This has been a major factor in the rising cost of living, with inflation now rising at its fastest rate for a decade. Mr Brearley said that customers should brace themselves for a further significant rise in gas prices in April, when a new price cap is introduced. ""Where you have legitimate price increases and the increase in gas is legitimate then those costs need to be passed onto customers. I know that's really hard, but we do expect a significant rise in April,"" he said. He added that it was too early to give a figure and refuted that Ofgem had failed to take control of the market. ""Our job as a regulator is to make sure people pay a fair price for energy but no more than that,"" he said. Ofgem said the cap had saved consumers an estimated £1bn a year since its introduction.  However it said the current methodology, while protecting consumers from price spikes, exposed suppliers to risks that are harder to manage at times of high energy price volatility.  ""There is a risk that, if not tackled, this could lead to higher costs for consumers,"" the regulator said."
market volatility,Markets drop as tech slowdown fears grow,2024-09-15,2018-11-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46272632,"A sell-off on Wall Street continued on Tuesday, amid steep declines in oil prices and losses among technology shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 550 points to close 2.2% lower, weighed down by Apple, whose share price plunged by nearly 5%. The broader S&P 500 dropped 1.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 1.7% to its lowest level since February. Meanwhile, benchmark oil prices sank nearly 7%, close to one-year lows. Connor Campbell at Spreadex described the sell-off as a ""macro-car crash, with Brexit fears, the post-Apec pre-G20 US-China trade war flare-up and the continuation of a nasty US tech sell-off resulting in absolute carnage"". It also reflects underlying concerns about slowing global growth, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. In the US, a robust economy had so far largely shielded stock markets from some of those worries. However, Mr Behravesh said investors now expect a boost from tax cuts and increased government spending to fade. ""This stimulus will wear off by late 2019 and early 2020, and the US economy will join the others in seeing a significant loss of speed,"" he said.  US retailers were punished for weak results and forecasts, with shares in Target sinking 10%, while Kohl's tumbled 9% and Walmart was dragged almost 3% lower. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their price target for Apple shares from $209 to $182, blaming very weak demand from China in the late summer as well as a stronger US dollar. Michael O'Rouke at Jonestrading said retailers as well as big technology firms such as Amazon and Facebook had pushed the market higher for most of this year.  ""Now that's fading, so people are more apt to take profit and de-risk going into the year-end. There are the headwinds of the trade war out there. The fiscal stimulus from tax cuts is starting to fade ... we don't have many positive catalysts,"" he said. By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent  The balloons will soon be inflated for the Thanksgiving Day parade just as the air seems to be coming out of the US markets. Tuesday's sell-off seemed to be sparked by disappointing earnings from several retailers. Aside from that, Wall Street traders offered up several reasons for the recent volatility. One was President Trump's trade war with China. Any escalation could hurt US and Chinese companies by raising production costs and the price for consumers. Another was the prospect that America's central bank could raise interest rates to combat inflation and stop the economy from overheating. This makes it more expensive for companies to borrow and invest. Whatever is behind the latest stock market gyrations, it's worth remembering that the current bull market is the oldest in history.  For months some have warned that the US market is overvalued. In which case what you may be witnessing is a shift as investors move from chasing yield - financial jargon for the return on their investment - to managing risk. The US market falls extended declines in Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 index slipped back below 7,000 points. The DAX index in Frankfurt fell 1.5%, while in Paris, the CAC 40 was 1.2% lower.  IHS Markit said the market swings are starting to hurt business sentiment and capital spending. But analysts at Oxford Economics said they think the effect on consumer spending - the biggest economic driver in the US - is likely to be relatively muted. The firm wrote: ""This doesn't mean the economy is insulated from stock market movements, but rather that so long as those movements don't excessively weigh on confidence, employment and income, consumers can be expected to continue spending.""  Since market turmoil emerged in earnest in October, all three major US indexes have largely given up the gains made earlier in 2018. Oil prices for the major benchmarks are also down about 30% since last month. On Tuesday, Brent crude fell by 6.5% to $62.58 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate shed 6.8% to $53.41 a barrel.  Hans Redeker at Morgan Stanley commented: ""For the US equity market to stabilise, either the rest of the world will have to show better growth or the Fed will have to moderate its stance."""
market volatility,Why West Africa wants a single currency,2024-09-15,2019-07-06,By Louise Dewast,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48882030,"Fifteen countries in West Africa have agreed to adopt a single currency next year called the eco. Experts are divided on the impact it would have on the region's economy, especially in the eight member states which use CFA franc - which is backed by France. Negotiations for the joint currency have been in the works for 30 years.  The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), the region's political and economic union, said the rollout will be gradual with countries meeting the laid-out criteria joining first.  Eight countries already use the CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro, and is guaranteed by France. The other seven have their own currencies, none of them freely convertible. Proponents of the eco say the single currency will facilitate trade, lower transaction costs and facilitate payments amongst Ecowas' 385 million people.  However, critics worry that Nigeria, the region's biggest economy, will dominate monetary policy and stall the projected benefits.  For economists Ferdinand Backoup and Daniel Ndoye, a single currency would prove a valuable instrument in the international monetary system:  ""West African countries - like most other developing countries - are not immune to monetary shocks caused by policies implemented in the rest of the world,"" the pair wrote in a briefing note for the African Development Bank. A single currency can offer a chance, they say, to put up a ""collective and effective front"" against these disruptions. About the ECO It looks extremely unlikely that all 15 countries will meet this target. The single currency was first planned to be introduced in 2003 but the launch has been postponed several times; in 2005, 2010 and 2014. It is possible, although ambitious, that some countries will meet the current criteria for the 2020 deadline - the primary four being: These criteria, along with two other secondary ones, are due to be assessed by Ecowas by the end of 2019. One of the problems is inconsistency: countries could, for example, meet the criteria next year, and then fall behind the following year.  In 2016, only one country, Liberia, met all the six conditions, and no single criterion was met by all the countries.   Economist Martial Belinga, author of Liberate Africa From Monetary Slavery, says 2020 is a symbolic goal. ""It's more about the process,"" he said. ""Having a deadline pushes states to reach the criteria.""  Mr Belinga says Ecowas might want to consider revising the entrance criteria, as long as they remain credible.  Ecowas has said adoption would be gradual though, so the countries that do meet the criteria can join, and the others can follow later.  If the goal is to boost trade, some analysts are sceptical that a single currency is key. ""We struggle in Nigeria alone to get produce from the north to Lagos, and to other southern parts where it can be consumed,"" said Sanyade Okoli, head of Alpha African Advisory. ""If goods can't move freely, how can we even talk about a single currency? she asked. ""We need to address poor infrastructure, bureaucracy - the lower-hanging fruits first"". For Mr Belinga, the real impediment to trade in the region is not the lack of a single currency but that countries don't have much to trade.  ""West African countries must transform their economies, with diversification and added value industries,"" he says.  ""That's the real solution to face external shocks and volatility."" Currently, most countries rely on commodities whose prices are regulated on international markets.  For the economist, the single currency isn't ""an end in itself"". Although talk of a political federation has not dominated the latest discussions, critics point at pitfalls of running a joint currency without a political union.  Economists Ferdinand Bakoup and Daniel Ndoye say the commitment of regional leaders should allay such fears.  ""The creation of a presidential task force to monitor the single currency creation process, headed by the heads of state of Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast and the Committee of Central Bank governors, is a glaring illustration,"" they said. ""What now remains is to transform this commitment by accelerating the implementation of reforms to help achieve this objective"". You may also be interested in: But despite their will to move forward, many also fear losing part of their sovereignty.  ""As Africa's largest economy and most populous country, we cannot afford to rush into such agreements without full and proper consultation with all stakeholders,"" said Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. The next Ecowas meeting in December is likely to whip up some of these concerns.  Nigeria, whose oil-dependent economy accounts for two-thirds of the region's GDP, would dominate a future monetary union. Some economists have compared Nigeria to Germany's weight in the eurozone although Nigeria would be far more dominant in the eco. For Ms Okoli, that could be problematic.  ""We should have an honest conversation about how we feel about that,"" she says. ""Germany had a measure of restraint coming out of World War II, but we don't have that in Nigeria,"" she said.  It is, however, less of problem and more of an opportunity,  Mr Belinga argues.  ""There's always a leader in a union and I think we should hope Nigeria will play that role positively. When you look at what they've done for their economy, I see that as a positive signal of good leadership"".  ""At the same time,"" he says, ""Nigeria must see that this is an opportunity for them to access a massive market"". Although some describe the CFA franc as a colonial relic, some analysts say that what's been driving growth in francophone countries like Ivory Coast has been high investment because of low interest rates which come from a stable currency guaranteed by France. The Francophone countries might be hesitant to joining a union with countries that have much higher levels of inflation and interest rates. But the appeal to cut colonial links and embrace the eco as an African project is strong. ""Even if it creates instability, that's normal,"" says Mr Belinga, ""countries must disconnect from the franc"", he adds. "
market volatility,Call for pump price investigation,2024-09-15,2011-05-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13593591,"Petrol prices reached record levels in April An alliance of European motoring organisations has written to the European Union calling for an investigation into the price of fuel. The call comes from the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in a letter to the European Union.  The group represents 35 million European drivers, including members of the RAC and AA in the UK. The FIA said the way petrol prices are currently set was ""far from transparent"". A full tank of fuel for an average European car now costs around £10 more than it did a year ago.  The price of fuel in the UK reached record levels in April as the cost of Brent crude rose above $125 a barrel. Although the price of crude has fallen $10 since then, motoring groups say the wholesale price of petrol has not fallen as fast. The price of crude oil is only one factor affecting the petrol price. Oil is traded in dollars, so the exchange rate against the dollar has a big impact on prices. Taxes, transportation and refining costs also vary - impacting the cost of fuel at the pump.  But the FIA says the EU should investigate the way petrol prices are set for the European market.  Most European petrol prices are derived from the Rotterdam spot market where some cargoes of petrol and diesel are bought and sold. But the FIA is not sure that this market works effectively. ""A platform with such a small volume is doubted to be a representative indicator for the vast European market,"" said Werner Krauss, chairman of the FIA Eurocouncil. This video can not be played Brian Madderson of RMI Petrol calls for 'fair competition' The organisation also wants the EU to look into the role of speculators who invest in the oil market. Mr Krauss claimed the ""resulting volatility"" in petrol prices had a negative financial impact on consumers. The complaint is backed by the UK motoring organisation the AA, which is calling for an independent regulator to oversee the petrol market. ""No one is giving us any answer as to why petrol prices are so high,"" said AA public affairs spokesman Luke Bosdet. ""We need greater transparency so everyone can see we are paying a fair price for fuel,"" he added.  Retailers have said that prices do go down when the cost of petrol has fallen. One way for sellers to balance the changing price of fuel is to buy in advance. The UK's largest supermarket, Tesco, say they try to keep prices low and will sometimes buy fuel in advance to balance changes in price. But in a statement the retailer said it was difficult to predict when to buy. ""As everybody knows, it's very difficult to predict movements in crude oil prices, which can go down as well as up. So it's wrong to say that buying in advance is necessarily an advantage,"" Tesco said in a statement.

market volatility,Sluggish Europe seeks new energy boost,2024-09-15,2011-02-04,Laurence Peter,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-12353792,"This video can not be played Europe tackles its energy-saving dilemmas EU leaders are meeting to consider the 27-nation bloc's ambitious energy targets on Friday - even if the Egypt crisis and eurozone debt woes are a big distraction. The EU's energy challenges, external are the focus of the European Council talks in Brussels - at least according to the official agenda.  The EU has set itself a ""20-20-20"" goal: a 20% cut in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020, compared with 1990 levels; a 20% increase in the share of renewables in the energy mix; and a 20% cut in energy consumption. Huge investment is needed to modernise Europe's energy infrastructure, external, and most of it will have to come from the private sector.  The goal is to make the EU's diverse economies more joined up, to reduce their reliance on imported oil and gas and to increase the share of renewables such as wind and solar power in the energy mix. But progress towards a greener, more energy-efficient Europe is painfully slow, as governments are forced to tighten the public purse-strings and many companies struggle to get credit from banks. The economic downturn means that the pace of urban renovation has slowed in many countries - and with it, the installation of eco-friendly buildings, with modern smart meters and efficient insulation. But on the plus side, photovoltaic panels and other green innovations have got cheaper. The European Commission, steering EU energy policy, says about 1tn euros (£850bn; $1.4tn) will have to be invested over the next 10 years to modernise energy generation and supply. Solar panels on a Berlin block of flats: The cost of green technology has fallen But with budgets tight throughout Europe more incentives will have to be found to get the private sector to commit to big energy projects, where the returns tend to be long-term. The Commission reckons that about 60bn euros of EU budget funds will have to be invested in high-risk, cross-border projects deemed vital for Europe's future energy security. Supply weaknesses in Central and Eastern Europe were highlighted dramatically in January 2009, when a Russian gas transit dispute with Ukraine meant that many other countries suffered a gas shortage. Millions of people were left without heating in sub-zero temperatures. Many former communist countries, including Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, are overwhelmingly dependent on gas from Russia's Gazprom. North-south energy connections are seen as a priority - to link the Baltic energy market to the rest of Europe and to help develop South-East Europe, where many people live in energy poverty, spending a relatively high amount of income on fuel bills. The EU imports more than half of its energy supplies - equal to 2.5% of total EU economic output (GDP). With economic growth models still wedded to fossil fuels Europe remains hostage to rising energy prices and volatility triggered by events such as the Egypt crisis. Energy diversification has become a mantra in Brussels, as the EU wrestles with Gazprom's leverage and competes for declining resources with energy-hungry emerging powers like China and India. But making that diversification a reality is a big and expensive challenge. Electric cars need many more recharging points to be viable in Europe New partnerships are being forged with North Africa and Central Asia, to bring new sources of gas to European markets via a ""Southern Corridor"".  There are also technical challenges, such as engineering reverse gas flow, so that a shortage in one country can be eased by a neighbouring country pumping extra gas to it in an emergency. An ambitious plan to develop wind power in the North Sea requires new grid connections in several countries. In addition to the funding challenge, the time taken to get planning permission hampers big cross-border energy projects. But Danish liberal MEP Jens Rohde, a vice-chairman of the European Parliament's industry and energy committee, says that ""if you don't invest public money in the infrastructure you can forget all about wind power"". If Europeans could become more energy-efficient then the pressure on dwindling resources would be eased and greenhouse gas emissions would also decline. Yet the Commission has a bleak message on that front.  ""Regarding energy efficiency, we are seriously lagging behind. By 2020 we will only reach half of the 20% target if we carry on at the current pace,"" Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said. He called for mandatory energy efficiency criteria in public building and transport projects. Many European politicians say energy efficiency standards need to be made binding, in the way that CO2 emission limits were in the EU. According to Mr Rohde, there is ""no one-size-fits-all"" because European tax systems vary so much. So incentives for energy-efficient behaviour will vary from country to country. But countries are slow to embrace energy-efficient technology such as smart cars and new meters, Mr Rohde says, because the end result is lower consumption - which means less fuel tax revenue and smaller returns for energy firms. The question of who pays for large-scale installation of smart technology has not been resolved, Giles Chichester MEP says. Mr Chichester, an energy specialist in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, says that making energy efficiency data compulsory in house sales was a useful innovation in the UK. Lowering the sales tax (VAT) on work to modernise buildings would also help towards energy efficiency, he told the BBC. ""There is a case for public money to be invested in some basic efficiency, such as draught exclusion. There is a double benefit - better living conditions and jobs for local businesses,"" he said. There is great scope for such projects in ex-communist Central and Eastern Europe, where many people still live in apartment blocks with wasteful, old-fashioned heating systems, he added.

While minsters say they must not move too early to prohibit large gatherings in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says the decision to hold back is ""surprising and concerning"". Measures announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson included advising anyone with a ""new, continuous"" cough or high temperature to self-isolate for seven days. Testing will now only focus on identifying people with the virus in hospital. He says closing schools or cancelling sporting events at this point could do more harm than good, should people tire of the restrictions.  But the Scottish government has advised the cancellation of gatherings of more than 500 people, while Ireland has shut schools. And Mr Hunt says the UK is in a ""national emergency"", with just four weeks until it reaches the stage that Italy is currently at. ""You would have thought that every single thing we do in that four weeks would be designed to slow the spread of people catching the virus,"" he argues. Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, suggests ""nobody has the right answer"". The effects of the virus continue to be felt around the globe. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie are in 14-day isolation after she tested positive. Australia is stopping gatherings of 500 or more people, not including transport or schools. Ghana and Gabon are reporting their first cases, while India has recorded its first death. Sport is increasingly affected. However, just eight new cases are reported in China. In football, Arsenal's visit to Brighton has been cancelled after manager Mikel Arteta tested positive.

market volatility,Electricity bills to rise after increase approved,2024-09-15,2023-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-65707754,"Bills are set to rise after the States allowed Guernsey Electricity to increase its revenues by 13%. The States' Trading Supervisory Board (STSB) said the increase would be split between the charge per unit and the daily fixed standing charge. The rise is below the 14.25% increase the company requested. STSB President, Deputy Peter Roffey, said the increase was ""regrettable but unavoidable"". The additional revenue will fund ""essential investment in the island's electricity infrastructure and offset the escalating cost of electricity import and generation arising from the market volatility caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine"", the States said. In the past 12 months, those costs incurred by the company have increased by £3.3m above what had been forecast in 2022, it added. Karl Brouard, Guernsey Electricity's chief financial officer, said: ""For the average usage customer on the standard or economy tariffs, both without electric heating, the combined impact of these changes is a rise of around £200 per year per household. ""We understand that this comes at a time when the cost of living is increasing for everyone, but we cannot delay much needed investment and upgrading of the network, along with the requirement to maintain the security of electricity supply to the island."" Deputy Roffey said: ""It is regrettable that Guernsey Electricity had to apply for such a significant increase in tariffs, but this is a nettle that had to be grasped."" He said ""a rise is unavoidable. We recognise the timing is bad, but to put it off could simply store up even greater challenges in the years ahead"". In deciding on a lower increase than the company had requested, the STSB said it had considered the impact on consumers ""in particular during the current economic climate"". ""The STSB has therefore acted responsibly in approving an increase, although not to the level that Guernsey Electricity had requested, which will require the company to continue focusing on improving efficiency,"" he said. The STSB also took independent advice and considered the results of a public consultation. Electricity bills will increase from 1 July. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

market volatility,Lessons must be learned from A6 delays - Campbell,2024-09-15,2023-04-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65172930,"Lessons must be learned from the delays to the long-awaited A6 road upgrade, DUP MP Gregory Campbell has said.  The 16-mile (25.5km) stretch of road between Londonderry and Dungiven will open on Thursday. Work started in 2018 but has been beset by continual delays.  Mr Campbell also reiterated his calls for a public inquiry into the project.   The Department for Infrastructure's (DfI) Kaine Lynch said the project had to be delivered ""in extremely challenging circumstances"". He added there were many factors as to why there had been delays to the road opening, citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the increased costs of building materials and some materials being in short supply. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 16-mile section of dual carriageway will include a bypass around Dungiven. The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's Breakfast Show, Mr Campbell said it was ""exceptionally good news"" that the project will be open before the Easter break.  ""It is great news but we should have had more information throughout - this was due to be finished more than a year ago,"" the East Londonderry MP said.   Mr Campbell said a public inquiry should happen, but added ""what is probably more important now is that the lessons of the delay over the past 18 months need to be learned for any future projects"". In Dungiven, local people welcomed the news.  Sheila McCartney from local clothing and giftware shop Nora & Katie said there was ""huge potential"" for businesses and tourism. ""We're just really looking forward to a nicer, less polluted, quieter Dungiven,"" she said. Local butcher Dessie McAleese said he was looking forward to the road's opening on Thursday. ""It's brilliant for the town because it is very congested, especially at the weekends, and the parking facilities are terrible."" Kaine Lynch said the DfI was ""delivering the largest road infrastructure project ever in Northern Ireland. ""We experienced the war in Ukraine, Covid-19, material shortages and supply chain issues.""   Mr Lynch said that in terms of scale of the project, they had more than 600 people working on the site in peak periods, have excavated enough material to fill Wembley Stadium in London and planted close to 750,000 trees. He conceded that ""people have waited a long time for this road"" but said that he is delighted that road users will be able to reap the benefits of it from Thursday.  Mr Lynch said 15,000 vehicles use the route each day and it will reduce journey time from Drumahoe to Dungiven by about 45% and be a ""significant benefit"" to improving road safety. The DfI had previously said the initial estimate of £220m was now likely to be in the region of £250m.  ""That is in the region of 12% over where we originally estimated,"" Mr Lynch said.  ""I know £30m is a lot of money, but given the scale of the project and the scale of the challenges that we faced I think that is a pretty good outcome."""
market volatility,Warning over fuel prices as oil hits 10-month high,2024-09-15,2023-09-19,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66852329,"Drivers have been warned of rising fuel costs after global oil prices surged to their highest level for 10 months. Brent crude, a benchmark for prices, breached $95 a barrel on Tuesday amid predictions of shorter supplies. It came as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said a decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut production could cause a ""significant supply shortfall"" by the end of this year. The RAC motoring group warned drivers were ""in for a hard time"" at the pumps. Latest figures show UK drivers are now paying £1.55 on average per litre of petrol, with diesel at £1.59.  Since the start of August, average petrol prices have increased by 10p per litre and diesel prices by 13p. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year. They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market. Saudi Arabia and Russia, members of the Opec+ group and two of the world's largest oil-producing nations, decided to reduce production earlier in August. At the same time, the US Energy Information Administration said on Monday that US oil output from its top shale-producing regions was set to decline in October for the third straight month, reaching its lowest level since May.  As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. However, the West has accused Opec, whose members regularly meet to agree on production levels, of manipulating prices. Petrol and diesel prices have jumped in recent months, and further rises could lie ahead due to crude oil being the main component of fuel, motoring groups say.  The AA warned rising prices were coming at a time when fuel efficiency typically drops as a result of darker evenings due to engines needing to work harder with heaters and lights being used more. ""Drivers have been lashed by a 10p-a-litre rise in the cost of petrol since the beginning of August,"" said Luke Bodset, the AA's spokesman on pump prices. ""The only things in their favour have been daylight still in the rush hour and mild weather, which means less fuel consumption. The drivers now beginning to feel happier are those with electric cars."" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said with oil heading back towards $100 a barrel, drivers were ""in for a hard time at the pumps"", but he added that a rise to three figures ""should really only take the average price up by another 2p"". But he warned: ""If retailers are intent on making more money per litre with increased margins then this could [take the average petrol price] closer to 160p."" Analysts warn rising global oil prices could impact inflation - the rate at which prices rise - in many countries. Inflation soared in 2022 and has only recently started to come down. ""The symbolically important $100 [a barrel of oil] mark is now being considered once more,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This is a difficult development, with fuel accounting for a significant portion of overall inflation."" The latest inflation figure for the UK will be released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday. Inflation has fallen in recent months but remains high at 6.8%. Over the last few years households have been hit by higher fuel and energy bills, while businesses have put up prices to cope with rising costs. A recent fall in the pound may have made fuel even more expensive. As well as supply and demand, oil prices are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as Brent crude is traded in dollars.  Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman defended Opec+'s moves to restrict supply on Monday, saying energy markets needed light-handed regulation to limit volatility."
market volatility,Can India's Adani Group recover from $100bn loss?,2024-09-15,2023-02-07,By Archana Shukla,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495573,"India's Adani Group has seen its market value plunge after a US investment firm made fraud allegations against it. Can its ambitious growth plans survive?  Until two weeks ago, the ports-to-energy conglomerate which operates seven publicly traded companies had a combined valuation of $220bn.  But since 24 January, when short seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, its valuations have nearly halved. The group's founder Gautam Adani has seen billions wiped off his personal wealth and has dropped out of the list of the world's top 20 richest people. The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious"" and ""baseless"" and says it plans have not changed. But investors are clearly still nervous.  On Monday, the group said in a statement that it would prepay loans worth $1.1bn, taken using shares as collateral, ahead of their maturity date next year. This, it said, was partly due to ""continued market volatility"" and to assure investors that the group's promoters would ""prepay all shares-backed financing"". The announcement led to a rally in the flagship company's stock - on Tuesday, shares of Adani Enterprises closed 15% higher on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Last week, the group also called off its secondary share sale. The 2.5bn (£2bn) it had raised was meant to pay off debt and fund projects, including airport renovation, expressway construction and an ambitious green hydrogen ecosystem. They indicate investors are losing confidence in a company. Analysts are now watching to see how the stock price slide affects the company's operations, cash flow and expansion plans. ""Most of their ambitious projects will have to be heavily scaled back in ambition and timetable, because they will have next to no capacity to raise funds right now,"" says Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance, a think-tank that works on financial issues related to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy. It could borrow money to fund projects and acquisitions - a common strategy for infrastructure companies, which helped fuel the Adani Group's rapid growth. But the group's debt has grown at a faster pace than revenues and profitability, which some fear could raise risks of a default - a concern flagged by both the Hindenburg report as well as some analysts. The group already has total debt of nearly two trillion rupees ($24bn; £20bn) - it almost doubled over the past three years as Mr Adani's ambitions extended to areas such as 5G and green hydrogen. Nearly two-thirds of Adani's debt is from overseas sources such as bonds or foreign banks, according to a report by global brokerage Jefferies. Until now, the group has mostly raised funds by using its infrastructure assets or shares as collateral. But with stock prices plunging, the value of this collateral has also dipped. The private wealth units of two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, Bloomberg has reported.  Many Indian banks have also loaned billions of dollars to companies linked to the group and state-owned insurance firm Life Insurance Corporation of India has invested in it. Market observers say that the Hindenburg report and the reaction to it will make lenders cautious - which means loans could become costlier. ""There is pressure on the company's credibility. It will make it extremely difficult to raise fresh loans, especially in the overseas market,"" an Indian corporate banker said on condition of anonymity as he didn't want to be seen commenting on the Adani Group. Another observer, a former banker with an international wealth fund, said that the group may be forced to delay some projects until the issue settles down. He also did not want to be named. The BBC sent a list of questions to the Adani Group. A spokesperson replied: ""All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group's core fundamentals remain unchanged.""  Scrutiny on the group has now increased. Investors and credit rating agencies are closely assessing its ability to raise money and repay loans. S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its outlook on two Adani companies to negative. ""New investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,"" it said.   In a video statement after the group's share sale was called off, Mr Adani had said that its balance sheet was ""healthy and assets robust"". He added that the group has an ""impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations"". But credit rating agency ICRA said in a statement last week that the group's large, debt-funded capital spending programme remains a key challenge. Most of the group's capital-guzzling new businesses such as green energy, airports and roads are housed under flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and depend on it for funds. AEL has enough cash but could come under pressure if it has to pay interest for even its subsidiaries. Some of the group's firms will be shielded from the current volatility because they own and operate strong physical assets such as ports, airports and factories. ""Adani Ports and Adani Power are the strongest and most well-capitalised [firms], which means their assets are backed by long-term government contracts. Most of the loans taken by these companies are against these revenue and profit-accruing assets,"" says the corporate banker quoted above. However, this isn't the case for some of the group's newer businesses. Companies such as Adani Gas and renewable energy arm Adani Green already have immense debt on their books and are still building up their cash flows. This could make them more vulnerable to market shocks and reduce their creditworthiness. The banker points out that while the prices of bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have fallen only marginally, those issued by Adani Green had lost more than a quarter of their value in three days. Deferring new projects and selling some assets to raise money could be a way out. ICRA has said that some of the planned capital spending is discretionary in nature and can be deferred, depending on how much liquidity it has. ""The company has built assets that are valuable to a developing country like India, and there will be many strategic investors interested,"" said a corporate adviser who didn't want to be named. Some analysts remain optimistic. ""I have seen varied operating [Adani] projects from ports, airports, cements to renewables which are solid, stable and generating a healthy cash flow. They are completely safe from the ups and downs of what happens in the stock market,"" says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert who is founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.  Analysts are also watching to see if there will be a regulatory enquiry into the group's corporate governance. The issue has also set off a political row over Mr Adani's perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which both deny.  On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi from the main opposition Congress party brought up the allegations in parliament, accusing Mr Modi of helping the Adani Group - his comments caused uproar, with a federal minister accusing Mr Gandhi of levelling ""wild allegations"" without proof.    A day earlier, the party had held protests across the country, demanding an investigation into the allegations. Mr Buckley says that as pressure mounts, the Adani Group's ability to win government contracts easily to ramp up revenues will be challenged. It will also find it difficult to restore its credit credibility.  Since the group has to repay a significant amount, it will have to do a strategic asset sale, he says. "
market volatility,Bitcoin trading gets another big boost,2024-09-15,2017-12-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42386893,"Bitcoin has moved another step towards mainstream investing with the start of trading on the huge Chicago Mercantile Exchange financial futures market. It comes as the value of the digital currency approached $20,000 on Sunday, before drifting below $19,000. Last week, Chicago's CBOE exchange began Bitcoin futures trading - bets on a future price - but CME is far bigger. On Sunday, the chairman of UBS bank and former Bundesbank head Axel Weber joined the chorus of Bitcoin warnings. ""Bitcoin is not money,"" he said in an interview, and urged regulators to intervene.  Meanwhile the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called for the issue to be discussed at the G20 summit of major economies in April.  ""There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how... with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin"", Mr Maire told the French news channel LCI.  Bitcoin prices have surged this year: a single bitcoin stood at less than $1,000 in January and hit a record $19,783 on Sunday, according to Coindesk. Analysts believe CME's entry into the Bitcoin market will generate more interest in the crypto-currency, possibly pushing the price higher.  The CBOE futures contract is based on a closing price of Bitcoin from the Gemini exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. However, the CME contract price will be culled from multiple exchanges, potentially offering investors more transparency about the value.  ""The CME [futures] contract is based on a broader array of exchanges,"" said Matt Osborne, chief investment officer of Altegris, which has $2.5bn in alternative investments.   ""So there is a possibility that the CME contract may generate more interest and more volume. ""Volumes are going to slowly increase as professional traders get comfortable with the price action and more importantly get comfortable with the volatility."" Institutional investors are prohibited from buying Bitcoin directly because the market is unregulated, but they can buy futures contracts. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date.  Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value.  CBOE Bitcoin futures surged nearly 20% on their debut last Monday, and more than 4,000 contracts changed hands by the end of the day. But as interest in the digital currency increases, so do the warnings.  Mr Weber told the Swiss Sunday newspaper that investors should resist jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon, saying the bubble would inevitably burst. He said Bitcoin does not fulfil the three main functions of money because, in his view: it is not an effective means of payment; it is not a good measure of value (since prices are not written in Bitcoin); and it is not an effective way to store value, since it is inherently unstable. UBS advises clients against investing in the virtual currency, he said, because the bank does ""not consider it valuable and not sustainable"". To protect investors who do not take the bank's advice, ""regulators are needed,"" Mr Weber said. However, many people say financial regulation is difficult, if not impossible, because transparency was not part of Bitcoin's creation. Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden. "
market volatility,US spies peer into the future - and it's not rosy,2024-09-15,2021-04-08,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56683852,"The US Intelligence Community has issued a survey of where the world may end up in 2040. It warns of a political volatility and growing international competition or even conflict.  The report entitled A More Contested World is an attempt to look at key trends and outlines a series of possible scenarios. It is the seventh such report with one coming every four years since 1997 from the National Intelligence Council. The Global Trends 2040 report does not make comfortable reading if you are a political leader or international diplomat - or hope to be one in the coming years. The latest attempt by the US National Intelligence Council to understand what may happen within and between countries points to uncertainty and instability. It firstly focuses on the key factors driving change. One is political volatility. ""In many countries, people are pessimistic about the future and growing more distrustful of leaders and institutions that they see as unable or unwilling to deal with disruptive economic, technological, and demographic trends,"" the report warns.  Vulnerable democracies It argues people are gravitating to like-minded groups and making greater and more varied demands of governments at a time when those governments are increasingly constrained in what they can do.  ""This mismatch between governments' abilities and publics' expectations is likely to expand and lead to more political volatility, including growing polarisation and populism within political systems, waves of activism and protest movements, and, in the most extreme cases, violence, internal conflict, or even state collapse."" Unmet expectations, fuelled by social media and technology, could lead to risks for democracy.  ""Looking forward, many democracies are likely to be vulnerable to further erosion and even collapse,"" the report warns, although adding that these pressures will also affect authoritarian regimes. Pandemic a massive 'global disruption' The report says the current pandemic is the ""most significant, singular global disruption since World War II"", which has fuelled divisions, accelerated existing changes and challenged assumptions, including over how well governments can cope. The last report in 2017 included such a possibility - imagining that ""the global pandemic of 2023"" dramatically reduced global travel to contain its spread.   The authors acknowledge they did not expect Covid-19, which they say has ""shaken long-held assumptions about resilience and adaptation and created new uncertainties about the economy, governance, geopolitics, and technology"".  Climate change and demographic shifts will also be key drivers, as will be technology, which could prove disruptive but also empower those who harness it fastest and first. Geopolitical competition Internationally, the analysts expects the intensity of competition for global influence to reach its highest level since the Cold War over the coming two decades amid the continuing weakening of the old order as institutions like the United Nations struggle.  Non-governmental organisations, including religious groups and what are called ""technology superstar firms"" may also have the ability to build networks that compete with - or even - bypass states. The risk of conflict may increase, with it becoming harder to deter new weapons being used.  Jihadist terrorism is likely to continue but there is a warning that extreme right- and left-wing terrorists promoting issues such as racism, environmentalism and anti-government extremism could revive in Europe, Latin America and North America.  Groups could use artificial intelligence to become more dangerous or use augmented reality to create ""virtual terrorist training camps"". The competition between the US and China lies at the heart of many of the differences in the scenarios - whether one of them becomes more successful or whether the two compete equally or divide the world into separate silos. Read more by Gordon Corera A 2004 report also predicted a caliphate emerging out of the Middle East, much as the Islamic State group tried to create in the last decade, although the same report - looking ahead to 2020 - did not quite capture the competition with China which now dominates US security thinking.  The overall aim is to look at possible futures rather than predict with certainty. Stronger democracies or 'the world adrift'? There are some optimistic scenarios for 2040 - one called ""the renaissance of democracies"".  This involves the US and its allies harnessing technology and economic growth to deal with domestic and international challenges, while China and Russia's crackdowns (including in Hong Kong) stifle innovation and strengthen the appeal of democracy.  But others are bleaker.   ""The world adrift scenario"" imagines market economies never recovering from the Covid pandemic, becoming domestically deeply divided and living in an international system that is ""directionless, chaotic and volatile"" as international rules and institutions are ignored by countries, corporations and other groups. One scenario, though, does manage to combine pessimism with optimism.  ""Tragedy and Mobilisation"" imagines a world in the midst of a global catastrophe in the early 2030s thanks to climate change, famine and unrest - but this in turn leads to a new global coalition, driven in part by social movements, to address the problems. Of course, none of the scenarios may come to pass or - more likely - a combination or something entirely novel may emerge. The aim, the authors say, is to prepare for an array of possible futures - even if many of them look far from rosy."
market volatility,Power NI electricity prices to fall by 10%,2024-09-15,2022-10-14,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63256308,"Power NI customers will see electricity prices fall by 10% from the start of November as a result of the energy price cap. The cap will more than reverse a 60% increase which would have applied from the same date. This cap sets the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge domestic households for each unit of energy they use. It has been in place in other parts of the UK since the start of October. It will apply to all electricity and gas suppliers in Northern Ireland from the start of November. Customers in Northern Ireland who saw prices rises in October will receive some form of rebate so they are on an equal footing with people in GB. Power NI is the largest electricity supplier in Northern Ireland, with about 471,000 domestic customers which is more half of all connections. Power NI last changed its prices in July when it put them up by 27.5%; that followed a 21.4% increase in January William Steele, Director, Power NI Customer Solutions, said: ""As many customers will already be aware, the UK Government has announced a major intervention into the energy market called the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG).  ""This means that from 1 November 2022, energy bill support will be provided to Northern Ireland residential customers, by reducing the underlying cost of electricity.  ""Although we now must substantially increase our underlying price to reflect the current market, the implementation of the EPG will mean our customers will see a reduction in their billed tariff level of 10%.""  The NI Utility Regulator said with the cap in place the typical Power NI customer's bill will be 38% lower than the equivalent in Great Britain and 48% lower than the equivalent in the Republic of Ireland. ""Further tariff reviews for all suppliers are likely given the ongoing volatility of wholesale prices and the effect of changes to the EPG discount - the latter to be announced by the UK Government every three months going forward,"" John French, Chief Executive of the Regulator added. ""Separate to the energy price guarantee support, we are working with the UK Government and local energy suppliers to ensure that the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme payment is paid to Northern Ireland consumers as soon as possible."""
market volatility,How much market chaos did the mini-budget cause?,2024-09-15,2022-10-13,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/63229204,"New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has reversed almost all of the tax measures outlined by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng three weeks ago.  The mini-budget of 23 September - included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - and was followed by days of turmoil on the markets, a fall in the value of the pound and rises in the cost of UK government borrowing and mortgage rates.  Prime Minister Liz Truss subsequently sacked Mr Kwarteng and acknowledged that ""it is clear that parts of our mini-budget went further and faster than markets were expecting"".  Previously, Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng, Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg and other ministers had defended the mini-budget, focusing on the effect of global factors like rising inflation and interest rates rather than acknowledging that the 23 September announcement had a profound impact. So, what has been going on?  It is true that interest rates have been rising around the world as central banks, including the Bank of England (BoE), try to control inflation, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the energy price shock which followed. On 22 September, the BoE announced it was increasing the UK's base rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.25%. This is the interest rate on which commercial banks base the amount you pay for borrowing money, and what banks pay you for saving money with them.  The day before, the US central bank had raised its interest rates by more - 0.75 percentage points to between 3% and 3.25%. Following the BoE's decision, the UK government's long-term borrowing costs - the interest rate the government has to pay to borrow money on the international markets - rose immediately. By the BoE's own analysis, long-term gilt yields were 0.2 percentage points higher at the end of the day as compared with the start. The next day - 23 September - Mr Kwarteng delivered his mini-budget starting at 09:35 BST. This included the government's support scheme for energy bills - which had already been announced. This was due to last two years for households and the Treasury estimated it would cost £60bn for the first six months. It also included a cut in National Insurance and the reversal of a planned rise in corporation tax. These tax changes were pledged by Ms Truss during her Conservative leadership campaign and were widely expected to happen. But Mr Kwarteng went further, announcing he would cut the basic rate of income tax a year earlier than expected and get rid of the top rate altogether.  The package of tax cuts announced in the mini-budget totalled £45bn and were unfunded in that the government did not set out what savings it might make.  The mini-budget was not accompanied by an assessment of its plans by the government's official spending watchdog - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - as happens at every budget.  Following the chancellor's statement, the UK government's cost of long-term borrowing rose sharply. According to the BoE, long-term gilt yields rose 0.3 percentage points over the course of the day.  The markets were closed over the weekend, but in a BBC interview on Sunday 25 September, Mr Kwarteng indicated there were more tax cuts to come.  On Monday 26 September, the pound fell to record lows against the dollar in early trading in Asia. There was also a sharp rise in the cost of long-term government borrowing. Long-term gilt yields had gone up 0.5 percentage points by the end of the day, according to the BoE. Comparing the cost of government borrowing - on this measure - across the G7 group of advanced economies, it is clear that there was a sharp spike in UK long-term borrowing costs following the mini-budget - which wasn't seen in the other countries.  If you just look at the changes to the cost of government borrowing since 1 September (Liz Truss officially became prime minister on 6 September) the trend is even clearer. The cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen considerably more in that period than it has in other G7 countries. This increase fed through into rising mortgage rates with hundreds of products withdrawn from the mortgage market.  It also had an impact on UK pension funds - which trade in government debt (30-year gilts). The BoE described the speed and scale of movements in interest rates on UK government bonds as ""unprecedented"". It had to step in to safeguard the pensions sector with a support scheme - worth a potential £65bn. The change to corporation tax was a key pledge Liz Truss made during her Conservative leadership campaign. On 11 August, she said she wanted to scrap the planned rise because, ""I don't think that's a good way to get our economy going and to attract investment into our country.""  The National Insurance cut was another of her campaign promises that made it into the mini-budget. On the scrapping of the top rate of income tax, Ms Truss was asked who had come up with this - she said it was the chancellor's decision. Mr Kwarteng was asked whether he had got her backing for it before the announcement and replied, ""of course"". On the absence of the OBR from the mini-budget, Ms Truss said the government didn't have time to wait for its forecast. The OBR wrote in a letter that it would have been in a position to produce an updated forecast for the 23 September announcement.  On the morning of 14 October, a Number 10 source told the BBC that the prime minister and chancellor were ""in lockstep"" - hours before she sacked him.  Speaking on 29 September, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said the turmoil on the markets in part ""reflects broader global developments... but there is undoubtedly a UK-specific component"". On 12 October, Sanjay Raya, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, told a committee of MPs that Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as high inflation were causing global instability and volatility in the markets.  But he added that there was ""absolutely a UK component here"". Mr Raya said: ""You throw on the 23 September event, you've got a sidelined fiscal watchdog, lack of a medium-term fiscal plan, one of the largest unfunded tax cuts that we've seen... since the early 1970s and it's sort of the straw that broke the camel's back."" Institute for Government chief economist Gemma Tetlow told the same committee that part of the problem had stemmed from the government undermining key economic institutions, ""questioning their credibility and not asking for a forecast from the OBR"". She added that while the temporary emergency measures to limit energy prices probably could have been announced without an OBR forecast, ""permanent changes to the tax system, which didn't need to be announced so quickly"", could have waited for OBR assessments and ""a full briefing from Treasury officials"".  Gerard Lyons, an economist who advised Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng during the leadership contest, speaking on the BBC's World at One programme admitted that the mini-budget ""misread"" the country's financial situation. However, he argued that everything that has happened was not ""solely due to the mini-budget"" but also down to parts of the financial system that were vulnerable to interest rates going up. On 3 October, Mr Kwarteng U-turned on plans to scrap the top rate of income tax.  On 14 October, Ms Truss sacked Mr Kwarteng and announced a U-turn on corporation tax, confirming it will rise after all. On 17 October, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that ""almost all"" the tax measures of the mini-budget will be reversed - apart from the National Insurance cut and the changes to stamp duty. The energy bills support scheme will last for six months, rather than two years.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate? Get in touch Read more from Reality Check"
market volatility,Oil prices rise as Saudi Arabia pledges output cuts,2024-09-15,2023-06-04,By Jemma Dempsey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65804768,"Oil prices have risen after Saudi Arabia said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day (bpd) in July. Other members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices. Opec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices. In Asia trade on Monday, Brent crude oil rose by as much as 2.4% before settling at around $77 a barrel. Opec+ said production targets would drop by a further 1.4 million bpd from 2024. The seven hour-long meeting on Sunday of the oil-rich nations came against a backdrop of falling energy prices.  Oil prices soared when Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but are now back at levels seen before the conflict began. In October last year Opec+, a formulation which refers to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, agreed to cut production by two million bpd, about 2% of global demand. In April this year the group agreed to a further cuts, which were due to last to the end of this year. But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Sunday's talks led to ""the extension of the deal until the end of 2024"". On Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that his country's cut of one million bpd could be extended beyond July if needed. ""This is a Saudi lollipop,"" he said, in what is seen as a bid to stabilise the market. Before the two-day Opec+ meeting started, it was widely expected the oil cartel would make production cuts to prop up prices. It appears most members were against the idea, as any cuts would impact oil revenues, which are crucial to keep running their economies.  Saudi Arabia's decision to make a voluntary reduction of one-million barrels per day was unexpected but does not come as a huge surprise. As the leader of the pack, and also the largest exporter of oil, it was the only one in a position to be able to lower output.  From Riyadh's point of view, it is crucial the price of crude remains over $80 a barrel for it to break even. Saudi officials want elevated prices to keep spending billions of dollars on ambitious projects spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as he tries to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. The move by the Saudis also underlines the uncertain outlook for demand for fuels in the months to come. Concerns about the global economy, especially recessionary fears in the US and Europe are expected to put further pressure on crude prices. Oil producers are grappling with falling prices and high market volatility amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices and undermining the global economy through high energy costs. It has also accused the group of siding with Russia despite sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.   In response, Opec insiders have said the West's monetary policy over the last decade has driven inflation and forced oil-producing nations to act to maintain the value of their main export."
market volatility,Markets stabilise after earlier sell-off,2024-09-15,2018-12-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46466903,"US markets stabilised on Thursday after steep falls earlier in the day spurred by fears about US-China trade tensions and global growth. The Dow Jones index closed down about 0.3% while the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.2%.  The tech-focused Nasdaq even ventured into positive territory, ending 0.4% higher. The rebound followed sharp falls in Europe and extended the sharp market swings seen in recent weeks. In London the FTSE 100 tumbled 3.2%, or more than 200 points, to close at about 6,700 - its lowest level in two years. Falls on European markets were even steeper, with Paris and Frankfurt both shedding almost 3.5%.  Oil prices also sank, with Brent crude more than 2% lower. Analysts said the arrest of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei's chief financial officer in Canada had revived worries over the US's trade war with China. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei index shed 1.9%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 2.5%. On the FTSE 100, worst-hit sectors included miners, oil companies, carmakers and tech stocks, with mining firms Antofagasta and Glencore among the biggest losers. The concerns about trade tensions, oil prices and slowing growth sparked losses at US financial, energy and materials companies early in the day, sending all three major US indexes more than 2% lower. But sentiment later swung in the other direction. Analysts at Oxford Economics said markets had become ""overly gloomy"". IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde also said in a CNBC interview that worries about recession were ""a little bit overdone"", although uncertainty was causing increased volatility. The US stock market is having another ugly day.  Coming up with culprits for the most recent panic isn't hard. Investors fear the trade war between China and the US will escalate. They worry America's central bank will raise interest rates too far. And they're concerned about Britain's exit from the European Union. All factors that could hurt company profits. The tougher question to answer is where the market is headed. Will it keep going down or bounce back? Many on Wall Street are describing the recent stock turbulence as a market correction - defined as a drop of at least 10% from a recent high.  How long it lasts depends on what investors perceive are the prospects for global economic growth. And right now the psychology of the markets appears fragile. Oil prices fell on Thursday as traders waited for news from the meeting of Opec oil-producing nations in Vienna, with some member states keen to agree on a production cut to drive up prices. Members tentatively agreed to cut output but were waiting for a commitment from Russia, which is not in the cartel, before making any firm decisions, according to insiders. Investors were also reacting to new US trade deficit figures, measuring the difference between imports and exports of goods and services. That gap increased to $55.5bn in October, the highest level in a decade, as major markets including China, the European Union and Mexico purchased fewer US products. All three markets have hit US goods with new import duties in retaliation for tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer had ""reignited fears that trade reconciliation between the US and China may not be forthcoming any time soon"".  ""The market is spooked by the damage a continuing trade war could do to global economic prospects, and that's hitting share prices in the UK and overseas. """
market volatility,Shares hit record amid trade talk hopes,2024-09-15,2019-07-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48828230,"The S&P 500 index of US stocks has closed at a record high amid signs of progress in US-China trade talks. The index closed at 2,964.33, beating 21 June's previous high, with technology stocks driving the rise.  Market watchers say more optimism around a potential trade deal between the US and China led to the movement. And gold, often seen as a safe asset in times of uncertainty, fell 2% to $1,382 per ounce, the biggest drop since June 2018. The Dow Jones closed 0.44% higher at 26,717.43, while the Nasdaq finished 1.1% higher at 8,091.16. In Europe, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and Germany's Dax closed 1% higher. ""We're right back on track,"" US President Donald Trump said after the countries agreed to restart trade talks.  ""Gold tends to do well during times of concern over growth, market volatility or when markets think the powers-that-be are losing control of events,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. ""A trade deal would deal with all three issues and markets are happy to take the view that a deal is coming. Though it could still be a long time coming, if there is to be one at all."" Negotiations between China and the US have dominated market moves for months as positive statements are often followed by extra tariffs, sending stock, currency and commodity markets up and down. The latest moves follow a pledge to renew talks between the US and China, an agreement that was reached at the G20 summit in Japan. US President Donald Trump agreed to hold off on $300bn of new tariffs on goods and relaxed restrictions on Huawei, while China agreed to make new purchases of US farm equipment. Last year, the US imposed three rounds of tariffs on more than $250bn worth of Chinese goods. China hit back by imposing tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on $110bn of US products. A truce agreed last December collapsed and in May the US raised tariffs on $200bn of Chinese products to 25% from 10%. Again China retaliated with tariff on $60bn of US goods. The price of gold is also retreating after gaining 8% in June, with prices exceeding $1,400 per troy ounce. ""Gold has just had a strong run. Nothing goes up in a straight line,"" said Mr Mould. While it earns no income, like a share or a bond would, gold's indestructible nature and its place in history as a store of value make it attractive to some investors in times of strife. Other safe-haven assets also declined, including the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar rose 0.4% against the yen to 108.26, and advanced 0.7% on the franc to 0.9830 francs."
market volatility,The storms battering oil and gas,2024-09-15,2020-05-03,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52523905,"For the oil and gas sector in Scotland, coronavirus is merely one part of its current nightmare.  It's been the catalyst that has brought upon it a confluence of massive challenges around maturing assets and structural change, pressure over climate change, and geo-politics. This week, we learned from a survey by Oil and Gas UK - the representative body for the industry, which is also one of the more reliable sources of data about it - that up to 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK sector. That's a very rough figure. It could be significantly worse, but it feels unlikely to be much less serious than that.  And the job numbers are a measure - a distillation, if you like - of the impact from numerous other changes coming down the pipeline. The UK industry is at the mercy of the oil price, over which it has no control. It is being battered by geopolitical rivalries between Saudis and Russia. With Asian demand for oil being hit hard by China's shut-down, their 6 March failure to do a deal on cutting supply sent the price of Brent crude oil barrelling downwards. That was as it was as it became clear that Europe and North America would also face a shutdown and sudden stop to much economic activity, including the grounding of entire airlines and traffic being cleared off roads. With supply far outstripping demand, the excess has to be stored somewhere.  That capacity is getting close to the brim.  By last week, around 80 ocean-going supertankers were being used for storage, some in the Firth of Forth.  It was the storage shortage that led to the price of the North American benchmark - West Texas Intermediate - turning negative in April, as contracts closed for May delivery. Where traders had failed to secure the rights to the diminishing amount of storage available, notably at the delivery point of American oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, they had to pay others to take oil off their hands. The geopolitics goes on: Saudi and Russia tussling for control and share of markets, others such as Venezuela hit exceptionally hard by reduced revenue, and President Trump... well, who knows what he's trying to do? He wants others to push the price back up, to help US producers, and US lenders who are exposed to loans turning sour in Texas and the Dakotas. Yet the president won't want to see the effect of increased fuel prices on his core voters come November, when they're already struggling with the economic impact of shutdown. More than 30 million Americans having registered as unemployed in the past few weeks. The low oil price, where far less tax is paid on car fuel than in Europe, is like a giant tax cut for American drivers. Low fuel prices also behave like a fiscal stimulus for airlines - at least those that haven't hedged on the expectation that prices would be much higher. With some US states beginning to relax the grip of lockdown, and some European countries too, the oil market picked up a bit last week. America's WTI benchmark has begun the new week down a further 8%, to $18, and at risk of another collapse as contracts close, in two weeks, for June delivery. Meanwhile, with less of a bottleneck on storage, Brent crude - used by the rest of the world's market as the benchmark - is down 3% with the start of a new week's trading, to below $26, having recently reached an 18-year low below $18. We talk a lot about the oil price, but much less about gas. And this week's Oil and Gas UK report had some interesting reflections on what has been happening to it, at least as it affects the industry and market in Britain.  Gas is less of a global market. Most of it gets from wellhead to central heating boiler and kitchen hob by pipeline, so the market has been determined by supply, demand and constraints on continental pipeline networks. That's changing though. At the start of last year, a therm of North Sea gas was wholesaling at 60 pence. That's for one day ahead, which is a measure of volatility as well as value. Most of the gas we use has been bought well in advance. In the first quarter of this year, the day-ahead price averaged 25 pence. On April 21, it bottomed out at 10.4 pence. That's not because of OPEC or Russia. Demand is down. We're more fuel efficient, with buildings better insulated. We had a mild winter so there was less need for heating.  Britain's total demand for gas fell over the past decade by 22%. Gas is being replaced by renewable sources in generating our electricity. In the past four years, Britain's use of gas in power stations has fallen 10%. Last year alone, use of gas in Britain was down 3.9%. Slightly more than half of it came from UK gas-producing fields, which were also exporting to Ireland and Belgium. These falls were before the lockdown. In the past few weeks, industrial demand for gas dropped 16%, Our use of electricity dropped by 15% - mainly in workplaces, while home use has risen, for home entertainment and as people work from home.  The other big change is in supply. There are more pipelines bringing gas from Norway, and a lot more liquified natural gas (LNG) is being shipped here, from the Persian and Mexican gulfs.  Last year, saw LNG imports more than double, accounting for 39% of Britain's imported gas. That competition drives the price down as well. So with prices down, what have we learned from Oil and Gas UK about the state of the industry, beyond those jobs at risk? It reckons this year could see companies going cash negative for the third time in 40 years. The average barrel of oil or its gaseous equivalent can be produced from UK waters for $15.20.  That's the result of harsh cost-cutting from free-spending days in the 2010-14 offshore investment boom, which led to production costs averaging above $30 per barrel. (That doesn't include exploration and development costs.) So the UK industry is in a leaner, fitter state than when the oil price last plunged.  With Brent crude ending last week at $26, producers can still break even. But that's the average. Some fields, and particularly the older ones, are more expensive, at up to $64 per barrel for production costs alone. So production costs are being squeezed, where there's further room to do so, and that usually means bearing down on supplier contracts. Some production levels will be cut back too. More significant is the slashing at investment plans while holding back on committing to new ones. Every day or two, it seems, another company reports cutbacks by the hundreds of millions of dollars.  This week, it was EnQuest and Ithaca Energy - two of the bigger producers in the North Sea these days, having bought a lot of assets from more familiar energy brands Shell and Chevron. Rystad Energy consultancy reckons the global capital cutback is around $100bn.  The survey by Oil and Gas UK suggests more than half of companies will more than halve their capital expenditure plans.   They were already expected to fall this year by 20 to 30% from the recent average, to reach the $4bn to $4.5bn range. They could end up a long way below that because of the low price, perhaps to the lowest level since the early 1970s, when the industry was getting under way. That directly affects those in the supply chain, who provide rigs and drilling equipment, engineering, data services, shipping, offshore catering, and so on. A lot of these companies are important exporters, and face similar cutbacks overseas to the ones in Scotland. It is those supply companies that are the focus of attention for industry calls for a special sector deal to weather the current economic tempest, pumping in government funds to keep them from collapse, and perhaps even accepting that government funds will be heading into the equivalent of a ""bad bank"" carrying bad loans. There are plenty people who will be outraged at the industry wanting more fiscal support, when it has been highly profitable in the past, and continues to provide the feedstock for climate changing emissions. The industry response is that these same engineering companies are among Britain's best hope for a transition to a net zero carbon economy - with carbon capture and storage back on the agenda after several false starts, and at the next frontier of making hydrogen as an energy source both safe and financially viable. The result of expenditure cuts now is lower oil and gas production in future. The lead time from capital expenditure to production varies, but it's measured across several years.  That investment boom beginning ten years ago opened up new fields, some of the biggest to the west of Shetland. Since then, 40 fields have come on stream, mostly in Scottish waters, and Oil and Gas UK tells us that these pumped more than a third of the UK total production last year. So rather than rely on old fields continuing to produce, at a rising cost per barrel, the industry would prefer to develop new, larger, more efficient fields - if that's financially viable.  At current prices, with recent volatility, few in UK waters will meet that financial test. Drilling activity has been low for years. It's now getting lower.  Exploration drilling has all but halted this year. Development projects, which are drilled to extend extraction within an existing field, dropped from 21 wells in April last year to only three last month, and the same expected this month. If there aren't more wells like that being sunk, then production is going to fall faster than expected. And with profits squeezed hard, there is little prospect of significant tax take - either for HM Revenue and Customs, or those surveying the financial outlook for an independent Scotland."
market volatility,Markets rise after lockdowns prompt oil price plunge,2024-09-15,2020-11-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54775143,"Markets have turned higher as investor optimism rises ahead of the US presidential election on Tuesday. The three main share indexes in the US all gained ground on Monday, reversing course after sharp falls last week. Oil prices also turned positive in US trading hours, after earlier hitting a five-month low following fresh virus-induced lockdowns.  The falls followed countries including the UK, France and Germanytightening restrictions on social activity. The news hit financial markets, worried that the new lockdown measures would further dent economic growth and cause demand for oil to slump. In Asia trading hours, the price of Brent crude fell to a low of $35.74 per barrel, a level not seen since late May.  But it later recovered, rising more than 3%, helped by strong manufacturing data.   The price of US crude oil was also hit hard, falling as much as 7% on Monday to a low of $33.64 a barrel before also rising more than 3%. But the price of Brent, the main benchmark for oil prices, remains down 45% from the start of the year. The virus-induced slump has weighed heavily on energy companies, with BP and Shell among those announcing thousands of job cuts this year. BP plans to cut 10,000 jobs after a slump in demand while Royal Dutch Shell has said it expects to cut 7,000 to 9,000 jobs. Exxon Mobil last week said it planned to cut 14,000 jobs - or about 15% of its global workforce. The rise in oil prices joined a broad market rally, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 1.6% higher. The S&P 500 - which suffered its biggest weekly loss since March last week - rose 1.2% while the Nasdaq gained 0.4%. Shares in Europe and the UK also climbed.  Concerns that the results of the US presidential election would not be known for weeks have weighed on markets.  But hope that the US will avoid a messy and contested election outcome has risen among investors, as polls show challenger Joe Biden maintaining his lead over President Donald Trump in key states on the eve of election day.  Investors are also optimistic that the conclusion of the campaign will return attention to the debate over economic stimulus, ultimately pushing Washington to advance spending plans to help the US economy recover from the pandemic downturn. ""Whichever way you look at it, this coming week will be huge for US and global markets,"" said Simon Ballard, chief economist at First Abu Dhabi Bank.  ""We see the potential for a sharp rise in volatility around these events and all in the context of a still deteriorating Covid-19 situation across much of the US, Europe and elsewhere."" China remains the most upbeat market for economic growth this year. The world's top crude oil importer said on Monday it would raise its quota for 2021 by 20% for non-state owned companies. This came after activity in China's factory sector accelerated at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in October as domestic demand surged. This was according to the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a private survey which focuses on smaller to medium-sized companies. Last month, China continued its recovery from the pandemic with strong economic growth during the third quarter, according to its official figures. The world's second-biggest economy reported growth of 4.9% between July and September, compared to the same quarter last year."
market volatility,Scotland's homes: One cost that's falling,2024-09-15,2022-12-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64110041,"A tip for 2023: keep an eye on the market for homes. You may have more pressing issues around the cost of living, but the housing market both reflects and drives wider changes in the economy. A rising market creates at least an illusion of growing wealth, driving expenditure beyond housing, and a falling one - as you might expect - does the opposite.  It should, however, help to make homes more affordable for those who would like to enter the market, many of whom have been priced out in the past two decades or more. If you don't own your home, but rent in the private sector, it may matter even more that you keep an eye on what's going on. Supply and demand matters a lot there too, and there are supply problems. The forecast from the Scottish Fiscal Commission is that the price of the average private home in Scotland is going to fall 5% during next year. In the Scottish market, that's very unusual. Previous downturns have seen prices stall but rarely fall. This reflects the more steady, plodding nature of the market.  It doesn't rise with the same exuberance as you might find in London and south-east England. John Boyle, an economist specialising in the private housing market with estate agency Rettie & Co, also foresees a 5% fall next year. He points out that it won't be that sharp a correction in prices, because there hasn't been a house price bubble to burst. There were, however, some sharp increases coming out of the shutdown of the market in the first months of Covid, so you could see it as a correction on inflated prices rather than a fall. The sharp annual increases of well over 10% over 2021 into 2022 have fallen back, and the more reliable indexes across the UK are showing month-on-month falls in price during autumn. During lockdown, some people with growing families had quickly found out that they could use more space, including a garden. That led to a pent-up surge in demand, particularly for homes with more space.  The other theme emerging from then was a surge in demand for homes at a greater distance from workplaces. Working From Home meant many people learned how not to commute to work, and showed employers that it could be made to work for them too. So up went the prices for rural, and notably coastal, properties. I've moved in to one such property in the Highlands, about 150 miles from the BBC Scotland head office. Our neighbour did likewise, selling in Surrey and buying a house three times the size, while he works online with colleagues in an office near Gatwick airport. A further trend that estate agencies noticed was people who commute less regularly. So they may not move hundreds of miles, but a flit to the Ayrshire coast offers more space and quality of life, while a reasonable distance to travel into Glasgow once or twice a week. So what are they noticing now? Not so much a fall in prices as a fall in the number of transactions. For years, prices have been helped upwards by the shortage of supply coming into the market. That's partly new builds falling short of demand for them, and partly people holding back on older homes being put up for sale. Estate agents and surveyors report that recent months have seen demand ease off as well, taking the upward pressure off prices where homes go to competitive bids, and meaning there are fewer transactions. Expectations on price, among the membership of RICS, the surveyors organisation, are weighted heavily towards declines. They don't measure by how much, but balance those surveyors who expect to see falls against those who expect to see rises.  Some 29% last month said they foresee increasing prices, but 69% forecast falls. Of course, nine consecutive rises in mortgage rates over the past 12 months are having an impact.  Younger people who have known mortgages when they're exceptionally cheap and competitive are learning that you shouldn't bank on it staying that way.  A normalisation of interest rates, from the low levels post-2008 financial crisis, was long overdue, though it didn't have to happen so sharply this year.  And it really didn't have to happen with the shock to the system from the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng budget in late September, which spooked markets and sent the cost of borrowing sharply up. That ""moron premium"" - a term coined somewhere in the City of London to describe the spike in borrowing costs during these daft days of autumn - has since subsided. But it was a sharp wake-up call to borrowers and home-buyers.  Around 80% of mortgage holders are on fixed rate mortgages, and are protected from such volatility - until they have to refinance. And a lot of people are going to see a steep increase in monthly bills over the next year. John Boyle says taking on the average Scottish mortgage, with an average two-year term, costs £500 more per month than it did a year ago. That helps explain why the sharp annual increase in the price of a home, of well over 10% over 2021 into 2022 have fallen back. The more reliable indexes across the UK are showing month-on-month falls in price during autumn. The Nationwide index has fallen from a peak of 14% to 4.4% in the year to November. Halifax saw a peak of 13% and in the year to October, prices were up 8.8%. Savills, at the premium end of the market, issued its new year market update on Wednesday, noting a divergence in markets that are most dependent on mortgages and those that are not.  Across its portfolio, a 0.7% price fall in the past three months in Scotland is less of a fall than other parts of the UK, and coastal Scotland is among several markets near the coast which it forecasts will be most robust over the next five years. John Boyle notes that the new-build market is showing most signs of disruption already.  The costs of materials and labour have gone up steeply, and with demand weakening, housebuilders are slowing up the pace at which homes come on to the market.  Boyle says you are more likely to find discounting and incentives such as help from the housebuilder with offloading your current home. And what of the private rental market? The proportion of Scots who depend on private landlords for their housing has nearly doubled in the past 15 years or so. Those who might previously have bought their homes have seen that opportunity lifted out of reach by rising prices. But rent prices have been rising as well. They, too, depend on demand, which has been rising, and supply, which is problematic. Changes in the tax on owning a second home for rental have squeezed smaller-scale landlords. Growing regulation of the private rented market has also made it more costly to rent out, and those who have depended on short-term lets, through platforms such as AirBnB, now face further hurdles to register with councils. If they don't get permission, that business plan may no longer stack up. A further blow to landlords this autumn came with the Scottish government's freeze on rents until next April, to help tenants handle other rising costs, notably of energy and food.  This plays well with the notion that landlords are lordly and loaded and can afford to take more of the widespread cost of living pain.  But they are businesses which invest in assets, and their cost of borrowing has been going up.  Plus the draft Holyrood budget for 2023-24 includes a hike in the Additional Dwelling Supplement to Land and Buildings Transactions Tax.  In addition to any LBTT that a buyer may have to pay in slabs of different rates on a property (5% over £250,000, rising to 10% over £325,000, etc, with no change in those thresholds as prices have risen), any purchase of a rental, second or holiday home carries a 6% supplement. That rate has doubled in three years. So we're being told that landlords are getting out of that market.  That may help subdue prices for buying the kind of home that is typically rented. That's good news for first time buyers. But with lower supply of rental homes, expect to see rents going up.  The better news for renters is that you can see build-to-rent blocks under constructions in cities, including a vast one, with 400 units, on the Broomielaw side of the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow. That is part of a transition from the landlord business moving from small-scale investors in one flat or a cluster of them to big financial institutions. That private rented sector is the one most in need of maintenance and repair, and it has the least energy efficient standards. And that's where the other emerging element of the property market is worth watching: with energy bills so much higher in 2023 than they were a year ago, prices may increasingly reflect the cost of heating older, draughtier homes. Where Scotland's governments - local, Holyrood and Westminster - step in to improve the dire state of heating insulation in many homes, will have an influence on calculating a valuation of what they're worth."
market volatility,Oil's up: What does it mean?,2024-09-15,2018-04-24,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43886953,"There's no magic price for oil at which investment is switched off or on, depending on the direction of travel. Investment depends on each project and its break-even point, and no two oil fields are the same - least of all those that require drilling offshore. But at $75 a barrel, and on an upward trend, this seems a milestone at which to catch some breath and ask a) what's going on with the market for Brent crude? And b) what are the implications? So first, what's going on? That's simple, perhaps deceptively so. It's about our old friends, supply and demand. The latter is rising with economic growth, notably in Asia, but around the world.  Growth is not as closely aligned to demand for oil as it once was. But in India, for instance, development means a big boost to industrial production, demand for electricity and transport. Symbolic of India's economic position, Saudi Arabia announced this month it is investing big in a refinery and petro-chemicals complex on a beach resort south of Mumbai. Ratnagiri will be one of the world's largest, processing 1.2 million barrels per day.  Saudi Aramco (state-owned while aiming to float) is taking a 50% stake in the £32bn ($44bn) project, while a consortium of state-owned energy firms in India own the other half. Supply is a more complex picture.  American stocks of oil influence the market, and the official numbers are expected to show they've fallen. That puts upward pressure on the price. More significant in the longer term, the Opec exporters' cartel, working with non-member Russia, has been holding back on production in order to pull the price up. Saudis are among those straining at the loss of market share, particularly to Americans.  The market gyrated a bit last week when the Saudi oil minister said the rising price didn't seem to be doing much harm to demand, so he reckoned out loud that oil at $80 to $100 might be a possible sustainable target zone.  The Saudi government has, remember, a war to fight. And hostilities with Yemen, partially as a proxy for Iran, are one of the reasons for markets being nervous about security of supply. The Straits of Hormuz are an oil supply choke point which could also be a flash point between Saudi and Iran. After the Saudi minister had hinted, Russia's energy minister counter-hinted that the constraints might come off the cartel, which would push the price down again. His comments did precisely that. America is the most dynamic part of the supply story, for two main reasons. Fracking technology extracts oil and gas for a limited period before new rock has to be fractured. It's a repeated process, and if, as in 2014-15, the price drops, the process is stopped. Only when the price rises again does fracking restart. That's what is happening. America is producing more oil now than ever. The other unpredictable dynamic sits in the Oval Office. Donald Trump wants to break from the Iran nuclear deal, which would involve a return to sanctions on Tehran's oil exports - that is, a cut in its supply into the world market.  The US president tweeted last Friday: ""Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!"" That, Mr President, is absolutely correct. Controlling supply and prices is precisely what cartels exist to do. That's the point of Opec.  And though oil prices may look too high from Washington DC, they probably don't look too high in mid-Texas or the Dakotas. ""No good"" for oil users, but very good for oil producers. And when you say this ""will not be accepted"", we look forward, nervously, to finding out if this is another threat of trade war. Put all that together, and the price of a barrel of oil delivered in three months has risen from a low below $30 at the start of 2016 to 150% more than that. However, the current price remains 43% below the peak in 2014. So what does it mean? Higher fuel prices? Well, not necessarily. At the same time the oil price, measured in US dollars, has been rising, the US dollar itself has been weakening against sterling. If like me, you'll find currencies easiest to understand by thinking of travelling abroad. If you want to vacation in America now, you'll be able to buy 12 more dollars for £100 than you could a year ago.  The same goes for dollar-denominated oil. A year ago, a pound bought you $1.28 on currency markets (without all those transaction charges). It now buys $1.40. That is, the pound buys 9% more in dollars than it did last year. The other factor is that UK forecourt prices have a lot to do with tax rates. VAT runs at 20%, so it is as volatile as the price. For heating fuel, VAT is 5%. Fuel duty for transport is fixed, currently sitting at 58p per litre. Take all that together, and the AA's price-monitoring tells us that the average price of a litre of unleaded fuel, at pumps across the UK, rose 1p between December and March, while diesel fell by 1p. For Scotland in particular, it's worth watching for three different effects. One is the risk of rising oil prices boosting costs for those who use fuel, in homes and in businesses. For those reasons around sterling, there's no sign of inflation resulting yet. But where economies are already doing well, analysts are concerned that the rising price of Brent crude could push up prices more widely. The other side of the coin in Scotland is the industry that extracts oil. Investment decisions have to take big gambles on the future price of Brent crude. In general, business plans don't like volatility or heightened uncertainty. It comes at a cost. They prefer to see a reasonably stable price and a market environment which looks like continuing that for the foreseeable. They don't have that yet, but they'll like the upward trend for more than two years. After a very harsh downturn, with the price slump from September 2014, much of the offshore industry has stabilised. It has a number of big final investment decisions - the gateway or green light for a project - which are helped by raised prices and an upward trend. Oil and Gas UK, the trade body, reckoned at the start of the year that at least 12 major investment projects were expected to be approved during 2018, worth around £5bn. So if there's more profit, there ought to be more tax revenue? Correct. But how much more?  Not as much as you would have found with other price revivals, because the UK Treasury has cut tax rates. The main tax take is at 30% of profits. The Supplementary Charge was cut in 2016 from 20% to 10%. And the Petroleum Revenue Tax rate, levied on profits from older fields, was cut from 35% to zero. The Office for Budget Responsibility last month raised its estimate of what the tax take might be as a result of the rising price, as it has had to do repeatedly.  It was a sharp increase, but to a level that remains low by previous standards - up from £500m this year to £900m.  Tax revenue from oil and gas is expected to average under £1bn annually for the five years of its forecast, which assumes the price of oil and of gas will fall again in the later three years. Production and profits are then expected to continue their decline. For the purposes of arguing the case for Scottish independence, a geographic share of that tax revenue is dwarfed by the scale of the public sector deficit calculated by Scottish government statisticians in their annual expenditure and revenue tables. Likewise, for those who want a national oil fund, less than a billion pounds per year might be nice to have but wouldn't go far.  That said, they are brave people who stick their necks out with assumptions about the oil price five years ahead. Sometimes, however, economic forecasters have nowhere to hide."
market volatility,New York Stock Exchange trading floor reopens,2024-09-15,2020-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52803390,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has reopened its trading floor after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. But as new social distance rules come into effect, the exchange looks and feels very different. The NYSE is one of the few bourses to still feature floor trade - most have shifted to fully-electronic trading. New York City has been hit hard by the outbreak with some 200,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths. Financial markets have continued to trade throughout the pandemic, but the exchange's trading floor was closed from 23 March and activity temporarily moved to fully-electronic trading to protect workers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on hand to ring the bell that re-started in-person trade, a sign of the symbolic weight attached to the reopening. US shares gained on Tuesday amid investor enthusiasm about economic rebound, but the new NYSE rules are a reminder that a full return to business will take time. ""It's not about returning to normal,"" NYSE president Stacey Cunningham told the BBC. ""It's about living with this global pandemic until there's a vaccine."" She added that she had faced ""no pressure"" from the Trump administration, which follows financial markets closely and has generally supported a rapid reopening.  Under the NYSE changes, only a quarter of the normal number of traders will be allowed to return to work. Traders must also avoid public transport, wear masks and follow strict social distancing rules, with newly fitted transparent barriers to keep people apart. They will also be screened and have their temperatures taken as they enter the building. Anyone who fails pass the check will be barred until they test negative for coronavirus or self-quarantine in accordance with US government guidelines. To return to their jobs, floor traders also have to sign a liability waiver that prevents them from suing the NYSE if they get infected at the exchange.  Some large financial companies, such as Morgan Stanley, have reportedly balked at signing, but Ms Cunningham defended the waiver as a way to ensure that traders, which are not employed by the exchange, abide by the new rules.  ""We need to make sure that they're committed to following this new norm,"" she said. NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of the total market capitalisation of listed companies. The 228-year-old exchange last closed its doors on 29 October 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy. It also shut for four sessions in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.  But the bourse resisted closing at the start of the pandemic and the closure reignited debate about the necessity of the floor in an era dominated by electronic activity. Ms Cunningham said trading has functioned smoothly with the floor closed, but she believed reopening will further ease volatility and help smaller firms that rely on in-person trades for their business. ""We are relevant we are necessary and WE ARE BACK,"" floor trader Peter Tuchman wrote on Twitter ahead of the reopening. For most people outside the financial world, NYSE's trading floor is a rare glimpse into the seemingly opaque workings of the global markets as well as being a colourful setting for companies to showcase their stock market debuts. The new regulations mean that the NYSE's high-profile opening bell events and stock market debut celebrations have been put on hold as visitors are banned. Media organisations that usually broadcast from the trading floor won't be allowed back until further notice. In the BBC interview, Ms Cunningham also addressed a proposal by US lawmakers to require companies that sell shares in the US to abide by American accounting rules and audits, or face de-listing.  The move, which comes as US-China tensions increase, is aimed at Chinese companies. The Senate passed the measure last week and the House is expected to take up the measure before the end of the summer.  Ms Cunningham in the past has said de-listing Chinese companies generally would simply shift their business elsewhere.  On Tuesday, she said lawmakers should ""balance"" investor protections and investor choice, but that the exchange backs efforts that would enhance the information supplied to investors. ""Any measures to enforce that are highly supported by us,"" she said. Trading - but not as we know it Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC reporter New York Before the coronavirus, I was a regular on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  It may be one of the great symbols of US capitalism, but it's also, just a workplace for hundreds of traders, market makers, and various bystanders such as journalists. And like so many offices and shop floors it's not somewhere that you would ever associate with social distancing, keeping two metres apart and wearing masks. Quite the reverse - face-to-face stock trading is sometimes close to a contact sport, as is reporting from the floor.  So the NYSE has to take its reopening very slowly. It will be a relief for some traders to be back to work, but it's not going to look like the trading floor we're all used to seeing for quite some time."
market volatility,US banks report gains but shares sink,2024-09-15,2018-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43758938,"Profits at JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo rose in the first three months of the year, but their shares slumped on Friday despite the gains. JP Morgan's profits soared 35% year-on-year, with more modest increases reported at Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Analysts said the share decline was a sign investors had already factored in some of the rise. They were expecting more active stock markets and a lower tax rate to boost results. Shares in all three banks sank more than 2% in early trading, providing a sour start to earnings season, when companies report quarterly performance to investors.  JP Morgan reported profits of $8.7bn (£6.11bn) in the period from $6.4bn last year, despite a decline in investment banking. Revenue increased 10% to $28.5bn, as a strong economy boosted activity at its consumer banking unit and the return of market fluctuations boosted trading, leading its equities unit to a record quarter. Citigroup's profits rose 13%, reaching $4.6bn in the quarter from $4.1bn last year.  Revenues in the quarter were $18.4bn, a 3% increase from the same period in 2017. The firm said volatility boosted its equity trading unit, helping to offset a fall in bond trading. As with JP Morgan, investment banking took a hit. Wells Fargo reported preliminary profits of $5.9bn in the quarter, rising 5% from the same period last year. The results were overshadowed by the firm's ongoing problems with watchdogs. Wells said US regulators have proposed to resolve investigations of vehicle insurance and might force it to restate its results. ""At this time, we are unable to predict final resolution ... and cannot reasonably estimate our related loss contingency,"" the bank said. The firm has been under a cloud since revelations that the bank created more than two million fake accounts to meet sales goals and ignored or punished whistleblowers. Then last year, the bank said it had wrongly charged customers for car insurance, among other problems.  In February, the US Federal Reserve, which regulates banks, said it would restrict the firm's growth until it improved its risk management oversight. Revenue slipped from $22.3bn in the first quarter of 2017 to $21.9bn this period, hurt in part by ""customer-friendly"" changes the bank made to card and overdraft fees. "
market volatility,Global bank stocks slump despite Biden reassurances,2024-09-15,2023-03-12,By Daniel Thomas & Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64935170,"Bank shares in Asia and Europe have slumped, despite reassurances from the US president that America's financial system is safe following the collapse of two US lenders. The falls come after authorities moved to protect customer deposits when the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank collapsed.  Joe Biden promised to do ""whatever is needed"" to protect the banking system. But investors fear other lenders may still be hit by the fallout. On Tuesday, Japan's Topix Banks share index fell by more than 7%, putting it on course for its worst day in more than three years. Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the country's largest lender by assets, were down by 8.1% in mid-day Asian trading.  On Monday, Spain's Santander and Germany's Commerzbank saw their share prices dive by more than 10% at one point.  A string of smaller US banks suffered even worse losses than European counterparts, despite reassuring customers that they had more than enough liquidity to protect themselves from shocks.  The volatility has led to speculation that America's Federal Reserve will now pause its plans to keep raising interest rates, designed to tame inflation. Mr Biden said that people and businesses that had deposited money with Silicon Valley Bank would be able to access all their cash from Monday, after the government stepped in to protect their deposits in full.  Many business customers had faced the prospect of not being able to pay staff and suppliers after their funds were frozen. BBC North America Technology correspondent James Clayton spoke to people queuing up all day outside the SVB branch in Menlo Park, California, to access their funds. As the bank was no longer offering wire transfers, they were taking out their money in cashier cheques.  Silicon Valley Bank - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by US regulators who seized its assets on Friday. It was the biggest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008. It had been trying to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates. Word of the troubles led customers to race to withdraw funds, leading to a cash crisis.  Authorities on Sunday also took over Signature Bank in New York, which had many clients involved in crypto and was seen as the institution most vulnerable to a similar bank run. Mr Biden promised that covering the deposits would not cost taxpayers anything, and instead be funded by fees regulators charge to banks. As part of efforts to restore confidence, US regulators also unveiled a new way for banks to borrow emergency funds in a crisis.  Yet there is concern that the failures, which came after the collapse of another US lender, Silvergate Bank, last week, are a sign of troubles at other firms.  Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the US authorities had ""acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing"". ""But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,"" he added. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at the stockbrokers AJ Bell, said: ""The first rush of relief has been replaced by niggling concerns that the era of high rates might be more difficult for some banks to stomach than had been previously thought.  ""In the US, bank stocks slid despite Joe Biden's pledge that 'whatever is needed' will be carried out to prevent more dominos from tumbling.""  The failure of SVB has re-ignited debates - similar to those seen following the 2008 financial crisis - about how much the government should do to regulate and protect banks. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says there will be a thorough and transparent review of the collapse. Mr Biden called for tougher rules and emphasised that investors and bank leaders would not be spared. ""They knowingly took a risk... that's how capitalism works,"" he said. Still, Republican Senator Tim Scott, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, called the rescue ""problematic"". ""Building a culture of government intervention does nothing to stop future institutions from relying on the government to swoop in after taking excessive risks,"" he said. Once again people are worried about banks. Once again there is intense debate about bailouts. But this isn't 2008. Following the global financial crisis, the focus was on reforming banks considered ""too big to fail"". Today's problems are centred around medium- and smaller-sized banks.   Both of the banks that collapsed - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - had the same thing in common: their business models were too concentrated in one sector and they were over exposed to assets whose values came under pressure from rising interest rates.  The criticism is that they should have foreseen this and they didn't. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has gone to great lengths to signal the Fed's intention to raise interest rates. Since most banks are well diversified and have plenty of cash on hand, the assumption is that the risk to the rest of the banking sector is low. That won't stop regulators looking into what went wrong and what rules need to change.  And the pressure on small- and medium-sized banks hasn't gone away. What happens to the US economy and the fight against inflation also remains to be seen."
market volatility,Google owner Alphabet misses forecasts,2024-09-15,2019-04-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48099862,"Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its shares drop in after-hours trading after the internet giant missed revenue forecasts. Alphabet, which also owns YouTube, reported $36.3bn (£28bn) in sales for the first quarter, below expectations of $37.33bn. Profits also fell during the three months to 31 March. It was impacted by a fine from the European Commission for blocking rival online search advertisers. Google had to pay €1.5bn (£1.3bn) after it was accused of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party competitors from displaying search adverts between 2006 and 2016. Including the fine, Alphabet's operating profit dropped to $6.6bn from a previous $7.6bn. Sales growth slowed to 17% in the first three months of the year, below the expansion rate of the previous three months and down from a 26% increase in the same period last year. Alphabet's share price dropped nearly 7% in after-hours trading.  Alphabet also said that the rate of growth in ""paid clicks"" decelerated, slowing to 39% growth compared to 59% at the beginning of 2018. Under the model, companies pay a fee each time one of their adverts is clicked on.   Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the firm was experimenting with its ad products as users grow reliant on mobile devices and that it was seeing revenue volatility as a result.  The majority of the firm's revenues (84.5%) came from Google's ad business, which sells links, banners and commercials across its own websites and apps and those of partners. Google's three billion users help make it the world's largest seller of internet ads, according to market research firm EMarketer.  George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Another EU fine won't have washed well with investors, but in reality it's not the cheque on its way to Brussels that's causing the shares to drop. ""Instead, it's a nasty combination of growth in traffic to Google ads slowing and lower revenue per click from those ads that's upset the market."" "
market volatility,Mortgage safety net 'disappearing',2024-09-15,2017-12-11,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42311583,"Ministers should consider strengthening the safety net for homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage, a report suggests. Help for this group introduced in response to the financial crisis will be largely withdrawn by 2022. Academics, commissioned by lenders' trade body UK Finance, said the government should review its position. However, mortgage applicants must now prove they have a buffer to deal with money shocks and rising interest rates.  Various schemes have been in place to help those facing arrears or, ultimately, repossession of their property if they face financial difficulties. One of the major schemes is Support for Mortgage Interest, which helps those on certain benefits, owing to their low income, to receive help to meet the interest payments on a mortgage. Next year, this will be replaced by a loan.  The Universal Credit benefit system, which merges various working-age benefits, also has less mortgage support for those in low-paid or part-time work than the current system of tax credits and other welfare. The UK Finance report said: ""It is now evident that by 2022, there will only be limited government financial support for home buyers in distress, and that will mainly be in the form of loans for those not in work."" Instead, borrowers and their lenders would be expected to come to an arrangement on mortgage payments. ""Recognising the relatively open nature of the UK mortgage market and the continued volatility of our housing market, this report suggests it would be timely for government to review the homeowner safety net situation systematically and comprehensively,"" the report concludes. Low interest rates and a less aggressive stance by lenders have meant comparatively few people have lost their homes in recent years. Fewer homes were repossessed last year than in any year since 1982, but lenders have warned that mortgage rates will not always be so favourable. Financial information service Moneyfacts said that even the recent rise in the Bank rate from 0.25% to 0.5% had not been felt by all variable mortgage holders, with the average rate rising by only 0.14%. However, there is widespread expectation that mortgage rates will not get any cheaper. In response, the UK Finance report said: ""Households have become very used to enjoying low and falling mortgage rates and many have extended their secured and unsecured debt despite static wages. The Bank of England rightly reminds us that this poses significant risks."" Stricter regulation means that mortgage applicants must prove they can deal with rising interest rates, but the report suggests that this will not cover all homeowners, nor would it protect everyone who has a financial shock, such as a sudden drop in income. It suggests that Universal Credit could be beefed up to help some of those struggling with their mortgage while in low-paid work."
market volatility,A6 Londonderry-Dungiven road to open on Thursday,2024-09-15,2023-04-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65170231,"The new A6 between Londonderry and Dungiven will open later this week, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has said. Work on the road started in 2018 and was due to be completed last autumn but has been beset by delays. On Monday DfI confirmed the 16-mile (25.5km) stretch will open on Thursday, ahead of the Easter holiday. ""This is great news for the 15,000 vehicles using the route each day,"" a DfI spokeswoman said. The opening of the Derry to Dungiven upgrade - part of the A6 road that links Derry and Belfast -  will ""bring long-term benefits for road users and the local community in providing shorter, safer and more reliable journey times,"" she added. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 16-mile section of dual carriageway will include a bypass around Dungiven. It was due to open last autumn and there has been frustration over delays. The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. The DfI spokeswoman added: ""The Road Safety Audit process has been completed and the contractor will commence the process of removing cones and temporary traffic management arrangements on the morning of Thursday 6 April. ""The entire 25.5 kilometres of the road will be open for road users by Thursday afternoon with national speed limit in place"".     She said the opening of the road means the department has invested around £440m in the Derry to Belfast road upgrade. Sinn Féin MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the opening is ""positive news for Derry, Dungiven and the surrounding areas"". ""Not only will this new road cut journey times between Belfast and Derry, it will improve the north west's connection to other parts of the island,"" she said."
market volatility,US stocks fall for second consecutive day,2024-09-15,2018-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42880629,"US markets have suffered a second day of steep losses, as investors dumped health care companies and Apple.  The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average sank nearly 1.4%, marking its biggest one-day decline in months. The fall followed the news that Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway would create a new healthcare company with the aim of lowering health costs for their US employees.  Bond yields also rose, reflecting last year's three US interest rate hikes. UnitedHealth Group and Pfizer were the two biggest losers on the Dow, while the insurance company Anthem saw the steepest losses on the S&P 500. Those are among the firms that would be threatened by the emergence of a major new competitor - or signs of a government crackdown on drug prices promised by US President Donald Trump. Apple dipped 0.6% on reports of weak demand for its latest iPhone, and energy firms also came under pressure. But the losses were widespread, touching nearly every sector. The Dow closed down 362.59 points at 26,076.89, while the wider S&P 500 fell 31.1 points or 1.09%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 64 points or 0.86% to 7,402.48. Meanwhile, the closely watched Vix index, which measures volatility based on options prices, also shot up after months of calm, in what some investors say is a sign that more market fluctuation could be coming. The sell-off, volatility and rising bond yields mark a turn for US markets that have been making gains for months, racing past one milestone after another. All three major US indexes are up more than 5% since the start of this month. Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at US Bank Private Wealth Management, said January's rise was driven by higher expectations, as global growth strengthened and the US approved major tax cuts. He said some investors were likely to be cashing in on their gains. They are also reacting to new information as companies update investors on their end of year earnings and provide forecasts for 2018. Others may be worried about the prospect of higher interest rates, which would drive bond yields higher. Bond yields have been relatively low in recent years, helping to make stocks the more attractive investment.  But yields have gained more recently, as the US has raised interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury closed on Tuesday at its highest level since 2014. ""Investors are catching up to the fact that rates have risen,"" said Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders. ""The market's finally catching up."" Investors are watching to see if the US Federal Reserve, which is in the middle of a two-day meeting in Washington, will signal when interest rates might rise again.  The bank is about to undergo a change of leadership as Janet Yellen, who is viewed as favouring low interest rates, steps down."
market volatility,"Global food prices hit fresh 10-year high, UN says",2024-09-15,2021-11-05,By Katie Silver,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59172665,"Global food prices have hit the highest level in over a decade after rising by more than 30% in the last year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says. The agency's figures highlighted the soaring cost of cereals and vegetable oils around the world. Vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October. Disruptions to supplies, high commodity prices, factory closures and political tensions are helping to push up prices. The FAO said its measure of cereal prices was up by more than 22% compared to a year earlier. The price of wheat was one of the major contributors to this rise, up almost 40% in the last 12 months after major exporters - such as Canada, Russia and the US - had poor harvests.  ""In the case of cereals, we're facing a situation where one could say it's climate change which is ultimately causing falling production,"" Peter Batt, an agribusiness expert at Curtin Business School told the BBC. ""We've had pretty bad years [of harvests] in a lot of places.""  The FAO said its index of vegetable oil prices was pushed up by rises in the cost of palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils.  In the case of palm oil, prices have been driven higher after output from Malaysia was ""subdued"" due to ongoing shortages of migrant workers, the FAO said. Labour shortages are helping to push up the cost of production and transportation of food in other parts of the world too. Mr Batt said: ""The other problem that has emerged is getting the product out. For example, here in Australia we've had a lot of ships arrive to take the food away but we can't get crew to come in because of Covid."" Shipping disruptions are also pushing up milk prices, with the cost of dairy products rising by almost 16% over the last year. Brigit Busicchia from Macquarie University said speculation on global markets is also contributing to price volatility: ""Since the 1990s, the deregulation of commodity futures trading has made it possible for institutional investors to enter this market on a large scale."" This is having a particular impact on countries which rely on food imports. ""Expect countries like Egypt or other Middle Eastern countries to experience tensions in their provisioning of cereals,"" she said. Ms Busicchia also highlighted that rising food prices are typically felt most acutely by the poor, as disadvantaged groups are pushed further into poverty and that this has the potential to heighten social and political tensions.

market volatility,Bank of England wasn't briefed on mini-budget,2024-09-15,2022-10-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63319567,"The government did not tell the Bank of England about its tax cut plans before the mini-budget, one of its deputy governors has said. In the event, the mini-budget sparked market turmoil, with the Bank having to step in to stabilise pension funds.  The Bank could have advised the government on the possible market reaction, Sir Jon Cunliffe said. The government was criticised for bypassing some independent scrutiny of its plans before making them public. The mini-budget, which was put forward by former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss, included huge tax cuts but it was unclear how they would be funded. This led to a sharp drop in the pound against the dollar, and spooked investors about government debt, leading to the risk of some pension funds collapsing. The Bank of England was forced to step in to buy government debt to stop a fire-sale by some pension funds of assets which could have led to their collapse. Following the market turmoil, criticism by institutions including the IMF, and a huge drop in the polls for the Conservatives, Mr Kwarteng was sacked by his close political ally Liz Truss. At a meeting with MPs on Tuesday, Sir Jon said the Bank of England had not been consulted on the government plans before they were announced. ""We did not have a full briefing of the package the night before,"" he said. ""Had they asked us what the market reaction would be, we would have interacted with them. ""But it is not our responsibility to give the government advice on fiscal policy. This would have been for the Treasury to advise on the market reaction."" However, he said ultimately the decision on how to proceed lay with ministers. At Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday Labour accused Ms Truss of ""crashing the economy"". The prime minister did not address the mini-budget, but said: ""Interest rates are rising across the world and the economic conditions have worsened."" However, according to experts including the Bank of England, the mini-budget on 23 September also had a significant impact on the financial markets. In a letter to MPs on the Treasury Committee on Monday, Sir Jon wrote: ""There has been a particular increase in volatility in UK markets"" and pointed out that: ""The five largest daily moves in the 30-year inflation-linked gilt, in data that dates back to 2000, have all been since the 23 September"", which was when the mini-budget was unveiled. Gilts are a form of IOU which the government sells to borrow money to fund its spending plans. A career Bank of England official like Jon Cunliffe doesn't overstate the situation. But the two key answers he gave the Treasury committee are very serious. He said that the Bank wasn't told about the unpublicised measures in the mini budget, and that had it anticipated a risk to financial stability it would have warned the Treasury. Those are serious because it had every reason to anticipate instability. The day before the mini-budget, the Bank had announced it would start to sell some of the £895bn of government bonds it had bought to try and keep the cost of borrowing down. When more investors buy bonds than sell them, prices rise and the interest rate - known as the yield - drops.  In 2020/2021, the Bank's presence as a buyer in the market was crucial in enabling Rishi Sunak to borrow more than £300bn in to support the economy through Covid, without any offsetting tax rises or spending cuts. The Treasury could borrow vast sums by issuing as many bonds as it liked to investors who didn't insist on higher interest rates to compensate for the risk of lending to a hugely-indebted government - because they could always sell the bonds straight away to the Bank. By contrast, when the mini-budget was announced, there was no such buyer propping up bond prices, and therefore keeping down yields, because the Bank had announced it was now a seller.  That led to chaos. But you only get to hear about potential unintended consequences of budget measures if you ask the people who know."
market volatility,Tech Tent: Apple's security under scrutiny,2024-09-15,2017-12-01,By Rory Cellan-Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42195356,"Will Apple's gold-plated reputation with consumers be dented by an embarrassing security foul-up? Also on the podcast this week: is Bitcoin really using more energy than Ireland? And what kind of qualities do you need to succeed as a professional e-sports player? We try to answer those questions on this week's Tech Tent. For a long time, Apple has boasted - with some justification - that it has an excellent record of keeping its devices safe from intruders.  In any case, with PCs having the lion's share of the computer market, hackers and security researchers used to spend little time hunting down vulnerabilities in Macs. But on Tuesday a Turkish software developer tweeted this: ""Dear @AppleSupport, we noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra. Anyone can login as 'root' with empty password after clicking on login button several times."" It sounded unlikely but it was true. What it meant was that anyone who got hold of an Apple computer running the latest operating system could get root access to the machine with very little trouble. ""Root access is a bit like having a master key to the building,"" Prof Angela Sasse, from University College London, tells Tech Tent. ""It's really bad news.""  She explains that it means an intruder could install new software, such as spyware, on your computer. And she is surprised that this issue was not spotted before High Sierra was released. ""Normally before release you would test that root access is adequately protected."" Apple moved quickly to release an update to patch this loophole in the operating system's defences. So will it suffer any long-term consequences in terms of a loss of consumer trust? Neil Mawston, from the tech consultancy Strategy Analytics, says Apple is a very clever company with a great brand.  But he has some concerns: ""We're seeing this gradual tick-tock of mis-steps in delivery.""  Recently, we have seen the delay in the launch of Apple's Homepod - and another, albeit much more minor, security issue.  ""If products are late or they have lots of flaws and that keeps on building up momentum, then that negative press coverage eventually catches up with them."" A decade ago a furious Steve Jobs would have roamed the Cupertino campus to find someone to eject from the building for such a serious error. Tim Cook's style is very much more measured, but do not be surprised if there is some movement in the upper ranks of Mac management in the coming months. It has been a dizzying week for anyone who takes an interest in the crypto-currency Bitcoin. It started 2017 worth just under $1,000 (£740) but this week it soared past the $10,000 mark. In the days that followed, the volatility we have come to expect from the Bitcoin market has become even more pronounced. In the space of three hours, its price dropped by more than $2,000, only to bounce back a few hours later. The debate over whether this is a speculative bubble or the future of money gets hotter by the moment. But so too do concerns over the amount of energy used in the process of mining Bitcoin and recording transactions. As banks of computers whir away, many of them in China, the electricity consumed as they solve increasingly complex mathematical problems gets ever greater. According to one study, Bitcoin is now using more energy each year than the whole of Ireland, and will soon surpass Morocco's energy use. This does not sound sustainable, but as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps rising, miners will not care about the electricity bills. And meanwhile the incentive to plant software on websites to hijack visitors' computers to help mine Bitcoin will only increase. Competitive video gaming or e-sports is a rapidly growing business. Market research firm Newzoo thinks this young industry will make nearly $700m in revenue this year. And it is not all about consoles - mobile gaming is increasingly popular. This weekend, London hosts the Clash Royale Crown World Championships, a global tournament entered by more than 27 million players, according to Supercell, the Finnish creators of the mobile game Clash Royale. Only a few of those will be professional e-sports players. This new breed can earn substantial sums, not only from tournaments but from sponsors, advertisers and from fans who watch them streaming their practice sessions on Twitch or YouTube and just send them money. So what does it take to make it as one of these new sports stars?  We hear from ElecTr1fy - yes, it is important to have an arresting name - who tells us his YouTube channel has added 40,000 subscribers and had generated 40 million views over the last month.  ""You need fast instincts  - every delay can cost you the game,"" he tells us. ""And you need to get into your opponent's head."" That message is reinforced by The Rum Ham, a gamescaster - another new profession - providing live commentary on e-sports. He says it is about making good decisions quickly.  ""They're making decisions where hundreds of thousands of dollars are on the line in a split second.  These players are doing mental maths, spatial awareness, predicting the outcomes of a combat before the troops are even on the field - all in a three-minute game play."" And the prize? Well the best players are making more than a million dollars a year. Time to put away the crossword, forget about the Sudoku and get down to some serious gaming. "

market volatility,Student numbers drop in Welsh unis,2024-09-15,2018-05-07,By Bethan Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44004774,"Five out of Wales' eight universities have seen a drop in student enrolments of up to a quarter over the last three years. Since 2013-14 student numbers at Glyndwr in Wrexham and Aberystwyth universities have fallen by 24%. A senior figure said Welsh universities were in ""a very competitive market"" where removing a cap on student numbers in England had a knock-on effect. Nevertheless, enrolments at Swansea jumped by 29%. Dr David Blaney, chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, admitted there was a degree of volatility around the UK universities sector. ""Universities in Wales are part of a market, predominantly with England but actually UK and internationally and it's a very competitive market,"" he said. ""So what we have seen particularly in England is removal of constraints on student numbers which means that some institutions in England - the stronger ones in the market in particular - have grown and that's had a knock-on impact across the whole of the system."" He said students were discerning and looking to make careful choices, taking note of the experiences of those already studying. Dr Blaney said universities had to look beyond the prospectus and advertising. ""If the message coming through social media from existing students is not strong then none of that will have an impact so you really have to look after the interests of the students that you've got,"" he added. Swansea University had 19,160 student enrolments in 2016-17 and they are aiming to get to 20,000 by their centenary in 2020. Pro Vice-Chancellor Prof Iwan Davies said student experience was ""critical"" and with students paying thousands in course fees employability, he said was also a key factor. ""It's great they're here in Swansea, we are in the top 15 in terms of employability in the league tables,"" he said. ""I'm very proud of the relevance of what we offer and the students of course are discerning and they've seen that."" Wrexham Glyndwr University saw student numbers fall from a peak of 9,535 in 2011-12 to 6,415 in 2016-17. A spokesman said there was a ""strategic change of direction"" during the period with a move away from international recruitment. International students made up 28% of enrolments in 2013-14 but by 2016-17 the figure was under 9%. ""During this same period, Welsh student enrolment actually increased from 42% to 62% which highlights success in our strategic change,"" he added. Aberystwyth University said its recruitment patterns had been affected by changes to how much universities could charge. ""The introduction of high tuition fees in 2012 marked a sea-change for the sector and saw a record intake at Aberystwyth University in 2011 - a large cohort which carried through to 2013-14,"" a spokesman said. Dr Blaney said there were still concerns about underfunding and a disparity in what goes into the Welsh system compared to England, with more resources towards supporting students rather than supporting for institutions. Changes to student finance in Wales, which will be introduced from this autumn, mean the tuition fee grant of £5,100 will be scrapped and replaced with a maintenance grant of just over £8,000 for students from the most disadvantaged families. Dr Blaney said the changes following a review by Prof Ian Diamond would rebalance the position ""substantially"" and he believes Wales will catch up with England in terms of investment although it may take several years.  ""At the moment the Welsh sector is arguably slightly less well resourced than the English sector,"" he said. ""So that means that they have to work harder to look attractive which they are doing."" Prof Davies said Swansea had been fortunate in terms of European funding in recent years and he said the Diamond reforms would ""go a long way"" to addressing concerns about the Welsh system being underfunded. But he warned: ""Welsh universities should not be disadvantaged in terms of our competitiveness with our friends in England."""
market volatility,Why energy firm Bulb's collapse may cost you £200,2024-09-15,2022-12-01,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63805028,"Energy firm Octopus Energy is on track to buy collapsed rival Bulb which is being run by administrators after being bailed out by taxpayers. You may not be one of Bulb's 1.6 million customers, but if you pay tax then you will be funding its rescue. The total estimated bill is more than £200 for every UK taxpayer. So how did a firm that was the poster child for the benefits of new competition in the energy market end up becoming the government's biggest bailout since the 2008 financial crisis? The government's official budget forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has said the support for the firm will cost the public around £6.5bn (although the government says the net cost will be lower). There are four main reasons: bad regulation, bad luck, bad government policy and most likely some bad maths.  Over the last two decades the energy regulator Ofgem, with the support of Conservative and Labour governments, prioritised stimulating competition in the energy market as the best way to bring down energy bills. The onetime monopoly of British Gas seemed a distant memory when looking at the proliferation of dozens of new providers competing via comparison websites and enabled by easy switching.   However, many of these companies had little or no shock-absorbing financial reserves. That was ok as long as they could pass on any rises in wholesale costs to their customers. When a universally politically popular energy price cap was introduced at the beginning of 2019, the landscape changed. It introduced the risk that energy companies might have to buy energy at a higher cost than they could sell it. Well run companies managed this risk by buying their energy well in advance so they could still survive under a cap set and monitored by Ofgem.   But some didn't do that.  When energy prices started to skyrocket when world demand for oil and gas soared post-Covid, the difference between the wholesale price companies bought energy at and the lower price at which they were allowed to sell it, bankrupted dozens of companies which didn't have the financial reserves to absorb these losses.  This exposed the regulator's failure to pay due - or any - regard to the financial resilience of the companies it regulated.  Ofgem had a system whereby the customers of these small, failed companies were absorbed by the larger, surviving companies. The additional cost incurred by those companies as they had to buy more energy at high prices for new customers, was passed on to all consumer bills over time. But Bulb was deemed too big for other companies to want to absorb and see another big hike to consumer bills at a time when energy costs were soaring. So in November 2021 Bulb was nationalised and special administrators appointed to run it. The government hoped to sell the business by the following spring and set aside £1.7bn to buy the energy to keep supplying Bulb customers until that time.  But worse was to come and energy prices rocketed again when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, sending any would-be buyers running for the hills. The government found itself owning an energy supplier at the worst time in living memory. Prices rose to five and then 10-times their pre-pandemic, pre-Ukraine rates at the same time as the energy price cap, set every six months, meant they were painfully exposed to the extreme volatility of wholesale energy prices.  The reason more energy companies didn't go bust was that the well-run, financially-resilient ones had insured themselves (""hedged"") against that volatility by buying the gas they needed for their customers well in advance. But the Treasury has a long-standing reluctance to do this. The government prefers to self-insure against financial risk rather than pay a fee to profit making third parties. ""We don't pay Aviva to insure battleships - so we don't pay financial institutions to insure financial risks,"" said one Treasury official. But this is a preference, not a rule. A former senior Treasury official told the BBC that ""Treasury theology wouldn't rule it out"".  So the government could have insured against rocketing prices but chose not to. But even that is not the main driver of the whopping £6.5bn bill for Bulb. It turns out that, to date, the administrators of Bulb have spent less buying energy than the government originally forecast they would. Although the meter is still running on it, they have currently spent less than £1.2bn. It seems the vast majority of the estimated bill comes from Treasury assumptions about a complex set of moving parts. To transfer Bulb back into private ownership, the government has to set aside money to protect the would-be buyer from taking on risks that might ruin the company (Octopus) acquiring it. Estimating the cost of this post-sale support depends on taking a view on future wholesale energy prices, the level at which future retail caps are set, the amount of ongoing government bill support, and assumptions about how much money the acquirer will pay back to the government from any extra profits from its new customers over time.  Industry sources have told the BBC that the government appears to have taken the most conservative/most pessimistic view on all of these factors. Even some in the Treasury seem unsure as to how the number was arrived at, while sources close to the current administrators have used words like ""toppy"" and ""baffling"".  Some energy companies argue it means that Octopus was getting an unreasonable and unfair level of government support to take it out of public ownership.  Lawyers in court argued it amounted to a massive sweetener - or ""cash dowry"" to Octopus.  Octopus hit back, saying other companies were offered the same chance to take on Bulb but walked away.  But crucially, say the objectors to the Bulb/Octopus deal, at the time they were asked to consider taking on Bulb, the government had not yet announced its Energy Price Guarantee which saw the government subsidising household bills, meaning millions of customers who would not have been able to pay, now could. This fundamentally reduced the risk of taking on more customers.  The deal currently in front of the courts for Octopus to take control of Bulb includes a profit sharing agreement which would see Bulb repay some of the government support over time if Octopus made a profit supplying Bulb's customers.  Estimates of the final likely bill range from ""only"" £3bn to £4bn, rather than the OBR's £6.5bn estimate.  ""[The OBR's] cost figure does not include the full details of any deal drawn up as part of the process to remove Bulb from the Special Administration Regime,"" said a business department (BEIS) spokesperson. ""Nor do the OBR figures include the financial support that will be repaid by the new entity in accordance with an agreed repayment schedule, so we still expect the net cost to taxpayers to be much lower."" Sources close to Octopus insist that the government needs to proceed quickly as Bulb's consumer satisfaction scores are plummeting, leaving the government and the taxpayer with an asset deteriorating in value.  The great energy bust of 2021 and 2022 may not yet be over. The Business Secretary Grant Shapps, recently wrote to the remaining suppliers urging them to reduce customer direct debits when they used less energy prompting some, including Centrica boss Chris O'Shea, to imply that some companies were essentially borrowing money from their customers to finance their operations. Some have described the energy bloodbath as the greatest regulatory failure since the financial crisis. While it is probably fair to say that few could have predicted a tenfold spike in the price of gas, regulators are there to imagine the ""what ifs"".  Ofgem has promised a new regime where the financial resilience of market participants, rather than their sheer number, is top of mind. Many will say that is something that a regulator should have been doing anyway. "
market volatility,Farm subsidies 'must be earned' - Gove,2024-09-15,2017-07-21,By Roger Harrabin,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40673559,"Farm subsidies will have to be earned rather than just handed out in future, the Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said in a speech. Farmers will only get payouts if they agree to protect the environment and enhance rural life, he will say. The move is part of what he calls his vision for a ""green Brexit"". Farmers’ leaders want the current £3bn total to be spent on the environment, more infrastructure to develop farm businesses, and promoting British food. The government has promised to keep overall payments at the same level until 2022. The Tenant Farmers' Association - which represents tenant farmers in England and Wales - has called for the same amount of money to remain after that time. Under the EU's current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), farmers are paid based on the amount of land they farm. However, in a speech at WWF's Living Planet Centre in Woking on Friday, Mr Gove said the current system will be abolished after the UK has left the EU. He criticised the current system for giving money to some of the UK's wealthiest landowners, for encouraging wastage, and for not recognising ""good environmental practice"". Mr Gove described Brexit as ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reform how we care for our land, our rivers and our seas, how we recast our ambition for our country’s environment, and the planet"".  Critics say under the CAP wealthy UK landowners are given subsidies of up to £3m a year. The issue was highlighted last year when BBC News revealed that taxpayers are paying more than £400,000 a year to subsidise a farm where a billionaire Saudi prince breeds racehorses. The Newmarket farm of Khalid Abdullah al Saud - owner of the legendary horse Frankel - is among the top recipients of farm grants, along with the Queen. Environmentalists will applaud the promise of change; they blame the CAP for the huge loss of wildlife in the British countryside. The question for Mr Gove will be what detailed policy takes its place.  Mr Gove said in his speech: “There are very good reasons why we should provide support for agriculture. Seventy per cent of our land is farmed - beautiful landscape has not happened by accident but has been actively managed.  “Agriculture is an industry more susceptible to outside shocks and unpredictable events - whether it’s the weather or disease. So financial assistance and mechanisms which can smooth out the vicissitudes farmers face make sense."" He also expressed a desire to protect the “human ecology” of Britain’s highlands, where farming without subsidy is impossible. This won’t please radical environmentalists, who want Mr Gove to save money (and in their view enhance the environment) by letting sheep farming wither, and allowing the uplands to revert to natural forest. The Country Land and Business Association, known as the CLA, accepts the need for reform and has launched a plan for a land management contract.  Ross Murray, president of the CLA - which represents owners of land, property and businesses in England and Wales - said there is ""vital work to be done"", including to support farming practices, to manage soils and preserve land. When pressed on whether rich landowners should received public money, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was open to change but practices such as tree planting - which are good for the environment but provide landowners with little benefit - should still be recognised. Asked if farming subsidies could be reduced in the future, he added: ""In the long term perhaps, but in the meantime I think we're going to have to support farmers who provide public goods which could never be provided by the market."" Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth, welcomed the speech, but said: “Current EU rules aimed at tackling air pollution and climate change and protecting our birds, bees and nature must not be watered down, and mechanisms must be put in place to enforce them post-Brexit."" National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Meurig Raymond said that, after leaving the EU, ""it is important that we see a broad and innovative range of measures to ensure farmers continue to deliver all the benefits - for our wellbeing, for our economy and for our environment - that the country enjoys"".  He added: ""Such a policy needs to be comprehensive, providing support to farmers not just for environmental work, but also to manage risk and volatility, and to improve productivity and resilience among farming businesses.""  One crucial question will be who has the final say on proposed developments in the UK's prime wildlife sites. At the moment they are protected by the EU as part of Europe's common heritage. That protection may disappear after Brexit.  Follow Roger on Twitter."
market volatility,Did robots trigger the market plunge?,2024-09-15,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42959755,"Robot trading has accelerated this week's market dive and may have sparked the sell-off, experts say. Financial firms use computers programmed with complex sets of instructions known as algorithms. They identify trading opportunities and then strike faster than any human could. Algorithmic trading has become so ubiquitous that some estimate well over half of all trading of the S&P 500 Index is done this way.  Such automated trading almost certainly accelerated the sell-off on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashing 800 points in ten minutes. ""The explosive speed of the fall ... that is done by machines,"" said Tom Stevenson, Investment Director at Fidelity Personal Investing. Most analysts believe the market tumble was prompted by a report on the US job market, released on Friday, which showed strong wage growth. But the decision to sell on that news may have been made by robot traders. US government bonds, or Treasuries, fell in value after the US jobs report. Yields (the interest that bonds offer investors) rise as prices fall. It's thought that robot traders were waiting for that yield to hit 3% - a significant figure as it could prompt human investors to switch out of shares into bonds. Mr Stevenson said: ""Everyone looks for a reason for why the fall happened. One of them was that bond yields rose up towards the magic number of 3%. ""There seems to have been a trigger at 2.9% for automatic trading to sell and once that trigger was pulled the markets went into freefall."" Piers Curran, head of trading at Amplify Trading, explained that algorithms will be set up to react in certain ways to certain situations. He said: ""One might work by a stop loss criteria, selling an asset as it falls to prevent further losses.  ""So if the Dow Jones Index has dropped 5% it may trigger the machine to sell, but if you have a huge number of these algorithms hitting stop losses at the same time that produces further falls which produce further stop losses."" The algorithmic trading can also be triggered by ""correlation"" trades, when movement in one market will trigger a trade in a different market. Last week an Index called the VIX, nicknamed the Fear Index because it measures stock market volatility, started to rise sharply.  Mr Currant said: ""The VIX was very elevated last week, and doubled on Monday, and because there is often an inverse correlation between the VIX and the Dow Jones Index, the machine trades sold US equities.""  The triggers though can work in the opposite direction.  Many of the algorithms that sold equities on Monday were ""selling short"", that is selling stocks specifically to buy them back cheaper later and net a profit. Steep market falls created by algorithms can create equally steep recoveries. Mr Curran said: ""The markets were reacting to some very specific numbers on Monday, but they are only one set of figures. ""We are going to have to see wages growing strongly in February too and get at least four rises in interest rates this year before we can be sure inflation is going to be that much higher.  ""The market reaction to these single numbers was massively exaggerated because of the machine trades."" Mr Stevenson agreed: ""Algorithmic trading or quant trading does make markets more volatile."" Longer term Mr Stevenson is not pessimistic. ""There are two things that can cause a proper bear market - interest rates rising faster than expected, or a recession,"" he said. ""Rates may rise a little faster but not excessively so. As for a recession, all the evidence, bearing in mind the strength of the US economy, is against it."""
market volatility,Market turmoil hits Citigroup revenues,2024-09-15,2019-01-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46866751,"US bank Citigroup has blamed the recent turmoil on global markets for a surprise drop in revenue. Fourth quarter revenue slipped 2% to $17.1bn (£13.3bn), falling short of analyst estimates of $17.5bn. The bank said income on its bond trading desks had slumped by a fifth following the fluctuations on financial markets in December. But chief executive Michael Corbat said the lender, which is America's third largest, was making ""solid progress"". ""A volatile fourth quarter impacted some of our market sensitive businesses, particularly fixed income,"" he said.  In the three months to the end of December, profit rose to $4.2bn, or $1.61 a share, from $3.7bn, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier. Citi is the first of the major US banks to post results in 2019, with JP Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs all due to issue fourth-quarter figures later this week. "
market volatility,Madoff investigator accuses GE of $38bn fraud,2024-09-15,2019-08-15,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49352765,"A private financial investigator who flagged warnings about Bernard Madoff's $65bn Ponzi scheme is now targeting one of America's blue chip companies. In a 175-page report Harry Markopolos claimed General Electric (GE) was hiding an accounting scandal. He accused GE of concealing $38.1bn in potential losses and alleged the company's cash situation was far worse than disclosed. GE called it ""meritless, misguided and self-serving speculation"". Chief executive Lawrence Culp also accused Mr Markopolos of ""false statements of fact"" and said he had not checked his facts with GE before publishing. Mr Markopolos's analysis of GE's financial position, called General Electric: A Bigger Fraud Than Enron, claims: ""The $38bn in accounting fraud amounts to over 40% of GE's market capitalization, making it far more serious than either the Enron or WorldCom accounting frauds.""  The report highlights the conglomerate's exposure to long-term care insurance in the US and its oil industry services business. Mr Markopolos's referencing of two of corporate America's most notorious frauds in the report was seen as potentially serious, as both led to criminal prosecutions.  GE's share price fell 15% on Thursday following news of the report and an appearance by Mr Markopolos on the CNBC television network. The stock closed down 11%, GE's worse one-day fall in 11 years. As a sign of faith in his company, Mr Culp bought $2m worth of GE shares, according to reports. Mr Markopolos disclosed that he had given an advance copy of his report to an unnamed hedge fund, and would receive a percentage of the profits from any share price movement. Some analysts dismissed the report, with John Hempton, co-founder of the Bronte Capital hedge fund calling it ""silly"". However, Reuters noted that there are Wall Street analysts who have long been concerned about claims of GE's low cash flow, charges and asset writedowns, and alleged opaque financial reports. In the past two years GE has announced more than $40bn in writedowns and accounting charges. The company has also disclosed that its accounting is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Mr Culp told reporters in the US that Mr Markopolos' report contained factual errors and constituted ""market manipulation - pure and simple"", because the investigator stood to profit from short-selling tied to its release. Earlier, GE issued a robust response to Mr Markopolos: ""We remain focused on running our business every day and... will not be distracted by this type of meritless, misguided and self-serving speculation."" The company said it ""stands behind its financials"" and operates to the ""highest-level of integrity"" in its financial reporting. ""Mr Markopolos openly acknowledges that he is compensated by unnamed hedge funds. Such funds are financially motivated to attempt to generate short selling in a company's stock to create unnecessary volatility."" He is best known for alerting regulators in the early 2000s to signs that money manager Bernard Madoff's investment firm was a Ponzi scheme, a deception in which unusually high returns for early investors are generated with money from later investors.  Madoff was arrested in 2008 and later sentenced to 150 years in prison for the fraud."
market volatility,Catcher in the Briny,2024-09-15,2017-12-27,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-42491696,"The Catcher area has cost $1.6bn to bring on-stream. That's 29% under its budget when the investment was approved. Making its announcement on Wednesday morning, Premier Oil wants the first oil, on 23 December, to signal to the market that it is a serious player in getting an offshore field to first oil, and beyond. It starts with 10,000 barrels a day. Once all 19 wells from various fields in the Catcher area are producing, it should hit the target 60,000 barrels per day some time in 2018. To put that in context, UK offshore production has been between 1.4m and 1.9m barrels in the past couple of years. World production is over 90m per day. Happily for Premier Oil, the price of Brent crude oil surged just as it came on-stream, reaching $67 per barrel on very light Christmas trading. Also happily, for the North Sea industry, this coincided with the Forties Pipeline Network being brought back onstream, after three weeks of repairs forced by a crack found at an underground section in Aberdeenshire. It's not up to speed yet, while the new owner, Ineos, limits the flow and pressure. That is estimated to have cost $20m a day in lost production from the 85 fields linked to Forties.  It wasn't much of a catch for Catcher, however, as it is based on a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) model - a rather large ship that bobs in the North Sea, the length of two football pitches, and holding up to 650,000 barrels of oil.  Once full, a tanker can take its contents to Rotterdam or Grangemouth. These developments remind us of five key elements to the North Sea oil and gas story at its present stage 1.  While the 'basin' is in decline, it's enjoying an uptick because of vast investment in recent years, from which new fields continue to come on-stream. 2. Much of the new investment is from smaller companies, such as Premier. While being the producer, it owns half of the Catcher area, and Cairn Energy, based in Edinburgh, owns a fifth. 3. ""Mature"" North Sea hardware is vulnerable to expensive outages as it shows signs of wear and tear. 4. The price of oil remains volatile. The past year has seen Brent crude rise by 17%, much of that in the past two months, after sharp falls from later 2014.  It was buoyed by the Forties Pipeline shutdown. It was raised further in the past three days by an explosion in a Libyan pipeline that has set back that country's hopes of re-establishing a reliable supply despite its continued civil war. 5. That 29% saving on the original budget for Catcher is not unique to Premier. Costs have been tumbling in oil production. So while the price picks itself off the floor of $30, with a steady run through this year in the upper 50s, some oil fields begin to look financially attractive for development. That's certainly true of the onshore fields in the US, where fracking is back. While OPEC, the cartel of oil exporters, a month ago agreed another phase of production cutbacks, in order to put a floor under the price, the American industry can step in with a quick hit of new, fracked production, thus keeping a ceiling on the price. In this, the North Sea has some influence. You could see that from the impact of the Forties Pipeline shut-down on the world price.  But not much influence. Beyond the short-term, offshore producers in the North Sea know that they have to accept the price set by forces controlled far away. What they can control is cost, and more than you might think. An industry survey published earlier this month showed a sharp rise in the extent of collaboration between oil producers, mostly in order to reduce costs. Deloitte found 95% of respondents see collaboration as being built into their business model. Success rates were more modest, at 47%, but they're improving a lot as the industry learns, up from 27% in 2015. As decommissioning efforts are ramped up, around 80% of those involved say collaboration will have to become part of the financial case. And if Catcher looks impressive, consider the case of Johan Castberg, a field with reserves of more than 650 million barrels of oil. It's located to the north of Tromso, off the north of Norway, which has both challenging and controversial elements of Arctic drilling. The original costing was for 100bn Norwegian kroner (£9bn) and breakeven point at a world oil price of $80 per barrel. After re-engineering the thinking, and re-thinking the engineering, the design and putting pressure on suppliers' prices, that initial investment was halved, and it can be profitable at below $35 per barrel.  That's why it got approval from the Statoil board earlier this month, to be a major part of its investment in Norwegian waters through to first oil, scheduled for 2022. Two months ago, Norway's state-controlled driller had an oil find at the Verbier field in the UK sector, and it's investing in drilling off South America.  But it isn't resting on an oily future. At the same time, it's seen a UK offshore wind array opened, invested in solar, and started work on the world's first floating offshore wind array, the Hywind project in the Moray Firth. On the same theme, nor is Royal Dutch Shell sticking with the knitting. It has just bought First Utility, a British energy retailer, signifying a shift into downstream energy and smart grid technology."
market volatility,Bank rules in biggest shake-up in over 30 years,2024-09-15,2022-12-08,By Simon Jack and Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63905505,"The government has announced what it describes as one of the biggest overhauls of financial regulation for more than three decades. It says the package of more than 30 reforms will ""cut red tape"" and ""turbocharge growth"". Rules that forced banks to legally separate retail banking from riskier investment operations will be reviewed. Those were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis when some banks faced collapse. The package of changes, the ""Edinburgh Reforms"", is being presented as an example of post-Brexit freedom to tailor regulation specifically to the needs and strengths of the UK economy.  However, critics say it risks forgetting the lessons of the financial crisis. Between 2007 and 2009 the then-Labour government spent £137bn of public money to bail out banks. Overall, taxpayers have lost £36.4bn on those bailouts, according to the latest estimate from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility. The plans to ease regulations on financial services are being described as another ""Big Bang"" - a reference to the deregulation of financial services by Margaret Thatcher's government in 1986. The government has already announced it will scrap a cap on bankers' bonuses and allow insurance companies to invest in long-term assets such as housing and windfarms to boost investment and help its levelling up agenda. Rules governing how senior finance executives are hired, monitored and sanctioned will be overhauled. There will also be new rules around bundling investments together into tradeable units - a process called securitisation. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the changes would secure ""the UK's status as one of the most open, dynamic and competitive financial services hubs in the world"". The reforms ""seize on our Brexit freedoms to deliver an agile and home-grown regulatory regime that works in the interest of British people and our businesses"". Mr Hunt met bosses of the UK's largest financial services in Edinburgh on Friday to discuss the reforms. While in Edinburgh he was asked whether the reforms risked sowing the seeds of the next financial crash. He said: ""We have learned the lessons of that crash, we put in place some very important guardrails which will remain, but the banks have become much healthier financially since 2008."" However, Labour's shadow City minister Tulip Siddiq said the reforms would bring more risk. ""That this comes after the Tories crashed our economy is beyond misguided,"" adding that the reforms were part of a ""race to the bottom"". Green charity the Finance Innovation Lab said the government ""is taking major risks with the stability of the economy"". ""Weakening the essential protections that were put in place after the global financial crisis is an incredibly dangerous move - they help keep the system stable and our money safe,"" said its chief executive Jesse Griffiths. But Chris Hayward, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, said the reforms would not weaken standards. ""It's a chance to actually grow our economy and I think we should be very excited about it,"" he said. After the financial crisis of 2008, when the government had to spend billions supporting the UK banking system, a new regime was brought in to increase the personal accountability of senior risk-taking staff.  It allowed for fines, bans and even custodial sentences, although there have been very few examples of enforcement.  But City insiders say a major disadvantage it imposes is the lengthy process of getting the movement of senior staff to the UK approved by the regulator - making London less attractive to foreign firms. After the financial crisis, large banks were forced to separate or ""ring fence"" their domestic banking operations - mortgages and loans for example - from their investment banking operations, which expose their own cash to market volatility and were deemed riskier. The cost of having two separate shock-absorbing cushions of spare money was seen by some as placing extra costs on the sector. Most of the big banks have spent billions on this ring fencing and are not calling for its reversal. The reforms of ring fencing are aimed at mid-size banks such as Virgin Money and TSB. The government also re-announced more freedom for the pensions and insurance industry to invest in longer term, illiquid assets - those that are hard to sell quickly such as social housing, windfarms, and nuclear - which the government will say helps their levelling up ambitions. It is worth noting that although this will be billed as a Brexit freedom, the EU is undertaking similar reforms. There was a nod to developing the UK as a centre for crypto assets, but with some caveats given the recent bloodbath after the demise of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Most financial industry leaders say they are crypto curious but do not feel the need to be first on this. ""Let the shipwrecks of others be your seamarks,"" said one.  London's position as the pre-eminent European financial centre has been dented in recent years. The UK's capital city briefly lost its long-time crown of most valuable European stock market to Paris before gains in the pound pushed it narrowly back ahead, while Amsterdam took the title of busiest European share dealing centre.  Leading hedge fund manager Sir Paul Marshall of Marshall Wace recently described the London financial markets as a ""Jurassic Park"" of old-fashioned companies and investors, and it has struggled to attract the world's fastest growing companies to list on UK exchanges, often losing out to New York, Shanghai or even Amsterdam."
market volatility,Isle of Man electricity bills to rise by 30%,2024-09-15,2022-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-60772655,"Electricity prices on the Isle of Man are to rise by 30%, Manx Utilities (MU) has announced. The increase will by applied in two increments of 15%, one in April and then one in July. The price hikes come on the heels of a 27.5% rise in Manx Gas bills, which was approved by Tynwald in October. Current volatility in the global wholesale gas market has been cited as the reason for both electricity and gas price rises. MU had previously warned the rising cost of natural gas, used to produce most of the island's electricity, could lead to an increase of up to 39%. Under MU's agreed pricing strategy, which is linked to inflation, water and sewerage rates will also rise by 5% next month.  Chief Minister Alfred Cannan said prices of oil, gas, petrol, and diesel had ""increased significantly in recent months with further sharp price spikes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine"". ""These rising prices mean that it is going to become considerably more expensive to heat and light our homes, to drive our vehicles, to operate businesses and to run essential public services,"" he added. Mr Cannan said the government-owned electricity provider had worked with the Council of Ministers to ""to determine a way forward that reflects the increased cost of generating electricity, but which also reduces the impact of such a sharp price rise"". The phased increase would ""buy some time"" for the government to better understand the ""longer term implications for the energy markets"" and to consider what broader economic support may be needed, he said. Treasury Minister David Ashford said global volatility would bring a ""substantial increase"" in the cost of living and an assessment of that impact and any necessary action would be presented to Tynwald in April.

market volatility,Will the UK financial chaos spark a wider meltdown?,2024-09-15,2022-10-14,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63221410,"The recent chaos on the UK financial markets has generated waves of stress and selling by investors far beyond the UK. As the sell-offs collide with high inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine, they have raised fears the turmoil in the UK could set off a wider crisis. Many analysts have said they believe the fallout is likely to be limited, especially amid signs that the government is reconsidering some of its plans. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked on Friday, and the government has dropped parts of the package of tax cuts that initially sparked the market turmoil. But the episode has highlighted the financial risks of the current moment. ""Markets are fragile. We have seen vulnerability that's been building over the last decade-plus,"" Fabio Natalucci, a deputy director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said earlier this week, describing the UK episode as a ""warning shot"".  ""That fragility makes the financial risk much more elevated.""  Borrowing costs in the UK shot up last month, triggered by Mr Kwarteng's announcement of £45bn of tax cuts in his mini-budget, which the government said would help reignite economic growth.  But he did not say how he would pay for them, which alarmed investors already worried about the UK's dim economic prospects. They swiftly sold off their holdings of UK government debt, also called bonds or gilts. The sell-off in UK government bonds prompted a dramatic change in their value.  Prices dropped and investors demanded a higher interest rate for holding a riskier investment, creating major volatility in what is usually considered a stable, safe investment.  That kind of swing can have big ripple effects, as investment firms adjust their holdings to cover losses and the increased risk. In the UK, some of the first cracks appeared at pension funds, giant investment firms that manage people's retirement savings and typically put a big chunk towards investments like government debt. Facing losses that were at risk of spiralling, pension funds pleaded for help from the Bank of England, which agreed to step in and buy government debt as an emergency intervention. In fact, the Bank of England ended up stepping in three times. The sudden rise in borrowing costs also meant chaos for the UK housing market, where mortgage rates on typical two and five-year fixed deals have jumped to more than 6% for the first time in over a decade. Analysts expect the rise in mortgage rates to spark a fall in property prices, meaning that another investment often seen as pretty safe is suffering a major, rapid change in value.   Interest rates on some US and European government debt have also jumped alongside the UK's. And as UK firms respond to the changing market, they have dumped some of their riskier assets, creating knock-on effects. For example, selling of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), a term for bundles of corporate debt, jumped in the weeks after the UK announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported. That is a part of the market that some already saw as full of financial risks.   ""There is a general sense of unease in financial markets because we never know where the landmines are buried,"" said economist Barry Eichengreen, professor at the University of California, Berkeley.   ""People are worried about which insurance companies and which pension funds and which bond markets are in a delicate state at the moment and we never know for sure. ""When bad things happen anywhere, people pause and global risk aversion rises."" IMF officials said last week that global financial instability was now verging on crisis levels, as investors pull back. ""We are certainly at a stressed moment,"" said Tobias Adrian, financial counsellor at the IMF warned, noting that indicators of strain, like demand for dollars, have surged. ""The only times when things were worse was in times of acute crisis."" The organisation did not forecast a major financial blow-up, noting that the traditional banking system in major economies like the US and UK has become more resilient in response to regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. But there are more vulnerabilities in emerging markets, where the Fund estimates that 29% of banks are at risk of financial problems in the event of a sudden, serious downturn. In the US and UK, officials are also worried about unknown problems in the large ""shadow banking"" system - where investors develop and trade debt products largely outside the view of regulators. As central banks around the world raise interest rates, those piles of debt may come under strain. ""When we look at the safety and soundness of the financial system... we should look at not only the banks but also the non-bank lenders,"" Ben Bernanke, who led the US central bank during the 2008 financial crisis, warned on Monday. He was speaking at a press conference that was supposed to be about his winning the Nobel prize in economics, but was dominated by questions about the current economic risks. For now, the turmoil stemming from the UK appears to be a ""bump in the road,"" Jamie Dimon, head of US bank colossus JP Morgan said Friday.  But he warned: ""There are going to be other surprises""."
market volatility,UK interest rates cut to lowest level in history,2024-09-15,2020-03-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51962982,"The Bank of England has cut interest rates again in an emergency move as it tries to support the UK economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the second cut in interest rates in just over a week, bringing them down to 0.1% from 0.25%. Interest rates are now at the lowest ever in the Bank's 325-year history. The Bank said it would also increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by £200bn with an effort to lower the cost of borrowing.  It's a dramatic move by Andrew Bailey, who only took over from Mark Carney as Bank of England governor on Monday. Last week, the Bank announced a 0.5% cut in rates to 0.25% and a package of measures to help businesses and individuals cope with the economic damage caused by the virus. The move coincided with additional measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Budget. However, the Bank said the measures it had taken so far were not going to be enough, and believed ""a further package of measures was warranted"". ""The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but should be temporary,"" it added. The move comes as international investors are trying to secure more cash, in particular dollars. This means they're ditching assets such as UK government gilts, which are the ""IOU"" notes the government hands over to private investors willing to lend it money.  As the gilts are sold, the price drops and the yield - the effective interest rate compared to the price - rises. What that means is the cost of borrowing to private investors as well as to the government rises - just when the Bank of England wants it to fall and the government is about to borrow huge sums.  The Bank of England's plan to buy £200bn more bonds is aimed at fighting that effect.  The fresh rate cut takes interest rates to the lowest they can feasibly go, said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group.  ""Lower rates and additional quantitative easing can keep markets satisfied and borrowing costs for both businesses and the government down but unless money is forced into the hands of small businesses soon, then it will be for nothing; they are the ones laying off staff due to a liquidity shock,"" he added. Karen Ward, chief European market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: The support to the economy and health system will require vastly higher government borrowing. The central bank showing willing to buy government debt will ensure the market can absorb this additional issuance without undue stress."" The Bank of England Governor has said today's second emergency rate cut in just over a week occurred after financial markets became ""borderline disorderly"", with fears about coronavirus leading to a rush into the US dollar away from sterling and lending to the UK government. ""We've seen very sharp moves in financial markets in the last few days, which is the pace of which frankly, was increasing very rapidly. And we were moving into conditions that were if not disorderly, frankly, bordering on disorderly let me put it that way,"" Andrew Bailey told journalists.  The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee had an emergency call this morning so that rate cuts and further ""quantitative easing"" could be agreed and announced, with the Bank needing to be ""on the offensive"" because: ""We can't wait for the hard economic data it will be too late by then"", he said.  He said he had seen a range of private forecasts about the economic impact of the current crisis: ""We don't have a precise forecast - every picture we look at has a very sharp V in it"". The governor also partly blamed rumours that appeared to emerge from Westminster of a shutdown to London for adding to the volatility in markets that saw sterling fall 5% against the dollar. Such a shutdown would be likely to impact on the functioning of the City. He said: ""I do have to say that, you know, there were rumours going on the market this time yesterday that there was going to be a lockdown in London. And I'd observe that did cause market prices to start moving around at that point. But I think the government has been clear, and it's clear that that is not the intention at the moment."" The governor also said that he had already intervened to try to get loans to businesses to keep people in employment, and he said the Bank had its thinking cap on as regards further monetary boosts it can make.  He reiterated his lack of enthusiasm for zero or negative interest rates because of their impact on the banking system's capacity to lend, and suggested that was the reason for limiting the cut to an unusual 0.15% (rather than the usual 0.25% or 0.5%) to a record low of 0.1%.  The key Monetary Policy Committee will meet again next week."
market volatility,Moscow stock market reopens for limited trading,2024-09-15,2022-03-21,By Jennifer Meierhans,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60821258,"The Moscow stock exchange has partially reopened after a nearly month-long suspension over the war in Ukraine. Only bonds issued by the Russian government can be traded as part of a phased re-opening of the market.  The exchange closed hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February. Andrei Braginsky, a spokesman for the Moscow Exchange, said he hoped that trading in stocks would be able to start again soon. ""Technically everything is ready, and we are hoping this will resume in the near future,"" he said.  The market reopened at 13:00 (10:00 GMT) but only for OFZ bonds - the Russian acronym for Federal Loan Obligations. In pre-market trading, yields on those government bonds rose by almost 20% - the highest on record. A higher yield means the government will have to pay more to borrow and indicates the investment is more risky. The yield later settled close to 13% after trading began. Central Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Friday the bank would maintain its key interest rate at 20% and would purchase government bonds to limit volatility. Meanwhile, oil prices jumped more than $3 on Monday, with Brent crude climbing above $111 a barrel. Prices moved higher after reports that the EU was considering whether to join the US in imposing an oil embargo on Russia. The European Commission said earlier this month it aimed to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels ""well before 2030"". The invasion of Ukraine, and sanctions imposed by western governments, are taking a toll on the Russian economy. The Russian rouble was steady against the dollar on Monday, trading at 104.83 RUB. However, it is down by about a quarter since the start of the invasion. Some supermarkets are rationing sales of basic goods such as salt and cooking oil. The central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20% four days after the start of Moscow's military action in Ukraine. The continuation of the conflict and ratcheting up of sanctions have undermined confidence further. There have been concerns about Russia defaulting on its debt, but it paid $117 million in interest on two dollar-denominated bonds last week."
market volatility,Bank's £65bn move driven by pension fund panic,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63065415,"The Bank of England stepped in to calm markets after some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse. It pledged to buy £65bn of government bonds after Friday's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged. Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. Pension funds, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn. The Bank said its decision to buy government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability."" The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets. But a collapse in the price of those bonds was forcing some pension funds to sell gilts and assets, further forcing down the price. If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they couldn't pay their debts. To stop this from happening the Bank said it would buy around £65bn of gilts on Wednesday. Joe Dabrowski, deputy director of industry group the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said: ""While this is a complex situation as there has been a lot of volatility in the gilt markets in recent days, we would not expect any significant issues for savers."" This is an immense show of force from the Bank of England trying to calm borrowing markets. It is already having an impact. It also raises some questions. First and foremost it underlines that this is a crisis, with the Bank responding in emergency mode. The clear cause was the chancellor's mini-budget, leading to a loss of market confidence, and spiralling borrowing rates on government debt. That crash in the value of loans to the government threatened to become a ""material risk to financial stability"", says the Bank. Read more here. The Pensions Regulator said it is monitoring financial markets closely for their impact on the funding of defined benefit, or final salary pension schemes, a spokesperson said. ""We welcome steps announced by the Bank of England to restore orderly conditions through temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds,"" the spokesperson added. The pound hit a record low on Monday following the chancellor's mini-budget, which pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth.  The level of government borrowing required had shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances. UK government bond markets and stock markets, which had seen sharp falls, stabilised after the Bank's announcement and the pound also rose slightly. The government has insisted it is standing by its plan despite growing criticism. Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said on Wednesday that its tax cuts were the ""right plans"" to grow the UK economy. He said the Bank of England had ""done their job"" by announcing it would buy government debt to stabilise the economy. It came after the International Monetary Fund openly criticised the government's tax cut plans, warning that the measures were likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis and increase inequality. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""losing control of the economy,""  ""What the government needs to do now is recall Parliament and abandon this budget before any more damage is done,"" he said. While the government says it will not reverse its tax cuts, it has promised to release further plans to boost growth and reduce public debt on 23 November. In a statement, the Treasury said it would continue to work closely with the Bank ""in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives."" Former IMF deputy director Mohamed El-Erian told the BBC's Newsnight that UK policy had been ""incredibly incoherent"", with the government and the Bank of England working at cross-purposes. Meanwhile, chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Philp confirmed on Wednesday that government departments are being asked to find spending cuts. Speaking on ITV's Peston, Mr Philp said government departments are being asked to ""look for efficiencies wherever they can find them"". The efficiencies will ""stick to the targets"" of the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review, Mr Philp said. Any savings will ""enable us to target spending on things that target growth,"" he said. Ministers have not decided whether benefits will rise in line with inflation in the autumn, he added. Mr Philp rejected calls for the OBR report on the mini-budget to be published, saying projections will be held until the 23 November to ensure they are done ""in a way that's organised and thoughtful""."
market volatility,Bitcoin futures trading begins in Chicago,2024-09-15,2017-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42304657,"Bitcoin has begun trading on a major exchange for the first time.  The digital currency launched on the CBOE futures exchange in Chicago at 23:00 GMT Sunday, allowing investors to bet on whether Bitcoin prices will rise or fall.  Its value had surged in the run-up to its futures debut, which saw it rise another 17% to above $18,000. Bitcoin's introduction to the CBOE has been seen by some as a step towards legitimising the currency. The move is expected to be followed next week by a listing on the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CBOE trading saw the Bitcoin futures contract expiring in January start at $15,000 before rising to above $18,000. The contract is based on the price of Bitcoin as quoted on the Gemini exchange. The Gemini exchange was set up by the Winklevoss twins, who were early fans of the crypto-currency and who have been called the first Bitcoin billionaires. A CBOE insider said its start was low key, with ""no champagne"". However, CBOE tweeted to warn that its website was running slowly and could be temporarily unavailable. Anticipation of the first mainstream listings have helped the controversial currency soar past $10,000 and then over $17,000 on Thursday before retreating. The price of Bitcoin stood at about $16,600 on Monday, according to Coindesk.com. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date.  Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value.  Nick Colas, of Data Trek research, said the futures listings gave Bitcoin ""legitimacy - it recognises that it's an asset you can trade"". Chris Ralph, chief investment officer at St James's Place told the BBC's Today programme that he remained cautious about the currency. ""I refuse to use the word legitimate, but it's probably moved out of the shadows into the open,"" he said. ""But what I think it means is more people in the conventional investment banking market will take a look at Bitcoin. ""It has been described as the asset class of 2017 but when we went into the year no one would have called it an asset class."" Bitcoin futures will make it easier for more investors to buy the crypto-currency, by removing the need for them to set up a special digital Bitcoin wallet. Sceptics argue that the CBOE futures will simply draw more naïve investors into perpetuating a bubble in a financial asset that Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz has accused of having no intrinsic value beyond supporting money laundering and tax avoidance. And there is something else that anyone placing big bets on the futures market may want to think about. The eventual payout on their futures contract depends on the auction price at the separate Gemini exchange of the Winklevoss brothers. Are they confident that the auction price cannot be manipulated, in the same way that Libor and regular currency derivatives have been in the recent past? The CBOE and CME launches were made possible following approval by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the regulator has warned investors about the ""potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts"".  The Futures Industry Association, which includes some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages, has criticised the CFTC's decision, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the risks involved. Bitcoin is not regulated by any country's central bank and has no universally recognised exchange rate. CBOE rules suspend trading if Bitcoin prices rise or fall by 10%, in an attempt to reduce wild fluctuations. They kicked in twice in this first session. ""We are committed to continue to work closely with the CFTC to monitor trading and foster the growth of a transparent, liquid and fair Bitcoin futures market,"" CBOE said."
market volatility,A6 Londonderry-Dungiven road to open on Thursday,2024-09-15,2023-04-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65170231,"The new A6 between Londonderry and Dungiven will open later this week, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has said. Work on the road started in 2018 and was due to be completed last autumn but has been beset by delays. On Monday DfI confirmed the 16-mile (25.5km) stretch will open on Thursday, ahead of the Easter holiday. ""This is great news for the 15,000 vehicles using the route each day,"" a DfI spokeswoman said. The opening of the Derry to Dungiven upgrade - part of the A6 road that links Derry and Belfast -  will ""bring long-term benefits for road users and the local community in providing shorter, safer and more reliable journey times,"" she added. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 16-mile section of dual carriageway will include a bypass around Dungiven. It was due to open last autumn and there has been frustration over delays. The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. The DfI spokeswoman added: ""The Road Safety Audit process has been completed and the contractor will commence the process of removing cones and temporary traffic management arrangements on the morning of Thursday 6 April. ""The entire 25.5 kilometres of the road will be open for road users by Thursday afternoon with national speed limit in place"".     She said the opening of the road means the department has invested around £440m in the Derry to Belfast road upgrade. Sinn Féin MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the opening is ""positive news for Derry, Dungiven and the surrounding areas"". ""Not only will this new road cut journey times between Belfast and Derry, it will improve the north west's connection to other parts of the island,"" she said."
market volatility,Are sanctions hitting Iran’s access to medicine?,2024-09-15,2019-08-07,By Anahita Shams & Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49051782,"Iran says sanctions are preventing lifesaving drugs from reaching the country, despite special exemptions for medical supplies.  This is disputed by Washington.   ""The United States exempts medicine and medical devices for the Iranian people from US sanctions,"" says Brian Hook, the American special representative for Iran.  So how are sanctions affecting access to medicines in Iran? Iran produces most of its own basic pharmaceuticals - but when it comes to the most advanced medicines, it relies heavily on imports.  It's estimated that although only about 4% of its medicines come from abroad in terms of volume, the more expensive imported drugs make up about a third of the total value.  There is only limited data on drug imports and prices paid inside Iran but anecdotal evidence can give some idea of the situation. The BBC's Persian Service has heard from its audience about rising costs of medicines.  A sufferer of Crohn's disease described the difficulties of accessing vital drugs. ""I have to travel to other towns and cities to check if their pharmacies have the drugs,"" they said. ""Some of them do but the prices are so high that I cannot afford them."" The BBC also spoke to a pharmaceutical importer from inside Iran who said the past two years had brought shortages and price rises. Drugs for anaesthetics, cancer-treatment and diabetes were particularly hard to find, they said. In the past 12 months, the cost of health and medical services rose by 19%, according to official Iranian statistics. But these shortages and price increases could be for many reasons, not only as a consequence of sanctions against Iran. International sanctions were lifted in 2016 following an agreement with Iran over its nuclear programme, but in November 2018 the United States reinstated ""the toughest ever"" sanctions on Iranian industry and banks. It threatened heavy punishment and exclusion from the US financial system for foreign companies seeking to circumvent these restrictions.   However, exporters of humanitarian supplies such as medicines and medical devices - and the companies facilitating this trade - should not be punished by the US for doing business with Tehran.  ""The problem is that you need to find banks willing to keep open the business lines and compliance functions to process those transactions,"" says Richard Nephew, an expert on US sanctions.  ""Often, they're seen as not worth the headache... so there is a practical problem in getting banks to do it.  But can they?  Sure.""  Also, not all medicines or medical devices qualify for the exemption.    ""Trading humanitarian goods and processing payments with Iran remains complex,"" says Justine Walker, director of sanctions policy at UK Finance, which represents British banks.  ""Legally, medicines are not prohibited under sanctions. However, they do become prohibited if they are found to be going to a designated actor or entity."" These include Iran's major banks.  Official Iranian figures seen by BBC News show a snapshot of the past 16 months of overall Iranian imports of medical drugs and devices.  These imports reached a peak of $176m (£145m) in September 2018, then fell significantly.   By June 2019, imports of medical supplies had fallen by 60% to about $67m. This fall coincides with the imposition of US sanctions but the data is limited and it's not possible to say with any certainty that sanctions are responsible. There is also data available from the EU, a key trading partner with Iran. Since sanctions were imposed in November last year, medical and pharmaceutical sales to Iran fell at first before rising slightly in May.  This followed a period when trade in medical supplies fluctuated, reaching a peak in 2016 (when international sanctions were lifted) and then falling in the following two years. Navigating new regulations and incurring extra costs, for example by changing banks, makes trade with Iran ""daunting for smaller firms"", says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of Bourse & Bazaar, which tracks Iran's economy. The lack of foreign currency inside Iran and the volatility of the Iranian currency also make imports more expensive.  Iran has been calling for the urgent implementation of a proposed European plan to support companies wishing to bypass US financial restrictions. But this has proven complex and politically difficult to implement.   Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
market volatility,UK petrol price hits fresh record above £1.50,2024-09-15,2022-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60554128,"Fuel prices have hit record highs in the UK as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect global oil prices. The RAC said the average price of petrol jumped to £1.51 a litre on Sunday, while diesel increased to £1.55. The price of both fuels has jumped since Thursday, when Russia began its assault on Ukraine. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said despite oil prices calming, prices at the pump will continue to rise. The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with unleaded petrol is now £83, or £85 for diesel. ""This week will be an important one in terms of the oil price as it's likely to reveal the speed of the inevitable upward trend or the extent of the volatility in the market,"" said Mr Williams. The price of Brent crude rose by 4.6% to $102 barrel on Monday after Western nations imposed new sanctions on Russia - one the world's largest energy producers. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because fuel, like oil is traded in dollars. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it would still be affected by global wholesale prices rising. UK consumers are already paying a high price for fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Steve Irwin, from fuel consultancy firm Portland, told the BBC that prices had risen due to concerns over oil and gas pipelines which travel through Ukraine and carry Russian products. He said there was ""potential for enormous supply disruption"" if Russia retaliated to sanctions and used oil ""as a weapon"". ""It's impossible to know what kind of trajectory we are looking at for oil prices over the coming weeks,"" he said. However, Mr Irwin added that price was a bigger concern than supply currently, as the US and Saudi Arabia are also huge oil exporters. Mandy Watts depends on her car for work, but thinks ""the cost of petrol has gone through the roof"". Going carless isn't an option for Mandy, but she is trying to use it less. ""Being a single parent as well, you have to think about these things,"" she told the BBC. ""Is it petrol, is it food, is it heating, what do you put first? Food and heating has to come before petrol. So I tend to limit a little bit where I go now."" Robert Halfon, a former Conservative minister, has called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to look at reducing VAT or fuel duty, which has been frozen for 12 years. He told the Times: ""Given what is going on it is genuinely going to be unaffordable for most families. It isn't just for motorists, it's businesses too because they can't afford transportation costs and things like that."" Luke Bosdet, fuel spokesman for the AA, said the rise in fuel costs came at the same time as households were facing energy bill rises. ""To think that, less than two years ago, fuel at £1 a litre beckoned,"" he said.  ""If there is a silver lining, the predictions of 160p or even 170p-a-litre fuel now look exaggerated as the oil price fell back after one day's surge last week."""
market volatility,'Surprise' pick-up in UK house prices,2024-09-15,2021-03-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56250728,"House price growth rebounded last month with the average value hitting a record high of £231,068, according to the   Nationwide. Prices were up 6.9% from a year before, compared with 6.4% in January, it said. ""This increase is a surprise,"" said the Nationwide's Robert Gardner, as price growth had been expected to slow ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday. The holiday is due to end on 31 March although there have been reports it could be extended. The stamp duty holiday means the tax has been suspended on the first £500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland since July.  There has also been some relief from the equivalent taxes for property buyers in Scotland and Wales - which is also set to end on 31 March. An announcement on any changes in stamp duty could come in this week's Budget.  A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits buy a property ladder is set to be announced in the Budget. The government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have ""virtually disappeared"" during the pandemic, the Treasury says. The Nationwide said house prices rose by 0.7% month-on-month, after taking account of seasonal effects, reversing the 0.2% monthly decline recorded in January. However, it added that the outlook for the housing market was particularly uncertain right now, and the market could slow because of the employment situation. Many workers remain on furlough, and some of those jobs may not return. Rival lender the Halifax said last month that the economic realities of 2021 meant activity would slow as the year progressed. Mr Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ""It may be that the stamp duty holiday is still providing some forward momentum, especially given the paucity of properties on the market at present. ""Shifts in housing preferences may also be providing a more significant boost to demand, despite the uncertain economic outlook. ""Many peoples' housing needs have changed as a direct result of the pandemic, with many opting to move to less densely populated locations or property types, despite the sharp economic slowdown and the uncertain outlook."" Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy, said he had been forecasting a fall in house prices this year, but the Nationwide numbers have prompted a rethink. ""Our forecast for house prices to drop by about 2% this year now looks too downbeat, though we'll wait for details of the guarantee scheme to be released before providing new numbers."" However, Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital, said: ""Reduced stamp duty is not the only driver of house price growth since the strictest lockdown conditions were removed in 2020.  ""We also have cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which gives buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners.  ""There is also the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to put their money in a stable asset with low volatility. These trends are likely to hold up throughout 2021."""
market volatility,Why a problem of plenty is hurting India's farmers,2024-09-15,2017-06-07,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40184788,"Farmers are on the boil again in India. In western Maharashtra state, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in southern Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop. The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.  Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to India's GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty.  In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived. In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops - the government sets prices for farming in India and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of India's controversial withdrawal of high value banknotes  - popularly called demonetisation - late last year.  The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers ""begged and borrowed"" from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.  So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Mr Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.  ""Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say there's not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash."" A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asia's biggest onion market in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of India's annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were ""exaggerated"".  ""There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways,"" Manoj Kumar Jain said. Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crises actually rooted in India's chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. ""If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers,"" Ashok Gulati, an agriculture specialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, told me. Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.  In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.   In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4C. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee (less than a US cent)  for every kilogram of onion a month.  So the government needs to make sure - or even subsidise - to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. ""We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasn't been able to make that happen,"" Dr Gulati said. For one, India just doesn't have enough cold storages.  There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers. Secondly, there's not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops don't perish or go waste.  Take onions, again.  One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of India's fruit and vegetables is processed. Thirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.  If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales. ""You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last year's prices,"" says Dr Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul.  Punjab, India's ""granary"", is a perfect example.  At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater.   Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability. ""They [the policies] are distorting the choices that farmers make - those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing  wheat we no longer need,"" says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.  But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers' suffering.  Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes - and announce a controversial farm loan waiver - and quell a simmering farmers' revolt .  The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same. "
market volatility,"UK economic outlook has deteriorated, Bank warns",2024-09-15,2022-07-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62049990,"The economic outlook for the UK and the rest of the world has ""deteriorated materially"", the Bank of England has warned. Energy and fuel costs are rising rapidly around the world, pushing up prices in general more quickly. However, UK banks are in a position to weather even a severe economic downturn, the Bank said. It told banks to keep more money in rainy day funds to ensure they can weather any storm. The Bank's comments came in its latest Financial Stability Report. International forecasters such as the IMF and OECD have said Britain is more susceptible to recession and persistently high inflation than other Western countries, all of which are grappling with energy and commodity market shocks. While the Bank said the UK's banking sector was well-placed to cope with a severe downturn, it said banks must increase the amount of money they set aside to absorb shocks. Starting a year from now, banks will be required to set aside a sum equal to 2% of their assets as a buffer, as opposed to the normal 1%. The Financial Policy Committee said it could vary the rate in either direction depending on how the global economy pans out. Households have come under increasing pressure in recent months, as energy, food and fuel prices soar. In April, domestic energy bills jumped after the price cap was increased by 54% to £1,971 for the average household. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Experts believe this could rise again in October, to around £2,800, which could help to push inflation up to more than 11% later this year. ""Commodity price volatility following the Russian invasion of Ukraine has further exacerbated price pressures facing households and businesses, and has had implications for the financial system,"" the Bank said. Some households could struggle with debt. About 80% of mortgages are currently on fixed interest rates, but some 40% of these are set for renewal this year or next, which could push up costs for these households. ""Tighter financial conditions and reduced real incomes will weigh on debt affordability for households, businesses and governments in many countries, increasing the risks from global debt vulnerabilities,"" the Bank said. However, despite increasing pressure on household budgets, the Bank said financial institutions were resilient to debt vulnerabilities among households and businesses. The pound also lowered 1.6% against the dollar and hit a two-year low on Tuesday.  Another surge in gas prices in Europe and the UK which could push inflation higher again, has added to fears the economy could slide into a recession.  It says something about the lengths that have been gone to over the past 15 years to shore up the resilience of the banking system that it looks, according to this report, comfortably able to withstand not only the biggest economic contraction in 300 years over the pandemic, but also stagflation and the highest inflation in four decades. It's more households and small firms, rather than the financial sector, that are vulnerable at the moment.  The Financial Policy Committee said that households' debts haven't shot up - yet - in response to the cost of living crisis, and it also takes the view that the proportion of households who spend a large portion of their incomes on servicing debts will remain manageable, in spite of rising interest rates, because of the package of help from the government.  Its members are similarly sanguine about the effect on small businesses, acknowledging they could be hit by falling demand from households with declining real incomes, but forecasting that it would ""take large increases in borrowing costs"" to impair their ability to service their debts. Let's hope the committee's optimism isn't misplaced. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank's verdict seems to be that ""the situation isn't as quite as bad as previous crises"". ""Consumers might be coping with the biggest hikes in prices in four decades but compared to the months before the 2008 financial crisis hit, households aren't as likely to dig themselves deeper into more debt,"" she said. ""The escalating cost-of-living crisis is so stark that the government has already moved to pledge more support to those on lower incomes facing sky-high energy bills."" She added that the Bank ""expects businesses on the whole to struggle on"". While many firms were struggling with supply chain challenges and weakening consumer demand, ""overall it's going to take a much larger shock to see a domino collapse of companies unable to pay their debts"", Ms Streeter added."
market volatility,How does Brexit affect the pound?,2024-09-15,2019-01-15,By Howard Mustoe,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46862790,"During the past three years, the pound has had a rough time of things when it comes to its price against the dollar and other currencies. The immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum saw sterling decline sharply in value. And as the vote on the UK's withdrawal deal from the European Union looms, further volatility is expected. Since June 2016, holidays and imported goods have become more expensive, but UK exports have been cheaper.  It's a complex picture, though.  Exporters, such as carmakers, are importers themselves, buying in raw materials such as oil or copper.  While Britons living abroad but drawing a UK pension have suffered as the pound has declined. Since 1992, the pound has floated freely on currency markets, meaning that traders - buyers and sellers - determine what it's worth. When the pound rises in value, more of the currency is being bought. When it goes down, more is sold.  ""A free-floating currency is a very good thing, because it works as a safety valve,"" says Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. After the global financial crisis, countries whose economies suffered had weaker currencies. ""Countries in the eurozone such as Greece and Spain had a strong euro they couldn't devalue,"" or reduce in value, she added, and for them, the safety valve was wage cuts. ""The downside is when it comes on the back of political uncertainty,"" she said. ""Goods become more expensive."" In recent years, traders have been looking at politics, rather than economic data, which means faster trading, and a faster pace of change in the price. That's the volatility traders talk about. ""If you think abut political uncertainty being bad, the worst outcome is a hard Brexit,"" says Ms Foley, because details of what will happen under those circumstances are so scarce.  ""If that's the worst case scenario, it [the pound] will rally if hard Brexit seems unlikely."" Similarly, talk of putting Brexit on hold has boosted the pound, as it gives businesses more room to plan, she says.  A softer Brexit could be good news for savers, according to CIBC's head of foreign exchange strategy, Jeremy Stretch. Currency experts think that a softer Brexit could provide a boost to the economy by providing confidence and certainty to companies and consumers who in turn may decide to spend more or take on more staff.  That increased economic activity could prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates, boosting returns for savers.  ""We could see an interest rate hike come the May meeting of the Bank of England, although it may be the case that they wait until August,"" according to Mr Stretch. ""Moving towards a softer Brexit would help to alleviate the uncertainty that was impacting the economy in the latter stages of 2018."" ""Certainly since 2016, sterling is weaker,"" says Ms Foley. ""Our wealth overseas has lessened."" At the bureau de change, rates will be even worse than those on the financial market.  That reflects their business costs including rent, staff, security and having lots of money ready. And if you buy your notes at the airport, convenience. BBC research shows that travellers have seen bureau de change rates fall in recent months as the pound as suffered against other currencies.  But the value of the pound is always reflected in the price of another currency.  Which means that since the referendum there are some currencies against which sterling has performed better, notably the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso. Interest rates and money-printing can also have an effect. Higher interest rates, and therefore returns, may attract more foreign buyers, which pushes up the value of the currency.  Printing money, either literally or through the bond-buying programmes known as quantitative easing, has historically reduced the value of a currency by increasing its supply. But sometimes the effects can be minor. Another factor is the UK's current account deficit, says Jane Foley. That's where imports exceed the value of a nation's exports. A simple way of thinking about it is a deficit of savers, she says. ""We need foreign savers to make up the shortfall. If they don't like what they see, they are more likely to pull their money out."" That means selling pounds and a cheaper currency. ""If we had a surplus, we would not be as vulnerable,"" she says. It explains why the pound is more volatile - why trading happens at a faster rate - than the yen. Japan has much domestic wealth to draw upon. Companies may buy currencies for a variety of reasons. A company wanting to buy a UK-based rival will need lots of sterling to do so. It may have to sell dollars or euros and buy sterling.  Likewise, a company wanting to pay shareholders a slice of profits may need to bring UK sales home. They will sell their pounds. Then you have traders who think they know something others don't. They will make bets on the market, or speculation. ""Customers I see are corporate customers who may have to buy energy, grain or some other component,"" says Ms Foley. ""They have a natural need. It's an easy mistake thinking it's just speculators, making a quick buck."" Events will determine how the pound performs in the short term, until some sort of resolution for Britain's departure from the EU comes about, said Ms Foley.  The vote on Prime Minster Theresa May's Brexit deal will probably be the next event. Market-watchers have typically mixed views. ""The pound will react to the extent and manner of the government's likely defeat in the vote, with a heavier defeat more likely to push down on an exchange rate that has already depreciated a great deal,"" said Gregory Thwaites, research director at WorldRemit and previously Head of International Research at the Bank of England.  ""In the unlikely event that the deal is passed, sterling will be likely to rally."" ""Should the withdrawal act be ratified on Tuesday, sterling will probably surge about 5% in value against the US dollar, but if December's failed attempt is anything to go by then the chances look slim,"" said Simon Harvey, market analyst at Monex Europe. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: ""It is expected that the bill will be voted down, but this won't be the most significant factor influencing the pound's direction, it's what will happen next."" He says options as diverse as a no-confidence vote in the government, an extension of Article 50, a new general election and a second referendum could mean very different things for the pound. ""As of now, investors seem to be on wait-and-see mode."""
market volatility,Why currency crash does not worry Turkey's Erdogan,2024-09-15,2021-12-03,By Ozge Ozdemir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59487912,"Turkey's national currency has plummeted 45% against the dollar this year and yet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doesn't seem all that bothered. The lira has flirted with record lows this week, but Turkey's long-time leader is pressing ahead with his ""economic war of independence"", backed up by low interest rates. So why is Mr Erdogan pushing a model that critics warn risks soaring inflation, higher unemployment and poverty, and what does it mean for Turks? The simple reason for the Turkish lira's collapse is his unorthodox economic policy of keeping interest rates low to boost Turkey's economic growth and export potential with a competitive currency. For many economists, if inflation goes up you control it by raising interest rates. But Mr Erdogan sees interest rates as ""an evil that make the rich richer and the poor poorer"". ""Everything is so expensive,"" Sevim Yildirim told the BBC at a local fruit market. ""It's impossible even to cook a main course for a family with these prices."" Annual inflation has surged above 21% in Turkey, but the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, overhauled by Mr Erdogan, has just lowered interest rates from 16% to 15%, the third cut this year.  Inflation is rising around the world, and central banks are talking about hiking interest rates. But not here, because Mr Erdogan believes ultimately inflation will fall. In the past two years he has sacked three central bank presidents and only this week replaced his finance minister. And so the lira continues to drop. Turkey's economy is heavily dependent upon imports for producing goods from foods to textiles, so the rise of the dollar against the lira has a direct impact on the price of consumer products. Take the tomato, a vital ingredient in Turkish cuisine. To grow tomatoes, producers need to buy imported fertilisers and gas. Tomato prices were up 75% in August, compared with the year before, according to the chamber of commerce in the south coast agricultural hub of Antalya. ""How can we make money out of this?"" asks Sadiye Kaleci, who farms grapes in Pamukova, a small town three hours' drive from Istanbul. ""We sell cheap, but buying costs are expensive,"" she complains, citing high costs of diesel, fertiliser and sulphur, which is thrown on the vines. Another farmer, Feride Tufan, complains the only way she can get by is by selling her assets: ""We can pay off our debt by selling our land and vineyards. But when we sell everything, we'll have nothing left."" The currency has become so volatile that prices are changing daily. Inflation for producers alone is up 50%. ""I've cut down on all my expenses,"" says Hakan Ayran, out shopping at a market. ""To pay the bills everybody eats less and nobody buys stuff.""  Supermarket employees post price hikes on social media, showing before and after labels for products. They range from margarine (above) and olive oil to tea, coffee, detergent and toilet paper. A bakery in Turkey's third city, Izmir, put up a sign explaining its higher prices by listing surging costs of ingredients such as flour, oil and sesame, signing off with the message: ""May God be with us."" Foreign currency debt is a problem for the private sector and most companies have found it is more profitable to hold products in storage rather than sell them, because of the lira's volatility and inflation. It all adds up to more poverty and a widening gap in income and wealth equality. Queues form outside petrol stations and outside local government offices offering cheap bread.  And opposition parties have called for snap elections and rallies. When the lira slumped 18% in one day on 23 November, there were small protests and dozens of arrests. But the most visible display of public dissent is among younger Turks on Twitter, Twitch live streams, TikTok videos and YouTube. ""I am not happy with this government at all. I cannot see a future for myself in this country,"" one young person told a reporter from a YouTube channel. One in five young people in Turkey is out of work; it is even worse among women. Turkey has the world's fourth highest rate of youth not in employment, education or training, according to the OECD. Turkey's youth compare their living standards with those in other countries and do not like what they see.  ""For a young person in the US or Europe, it's easy to buy an iPhone with their salary,"" says one 18-year-old. ""Even if I work for months and months, I cannot afford it. I don't deserve that."" This generation is poised to play an important role in politics in Turkey, ruled by Mr Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) since 2002. Almost nine million Turks born since the late 1990s will be eligible to vote in the next election in 2023 and that could spell trouble for the AKP. One video that went viral showed a mother praising President Erdogan to a reporter, while her eight-year-old son contradicted her, pointing out his poor handling of recent disasters. The ruling party's success was partly down to a flood of foreign funding after the 2008 financial crisis. But much of Turkey's economic growth came from government spending and lending that favoured the construction industry. As a result production continues to depend on imports and the economy is at the mercy of currency  fluctuations. Few hold out hope of Mr Erdogan's new economic model coming to the rescue of the Turkish lira.  Amid such uncertainty, economist Arda Tunca says all bets are off for what happens next. ""This is the first time we're using a model completely beyond economic theory. Even when there were crises we could guess what would happen. Now it's impossible,"" he said."
market volatility,Global food prices fall for fifth month in a row,2024-09-15,2022-09-02,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62769675,"The UN's Food Prices Index has fallen for the fifth month in a row, in a sign that one of the main pressures pushing up the cost of living around the world could ease. The index fell to 138 in August and is now lower than it was before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The countries were both major exporters of crops including sunflower oil, corn and wheat. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation says July's UN backed deal to re-open Ukrainian ports has eased cereal and vegetable oil prices. That has meant more supplies have been able to reach international markets. The FAO's Erin Collier told the BBC that ""prices came down for a mix of reasons"". Cereals have been the ""main driver"" of this year's growth in food prices, but Ms Collier explained supplies are now increasing because ""the harvest looks a little bit better, especially in Canada, the US and Russia"". All three are major exporters of wheat. For other food categories, ""an easing of export restrictions helped bring down sugar and oil prices, and weaker demand for certain products helped bring down meat and dairy prices"", added Ms Collier. Indonesia's temporary reduction in export taxes on palm oil has meant food manufacturers have had more options for the vegetable oils they use in huge quantities.  The cost of food has been one of the biggest contributors to inflation around the world. This week the Eurozone reported inflation was running at an annualised rate of 9.1% in August. Energy was the biggest contributor with increases of 38.3% but unprocessed food was next at 10.9%. The most recent inflation figures from the UK and the US paint a similar picture. The FAO index, a closely watched barometer, also showed that there were falls in the cost of its other food categories: dairy, meat and sugar. It said beef and other bovine product prices ""declined on weak domestic demand in some leading exporting countries"", perhaps reflecting that consumers are switching to cheaper alternatives. ""Growing concerns of a recession have led to fears that demand for foods like corn, meat, vegetable oils and other products will fall"", according to Kona Haque, head of research at the agricultural commodities firm ED&F Man. However, because of ongoing supply chain problems and the time it takes for price change to filter through, Ms Haque said that not all countries will feel the benefit of these lower prices immediately.  The FAO index has fallen sharply from March's record high of 159.7 but remains 10 points above where it was a year ago. Price volatility has increased according to Ms Haque, who cited recent heatwaves in Europe and floods in Pakistan as examples of the increasing influence of extreme weather on crops prices. This week Ukraine's agriculture minister Mykola Solsky warned forthcoming harvests would suffer because of the war. The area for planting wheat and barley for next year's harvest is set to fall at least 20% because of the Russian invasion. The Ukrainian Agrarian Council also says a lack of funds will lower production.  Ms Collier cautioned that even after these recent falls global food prices remain higher than during the 2011 peak.  ""There's a lot of factors at play right now that are still keeping prices high,"" she said. Those include soaring energy prices which mean that fertiliser remains very expensive for farmers, as well as ""supply uncertainty"".  ""Even though [some of] Ukraine's ports have opened that remains a very tentative situation, and the volumes are still quite small. We need to see those volumes increase to help bring prices down more""."
market volatility,Price inflation: Lumpy and sticky,2024-09-15,2023-07-10,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66158714,"Harsh medicine for inflation does not have the same effect everywhere. Those who depend most on borrowing are those most affected by rising interest rates. That can most affect those in the early years of home ownership - typically young families, at a time of life when finances are already stretched. So the Bank of England's policy, fully supported by government and being reaffirmed by the central bank governor at a dinner on Monday - ""it is crucial we see this job through"" - is to put a chill on demand within the economy in the hope that it snuffs out inflation. By international standards, that's not going well. The UK has higher price inflation than comparable large economies, and core inflation, excluding the more volatile and international effects of energy and food, is rising. There are several reasons for that. Andrew Bailey's speech highlights the problem of unemployment. He doesn't say it in so many words, but the implication is clear, that unemployment simply isn't high enough to cause workers to moderate their wage demands.  Inflation is proving ""sticky"": ""Both price and wage increases at current rates are not consistent with the inflation target"". This is also due to the structure of housing finance, which has changed in recent decades and means that the financial pain, which is an intended consequence of higher interest rates, takes longer to feed through to spending and investing behaviour.  In turn, that slow effect on inflation means interest rates going higher and staying there for longer than previously foreseen. Only with price stability, argues Andrew Bailey, can the UK economy thrive, and only then can people ""trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value"". Those who do not depend on borrowed money are, obviously, less affected, and they are generally the more affluent households. In response to that, one former member of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England, suggested this weekend that monetary policy (interest rate rises) should be aligned with at least temporary tax increases designed to spread the pain a bit more evenly. ""We're asking monetary policy to do all the work,"" Kate Barker told the Financial Times. ""We ought to be doing more of the work of driving out inflation by putting taxes up on the better-off."" Specifically? ""Income tax."" It may be that imbalance goes for parts of the UK as well.  The latest snapshot of the private sector across the nations and regions points to markedly different performance of the economy around the UK. The Purchasing Managers Index tells us the balance of how companies are getting on, when asked about a range of indicators: output, orders, backlogs of work, exports, recruitment and so on.  For June, Scotland comes out of it relatively well. Output was rising in the May figures, but it is now rising more strongly.  That puts it behind only London and south-east England in this measure of output, and a long way adrift from the negative figures for the south-west, East Midlands, north-east England and especially Wales. New orders tell a similar story, according to these figures from Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest, with Scotland second only to London.  Yet, confidence about the future does not reflect that: it's been slipping in most parts of the UK, and Scottish firms last month had relatively low levels of confidence about growth over the next 12 months. Only Northern Ireland and north-east England were more downbeat. The issue that's been causing most concern across business, as with the government and Bank of England, has been rising prices. Input costs continue to rise for the vast majority of firms in this regular and wide-ranging survey, but that increase seems to be easing. However, it's a mixed picture. Scotland is behind only London in companies' perception of rising input costs. The prices then charged to customers are also still on the rise. That rate of increase has also been easing, but last month remained greater in Scotland than any nation or region other than London, the south-east and the north-east of England. Northern Ireland was found to have the least problem with rising input costs, and was passing on costs to customers at the lowest rate. That might have something to do with its increased integration into the European economy through seamless trade across the border with Ireland, while Brexit effects on the labour market and trade frictions contribute to a range of inflationary pressures on the British mainland. These figures provide only one month's snapshot. They offer the balance of business opinion, rather than gauging how bad or good it looks on either side of the balance.   The ordering of nations and regions can change. All of them face difficulties with price inflation, the tight labour market and economic uncertainty. But it offers some indication of the effect of economic policy being seen least in those parts of the country that are already relatively well off.  Most recent measures suggest Scotland's income per head trails only London, the south-east and east of England. Its property market is not given to the same volatility as England's and especially London's, so the impact of interest rates on house prices is more subdued.  The Halifax house price index, published on Friday, shows UK average house prices falling by 2.6% in the year to June - the third month of seeing that annual comparison going negative. Scotland's house prices went into the red for the first time in three years, but with a reduction of only 0.1% over the year. That's nowhere near enough of a fall for many of those with rising rents who would like to get on the housing ladder. But it continues both to reflect and to drive confidence about the economy more widely."
market volatility,Power NI electricity prices to fall by 10%,2024-09-15,2022-10-14,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63256308,"Power NI customers will see electricity prices fall by 10% from the start of November as a result of the energy price cap. The cap will more than reverse a 60% increase which would have applied from the same date. This cap sets the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge domestic households for each unit of energy they use. It has been in place in other parts of the UK since the start of October. It will apply to all electricity and gas suppliers in Northern Ireland from the start of November. Customers in Northern Ireland who saw prices rises in October will receive some form of rebate so they are on an equal footing with people in GB. Power NI is the largest electricity supplier in Northern Ireland, with about 471,000 domestic customers which is more half of all connections. Power NI last changed its prices in July when it put them up by 27.5%; that followed a 21.4% increase in January William Steele, Director, Power NI Customer Solutions, said: ""As many customers will already be aware, the UK Government has announced a major intervention into the energy market called the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG).  ""This means that from 1 November 2022, energy bill support will be provided to Northern Ireland residential customers, by reducing the underlying cost of electricity.  ""Although we now must substantially increase our underlying price to reflect the current market, the implementation of the EPG will mean our customers will see a reduction in their billed tariff level of 10%.""  The NI Utility Regulator said with the cap in place the typical Power NI customer's bill will be 38% lower than the equivalent in Great Britain and 48% lower than the equivalent in the Republic of Ireland. ""Further tariff reviews for all suppliers are likely given the ongoing volatility of wholesale prices and the effect of changes to the EPG discount - the latter to be announced by the UK Government every three months going forward,"" John French, Chief Executive of the Regulator added. ""Separate to the energy price guarantee support, we are working with the UK Government and local energy suppliers to ensure that the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme payment is paid to Northern Ireland consumers as soon as possible."""
market volatility,Fact-checking Liz Truss at PMQs,2024-09-15,2022-10-19,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/63316608,"Liz Truss apologised and admitted to having ""made mistakes"" as she faced MPs at Prime Minister's Questions. It follows weeks of turmoil on the markets after her government's mini-budget and the subsequent U-turns over most of its key measures. The prime minister defended her record though, making claims about government support on energy bills, the economy and the NHS.   We've examined them.  Ms Truss has used this figure repeatedly since announcing the Energy Price Guarantee, but the duration of this support scheme has now been scaled back meaning the figure is no longer certain.  When it was announced on 8 September, there was a cap on the price of a unit of energy until 2024.  A government press release on this date said: ""From 1st October, a new 'Energy Price Guarantee' will mean a typical UK household will now pay up to an average £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years."" But on 17 October, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the scheme would be scaled back, to six months (with a review to decide what support to offer after that). The cap will now only cover prices up to April 2023 and, at the moment, we do not know how much people will be paying per unit of energy after that. So the government needs a new calculation for typical bills. Until they come up with one, they can't say with any certainty that the typical household won't be paying more than £2,500.  Therese Coffey has announced a plan for patients, with measures on backlogs and waiting times.  But the pandemic didn't create the NHS backlog, it already existed. Covid-19 made it worse. As of August 2022, the NHS backlog - the number of people waiting for NHS treatment in England - stood at around seven million. According to the British Medical Association, ""demand for hospital treatment was outstripping capacity even before the pandemic"".  Its figures show that just before the pandemic in February 2020, the NHS backlog already stood at 4.43 million people.  NHS rules state that patients needing non-urgent treatment should not wait any longer than 18 weeks to be seen by a healthcare professional.  Prior to the pandemic, figures show that 17% of people were waiting longer than this time, compared with 36% of people in December 2021.  The prime minister said this after being accused by Labour of ""crashing the economy"" and causing people's monthly mortgage payments to go up by hundreds of pounds. But she didn't mention the mini-budget. Interest rates have been rising around the world and there are gloomy forecasts about the world economy from organisations such as the International Monetary Fund.  But her government's mini-budget of 23 September - with its £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - also had a significant impact on the UK. In a letter on Tuesday, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe said: ""there has been a particular increase in volatility in UK markets"" and pointed out that: ""the five largest daily moves in the 30 year inflation-linked gilt, in data that dates back to 2000, have all been since the 23 September"". You can see that in this chart of borrowing costs for G7 countries. It shows the increases in government borrowing costs since 1 September, the spike after the 'fiscal event' or mini-budget and the cost coming back down as measures were reversed. These borrowing costs have fed into things like higher mortgage rates for homebuyers and had an adverse impact on the pensions sector which forced the Bank of England to step in with a £65bn support scheme. We've looked in more detail at how far the mini-budget caused the ensuing market chaos in this piece. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

market volatility,Why did Man Utd not sign anyone?,2024-09-15,2018-08-09,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45133827,"This video can not be played I am going to enjoy this season - Mourinho Speaking to Manchester United's own TV station following a 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich on 5 August, Jose Mourinho said his side would face ""a difficult season"" unless they signed at least one more player. At the time, United boss Mourinho was confident a new central defender would be recruited. It did not happen. Despite late excitement over a move for Uruguay's Diego Godin, which, it subsequently transpired, had fizzled out earlier in the week virtually as soon as it had been made, Mourinho's squad remains as it was on 4 July when Lee Grant arrived from Stoke as United's third-choice keeper. Thirty-six hours before the 2018-19 Premier League was set to begin - United welcome Leicester to Old Trafford on Friday night - Mourinho was asked if he had the ""tools to compete"" with Manchester City and Liverpool. ""I know the words you want me to say,"" he said. ""I think by the end of November, December you won't need words, you will see by then which teams are candidates to win the Premier League."" Does that mean there is trouble ahead for Manchester United? In short, they couldn't do the right deal. The confidence Mourinho expressed about United getting an additional signing on 31 July during the club's pre-season tour of the United States was based around multiple targets. They ranged from Leicester's Harry Maguire to Barcelona's Yerry Mina (who subsequently joined Everton), via seasoned internationals Jerome Boateng and - briefly - Godin. United have the money to do big deals. They were prepared to do exactly that to get a top player. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward would not have flinched had he been told £100m, a sum that would have smashed both United's club record transfer fee and the world record for a defender, was the price to be paid for for the right man. Why it is dangerous to write off Jose Mourinho - Shearer Mourinho warns of 'difficult season' But the right man never materialised. Over the course of a lengthy meeting between United and Real Madrid top brass in Miami last month, Raphael Varane never became a discussion topic because it was obvious the Champions League winners would not have sold him. Talks about Maguire never progressed beyond the outline stage because, with no need to sell and secure in the knowledge the England man had four years left on his contract, Leicester were pushing the price upwards, to the level Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk. For a man with no Champions League experience and still relatively new to the Premier League, United did not think entering the market at that level was wise. Raphael Varane played every minute of France's World Cup-winning campaign Godin's class is not in question either. The 32-year-old remains one of the best defenders in the world. Encouraged to go for the Uruguayan in the final days of the window, United discovered they were being used as leverage to net Godin a better contract extension from Atletico Madrid, so another door closed. Jerome Boateng was offered by Bayern Munich for about £40m. Mourinho was keen on the former Manchester City man. United, having analysed Boateng's awful appearance record - 33 games missed through injury and illness in two seasons - proposed a loan. Boateng and Bayern were not impressed. United were not impressed by the outcome of their negotiations over Mina, walking away from what they regarded as prohibitive agents' fees which, if they had agreed to them, would have set a dangerous precedent for a player who is hardly in the world-class bracket. Speculation surrounding a move for Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld rumbled on for much of the summer. It turned out to be unfounded. United never made a bid for the 29-year-old Belgian. As one club source said: ""We ended up in a situation where if we had done a deal, we would have been swapping our fifth best central defender for another fifth best central defender.""  Under the circumstances, United concluded there was no point. If anything sums up what seems to be a divergence of opinion over the short-term strategy at Manchester United, it is the treatment of Anthony Martial. In the United States, less than 20 days ago, it became apparent Mourinho was willing to let Martial leave. Anthony Martial was left out of France's World Cup squad this summer The decision was based around the comments of Martial's agent, Philippe Lamboley, who in a TV interview in June said that ""after considering all the factors and possibilities"" his client wanted out. In truth, the position suited Mourinho, who concluded a long time ago that Martial, who has a maximum two years left on his contract, goes missing at big moments. Evidently, that view is not shared by others at Old Trafford. The one conversation between Woodward and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy this summer centred around the availability of Martial and Juan Mata. In both instances, Levy was told no. As the transfer window entered its final week, rumours surfaced that Martial might be sold to fund a move for Inter Milan's Ivan Perisic, of whom Mourinho is a long-standing admirer. Sources at Old Trafford were adamant that Martial would not be sold. So it has proved. Given Manchester United do not have a director of football, it is not absolutely clear who is making footballing decisions that contradict Mourinho's. And, despite Martial remaining, there is no obligation on the manager to pick him, which is exactly what happened at the weekend when the Frenchman remained in Manchester for a double training session rather than flying to Munich for United's final pre-season friendly. The reason for his absence? Martial returning to France for the birth of his daughter which ended his United States tour a week early. ""There is no story,"" said Mourinho. ""He had three days of pre-season. Then he had nine where he did no training and no football. Absolutely nothing [about it]. If you do that, you have to start again with the other people."" If Mourinho's ""difficult season"" assessment is taken at face value, the Portuguese is heading towards a turbulent few months. It is clear he has not got the players he wanted. Mourinho has given youth a chance at Old Trafford but he is also of the view that if Manchester City's dominance is going to be challenged, it must be with a core of experienced, top-quality players, who tend to be around 29 years of age with little resale value. Those responsible for signing the cheques tend to look longer term. Paul Pogba, for instance, was bought at huge cost, £89m, and comes with an enormous social media following, 5.62m on Twitter alone. In the modern game, such things matter. Paul Pogba has been reportedly linked with a move to Barcelona this summer, having won the World Cup with France in July So, whether Mourinho wanted to or not - and there is no evidence he did - Pogba would not have been sold this summer, despite suggestions the Frenchman would be open to exiting Old Trafford for a second time. United must also factor in market volatility in assessing their transfer dealings.  Neymar's £200m move from Barcelona to Paris St-Germain 12 months ago might be dismissed as an exception. But it created a ripple effect that led to Barcelona signing Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho for £135.5m and £142m respectively. Sir Alex Ferguson was ridiculed for saying there was ""no value in the market"" but United have to think seriously before adopting a ""pay what it takes"" stance. Ultimately, Mourinho has at his disposal the same squad that finished runners-up last season, minus the retired Michael Carrick, and plus Brazil World Cup midfielder Fred and teenage full-back Diogo Dalot.  In addition, to his satisfaction but the chagrin of many United fans, Mourinho also has Marouane Fellaini, who ended months of speculation by signing a two-year contract at the end of June. Will it be enough to close a 19-point gap to Manchester City and at the same time hold off an anticipated threat from a resurgent Liverpool? Mourinho says by the end of November it will be known which clubs will be Premier League title contenders. If Manchester United are not one of them, no-one would be surprised if those in charge start to get a succession plan prepared."
market volatility,Farmers facing price rises fear volatile times,2024-09-15,2022-03-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-60663031,"There are fears food supply could be affected as a result of the war in Ukraine, according to members of the farming industry. Farmer Guy Smith, from Essex, said the price of fertiliser had trebled and it felt like ""very volatile times"". The National Farmers' Union (NFU) warned farmers were facing rapidly increasing prices.  The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was trying to find ""long-term solutions"". Mr Smith, who farms in St Osyth, said nitrogen fertiliser was becoming more expensive and so was using 25% less than normal on his wheat crops. He said he feared prices would increase as a result.  ""Food will become more expensive. And what is really worrying is that for parts of the world where people aren't as well off as they are in this country, food could become short and that's very worrying,"" he said. ""I've been farming now for 30 to 40 years and I have never seen fertiliser treble and never seen the wheat price double. ""These are very volatile times."" Russia and Ukraine, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, such as seeds and oil. Andrew Dewing who manages and owns a grain trade business in Aylsham, Norfolk, said the increased price was a short-term benefit for suppliers in the UK, but the lack of fertiliser could cause problems for future crops. ""It's important to say that a farmer might benefit price-wise this year but they're not going to benefit in future years if this is ongoing.  ""[They] may not be able to produce crops at the same level or might not get the supply of fertiliser anyway,"" he said. An NFU spokesman said: ""The impact of the conflict has seen prices rise even further for everyone.  ""For farmers, prices of fertiliser and animal feed in particular is increasing rapidly.  ""To maintain confidence and stability in the supply chain, we have highlighted some short and long-term asks of government that can help navigate the extreme volatility we are seeing today and will grow in the coming months."" The NFU is calling on the Government to prioritise food security and sustainable food production, preserve and protect gas supplies for food production and processing and create a market monitoring group to identify and resolve potential problems.  Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary, George Eustice, said the Government was taking a number of steps including setting up a group to work with industry to ""identify better, long-term solutions that rely less on the price of gas"". He also said they had been working with the UK's producer of fertiliser to maintain production. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

market volatility,Ministers move to combat butter shortage,2024-09-15,2017-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-41527710,"The Scottish government has announced ""urgent"" action to help bakers and shortbread makers in the wake of a butter shortage. A feasibility study will be carried out to see if collective buying and storing of butter is an option that could help combat shortages and rising costs. The Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society (SAOS) has been tasked with the work. It will also look at ways to combat volatility in the butter industry. A supply shortage combined with rising demand has seen wholesale butter prices rise to record highs this year. In July, the boss of dairy giant Arla warned that the UK could be facing a butter and cream shortage this Christmas. Peder Tuborgh said there was insufficient milk being supplied by farmers to make the products, but the National Farmers' Union described his comments as ""scaremongering"". Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing told an audience at the RBS Food and Drink conference that the food and drink sector was a ""significant and growing part of our economy"" and ministers wanted to support manufacturers ""particularly during times of economic pressure"". He said: ""The price of wholesale butter has doubled since the start of the year, with wholesale prices at a record high. ""This is a concern for many of our smaller food and drink manufacturers who use butter as a primary ingredient, such as our shortbread and confectionery producers and bakeries, and who are finding trading tough."" He added: ""We have listened to the concerns of our manufacturers and this urgent feasibility study will explore opportunities to exploit buying and efficiency savings made available through collaboration, boosting productivity and competitiveness within domestic and global markets. ""We expect to see the outcome of the study within the next month or so and we look forward to supporting the industry in whatever way we can."" The feasibility study is being funded from the £1m Market Driven Supply Chain (MDSC) project, which the Scottish government established in March."
market volatility,How cow poo is powering crypto mining,2024-09-15,2021-06-09,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57199405,"At Philip Hughes farm, near the Berwyn mountain range, not far from the Snowdonia National Park, in Denbighshire, cattle chew the lush valley pastures and flocks of sheep clothe the hills. In a green shipping container next to a large domed tank, a very different kind of farm also thrives in this idyllic landscape - a cryptocurrency farm. Philip Hughes's family have farmed the land for generations - but now he is turning his hand to mining, using powerful computers powered by renewable energy to generate new cryptocurrency. And that energy is derived, as Philip puts it, from ""cow muck"".  A big six-cylinder engine running at 500rpm turns methane given off by decomposing cow manure into electricity.  The process is called anaerobic digestion.  In the absence of oxygen, microbes break down the manure and produce methane, which can be combusted to produce heat and electricity, instead of entering the atmosphere where it would act as a powerful greenhouse gas.  What's left over can be used as fertiliser. About two-thirds of the electricity generated by the anaerobic digester helps power the farm and the farm's caravan park - but the remainder powers mining rigs, specialist computers about the size of a suitcase.  They are working on complex computations that serve to verify transactions and in return are rewarded with new cryptocurrency - a process that can consume large amounts of energy. Presently, they are mining Ethereum.   The income has been good but ""it does very much depend on what day you ask that question"", Philip says, with a nod to the notorious volatility of this digital product.  The value of Ethereum has fallen from over $4,000 (£2,800) in May to about $2,400 at the time of writing. Philip has also started leasing out his renewable energy.  The rigs powered by the digester are a mixture of those he owns and others belonging to third parties. At a cost of about £18,000, each rig is stuffed with ""lots of very powerful computer-graphics cards"", according to supplier Josh Riddett, who runs Easy Crypto Hunter, in Manchester.    And while the energy consumption of Ethereum mining is high, it is significantly less than mining Bitcoin and may yet be reduced further. Josh has been pitching cryptocurrency mining to small-scale renewable electricity generators for some time - he says his equipment is in 42 sites covering solar, hydro and wind-powered generators in addition to anaerobic digestion.  But some small-scale hydro projects are wary because they worry about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrencies.   And others doubt cryptocurrencies will be valuable for long enough or consistently enough to repay the considerable capital investment hydropower requires. Out of the British Hydropower Association's 290 members, the association's CEO Simon Hamlyn, knows of just two who are trying out crypto mining.  One has purchased a number of rigs to install at sites in Northern Ireland. But the other fell victim to a heist, when masked thieves crossed fields to break into the powerhouse and steal the rigs. Previously, the main mechanism for developing renewable-energy schemes was the feed-in-tariff, which paid renewable generators for the electricity they fed into the grid. The tariff started in 2011 and a boom in renewables followed - but the amount it pays has declined and it closed to new generators in 2019.  ""We're not going to be able to move to green energy unless the government revitalises the subsidy, or we start looking at alternatives,"" Josh says.  But renewable energy used to mine cryptocurrency cannot be used for other purposes, such as powering electric cars or heating homes.  If cryptocurrency is as socially valuable as any of those things, this might not matter - but for critics such as financial economist Alex de Vries, who writes the Digiconomist blog, it is a waste of green energy. ""The utility these systems can have is inherently extremely limited,"" he says.  ""If you look at Bitcoin, it can only process seven transactions per second at most - that's its maximum capacity.  ""You have to consider that a payments provider like Visa can do 65,000 transactions per second if needed.""  The decline of heavy industry has left some parts of the US with a surplus of hydroelectric power and the resulting cheap electricity has attracted cryptocurrency miners.  But communities that have experienced a ""gold rush"" of crypto miners have found it a mixed blessing, pushing up electricity prices.  And some, such as Plattsburg, have temporarily banned crypto mining.  Alex worries also about the limited lifespan of mining equipment, which he says can rapidly become obsolete, creating an e-waste problem. And rather than switching to renewables, many say it would be better to make cryptocurrencies more efficient - or stop using them altogether. In the UK, the Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association says only a ""small handful of plants"" are exploring crypto mining.  And Philip is very aware his cryptocurrency business is based upon producing an asset whose value can change dramatically, sometimes in response to a single remark by Elon Musk or Donald Trump. If the market collapses, he says, he will put the computing power of the rigs to other uses. But some seem more speculative than others, such as setting the boxes of graphic cards to work rendering computer animation for film-makers such as Disney. His venture into crypto has sparked interest, though. Other farmers interested in the project have called him, Philip says. And it is ""a lot easier to run a computer, than a herd of cows or a flock of sheep"". "
market volatility,University facing possible £11m energy bill rise,2024-09-15,2023-01-18,By Julia Causton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-64292532,"A university says it could be facing an energy bill rise of more than £11m. Steve West, vice chancellor of the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, said costs might be as high as £18m in 2023-2024. He said the price increase would not be passed on to students, despite the impact on the university's budget. ""We're looking at how we can save energy, save costs, but also we're having to look hard about how and where we invest going forward,"" Mr West said. UWE's energy bill for the 2021-2022 academic year was £6.5m, while in 2022-23 it was £10.5million, he added. ""Many universities forward purchase [energy], so we forward purchase two years ahead, and that gives us some security. ""But at the moment the market is so volatile, we're going to see a significant increase. We don't quite know how much and that's a big problem for us,"" said Mr West. He warned the rising energy prices could ""impact on our capital investments going forward"". ""At the moment we're prioritising all of the things we can do to reduce our energy to net zero carbon emissions for the university itself,"" added Mr West. Meanwhile, the University of Bath told the BBC it generated about 10 per cent of its electricity on campus through the use of renewables and mini-power stations. The University of Gloucestershire said its energy rate was fixed every six months so, although it was likely to face significantly higher prices later in the year, it was currently protected from market volatility. While its energy bills have increased ""significantly"", the University of Bristol said they remained a small part of its overall expenditure. It said its priority was to help students who were struggling, via hardship funding. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk"
market volatility,How Gen Z is hooked on cryptocurrency and NFTs,2024-09-15,2022-05-17,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60566575,"The lure of making a quick buck has always attracted young people to invest in risky assets. For Generation Z, it is the volatility - and the decentralised nature - of digital assets such as cryptocurrency and NFTs which appeals. But they are unregulated, meaning there is little investor protection. ""All my friends were talking about [cryptocurrency] so one day I just decided why not just jump in and see if I can make some money,"" says 20-year-old Paxton See Tow. All he needed was his phone and trading thousands of dollars' worth of assets was only a click away.  Generation Z - also known as Zoomers - are the age group born between the mid-1990s to early-2000s. They grew up online, playing games and meeting friends virtually, so the transition is natural. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies while a ""non-fungible token"" (NFT) is a way of owning an original digital image, touted as the digital answer to collectables. Just over a year ago, Paxton bought S$1,000 ($743; £739) worth of Bitcoin - one of the most popular cryptocurrencies - which gave him a 10% profit straight away. He decided to quadruple his portfolio. But then the price fell.  ""There's always the saying 'buy low, sell high' but I did the complete opposite. I let my emotions get the better of me,"" he says. He had lost a thousand dollars, on top of all the money he had invested, before he could pull his money out and re-strategise. For another, older trader, Kelvin Kong, the loss was much bigger. After making six figures in 2017, he lost more than half a million dollars the following year. ""I lost everything,"" he says. ""I thought I was the king of trading and my head got really big so I thought nothing could bring me down and I kept buying,"" he says.  In the end, he only had a few hundred dollars left in his bank account.  ""I think I almost went into depression. I had suicidal thoughts."" The boom in crypto and NFTs trading among young people worries him. ""A lot of them will lose money at the end of the day,"" he adds. But cautionary tales of people losing huge amounts of money don't seem to deter young traders.  For many, the first taste of digital assets are through ""play-to-earn games"" which reward players with NFTs and cryptocurrencies that can then be used within the game itself, or traded for cash. ""Every kid wants to make money playing games,"" says a 23-year-old trader in Malaysia who goes by the name of YellowPanther. ""That's the dream of my generation."" A month after he started trading NFTs last August, he decided to quit his job as a marketing executive to trade them full time. ""The day job took a long time - eight to nine hours a day - and the pay was quite low. I saw a big opportunity in the [NFT] space and I took the leap of faith,"" he says. YellowPanther now works with 29-year-old Resh Chandran, who offers training in conventional stocks, cryptocurrency and NFT trading in Singapore. Using Axie Infinity, one of the most popular ""play-to-earn games"", Mr Chandran introduces investors to mostly Filipino gamers who play on their behalf for a fee. But he warns the space is a ""wild wild west"".  The pandemic has only accelerated this growing trend of young people trading crypto and NFTs.  ""There was an extreme level of volatility in the marketplace so when you have volatility you also have opportunity in the market,"" says Lily Fang, a professor of finance at INSEAD business school. ""Young people were at home and it's almost a gamification of trading. All of these factors created a perfect condition for this to take off.""  For many young wannabe traders, advice is readily available on platforms such as YouTube, Twitter and Reddit. Brian Jung, 23, boasts one million YouTube followers but compared to other crypto influencers, he is known to talk more cautiously about the risks. ""I really have to make sure I'm careful about what I say to my audience because the last thing I want is for people to get hurt from these types of videos,"" he tells the BBC.  Brian's family emigrated from South Korea to the US and he believes his background affects how he invests and talks about money. ""Our family always struggled financially so I always have this frugal mindset,"" he says. ""My mum still works at the US Post Office and my dad works in a warehouse so I know one hour of their time is still equivalent to dollar value. I see what that is worth, regardless of how much income that I'm getting right now."" Gaining financial freedom is also what attracted 22-year-old Jowella Lim - a rare female trader - to the crypto world. But as well as the opportunities to make money, Jowella enjoys being at the forefront of this new technology.  As governments around the world look to regulate the industry, she believes they will help legitimise crypto and NFTs. ""Regulators have to eventually compromise and realise that this is a tech they cannot ignore, especially when it's constantly penetrating this society,"" she adds. Aside from financial losses, another big danger is addiction. ""The crypto market never sleeps so people really literally get sucked into it,"" says Mr Chandran.  Andy Leach, from addictions clinic Visions by Promises in Singapore, says he has seen a jump in young - particularly male - clients getting addicted to the thrill of trading crypto and NFTs.  ""You have the ability to watch Bitcoin going up and down and basically this process, this rollercoaster ride, the highs, the lows, it's available on your phone 24/7,"" he says. Despite losing money in the crypto market in the past, both Paxton and Kelvin are back trading after studying it more closely. I asked Kelvin if he thinks he may be addicted. ""You can put it that way,"" he smiles. ""But I would call it passion."""
market volatility,Tech Tent: Apple's security under scrutiny,2024-09-15,2017-12-01,By Rory Cellan-Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42195356,"Will Apple's gold-plated reputation with consumers be dented by an embarrassing security foul-up? Also on the podcast this week: is Bitcoin really using more energy than Ireland? And what kind of qualities do you need to succeed as a professional e-sports player? We try to answer those questions on this week's Tech Tent. For a long time, Apple has boasted - with some justification - that it has an excellent record of keeping its devices safe from intruders.  In any case, with PCs having the lion's share of the computer market, hackers and security researchers used to spend little time hunting down vulnerabilities in Macs. But on Tuesday a Turkish software developer tweeted this: ""Dear @AppleSupport, we noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra. Anyone can login as 'root' with empty password after clicking on login button several times."" It sounded unlikely but it was true. What it meant was that anyone who got hold of an Apple computer running the latest operating system could get root access to the machine with very little trouble. ""Root access is a bit like having a master key to the building,"" Prof Angela Sasse, from University College London, tells Tech Tent. ""It's really bad news.""  She explains that it means an intruder could install new software, such as spyware, on your computer. And she is surprised that this issue was not spotted before High Sierra was released. ""Normally before release you would test that root access is adequately protected."" Apple moved quickly to release an update to patch this loophole in the operating system's defences. So will it suffer any long-term consequences in terms of a loss of consumer trust? Neil Mawston, from the tech consultancy Strategy Analytics, says Apple is a very clever company with a great brand.  But he has some concerns: ""We're seeing this gradual tick-tock of mis-steps in delivery.""  Recently, we have seen the delay in the launch of Apple's Homepod - and another, albeit much more minor, security issue.  ""If products are late or they have lots of flaws and that keeps on building up momentum, then that negative press coverage eventually catches up with them."" A decade ago a furious Steve Jobs would have roamed the Cupertino campus to find someone to eject from the building for such a serious error. Tim Cook's style is very much more measured, but do not be surprised if there is some movement in the upper ranks of Mac management in the coming months. It has been a dizzying week for anyone who takes an interest in the crypto-currency Bitcoin. It started 2017 worth just under $1,000 (£740) but this week it soared past the $10,000 mark. In the days that followed, the volatility we have come to expect from the Bitcoin market has become even more pronounced. In the space of three hours, its price dropped by more than $2,000, only to bounce back a few hours later. The debate over whether this is a speculative bubble or the future of money gets hotter by the moment. But so too do concerns over the amount of energy used in the process of mining Bitcoin and recording transactions. As banks of computers whir away, many of them in China, the electricity consumed as they solve increasingly complex mathematical problems gets ever greater. According to one study, Bitcoin is now using more energy each year than the whole of Ireland, and will soon surpass Morocco's energy use. This does not sound sustainable, but as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps rising, miners will not care about the electricity bills. And meanwhile the incentive to plant software on websites to hijack visitors' computers to help mine Bitcoin will only increase. Competitive video gaming or e-sports is a rapidly growing business. Market research firm Newzoo thinks this young industry will make nearly $700m in revenue this year. And it is not all about consoles - mobile gaming is increasingly popular. This weekend, London hosts the Clash Royale Crown World Championships, a global tournament entered by more than 27 million players, according to Supercell, the Finnish creators of the mobile game Clash Royale. Only a few of those will be professional e-sports players. This new breed can earn substantial sums, not only from tournaments but from sponsors, advertisers and from fans who watch them streaming their practice sessions on Twitch or YouTube and just send them money. So what does it take to make it as one of these new sports stars?  We hear from ElecTr1fy - yes, it is important to have an arresting name - who tells us his YouTube channel has added 40,000 subscribers and had generated 40 million views over the last month.  ""You need fast instincts  - every delay can cost you the game,"" he tells us. ""And you need to get into your opponent's head."" That message is reinforced by The Rum Ham, a gamescaster - another new profession - providing live commentary on e-sports. He says it is about making good decisions quickly.  ""They're making decisions where hundreds of thousands of dollars are on the line in a split second.  These players are doing mental maths, spatial awareness, predicting the outcomes of a combat before the troops are even on the field - all in a three-minute game play."" And the prize? Well the best players are making more than a million dollars a year. Time to put away the crossword, forget about the Sudoku and get down to some serious gaming. "
market volatility,Call for pump price investigation,2024-09-15,2011-05-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13593591,"Petrol prices reached record levels in April An alliance of European motoring organisations has written to the European Union calling for an investigation into the price of fuel. The call comes from the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in a letter to the European Union.  The group represents 35 million European drivers, including members of the RAC and AA in the UK. The FIA said the way petrol prices are currently set was ""far from transparent"". A full tank of fuel for an average European car now costs around £10 more than it did a year ago.  The price of fuel in the UK reached record levels in April as the cost of Brent crude rose above $125 a barrel. Although the price of crude has fallen $10 since then, motoring groups say the wholesale price of petrol has not fallen as fast. The price of crude oil is only one factor affecting the petrol price. Oil is traded in dollars, so the exchange rate against the dollar has a big impact on prices. Taxes, transportation and refining costs also vary - impacting the cost of fuel at the pump.  But the FIA says the EU should investigate the way petrol prices are set for the European market.  Most European petrol prices are derived from the Rotterdam spot market where some cargoes of petrol and diesel are bought and sold. But the FIA is not sure that this market works effectively. ""A platform with such a small volume is doubted to be a representative indicator for the vast European market,"" said Werner Krauss, chairman of the FIA Eurocouncil. This video can not be played Brian Madderson of RMI Petrol calls for 'fair competition' The organisation also wants the EU to look into the role of speculators who invest in the oil market. Mr Krauss claimed the ""resulting volatility"" in petrol prices had a negative financial impact on consumers. The complaint is backed by the UK motoring organisation the AA, which is calling for an independent regulator to oversee the petrol market. ""No one is giving us any answer as to why petrol prices are so high,"" said AA public affairs spokesman Luke Bosdet. ""We need greater transparency so everyone can see we are paying a fair price for fuel,"" he added.  Retailers have said that prices do go down when the cost of petrol has fallen. One way for sellers to balance the changing price of fuel is to buy in advance. The UK's largest supermarket, Tesco, say they try to keep prices low and will sometimes buy fuel in advance to balance changes in price. But in a statement the retailer said it was difficult to predict when to buy. ""As everybody knows, it's very difficult to predict movements in crude oil prices, which can go down as well as up. So it's wrong to say that buying in advance is necessarily an advantage,"" Tesco said in a statement.

market volatility,Home asking prices see smallest February rise of £14,2024-09-15,2023-02-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64703234,"The average asking price for a UK home rose by just £14 from January to February, according to property website Rightmove - the lowest increase for the month since its records began in 2001. The average asking price for a home is now £362,452, it said. Asking prices normally rise at the start of the year as sellers gear up for the spring selling season. However, price tags do fluctuate at other times in a year. For example in November and December, they decreased. Rightmove said higher mortgage rates and living costs were squeezing what people could afford. It follows months of falling house prices and predictions of further declines this year and next.  ""Many sellers are breaking with tradition and showing unseasonal initial pricing restraint,"" Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property science, said of the latest figures.  He added buyers were taking more time to ""find the right property at the right price"" and wanted ""greater realism on price"". Up until January house prices in the UK fell for five months in a row, according to building society Nationwide.  Meanwhile annual house price growth slowed to 1.1%, down from 2.8% in December. Rightmove said the rise in asking prices seen this February was lower than the growth of 0.6% recorded during the 2008 financial crisis. Part of the reason is higher mortgage rates, which have squeezed purchasing power. Rates have fallen from the 6.65% highs seen after Liz Truss's mini-budget in September but remain far above what they were a year ago. According to research firm Moneyfacts, average two-year and five-year fixed rate mortgages are still above 5%.  At the same time inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is near a 40-year high, putting pressure on household budgets.  Despite this, Rightmove said buyers were benefiting from ""more choice albeit with revised budgets to accommodate higher mortgage rates"". The company said the number of sales agreed was rebounding, but was still 11% down on 2019 levels. They had been down 30% during the aftermath of the mini-budget. And Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agent Knight Frank, said the housing market had picked up a bit since Christmas.  ""Buyers and sellers switched off early for the holidays due to the volatility caused by the mini-budget but have come back surprisingly strongly in 2023,"" he said. Knight Frank expects house prices to fall by about 5% this year as household budgets come under pressure.  The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official forecaster, has predicted a 9% drop in prices through to Autumn 2024 before prices start to rise again."
market volatility,Public inquiry calls over A6 road scheme 'fiasco',2024-09-15,2022-11-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63726495,"There have been calls for a public inquiry into ongoing delays into the completion of a new dual carriageway between Londonderry and Dungiven. The 15-mile stretch is part of the A6 upgrade linking Derry and Belfast. Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said key aspects of the project have yet to be completed. However, DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said the project had now become ""a fiasco"". Work on the road started in 2018, with an estimated cost of £220m, and had been due to be completed earlier this year. DfI said while the road upgrade is ""well advanced"" essential aspects, including safety barriers and lighting, have yet to be completed. It said at present it is not possible to ""provide an exact opening date"" for the road.  The department has also now confirmed the scheme's budget will exceed the original estimated cost. It included cost details in a Freedom of Information (FOI) request response to BBC Radio Foyle's Mark Patterson Show. DfI said the ""actual cost is under continual review and the final cost will not be known until the project has been completed"". It added: ""Any funding requirements will be factored into future budget settlement"". Speaking earlier to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Campbell said the A6 should be ""a tremendous asset"". ""But it is an embarrassment to the department now. This fiasco has gone on for far too long,"" he said. The DUP MP said a public inquiry is needed to establish ""how it has come to this"". He said it is needed to establish the nature and cost to the public of the scheme's ""inordinate delay"". Foyle SDLP MLA Mark Durkan said an inquiry would ""demonstrate the shortcomings and what they (DfI) can learn and not repeat"". He said it has become increasingly challenging to get updates on the road scheme from DfI. ""Over the past six to eight months it has become much, much more difficult to get information from the department as to what is happening and when we can expect to see completion of this much needed and long overdue project,"" he said. The Department for Infrastructure began work on the A6 road scheme in 2018. Work was completed on the nine-mile (14.7km) dual carriageway between Toomebridge, County Antrim, and Castledawson, County Derry, last year.  The first phase of the carriageway, between the M22 motorway at Randalstown and Toomebridge, opened in 2019. The dual carriageway is part of a larger scheme to improve the route between Derry and Belfast, with work continuing on a major new road between Derry and Dungiven. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 15-mile section of dual carriageway includes a bypass around Dungiven. In September the department said supply-chain issues and global-market volatility were causing the delays. It said at that time it was ""working closely with the contractor"" to agree a completion date. The continued delays are causing frustration for commuters and affected businesses.   At present there are a number of diversions and speed restrictions in place to accommodate the ongoing work. Brian Cassidy owns a cycle shop in the County Londonderry village of Claudy. ""People are stopping with us, asking how to get to Derry, Belfast, Claudy,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. ""They are turning off not knowing where they are going. We have had lorries stuck up the road, 40ft lorries on back roads that are not designed for them, purely down to signage."" In a statement the DfI said the ""work items yet to be completed"" include ""the provision of safety barrier, road marking, signage and street lighting"". The department added: ""A Road Safety Audit must then be completed before the road can be fully opened. ""The outcome of the audit process may recommend some safety-related amendments and therefore it is not possible to provide an exact opening date at this time."" It said it ""is currently envisaged that the road will open in the coming months""."
market volatility,"Banks can weather pandemic, says Bank of England",2024-09-15,2020-12-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55271187,"UK banks are well prepared for serious economic shocks and can continue to lend during the pandemic, the Bank of England has said. Banks have built up strong capital buffers since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, the Bank said in its latest financial stability report. Most risks to the UK's financial stability posed by a no-deal Brexit have been mitigated, it said. But it warned that ""some disruption to financial services could arise"".  Businesses, with the support of government guarantees, have borrowed £80bn so far this year, compared with £20bn by this time last year, according to the Bank. It said the major UK banks could absorb credit losses in the order of £200bn, but that would involve ""incredibly severe"" shocks that were unlikely to occur. For instance, unemployment would have to rise to 15% and house prices to fall by 30%. Former Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance told the BBC that the Bank saw the banking system as ""very resilient"". ""I think that the Bank's assessment makes sense,"" he said. However, he warned that outside the financial system, a no-deal Brexit would pose big challenges. ""The real economy is going to struggle if we go into a Brexit no-deal,"" he added. ""Financial sector preparations for the end of the transition period with the EU are now in their final stages,"" the Bank's report said. ""Most risks to UK financial stability that could arise from disruption to the provision of cross-border financial services at the end of the transition period have been mitigated."" However, it added: ""Financial stability is not the same as market stability or the avoidance of any disruption to users of financial services. Some market volatility and disruption to financial services, particularly to EU-based clients, could arise."" The Bank said financial institutions should continue taking measures to minimise disruption. On the housing market, the Bank noted that activity had picked up sharply in recent months, but the number of advertised mortgage products had continued to fall and was ""materially lower"" than earlier in the year. ""While some lenders have reintroduced products since the early stages of the pandemic, others have withdrawn further, especially at higher [loan-to-value] ratios,"" it said. The Bank said it was important to prevent a rapid build-up of mortgage debt, which it said had ""historically been an important source of risk to financial and economic stability"". To that end, the Bank's Financial Policy Committee had recommended limiting the proportion of new mortgages with high loan to income ratios, guarding against an increase in the number of highly indebted households.  Those recommendations are under review and the conclusions will be published next year."
market volatility,UK trading platform IG stops new GameStop trades,2024-09-15,2021-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55871381,"One of the UK's biggest financial trading platforms, IG, has stopped any new trades in GameStop and theatre chain AMC when markets open on Monday. US video games retailer GameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros. Both GameStop and AMC Entertainment have seen their share prices boom as amateur investors, fuelled by chat on social media, bought their shares. In a statement IG said the restrictions will be reviewed regularly. Other popular stock market trading apps also temporarily halted dealings in GameStop on Thursday, after its shares soared as much as 700% in the past week.  AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies hit by the trading restrictions. But the move left investors outraged, accusing the trading platforms of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out. Several platforms then rowed back on their stance. In a statement, IG said: ""Due to the recent extreme volatility, and in order to prioritise the service we give our existing clients, we are not allowing any new positions to be opened on the US stocks GameStop and AMC Entertainment. ""These restrictions apply to all IG accounts, and will be reviewed regularly. You will still be able to close any open positions that you have in these stocks. Any orders that you have already placed on these two stocks will remain."" GameStop is a struggling US High Street shop that sells games, consoles and other electronics. Lots of big investment firms, such as hedge funds, had bet on GameStop to lose a lot of value, meaning they borrowed shares in the company and then sold them, with a promise to buy them back at a later date. This is called ""short selling"" or ""shorting"" and the idea is to make money as the share price falls. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But huge numbers of independent amateur traders on social media, including Reddit, swapped tips and bought shares in GameStop. The demand raised its share price massively, leading to losses for the Wall Street traders. And the idea has caught on globally, fuelling activity in stocks traded in other parts of the world, including the UK, Brazil and Malaysia. The strategy has also been deployed on behalf of other firms, such as struggling theatre chain AMC Entertainment, owner of Odeon Cinemas. Publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld have also been the focus of social media discussion, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge. Earlier this week, watchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses. In a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: ""The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks. ""Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in."""
market volatility,Bitcoin slides amid rollercoaster ride,2024-09-15,2017-11-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42178705,"The price of digital currency Bitcoin has fallen sharply in a period of wild trading since it passed the $11,000 mark a day ago.  Bitcoin is now around $9,600, down about 16% from the record $11,434 (£8,500) it hit on Wednesday. The digital currency is used by some people to pay for things online, but most users see it as an investment. On Wednesday, a Bank of England deputy governor warned ""investors should do their homework"" on Bitcoin. There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.  Secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. A small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.  However, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment.  At its peak, Bitcoin had increased by 1,000% from the $1,000 value at which it started the year. Bitcoin is ""prone to wild swings"", partly because it is not well regulated and because there are fewer traders, said Dr Garrick Hileman of the Judge Business School at University of Cambridge. The trading over the past day ""was a rollercoaster like nothing I've ever seen,"" said Neil Wilson, a financial analyst at ETX capital in London. He said part of the volatility was due to small investors ""with no market experience"" buying and selling the coin. ""There is no way to discern what fair value is - it's so incredibly speculative and it is so new and not properly understood."" Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. On Thursday, Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, warned that digital currencies like Bitcoin could pose ""more serious financial stability issues"" if adopted widely. Financial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks. Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, said Bitcoin was ""not of a size that would be a threat to financial stability"" or a risk to the UK economy. But he also told the BBC on Wednesday: ""People need to be clear this is not an official currency. No central bank stands behind it, no government stands behind it.""  Bitcoin is ""closer to a commodity"" than a currency, with people choosing to invest and trade in it, Sir Jon said. Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. A steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are coming under closer scrutiny due to the rapid price rise. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"". "
market volatility,Markets stabilise after earlier sell-off,2024-09-15,2018-12-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46466903,"US markets stabilised on Thursday after steep falls earlier in the day spurred by fears about US-China trade tensions and global growth. The Dow Jones index closed down about 0.3% while the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.2%.  The tech-focused Nasdaq even ventured into positive territory, ending 0.4% higher. The rebound followed sharp falls in Europe and extended the sharp market swings seen in recent weeks. In London the FTSE 100 tumbled 3.2%, or more than 200 points, to close at about 6,700 - its lowest level in two years. Falls on European markets were even steeper, with Paris and Frankfurt both shedding almost 3.5%.  Oil prices also sank, with Brent crude more than 2% lower. Analysts said the arrest of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei's chief financial officer in Canada had revived worries over the US's trade war with China. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei index shed 1.9%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 2.5%. On the FTSE 100, worst-hit sectors included miners, oil companies, carmakers and tech stocks, with mining firms Antofagasta and Glencore among the biggest losers. The concerns about trade tensions, oil prices and slowing growth sparked losses at US financial, energy and materials companies early in the day, sending all three major US indexes more than 2% lower. But sentiment later swung in the other direction. Analysts at Oxford Economics said markets had become ""overly gloomy"". IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde also said in a CNBC interview that worries about recession were ""a little bit overdone"", although uncertainty was causing increased volatility. The US stock market is having another ugly day.  Coming up with culprits for the most recent panic isn't hard. Investors fear the trade war between China and the US will escalate. They worry America's central bank will raise interest rates too far. And they're concerned about Britain's exit from the European Union. All factors that could hurt company profits. The tougher question to answer is where the market is headed. Will it keep going down or bounce back? Many on Wall Street are describing the recent stock turbulence as a market correction - defined as a drop of at least 10% from a recent high.  How long it lasts depends on what investors perceive are the prospects for global economic growth. And right now the psychology of the markets appears fragile. Oil prices fell on Thursday as traders waited for news from the meeting of Opec oil-producing nations in Vienna, with some member states keen to agree on a production cut to drive up prices. Members tentatively agreed to cut output but were waiting for a commitment from Russia, which is not in the cartel, before making any firm decisions, according to insiders. Investors were also reacting to new US trade deficit figures, measuring the difference between imports and exports of goods and services. That gap increased to $55.5bn in October, the highest level in a decade, as major markets including China, the European Union and Mexico purchased fewer US products. All three markets have hit US goods with new import duties in retaliation for tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer had ""reignited fears that trade reconciliation between the US and China may not be forthcoming any time soon"".  ""The market is spooked by the damage a continuing trade war could do to global economic prospects, and that's hitting share prices in the UK and overseas. """
market volatility,FTSE 100 suffers worst year since financial crisis,2024-09-15,2020-12-31,By Simon Read,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55500103,"Pension savers and investors' nest-eggs have been hit as the UK's leading share index had its worst year since the height of the financial crisis. The FTSE 100 index fell 14.3% over the year, marking its worst performance since 2008, when it slumped 31.3%. Despite the poor performance, the blue-chip index has recovered significantly since the start of the global pandemic when it was a third lower than now. Analysts have said that next year is likely to be better for investors. ""The factors which worked against the FTSE-100 in 2020 - the pandemic, a deep recession and Brexit - will start to fade into the background, giving corporate profits, dividends and employment a chance to bounce back,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Such market volatility can be alarming, but people should not panic. Anyone who sold shares back in March would have missed out on the market's gains we've seen since, for instance. Market movements don't only affect savers with shares or funds that invest in the stock market. They also affect anyone with a pension scheme, as the money we stash for our retirement is invested on our behalf in the market. That means millions of workers in the UK are relaying on stock market returns for their financial future. Seasoned investors and fund managers are constantly taking action to protect their portfolio. That can mean moving cash out of risky markets or moving into safer cash havens, such as bonds. It's essential to diversify and not back just one investment opportunity, which is what funds are all about. By avoiding having all your savings in one basket - or share - then you avoid falling prey to the worst volatility of stock markets. ""The coronavirus market downturn spurred many young people to dip a toe into the world of investments for the first time - perhaps because they have been at home more,"" pointed out Myron Jobson, personal finance campaigner at Interactive Investor. ""The key for investors of all ages is to ensure that your portfolio is well diversified across assets, sectors and regions so that you are not overexposed to risk in any one part of the market."" ""If 2020 taught us anything it's that predicting short-term movements in the stock market is impossible,"" Robin Powell, editor of The Evidence-Based Investor told the BBC. ""Investors should check that they're happy with the level of risk they're taking, and if they are, they should ignore the noise and stay invested, rebalancing periodically."" He advises people to have a portfolio you can stick with through thick and thin, diversified across regions and sector, and that includes a percentage of government bonds to dampen the risk. ""And don't pay for help from anyone who thinks they know where markets are heading. They have no more of a clue than you do,"" he cautioned. Mr Mould conceded that it has been hard to find a decent return in 2020 with interest rate cuts, falling returns from National Savings products and lower Government bond yields. But if you put your money overseas, the story could have been different. ""Japanese and US stock markets both had solid years and America's tech-laden Nasdaq soared by over 40%,"" he pointed out. That's a point taken up by Michael Baxter, economics commentator for The Share Centre. ""Compare the FTSE-100 with the US equivalent,"" he said. ""The S&P 500 surged this year hitting a new all-time high. By contrast, the FTSE 100 fell sharply."" He attributes that to the tech sector making up a high proportion of the US index. ""The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated a trend that was already in place before, namely the adoption of digital.  ""By contrast, the FTSE 100 is made up too many companies with their base stuck in the past, trying to promote 20th century business models in the 21st century and Covid just served to make a bad situation worse."""
market volatility,Job losses at Mini plant postponed,2024-09-15,2020-09-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-54108246,"Hundreds of proposed job losses at the Mini car factory in Oxford have been postponed.  BMW, which owns the plant in Cowley, said in August that 400 of 950 agency staff would be going. But it said they would now be kept on after ""recent and unexpected improvements in global customer demand"".  Production at the factory was halted in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, with work resuming in May. Last month it was announced the plant would move from a three-shift pattern to running two shifts by mid-October. It would have still operated five days a week.  But the three-shift pattern will be maintained for the time being ""in light of higher-than-expected order volumes"", a spokesman said.  He added: ""We remain in close dialogue with trade union representatives and are keeping our workforce, including agency employees, fully informed of any developments during this uncertain and unpredictable time. ""The continuing market volatility posed by the Covid-19 pandemic means that we cannot say whether, or for how long, positive market trends will continue, and we will of course be keeping the situation under close review in the weeks and months ahead."""
market volatility,Scottish prescription costs rise by 25%,2024-09-15,2018-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44937793,"The cost of providing prescriptions has gone up by 25% in the last decade, with an ageing population and new drugs part of the reason. NHS figures show the total bill for 2017-18 was £1.3bn, which is 25.7% more expensive than 10 years ago. Paracetamol and aspirin are among the most commonly-prescribed drugs. In Glasgow, the average cost of prescriptions is about 8% higher than the Scottish average. The data, from the Information Services Division of NHS Scotland, said the overall cost amounted to £248.79 per person. In the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, Scotland's largest health board, that figure rose to £271.30 per person, while NHS Orkney had the lowest average cost at £206.28 per person. Prescriptions have been free in Scotland since April 2011, a policy introduced by the SNP government. The figures showed 103.4 million items were dispensed on prescription in 2017-18 - an increase of more than a fifth over the last 10 years. Pregabalin, a drug used to treat epilepsy and chronic pain, had the highest total gross ingredient cost in 2017-18, at £36.38m. The most commonly-prescribed medication was omeprazole - used to treat indigestion, acid reflux, and stomach ulcers - with a total of 3.59 million prescriptions issued. Painkillers paracetamol and aspirin - both of which are available over the counter without a prescription - were the fourth and eighth most commonly-issued prescriptions, at 2.5 million and 2.01 million respectively. The report states that reasons for the increase in the number of prescriptions issued over the decade include; It also explains that there has been a shift from secondary to primary care for a number of high-cost medicines. The Scottish government said the figures had not been adjusted for inflation, but inflation would be a factor on the value of drugs in the global pharmaceuticals market. Scottish Conservative shadow health spokesman Miles Briggs has responded to the figures, saying he's concerned: ""With drugs such as paracetamol and aspirin often cheaper to purchase over the counter, we need to ensure that we are getting value for money for our NHS."" Labour health spokesman Anas Sarwar said: ""As more Scots continue to live longer, prescription costs are almost bound to rise due to more people living with long-term conditions that require treatment. ""This presents challenges not only for prescriptions but for a range of other services such as social care and GP practices. ""Labour continues to call on the SNP government to use the powers of the Parliament to give our NHS the funding it needs to end the staffing crisis in our health service."" Scottish Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, said: ""The increase in costs for drugs dispensed in the community is in line with anticipated trend and reflects the fact more patients are being treated closer to home with specialist medicines traditionally reserved for hospital. ""These new treatments deliver better outcomes for patients and are best value for money for the NHS, however we expect NHS Scotland to always look for opportunities to work with pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost for drugs wherever possible. ""Supply issues, an ageing population, increasingly complex health care needs, more people living with long term conditions, and the impact of the volatility in the value of the pound in recent years are also contributory factors to increased costs."" She then added: ""Legislation controlling what the NHS pays for medicines and supplies is currently reserved to the UK government and we are continuing to press them to ensure we can get best value."""
market volatility,Shares hit record amid trade talk hopes,2024-09-15,2019-07-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48828230,"The S&P 500 index of US stocks has closed at a record high amid signs of progress in US-China trade talks. The index closed at 2,964.33, beating 21 June's previous high, with technology stocks driving the rise.  Market watchers say more optimism around a potential trade deal between the US and China led to the movement. And gold, often seen as a safe asset in times of uncertainty, fell 2% to $1,382 per ounce, the biggest drop since June 2018. The Dow Jones closed 0.44% higher at 26,717.43, while the Nasdaq finished 1.1% higher at 8,091.16. In Europe, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and Germany's Dax closed 1% higher. ""We're right back on track,"" US President Donald Trump said after the countries agreed to restart trade talks.  ""Gold tends to do well during times of concern over growth, market volatility or when markets think the powers-that-be are losing control of events,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. ""A trade deal would deal with all three issues and markets are happy to take the view that a deal is coming. Though it could still be a long time coming, if there is to be one at all."" Negotiations between China and the US have dominated market moves for months as positive statements are often followed by extra tariffs, sending stock, currency and commodity markets up and down. The latest moves follow a pledge to renew talks between the US and China, an agreement that was reached at the G20 summit in Japan. US President Donald Trump agreed to hold off on $300bn of new tariffs on goods and relaxed restrictions on Huawei, while China agreed to make new purchases of US farm equipment. Last year, the US imposed three rounds of tariffs on more than $250bn worth of Chinese goods. China hit back by imposing tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on $110bn of US products. A truce agreed last December collapsed and in May the US raised tariffs on $200bn of Chinese products to 25% from 10%. Again China retaliated with tariff on $60bn of US goods. The price of gold is also retreating after gaining 8% in June, with prices exceeding $1,400 per troy ounce. ""Gold has just had a strong run. Nothing goes up in a straight line,"" said Mr Mould. While it earns no income, like a share or a bond would, gold's indestructible nature and its place in history as a store of value make it attractive to some investors in times of strife. Other safe-haven assets also declined, including the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar rose 0.4% against the yen to 108.26, and advanced 0.7% on the franc to 0.9830 francs."
market volatility,US job growth surges in February,2024-09-15,2018-03-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43345362,"Job creation in the US economy surged last month, but the annual rate of wage growth slowed. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, official figures show, far in excess of analysts' expectations. However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, while the annual earnings growth rate slowed to 2.6% last month. January's annual wage growth rate - which had triggered fears over inflationary pressures - was also revised down from 2.9% to 2.8%. The strong wage growth figure for January prompted sharp volatility on the stock market, as investors worried the US Federal Reserve would quicken the pace at which it increased interest rates. Despite a lower-than-expected wage increase in February, many economists said longer term trends still point to higher wages. The US economy is in its ninth year of economic expansion, with an upswing in global growth and tax cuts passed last year helping to boost growth. Friday's report from the US Labor Department showed the biggest increase in jobs since July 2016, sending major stock indexes higher. The three major US stock indexes climbed almost 2% by the close of trading and the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 440 points, or 1.77%, to end at 25,335, the S&P 500 gained 47 points, or 1.74%, to 2,786 and the Nasdaq ended up 132 points, or 1.79%, to 7,560. ""We have an economy that is firing on all cylinders and the job market is a reflection of that,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank. February's gains included an increase of 61,000 construction jobs - the biggest rise since 2007. The manufacturing sector also added 31,000 jobs, while retail employment rebounded from declines last year. The number of people working or looking for work also jumped by more than 800,000 last month. That was the biggest monthly rise in the labour force in more than two decades and boosted the labour force participation rate to 63%. Despite the rise, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, where it has hovered since October.   Those figures provided fodder for analysts who say wage growth could be moderated by a large number of potential workers sitting on the sidelines. ""The huge gain in payrolls belies the notion that the [labour] market has truly reached full employment,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj of Moody's Analytics. Increasing participation by men of prime working age - between 25 and 54 years - has helped drive the labour force participation rate higher in recent months, reflecting a resurgence in sectors such as manufacturing. But Ms Koropeckyj said she does not expect the labour force to continue growing at last month's pace, pointing to challenges such as skill gaps and opioid addiction.  Americans are also moving less, fuelling a geographic mismatch between jobs and job seekers and hardening regional disparities.  ""There's only so much of a boost you can get because a lot of people are structurally unemployed,"" she said. ""Certainly there is slack, but how much of it will be practically absorbed is questionable."" Ms Koropeckyj said a tighter labour market makes slow acceleration in wage growth ""inevitable"" this year.  The average hourly wage for private sector workers was $26.75 last month, up 68 cents from February 2017 and 4 cents from January. Markets are expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times in 2018. But with the inflation rate lagging its target 2% rate, it has been waiting for signs - like strong wage growth - of pricing pressure. Analysts said strong hiring in February all but guarantees the Fed will raise rates at its meeting later this month, even if the figures were boosted by mild weather. But the relatively weak wage growth did little to resolve debates about whether policymakers will eventually move faster."
market volatility,Rees-Mogg says market turmoil not due to mini-budget,2024-09-15,2022-10-12,By Beth Timmins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63230001,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has claimed market turmoil is not linked to the mini-budget in which the chancellor announced big tax cuts without the usual analysis of the economic impact. The business secretary said volatility was ""more to do with interest rates than a minor part of fiscal policy."" He said the Bank of England had not raised rates as fast as the US. But economists and some MPs said the plans had worried investors, pointing to the surge in borrowing costs. Investors are often wary of putting money into countries that are increasing their debt. And if a country raises its interest rates it means investors will get a bigger return on their money if they put it into that country's banks and assets. After the mini-budget, the pound plunged and government borrowing costs surged. ""What has caused the effect in pension funds... is not necessarily the mini-budget. It could just as easily be the fact that the day before the Bank of England did not raise interest rates as much as the (US) Federal Reserve did,"" he said. ""Jumping to conclusions about causality is not meeting the BBC's requirement for impartiality"" he said, after a suggestion the chancellor's actions had been the trigger for the fluctuations in the value of the pound and government bonds. At the first PMQs since the mini-budget, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Prime Minister Liz Truss of ""ducking the question"" when asked whether she agreed with the business secretary. Ms Truss said the government had taken ""decisive action"", adding ""as a result of our action... we will see higher growth and lower inflation."" Separately, speaking at the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said the mini-budget on 23 September was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"". He said the ""trade shock"" because of Brexit is a factor, and added: ""You throw on the 23 September event, you've got a side-lined financial watchdog, you've got lack of a medium-term fiscal plan, one of the largest unfunded tax cuts we've seen since the early 1970s, it was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back."" The Resolution Foundation's Torsten Bell said it was clear the huge package of cuts, which was downgraded to £43bn after Mr Kwarteng's U-turn on the top rate of income tax, should not have happened in the current financial climate. He said the sacking of the Treasury's top civil servant Sir Tom Scholar and the lack of a report on the economic impact from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had contributed to investor unease. ""It was no surprise to any of us that this is where you end up"". ""This is what happens if you aren't paying attention,"" he said. ""It was always going to be hard but it was exactly because it was always going to be hard that you don't do this."" The latest official statistics showed the economy unexpectedly shrank in August, strengthening predictions that it will fall into a recession. Professor Jagjit Chadha, director of National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) told the Commons Treasury Committee that the ""real danger"" seen after the mini-budget was ""obviously on the back of what can only be described as guerrilla tactics against our independent economic institutions over the summer - the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility"".  Gerard Lyons, an economist who advised Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng during the leadership contest, speaking on the BBC's World at One programme admitted that the mini-budget ""misread"" the country's financial situation.  However, he argued that everything that has happened was not ""solely due to the mini-budget"" but also down to parts of the financial system that were vulnerable to interest rates going up.  The Bank of England has warned interest rates could rise again after the value of the pound plummeted, following the government's decision to cut taxes and borrow more.  After the market turmoil, it stepped in with an emergency bond-buying intervention designed to stabilise the economy but said this scheme would end on Friday. Deputy Governor Ramsden said he was ""acutely"" aware that millions of households and businesses were experiencing ""real hardship"", noting that ""many"" of the policy actions were ""adding to the difficulties caused by the current situation"".   Prime Minister Liz Truss has said the promised tax cuts will boost UK economic growth and therefore help pay for themselves. The chancellor has committed to fast tracking the independent forecast by the OBR, the independent budget watchdog, at the same time as his economic plan detailing how he will pay for the planned tax cuts - which is now due to be announced on 31 October."
market volatility,Crypto trader Coinbase worth more than oil firm BP,2024-09-15,2021-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56750102,"Cryptocurrency firm Coinbase, which runs a top exchange for Bitcoin and other digital currency trading, hit a market value of nearly $100bn (£72.5bn) in its stock market listing. Shares debuted on the Nasdaq at a price of $381, but later closed below $330. The initial valuation put Coinbase ahead of many well-known firms, such as oil giant BP and key stock exchanges. The listing was seen as the latest step toward cryptocurrencies gaining wider acceptance among traditional investors. The price of Bitcoin surged more than 300% last year - and has climbed even higher in 2021 - as firms including Tesla, Mastercard and BlackRock unveiled plans to incorporate digital currencies into their businesses. It hit a record of more than $63,000 on Tuesday, ahead of the Coinbase listing. Less well-known digital currencies have also made gains with Dogecoin, which was created as a joke, rising more than 70% to more than 13 cents. US-based Coinbase, which makes money primarily by charging transaction fees, has benefited from the soaring demand.  Founded in 2012, Coinbase had more than 56 million users across more than 100 countries and held some $223bn in users' assets at the end of March. It reported $1.8bn in estimated revenue in the first three months of 2021 - more than its total for all of 2020 - as interest in Bitcoin and other digital currencies boomed. Compared to 2018, when investors reckoned Coinbase was worth $8bn in a private funding round, the firm's value has increased more than ten-fold. Wednesday's listing was set to make Coinbase co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong one of the wealthiest people in the world. The 38-year-old, a former Airbnb software engineer, owns a roughly 21% stake in the company. For outside investors, buying shares in Coinbase is seen as a potentially less risky way to tap into the activity in the crypto market, without investing directly in Bitcoin or other digital currencies, which have attracted warnings from financial regulators. But Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank said tougher rules, if enacted, could change the outlook for Coinbase. ""There does appear to be a little bit of a slow march towards acceptability,"" she said.  ""There's a lot of concern that at some point the regulators, the central banks, might just say, 'well, no,' and make this a lot more difficult and at that point many people could stand to lose a lot of money."" Last year, Coinbase's revenues hit $1.3bn, more than double that of 2019. Profits were $322m, compared to a loss of more than $30m in 2019. On Wednesday, the company's share price initially jumped, hitting a high of nearly $430 at one point. But it later dropped back, hitting a low of $118 before ending the trading session at roughly $328.  That would give the firm a valuation of about $86bn. This is a bit of a moment for crypto currency. Digital currencies have long been seen as a high risk bet for investors - a 'you only live once' investment. Over the years though, crypto has slowly gained some credibility - and has delivered astonishing returns for some investors. Several major companies have said they want to introduce crypto as a form of payment. But this is perhaps an even greater step on the road to crypto credibility. The attraction for investors is that it feels like a safer way to invest in crypto itself. Coinbase's market price will be linked to how well currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing. But the fact that the firm has such an range of currencies you can buy and sell means investors may feel they are more insulated from wild changes in the price of a single currency. The big worry for investors taking a punt on crypto is that authorities will move to limit or even shut them down.  Mining some digital currencies can be hugely environmentally damaging, and the currencies themselves have been linked to organised crime.  Coinbase, then, may be seen as a more acceptable place for funds to take a punt on digital currencies. Executives said the firm's performance would vary amid the swings in notoriously volatile digital currencies, but over the long term it was poised for growth. ""There's going to be volatility with new technologies and the companies associated with them. That's ok. That's a feature, not a bug,"" Coinbase president Emily Choi told the BBC. ""If you believe in the long term idea about digital value and what crypto assets create, you're just going to play this as a long-term thing."" Coinbase's market debut comes at a time when investors have shown high demand for newly listed companies, sending their valuations soaring at trading launches. The firm listed its shares with a sale of existing stock, rather than issuing new equity as would occur in a more typical initial public offering. "
market volatility,Pound hits record low after tax cut plans,2024-09-15,2022-09-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63030208,"The pound has fallen to a record low against the dollar as markets react to the UK's biggest tax cuts in 50 years. Sterling fell close to $1.03 early on Monday before regaining some ground to stand at $1.08.  Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has promised more tax cuts on top of a £45bn package he announced on Friday amid expectations borrowing will surge. The cost of UK government borrowing climbed and markets speculated about an emergency interest rate rise.  Some economists predict the Bank of England may call an emergency meeting as soon as this week to raise rates, to help stem a fall in the pound and calm high inflation.  If so, it would come less than a week after the Bank lifted interest rates by half a percentage point to 2.25% and before its next official meeting on 3 November. The Bank of England declined to comment.  Market-watchers now forecast that interest rates could reach 5.5% or even higher by next spring. The rate increase in September was the seventh in a row and took rates to the highest for 14 years. A further rise would increase monthly mortgage costs for millions of homeowners. If the pound stays at low levels against the dollar, imports of commodities priced in dollars, including oil and gas, will be more costly.  Other imported goods could also become considerably more expensive, further pushing up inflation which is already at its highest rate for decades.  And British tourists visiting America will find that their holiday money does not go as far as before sterling's slide. Neither the chancellor or Prime Minister Liz Truss would comment on the fall in the pound.  While worries about the UK economy have hit the pound, its value has also been under pressure due to the strength of the dollar. Other currencies have been falling against the dollar, and the euro touched a fresh 20-year-low against the US currency amid concerns about the risk of recession. Investors all around the world trade huge amounts of foreign currency every day. The rate at which investors swap currencies also determines what rate people get at the bank, post office or foreign exchanges. Many people don't think about exchange rates until it's time to swap money for a foreign holiday. When you travel abroad, things will be more expensive if the pound buys less of the local currency. However, a fall in the pound affects household finances too. If the pound is worth less, the cost of importing goods from overseas goes up. For example, as oil is priced in dollars a weak pound can make filling up your car with petrol more expensive. Gas is also priced in dollars. Technology goods, like iPhones, that are made abroad, may get more expensive in UK shops. Even things that are made in the UK but from parts that are bought abroad can get much more expensive. Read more here Commenting on the likelihood the Bank of England could raise rates before its scheduled meeting in November, former Bank deputy governor Sir John Gieve told the BBC: ""I'm sure they very much don't want to do that... because that is a sign of pressure. ""Emergency meetings are avoided if at all possible and I am sure they will try to avoid it."" Sushil Wadhwani, chief investment officer at PGIM Wadhwani and a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee, said if he was still there: ""I would be tempted to announce an extra meeting in a week. ""The argument for waiting a week would be to give them time to properly assess the extra news. The reason for not waiting until November is that they are cognisant of the need to respond in a timely basis to the new developments."" He added: ""Of course, the Bank of England taking action is a second best solution. The first would involve the chancellor coming up with a credible fiscal plan which is blessed by the Office for Budget Responsibility."" On Monday, the cost of UK government borrowing surged again. Interest rates on borrowing over two and five-year periods reached 4.5%, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis, while rates over 10 years hit the highest since April 2010. At the weekend, Mr Kwarteng said there was ""more to come"" in terms of tax cuts after announcing a massive shake-up of taxes on Friday during a ""mini-budget"" to boost economic growth. Under the plans, which he hailed a ""new era"" for the economy, income tax and the stamp duty on home purchases will be cut and planned rises in corporation taxes have been scrapped.  As well as outlining £45bn in tax cuts, the government confirmed it would spend £60bn for the first six months of its scheme to subsidise rising energy bills for households and businesses. But that cost is expected to rise as the scheme to support households will last for two years. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves described the fall in sterling as ""incredibly concerning"". ""We need to hear from the chancellor his plans to get a grip on the public finances because that is what is giving real concern to market traders"" and ""working people"", she added. The Treasury refused to publish a forecast by independent watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility on Friday on the UK's economic outlook as well as future borrowing and debt.  BBC political editor Chris Mason said that while ministers were not saying anything publicly: ""The impression I am left with is they want to ride this out. They hope it is short-term volatility. "" However, he said one Conservative MP told him: ""This is very worrying. All the wheels could come off.""  Paul Davies, chief executive at Carlsberg Marston's Brewing Company, said the fall in the pound was ""worrying"" for the British beer industry, which imports hops from overseas. He said: ""Many of the hops used in this country are actually imported and a lot of them, particularly for craft brewers, are imported from the US, so changes in currency is actually worrying for industry.  ""Then of course people drink a lot of imported beers from Europe, and the euro vs the pound is also something we're watching very closely at the moment.""

market volatility,Tech Tent: Has crypto-currency peaked?,2024-09-15,2018-09-14,By Rory Cellan-Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45526365,"If you believe crypto-currencies are the future this has not been a good week. The value of Ethereum, Bitcoin's main rival and ""the future of crypto"" not so long ago, has lurched ever lower and is now 80% below its peak.  Meanwhile, US regulators have acted against companies involved in crypto-currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) - schemes to create new coins. But hope springs eternal, and in recent days both a London art gallery and a Scottish hotel have contacted me about plans to allow their customers to pay with crypto-currencies.  So on this week's Tech Tent we debate this question: has crypto-currency peaked or do its best days lie ahead? We invited David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, a very sceptical take on the crypto landscape, to debate with Christopher Shake, the director of that London gallery, The House of Fine Art. The gallery's press release had boasted that it was about to run ""the very first art exhibition only available through crypto-currency"".  By the time Mr Shake arrived in our studio that had changed slightly - customers would be encouraged to buy the 500 works in the October exhibition in Bitcoin or a range of other digital currencies but if they wanted to use good old-fashioned dollars or pounds, such payment would be accepted. ""Our main goal is to support and promote our artists,"" he says. But as a crypto-currency enthusiast, he explains that there is also problem he wants to solve: people sitting on big crypto assets aren't able to spend them. ""If a lot of merchants do jump on and accept crypto-currencies, that will add confidence to the market,"" he explains. But David Gerard says things are moving in the opposite direction - fewer merchants are accepting crypto-currencies because they are so volatile and the promise of smooth cost-free transactions has proved illusory.  He says many left during the 2017 Bitcoin bubble. ""You couldn't trust it for volatility, you couldn't trust it because transactions were slow and often didn't go through at all. It really destroyed the use-case for the general merchant acceptance of cryptos."" He sums up his view of the whole crypto market: ""It's not really very interesting or shiny any more."" But Christopher Shake sees it very differently. He claims that everyone from Goldman Sachs to Amazon and Facebook is now moving into crypto-currencies - something David Gerard says just isn't the case - and he believes it is an idea whose time has come. ""It is sticking around because it has value. It's sticking around because it's a great technology, and that's why institutions are getting into it."" But for all his reservations, David Gerard does not expect Bitcoin in particular to disappear in a hurry. ""Bitcoin has spent its entire existence lurching from crisis to crisis, any of which would have killed a sane financial instrument,"" he says. ""But Bitcoin is more of a strong cultist advocate thing for people who are into it.""  His forecast is that crypto-currency will slowly become more regulated and normalised - a rather different vision from that of the early Bitcoin advocates, who saw it smashing the system and making central banks and governments irrelevant. Also on this programme, we look at Apple's new health-focused Watch and ask whether doctors will be flooded with patients worried about what its ECG monitor is telling them. And we get two opposing views on whether the EU's proposed new copyright law is good for artists or will lead to a censored internet.  "
market volatility,Manx Gas overdue payments peaked at £9m,2024-09-15,2022-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-61234260,"Overdue payments by Manx Gas to the Isle of Man utilities provider peaked at £9m earlier this month, it has been confirmed.  Manx Utilities (MU) has confirmed the company had not paid all of its invoices on time or in full between September and February. All of the natural gas purchased for sale on the island by Manx Gas is done via MU. Manx Gas said it had been ""quite open about the difficulties"" it had faced. The gas provider's overdue debt has now reduced to £2.4m, with a further £3.2m ""invoiced but not yet due for payment"", MU said.  It added that £2.3m in payments due from Manx Gas had been cancelled on 24 December, and some later payments were made more than 70 days after they were due.  It was recently revealed that MU had refused a request to forward-purchase gas for the company for winter 2021 as the company was deemed to be a ""credit risk"". A request to extend its payment times from 30 days to 90 had also been rejected by MU in January. Earlier this month, Manx Gas CEO Jo Cox told Tynwald's Economic Policy Review Committee that a new regulatory framework approved by Tynwald in March had since given the company ""stability"". Under the agreement, a 58% hike in bills for gas customers came into force on 1 April, in response to the current volatility in the wholesale market. In a statement, Ms Cox said it was ""important to understand"" that the issues had arisen before the regulatory agreement was introduced. ""Having this framework in place is vital as prices can now follow the market in a timely manner, giving transparent pricing for all parties,"" she added.

market volatility,Business and farmers welcome deal,2024-09-15,2018-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46220456,"The draft Brexit deal has received a cautious welcome from the Northern Ireland business and farming community.  Agreement has been reached between the UK and EU on the Irish border, the main sticking point in the talks. The agreement states there will be nothing to prevent unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. Certain goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would be subject to new checks and controls. The draft deal still needs to be voted on by MPs. ""The situation remains very fluid and we are reviewing the document in detail. Ultimately, we would like a UK wide solution - full stop. ""However, this agreement does provide an insurance policy to prevent a no deal outcome, which would be disastrous for farm businesses and the economy in Northern Ireland. ""Farmers here provide safe, traceable and affordable food, while at the same time meeting some of the highest animal welfare and environmental standards in the world ""We have always argued that any deal, as far as possible, must allow the agriculture industry free and frictionless trade with the EU. ""Agri-food is the cornerstone of the Northern Ireland economy and any significant barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and EU member states, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, or Northern Ireland and Great Britain would have a major impact."" ""The agreement is the best of a bad situation at the minute. ""At least it is an agreement and it is better than a no deal, which is what a lot of businesses in Northern Ireland had started to prepare for. ""It says two things: [goods] could be checked at point of source and other points. ""But live goods are already checked coming into Northern Ireland, so it just depends on exactly where the UK wants to check those goods and how they want to check them. ""What's on the table now is not ideal, but it's definitely moving in the right direction and most businesses will take it."" ""This provides a basis for certainty for small businesses, and a means to avoid a hard border. ""We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without a withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March 2019 without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens' rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. ""We believe that the draft withdrawal agreement is a significant step back from the cliff edge, which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. ""Our first reaction is relief - we feel that the government have actually listened to us.  ""We set out proposals two years ago about what we needed to keep the UK and Northern Ireland goods flowing freely and this, although it's not perfect, ticks a lot of boxes.  ""We have to avoid friction on the island of Ireland - for goods here in Northern Ireland, we're so reliant on cross border movement.  ""For every 10 trucks that leave the Republic of Ireland coming into Northern Ireland, seven are carrying components or ingredients for goods we make here and that we send to Great Britain, so if we did have any friction or tariff on the Irish border, that not only jeopardises the competitiveness of our products, but also their mere existence. ""So there's relief, but there's a lot more work to be done."" ""NIFDA welcomes the draft withdrawal agreement as a positive development in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, and we would be hopeful that this will enable more substantive talks around our future trading relationship with the EU. ""We must be clear on the fact that a no-deal outcome would be disastrous for Northern Ireland, particularly for the agri-food sector. ""We simply could not absorb increased customs, tariffs and regulatory costs on trade between Northern Ireland and the EU. ""Whilst this agreement may not be perfect, and further clarification on certain aspects will be required, it is vastly preferable to a no-deal scenario."" ""Business leaders have been desperate for this stage of the negotiations to reach a conclusion, and although it has taken longer than firms would have liked, it is clear definitive progress has been made between the UK and EU. ""We are heartened to see that provision has been made for an extension to the transition period, which may be needed not only to avoid the deployment of the backstop, but also to ensure firms have time to adjust to any changes once the new economic partnership is agreed. ""We also urge all politicians to think long and hard about how they react to this first-stage agreement.  ""Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal."" ""Business will clearly welcome last night's announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal, however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe.  ""The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. ""The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the significant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past 24 hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning."" ""The deal provides solutions to customs, tariffs and an innovative solution on VAT. ""However, there is some work to be done by both the Westminster government and the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming into Northern Ireland from GB. ""This will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. ""We have always said the backstop is better than no deal."" ""The EU has made important concessions which would help NI businesses if the backstop is ever implemented. ""The fears and risks flagged by business seem, so far, to have been addressed. ""The issues of VAT remains a HMRC responsibility and there will be no quotas, origin rules nor tariffs between Britain and Northern Ireland."""
market volatility,Truss: Ground should have been laid for tax cuts,2024-09-15,2022-10-02,By Paul Seddon,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63107649,"Liz Truss has admitted she should have ""laid the ground better"" for her mini-budget, after it sparked days of market turmoil. The prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she had ""learned from that"", but she was confident her tax cutting package would boost economic growth. She added a decision to cut the top earner tax rate was a ""decision that the chancellor made"". And she revealed it was not discussed with the whole cabinet beforehand. The cut to the 45p rate has provoked outrage from opposition parties, and concern from some Conservative MPs. Former minister Michael Gove said the cut displayed the ""wrong values,"" and signalled he wouldn't vote for it. He also said he was ""profoundly concerned"" about the decision to borrow to fund the tax cuts, calling it ""not Conservative"". The government's mini-budget included £45bn in cuts funded by government borrowing, and revealed the government expects its two-year scheme to fix energy prices will cost £60bn in the first six months. The announcements sparked days of turbulence in financial markets, with the pound falling to a record low against the US dollar on Monday, although it has since recovered. The rocky economic backdrop is set to dominate this week's Conservative party conference, Ms Truss's first as Tory leader, where she faces the task of reassuring her MPs over her approach to boosting the flagging UK economy. Speaking from the gathering in Birmingham, Ms Truss promised to win over ""the hearts and minds"" of Tory MPs to persuade them of her plan. In an interview for the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, she said she remained committed to her approach and she was ""confident"" better growth would result. ""I do stand by the package we announced and I stand by the fact we announced it quickly, because we had to act,"" the prime minister added. ""But I do accept we should have laid the ground better. I have learned from that, and I will make sure that in future we do a better job of laying the ground."" She also defended the decision to cut the 45p income tax rate for top earners, saying it ""raises very little"" and made the tax system more complicated. She added that the cut was a decision made by Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng - prompting former cabinet minister and Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries to accuse her of throwing him ""under a bus"". And Mr Gove, who has served in several cabinet roles in previous governments, expressed concerns about scrapping the top rate at a time when ""people are suffering"". Former deputy prime minister Damian Green warned a reception at conference that the Tories would lose the next general election if ""we end up painting ourselves as the party of the rich"". Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused the government of conducting a ""mad experiment"" with the economy, calling the market turmoil a ""crisis made in Downing Street"". Also speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, she said investors had been spooked by the ""sheer scale of the borrowing"" to fund the tax cuts, alongside the decision not to publish an official economic forecast alongside the plans. She added that the public would ""pay the price"" for the turbulence, and said Ms Truss had failed to understand the ""anxiety and fear"" about the state of the economy. Just a few weeks ago, this was a conference where many would have anticipated a mood of loyal celebration.  Yes, a government and a country confronting difficult times - but a party welcoming a new prime minister; relieved to have left the arguments of the collapsing premiership of Boris Johnson behind.  Instead, with nosediving opinion poll numbers and self-inflicted economic volatility, the mood here is bleak, the outbreaks of public anger illustrative of a deeper well of private anguish.  There are few things more dangerous for a government than a perception that senior figures don't know what they are doing and are not fully in control of events.  Some Tory MPs are already privately questioning how long Liz Truss might last in office; even more say they will not support elements of her budget, not least the tax cut for the highest paid.  Senior Conservatives recognise this is a moment of considerable jeopardy for a prime minister not yet a month in the job - and the next few days will be crucial in providing reassurance for the party and the country. In a bid to reassure markets, the government has said it will set out how it plans to lower public debt in the medium term on 23 November. Pushed repeatedly on whether she planned to cut public spending, Ms Truss did not say, but added she wanted to get ""value for money for the taxpayer"". She did not commit to raising benefits in line with inflation, saying that a decision would be made later this autumn. She also rejected calls to bring forward an assessment of the government's plans from the UK's budget watchdog, currently due to be published alongside the debt plan. She added that an assessment of the spending plans was ""not yet ready"". ""There's no point in publishing something that's not ready. That would just cause confusion,"" she added."

market volatility,Pound sinks as UK economic uncertainty rises,2024-09-15,2022-10-21,By Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63340725,"The pound fell against the dollar on Friday as new figures showed a gloomy picture for the UK economy. Sterling slipped to $1.11, after rallying on Thursday as Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned. However, it clawed back losses on Friday evening and was back up to around $1.12 against the dollar. The volatility in the pound came after official figures showed government borrowing rose to its second highest September on record. Meanwhile, people are shopping less than they did before the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures from the Office For National Statistics (ONS). Retail sales fell by more than expected last month, dropping 1.4% and continuing their slide from August, the official figures showed. The pound's latest slide comes after a period of volatile trading for the currency. It plunged to a record low against the dollar last month, while government borrowing costs rose sharply in the aftermath of the mini-budget. Investors were spooked after the government promised huge tax cuts without saying how it would pay for them. Government borrowing costs also rose slightly on Friday. A fall in the US dollar against a number of currencies late Friday helped the pound regain some ground. But Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said much of the pound's moves are being driven by investors reacting to political and economic uncertainty in the UK as well as the negative economic data.  ""While sterling rallied yesterday on Truss's resignation, I think investors have realised today that it's not a guarantee that we'll get a market-friendly outcome from the Conservative leadership contest,"" she said. The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt is due to announce plans for spending and tax on 31 October in his economic plan, which the Treasury confirmed was set to go ahead, although there are reports it could be delayed due to the leadership race. Ms Foley said this uncertainty was also weighing on the pound. ""The longer the uncertainty continues, the worse it's going to be for the markets."" A fall in the value of the pound increases the price of goods and services imported into the UK from overseas - because when the pound is weak against the dollar or euro, for example, it costs more for companies in the UK to buy things such as food, raw materials or parts from abroad. A weaker pound can push rising costs higher as well if companies choose to pass on higher prices to customers. For people planning a trip overseas, changes in the pound affect how far their money will go abroad. ""Consumers are now buying less than before the pandemic,"" said Darren Morgan, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which released the figures, said. He added: ""Retailers told us that the fall in September was partly because many stores were closed for the Queen's funeral, but also because of continued price pressures leading consumers to be careful about spending."" The cost of living crisis continues to squeeze household budgets, with prices rising faster than average wages. Inflation - the rate at which UK prices rise - surged to 10.1% last month and is expected to climb further. Mr Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said all types of shops saw sales drop with food stores particularly hard hit. The UK is borrowing billions of pounds to limit energy bill rises for households and businesses. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £20bn last month, up £2.2bn from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. It is the second highest September borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, the ONS said. The figure is lower than in September 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, when the government was borrowing to fund schemes such as furlough, it said. But economists warned that government borrowing is set to rise further in the coming months. The Office For Budget Responsibility (OBR) makes independent forecasts on what impact government decisions on things like tax and spending will have on borrowing and growth. It is due to issue its latest forecast on 31 October when the chancellor is due to deliver his economic plan detailing its spending plans. Carl Emmerson, Deputy Director of think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said so far for the first half of the year government borrowing was almost as expected but warned it was likely to rise much higher. ""But this is little guide to how much borrowing will be over the whole of this financial year, as the huge cost of government support for household and business energy use only began in earnest this month."" The IFS predicts borrowing this year could reach almost £200bn, ""nearly £100bn more than the OBR forecast,"" he added. Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK, also warned that government borrowing was expected to ""only worsen from October onwards"". This was to due the government's energy price guarantee for households and businesses, on top of the second cost of living instalment and the support for pensioners, he said. The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: ""To stabilise markets, I've been clear that protecting our public finances means difficult decisions lie ahead. ""We will do whatever is necessary to drive down debt in the medium term and to ensure that taxpayers' money is well spent, putting the public finances on a sustainable path as we grow the economy."""
market volatility,Biggest UK commercial port hit by container logjam,2024-09-15,2021-10-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58888552,"The UK's largest commercial port says the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers. The Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages. However, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days. Shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it is re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the port. The Financial Times first reported on Tuesday that Maersk was re-routing ships away from Felixstowe to other European ports, where smaller vessels will be used for UK deliveries. Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe for between four to seven days. ""We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,"" he said.  ""Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge."" Problems at Felixstowe come as retailers and other groups warn of mounting concern about stocks in the run-up to Christmas trading. The port has blamed several factors for the build-up of shipping containers, including the busy pre-Christmas peak, haulage shortages, poor vessel scheduling, and the impact of the pandemic. On top of this, there are a high number of empty containers currently sitting at the port. Felixstowe said it is asking shipping lines to remove them as quickly as possible. ""The vast majority of import containers are cleared for collection within minutes of arriving and there are over 1,000 unused haulier bookings most days,"" the port stressed. ""However, the situation is improving and there is more spare space for import containers this week, than at any time since the beginning of July, when supply chain impacts first started to bite."" Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers with several sectors from retailers to domestic refuse collection affected. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help deliver fuel and to issue emergency temporary visa to foreign drivers. The shortage has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes and a backlog of HGV driver tests. Tim Morris, head of the Major Ports Group, which represents port operators, said the industry had been had been hit by a whole host of issues, including Brexit border changes, global demand for goods travelling by sea, and the pandemic.  ""It has not been easy and there have been times of real stress on the ports system,"" he said. ""Ports have taken significant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience."" The problem is not just confined to the UK. Ports across the world have also suffered significant delays. Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping. Sarah Treseder, chief executive of the trade group UK Chamber of Shipping, said there are reports of dozens of ships forced to wait outside ports in America and Asia.

market volatility,Crypto trader Coinbase worth more than oil firm BP,2024-09-15,2021-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56750102,"Cryptocurrency firm Coinbase, which runs a top exchange for Bitcoin and other digital currency trading, hit a market value of nearly $100bn (£72.5bn) in its stock market listing. Shares debuted on the Nasdaq at a price of $381, but later closed below $330. The initial valuation put Coinbase ahead of many well-known firms, such as oil giant BP and key stock exchanges. The listing was seen as the latest step toward cryptocurrencies gaining wider acceptance among traditional investors. The price of Bitcoin surged more than 300% last year - and has climbed even higher in 2021 - as firms including Tesla, Mastercard and BlackRock unveiled plans to incorporate digital currencies into their businesses. It hit a record of more than $63,000 on Tuesday, ahead of the Coinbase listing. Less well-known digital currencies have also made gains with Dogecoin, which was created as a joke, rising more than 70% to more than 13 cents. US-based Coinbase, which makes money primarily by charging transaction fees, has benefited from the soaring demand.  Founded in 2012, Coinbase had more than 56 million users across more than 100 countries and held some $223bn in users' assets at the end of March. It reported $1.8bn in estimated revenue in the first three months of 2021 - more than its total for all of 2020 - as interest in Bitcoin and other digital currencies boomed. Compared to 2018, when investors reckoned Coinbase was worth $8bn in a private funding round, the firm's value has increased more than ten-fold. Wednesday's listing was set to make Coinbase co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong one of the wealthiest people in the world. The 38-year-old, a former Airbnb software engineer, owns a roughly 21% stake in the company. For outside investors, buying shares in Coinbase is seen as a potentially less risky way to tap into the activity in the crypto market, without investing directly in Bitcoin or other digital currencies, which have attracted warnings from financial regulators. But Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank said tougher rules, if enacted, could change the outlook for Coinbase. ""There does appear to be a little bit of a slow march towards acceptability,"" she said.  ""There's a lot of concern that at some point the regulators, the central banks, might just say, 'well, no,' and make this a lot more difficult and at that point many people could stand to lose a lot of money."" Last year, Coinbase's revenues hit $1.3bn, more than double that of 2019. Profits were $322m, compared to a loss of more than $30m in 2019. On Wednesday, the company's share price initially jumped, hitting a high of nearly $430 at one point. But it later dropped back, hitting a low of $118 before ending the trading session at roughly $328.  That would give the firm a valuation of about $86bn. This is a bit of a moment for crypto currency. Digital currencies have long been seen as a high risk bet for investors - a 'you only live once' investment. Over the years though, crypto has slowly gained some credibility - and has delivered astonishing returns for some investors. Several major companies have said they want to introduce crypto as a form of payment. But this is perhaps an even greater step on the road to crypto credibility. The attraction for investors is that it feels like a safer way to invest in crypto itself. Coinbase's market price will be linked to how well currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing. But the fact that the firm has such an range of currencies you can buy and sell means investors may feel they are more insulated from wild changes in the price of a single currency. The big worry for investors taking a punt on crypto is that authorities will move to limit or even shut them down.  Mining some digital currencies can be hugely environmentally damaging, and the currencies themselves have been linked to organised crime.  Coinbase, then, may be seen as a more acceptable place for funds to take a punt on digital currencies. Executives said the firm's performance would vary amid the swings in notoriously volatile digital currencies, but over the long term it was poised for growth. ""There's going to be volatility with new technologies and the companies associated with them. That's ok. That's a feature, not a bug,"" Coinbase president Emily Choi told the BBC. ""If you believe in the long term idea about digital value and what crypto assets create, you're just going to play this as a long-term thing."" Coinbase's market debut comes at a time when investors have shown high demand for newly listed companies, sending their valuations soaring at trading launches. The firm listed its shares with a sale of existing stock, rather than issuing new equity as would occur in a more typical initial public offering. "
market volatility,Bitcoin sets fresh records after Musk investment,2024-09-15,2021-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55984393,"Bitcoin has hit record highs for a second day after Elon Musk's car company Tesla said it had bought about $1.5bn (£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin rose above $48,000 (£34,820) before falling back, but it remains about 25% higher than a week ago. Some investors took Tesla's move as a signal that Bitcoin would become a mainstream financial asset. However, there was some criticism about a green car firm investing in such an energy intensive currency. Bitcoin currently uses more energy than Argentina every year, according to analysis from the University of Cambridge. Production of the cryptocurrency, known as ""Bitcoin mining"", needs energy-hungry computer hardware and ever-greater amounts of processing power. Mike Butcher, an editor at news website Techcrunch, tweeted: ""Tesla: Sells carbon credits to buy Bitcoin, which requires as much energy (not always Green energy) as a small country to mine."" Bitcoin is a form of digital money. This means it doesn't have a physical form. Instead, units of digital currency are traded over a computer network. It operates over a global network with thousands upon thousands of nodes - a machine within a network like a computer or some other device - which together process and store transactions. Explaining its investment on Monday, Tesla said that it wanted to maximise returns on cash lying dormant in the company's accounts. It also expects to accept payment for its electric cars in Bitcoin in future.  The moves sparked market interest which carried on into Tuesday. Shares of companies that provide trading platforms for Bitcoin and the technology to mine the cryptocurrency have surged in China, South Korea and Australia, and big computer chip-making firms such as SK Hynix also rose. The cryptocurrency has already risen in value by 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally in 2020, as investors search for alternative assets at a time when interest rates in many countries are at record lows. Bitcoin has had some interest from big investment firms, including Blackrock, which recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency. However, central banks remain sceptical about the cryptocurrency. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method, saying it lacked ""intrinsic value"" unlike cash or gold.  Some institutional investors are also wary of the price volatility of Bitcoin. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said: ""The average institutional investor is shaking their head. ""For these folks who are believers in cryptocurrency, [Tesla's investment] gives them another layer of support that crypto is the future."" But Bitcoin scepticism does not mean that central banks and regulators are against digital currencies per se. In China in particular regulators are starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use."
market volatility,Mortgage safety net 'disappearing',2024-09-15,2017-12-11,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42311583,"Ministers should consider strengthening the safety net for homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage, a report suggests. Help for this group introduced in response to the financial crisis will be largely withdrawn by 2022. Academics, commissioned by lenders' trade body UK Finance, said the government should review its position. However, mortgage applicants must now prove they have a buffer to deal with money shocks and rising interest rates.  Various schemes have been in place to help those facing arrears or, ultimately, repossession of their property if they face financial difficulties. One of the major schemes is Support for Mortgage Interest, which helps those on certain benefits, owing to their low income, to receive help to meet the interest payments on a mortgage. Next year, this will be replaced by a loan.  The Universal Credit benefit system, which merges various working-age benefits, also has less mortgage support for those in low-paid or part-time work than the current system of tax credits and other welfare. The UK Finance report said: ""It is now evident that by 2022, there will only be limited government financial support for home buyers in distress, and that will mainly be in the form of loans for those not in work."" Instead, borrowers and their lenders would be expected to come to an arrangement on mortgage payments. ""Recognising the relatively open nature of the UK mortgage market and the continued volatility of our housing market, this report suggests it would be timely for government to review the homeowner safety net situation systematically and comprehensively,"" the report concludes. Low interest rates and a less aggressive stance by lenders have meant comparatively few people have lost their homes in recent years. Fewer homes were repossessed last year than in any year since 1982, but lenders have warned that mortgage rates will not always be so favourable. Financial information service Moneyfacts said that even the recent rise in the Bank rate from 0.25% to 0.5% had not been felt by all variable mortgage holders, with the average rate rising by only 0.14%. However, there is widespread expectation that mortgage rates will not get any cheaper. In response, the UK Finance report said: ""Households have become very used to enjoying low and falling mortgage rates and many have extended their secured and unsecured debt despite static wages. The Bank of England rightly reminds us that this poses significant risks."" Stricter regulation means that mortgage applicants must prove they can deal with rising interest rates, but the report suggests that this will not cover all homeowners, nor would it protect everyone who has a financial shock, such as a sudden drop in income. It suggests that Universal Credit could be beefed up to help some of those struggling with their mortgage while in low-paid work."
market volatility,Student numbers drop in Welsh unis,2024-09-15,2018-05-07,By Bethan Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44004774,"Five out of Wales' eight universities have seen a drop in student enrolments of up to a quarter over the last three years. Since 2013-14 student numbers at Glyndwr in Wrexham and Aberystwyth universities have fallen by 24%. A senior figure said Welsh universities were in ""a very competitive market"" where removing a cap on student numbers in England had a knock-on effect. Nevertheless, enrolments at Swansea jumped by 29%. Dr David Blaney, chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, admitted there was a degree of volatility around the UK universities sector. ""Universities in Wales are part of a market, predominantly with England but actually UK and internationally and it's a very competitive market,"" he said. ""So what we have seen particularly in England is removal of constraints on student numbers which means that some institutions in England - the stronger ones in the market in particular - have grown and that's had a knock-on impact across the whole of the system."" He said students were discerning and looking to make careful choices, taking note of the experiences of those already studying. Dr Blaney said universities had to look beyond the prospectus and advertising. ""If the message coming through social media from existing students is not strong then none of that will have an impact so you really have to look after the interests of the students that you've got,"" he added. Swansea University had 19,160 student enrolments in 2016-17 and they are aiming to get to 20,000 by their centenary in 2020. Pro Vice-Chancellor Prof Iwan Davies said student experience was ""critical"" and with students paying thousands in course fees employability, he said was also a key factor. ""It's great they're here in Swansea, we are in the top 15 in terms of employability in the league tables,"" he said. ""I'm very proud of the relevance of what we offer and the students of course are discerning and they've seen that."" Wrexham Glyndwr University saw student numbers fall from a peak of 9,535 in 2011-12 to 6,415 in 2016-17. A spokesman said there was a ""strategic change of direction"" during the period with a move away from international recruitment. International students made up 28% of enrolments in 2013-14 but by 2016-17 the figure was under 9%. ""During this same period, Welsh student enrolment actually increased from 42% to 62% which highlights success in our strategic change,"" he added. Aberystwyth University said its recruitment patterns had been affected by changes to how much universities could charge. ""The introduction of high tuition fees in 2012 marked a sea-change for the sector and saw a record intake at Aberystwyth University in 2011 - a large cohort which carried through to 2013-14,"" a spokesman said. Dr Blaney said there were still concerns about underfunding and a disparity in what goes into the Welsh system compared to England, with more resources towards supporting students rather than supporting for institutions. Changes to student finance in Wales, which will be introduced from this autumn, mean the tuition fee grant of £5,100 will be scrapped and replaced with a maintenance grant of just over £8,000 for students from the most disadvantaged families. Dr Blaney said the changes following a review by Prof Ian Diamond would rebalance the position ""substantially"" and he believes Wales will catch up with England in terms of investment although it may take several years.  ""At the moment the Welsh sector is arguably slightly less well resourced than the English sector,"" he said. ""So that means that they have to work harder to look attractive which they are doing."" Prof Davies said Swansea had been fortunate in terms of European funding in recent years and he said the Diamond reforms would ""go a long way"" to addressing concerns about the Welsh system being underfunded. But he warned: ""Welsh universities should not be disadvantaged in terms of our competitiveness with our friends in England."""
market volatility,Pret A Manger owner buys Miller Homes,2024-09-15,2017-08-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-40807683,"Scottish housebuilder Miller Homes has been bought by the private equity group which owns sandwich chain Pret A Manger in a deal worth £655m. Bridgepoint confirmed the acquisition of one of the UK's largest housebuilders on Wednesday. Established in 1934, Miller Homes focuses on regional markets such as the north of England, Midlands and Scotland. In 2016, the Edinburgh-based company completed a total of 2,380 homes.  Last year it reported a 13% increase in revenue to £565m and a 31% increase in operating profit to £103m. Miller Homes chief executive Chris Endsor said: ""2016 was an outstanding year for Miller Homes delivering operating profit in excess of £100m for the first time and outperforming on all key financial metrics for the fifth consecutive year.  ""We fully expect 2017 to continue that upward trend."" Bridgepoint partner Jamie Wyatt said: ""The UK regional markets in which Miller operates are in good health with a positive sales environment and an attractive land buying market.  ""Miller's strategic position within those markets combined with its historic robust financial performance position it well to address future growth in the UK new build housing market where demand currently outstrips supply."" In 2014, Miller Homes shelved plans to float on the London Stock Exchange, blaming market volatility."
market volatility,Pound sinks as UK economic uncertainty rises,2024-09-15,2022-10-21,By Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63340725,"The pound fell against the dollar on Friday as new figures showed a gloomy picture for the UK economy. Sterling slipped to $1.11, after rallying on Thursday as Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned. However, it clawed back losses on Friday evening and was back up to around $1.12 against the dollar. The volatility in the pound came after official figures showed government borrowing rose to its second highest September on record. Meanwhile, people are shopping less than they did before the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures from the Office For National Statistics (ONS). Retail sales fell by more than expected last month, dropping 1.4% and continuing their slide from August, the official figures showed. The pound's latest slide comes after a period of volatile trading for the currency. It plunged to a record low against the dollar last month, while government borrowing costs rose sharply in the aftermath of the mini-budget. Investors were spooked after the government promised huge tax cuts without saying how it would pay for them. Government borrowing costs also rose slightly on Friday. A fall in the US dollar against a number of currencies late Friday helped the pound regain some ground. But Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said much of the pound's moves are being driven by investors reacting to political and economic uncertainty in the UK as well as the negative economic data.  ""While sterling rallied yesterday on Truss's resignation, I think investors have realised today that it's not a guarantee that we'll get a market-friendly outcome from the Conservative leadership contest,"" she said. The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt is due to announce plans for spending and tax on 31 October in his economic plan, which the Treasury confirmed was set to go ahead, although there are reports it could be delayed due to the leadership race. Ms Foley said this uncertainty was also weighing on the pound. ""The longer the uncertainty continues, the worse it's going to be for the markets."" A fall in the value of the pound increases the price of goods and services imported into the UK from overseas - because when the pound is weak against the dollar or euro, for example, it costs more for companies in the UK to buy things such as food, raw materials or parts from abroad. A weaker pound can push rising costs higher as well if companies choose to pass on higher prices to customers. For people planning a trip overseas, changes in the pound affect how far their money will go abroad. ""Consumers are now buying less than before the pandemic,"" said Darren Morgan, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which released the figures, said. He added: ""Retailers told us that the fall in September was partly because many stores were closed for the Queen's funeral, but also because of continued price pressures leading consumers to be careful about spending."" The cost of living crisis continues to squeeze household budgets, with prices rising faster than average wages. Inflation - the rate at which UK prices rise - surged to 10.1% last month and is expected to climb further. Mr Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said all types of shops saw sales drop with food stores particularly hard hit. The UK is borrowing billions of pounds to limit energy bill rises for households and businesses. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £20bn last month, up £2.2bn from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. It is the second highest September borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, the ONS said. The figure is lower than in September 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, when the government was borrowing to fund schemes such as furlough, it said. But economists warned that government borrowing is set to rise further in the coming months. The Office For Budget Responsibility (OBR) makes independent forecasts on what impact government decisions on things like tax and spending will have on borrowing and growth. It is due to issue its latest forecast on 31 October when the chancellor is due to deliver his economic plan detailing its spending plans. Carl Emmerson, Deputy Director of think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said so far for the first half of the year government borrowing was almost as expected but warned it was likely to rise much higher. ""But this is little guide to how much borrowing will be over the whole of this financial year, as the huge cost of government support for household and business energy use only began in earnest this month."" The IFS predicts borrowing this year could reach almost £200bn, ""nearly £100bn more than the OBR forecast,"" he added. Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK, also warned that government borrowing was expected to ""only worsen from October onwards"". This was to due the government's energy price guarantee for households and businesses, on top of the second cost of living instalment and the support for pensioners, he said. The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: ""To stabilise markets, I've been clear that protecting our public finances means difficult decisions lie ahead. ""We will do whatever is necessary to drive down debt in the medium term and to ensure that taxpayers' money is well spent, putting the public finances on a sustainable path as we grow the economy."""
market volatility,How small businesses survive global market shocks,2024-09-15,2023-01-05,By Jill Martin Wrenn,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64151515,"Sherene Headley got a big surprise when she checked the invoice from her manufacturer in China this past autumn. The founder and chief executive of Mokkah, a London-based company that makes shoes in large sizes for women, had ordered 57 pairs of black suede boots to sell to customers. But the manufacturer's invoice, which was priced in US dollars, was about 20% more expensive than Ms Headley had expected. When the British pound sank to a record low against the US dollar in September, her fledgling company's overseas buying power dropped with it. The pound's fall makes goods priced in dollars much more expensive to buy. For any business, that can be a shock; for a new business, it can be debilitating. ""A lot of small businesses, their margins are quite small when they're trying to get their businesses out there,"" Ms Headley says. ""So I knew from the outset that I could never compete with the High Street [on price] because we just haven't got the resources to be able to do that."" From its inception, Mokkah has been a lean, bootstrapped company. Using Crowdfunder, the fundraising platform, Ms Headley raised £13,000 in June 2020, to launch the firm. Thanks to advice from her business mentor, Ms Headley prices her products high enough to protect against unexpected increased costs. ""Luckily for me, who is new to business, I was able to put some measures in place so my selling rate for the UK would work out OK, even with this increased conversion,"" Ms Headley says. ""It would still allow me the space to be able to be like, 'this is what I could plug back in to get another pair of shoes, or another sample made'."" While the pound has stabilised since September, it is still historically low against the US dollar. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. You might think that this would help Ms Headley boost exports to the US, as her shoes are cheaper to buy in dollars than they would be if the pound was higher. However, the weak pound has meant that the cost of global shipping has risen sharply for UK exporters. ""The real challenge I would say, when it does come, is if I was to increase my sales abroad,"" says Ms Headley. ""At the moment, I do have quite a few customers that buy from America, but the bulk of my sales are here in the UK."" For small manufacturers in the US, the high value of the dollar makes their products more expensive for overseas customers, making it harder for them to win export orders. Molly Fienning, chief executive of South Carolina-based Red Clay Hot Sauce, says she would still love to expand her company's overseas sales in the years ahead. ""We need to find that right [overseas] partner,"" she says. ""We want to really own our backyard, and own the South, then own the US, then think about global."" Ms Fienning says that in addition to the currency issue, she has seen the cost of key business expenses, such as the price of cardboard boxes and how much she has to pay freight firms, reach their highest levels since she became chief executive in 2018. To insulate the business from any currency swings, Red Clay only sources its ingredients from within the US. These include sweet peppers, raw honey and white wine vinegar. ""We started with all Southern products, and then as we've scaled, we've needed more peppers and more honey,"" Ms Fienning says. Now, the company sources peppers from up and down the east coast of the US, from Florida to New York, and uses honey manufacturers in Georgia and Colorado. Back in the UK, experts say that currency volatility is just one of numerous challenges for small firms. ""I would say in general small UK companies are being challenged on several fronts,"" says financial commentator Todd Benjamin. ""These include Brexit, a weaker currency if importing materials, higher labour costs due to wage inflation, higher taxation due to the chancellor's announcement in the Autumn Statement, and an economy that is weaker for the foreseeable future."" In Istanbul, Pinar Büyükbalci, associate professor of entrepreneurship at the city's Yildiz Technical University, says that global investors are increasingly wary of investing in emerging economies that have seen their currencies drop sharply against the dollar, such as Turkey and its lira. ""What we have been witnessing over the last year and a half is the very strict and cautious approach of foreign investors, when thinking about making further investment in start-ups in Turkey, and also in all other emerging markets,"" she says. Timuçin Bilgör, the president of the Turkish-based investor network, Buba Ventures, agrees that it is now more difficult for new firms to find overseas investment. ""The challenge is finding money,"" he says, adding that investors want to see more proof of success before they take the plunge.  With higher interest global rates, funds are also now more expensive. ""The money is not cheap anymore,"" says Mr Bilgör.  The bottom line for new businesses is to prepare for anything, and to try to add padding to prices to allow for shocks. ""So when it came to me creating my brand, luckily I was able to build in certain room for issues,"" says Mokkah's Ms Headley. ""I didn't really expect it to be a currency thing, and I'm hoping that with time it starts to improve."""
market volatility,Biggest UK commercial port hit by container logjam,2024-09-15,2021-10-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58888552,"The UK's largest commercial port says the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers. The Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages. However, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days. Shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it is re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the port. The Financial Times first reported on Tuesday that Maersk was re-routing ships away from Felixstowe to other European ports, where smaller vessels will be used for UK deliveries. Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe for between four to seven days. ""We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,"" he said.  ""Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge."" Problems at Felixstowe come as retailers and other groups warn of mounting concern about stocks in the run-up to Christmas trading. The port has blamed several factors for the build-up of shipping containers, including the busy pre-Christmas peak, haulage shortages, poor vessel scheduling, and the impact of the pandemic. On top of this, there are a high number of empty containers currently sitting at the port. Felixstowe said it is asking shipping lines to remove them as quickly as possible. ""The vast majority of import containers are cleared for collection within minutes of arriving and there are over 1,000 unused haulier bookings most days,"" the port stressed. ""However, the situation is improving and there is more spare space for import containers this week, than at any time since the beginning of July, when supply chain impacts first started to bite."" Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers with several sectors from retailers to domestic refuse collection affected. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help deliver fuel and to issue emergency temporary visa to foreign drivers. The shortage has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes and a backlog of HGV driver tests. Tim Morris, head of the Major Ports Group, which represents port operators, said the industry had been had been hit by a whole host of issues, including Brexit border changes, global demand for goods travelling by sea, and the pandemic.  ""It has not been easy and there have been times of real stress on the ports system,"" he said. ""Ports have taken significant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience."" The problem is not just confined to the UK. Ports across the world have also suffered significant delays. Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping. Sarah Treseder, chief executive of the trade group UK Chamber of Shipping, said there are reports of dozens of ships forced to wait outside ports in America and Asia. ""We anticipate the disruption will continue while the underlying market volatility stabilises,"" she said."
market volatility,'China's Netflix' dips in US stock debut,2024-09-15,2018-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43592981,"Chinese video streaming service iQiyi - often called China's Netflix - made a rocky US stock market debut as it launched on the Nasdaq.  Shares opened slightly ahead of the $18 listing price, before quickly falling back and closing down 14%. But iQiyi chief executive Gong Yu said he was not concerned about the ""short term volatility"". The firm, controlled by Chinese internet giant Baidu, raised more than $2.2bn (£1.6bn) in the listing. The initial public offering (IPO) gave the streaming service a valuation of about $12.7bn. Despite the initial stock price fall, Mr Gong was confident about the firm's future prospects.  ""Long term, you'll see how much value the IPO creates,"" he told the Reuters news agency.  iQiYi had more than 50 million subscribers by the end of 2017 and an average of more than 420 million mobile users per month, according to Reuters. But while revenues have risen in recent years, iQiyi has never posted a profit since it launched in 2010.

market volatility,Will the UK financial chaos spark a wider meltdown?,2024-09-15,2022-10-14,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63221410,"The recent chaos on the UK financial markets has generated waves of stress and selling by investors far beyond the UK. As the sell-offs collide with high inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine, they have raised fears the turmoil in the UK could set off a wider crisis. Many analysts have said they believe the fallout is likely to be limited, especially amid signs that the government is reconsidering some of its plans. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked on Friday, and the government has dropped parts of the package of tax cuts that initially sparked the market turmoil. But the episode has highlighted the financial risks of the current moment. ""Markets are fragile. We have seen vulnerability that's been building over the last decade-plus,"" Fabio Natalucci, a deputy director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said earlier this week, describing the UK episode as a ""warning shot"".  ""That fragility makes the financial risk much more elevated.""  Borrowing costs in the UK shot up last month, triggered by Mr Kwarteng's announcement of £45bn of tax cuts in his mini-budget, which the government said would help reignite economic growth.  But he did not say how he would pay for them, which alarmed investors already worried about the UK's dim economic prospects. They swiftly sold off their holdings of UK government debt, also called bonds or gilts. The sell-off in UK government bonds prompted a dramatic change in their value.  Prices dropped and investors demanded a higher interest rate for holding a riskier investment, creating major volatility in what is usually considered a stable, safe investment.  That kind of swing can have big ripple effects, as investment firms adjust their holdings to cover losses and the increased risk. In the UK, some of the first cracks appeared at pension funds, giant investment firms that manage people's retirement savings and typically put a big chunk towards investments like government debt. Facing losses that were at risk of spiralling, pension funds pleaded for help from the Bank of England, which agreed to step in and buy government debt as an emergency intervention. In fact, the Bank of England ended up stepping in three times. The sudden rise in borrowing costs also meant chaos for the UK housing market, where mortgage rates on typical two and five-year fixed deals have jumped to more than 6% for the first time in over a decade. Analysts expect the rise in mortgage rates to spark a fall in property prices, meaning that another investment often seen as pretty safe is suffering a major, rapid change in value.   Interest rates on some US and European government debt have also jumped alongside the UK's. And as UK firms respond to the changing market, they have dumped some of their riskier assets, creating knock-on effects. For example, selling of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), a term for bundles of corporate debt, jumped in the weeks after the UK announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported. That is a part of the market that some already saw as full of financial risks.   ""There is a general sense of unease in financial markets because we never know where the landmines are buried,"" said economist Barry Eichengreen, professor at the University of California, Berkeley.   ""People are worried about which insurance companies and which pension funds and which bond markets are in a delicate state at the moment and we never know for sure. ""When bad things happen anywhere, people pause and global risk aversion rises."" IMF officials said last week that global financial instability was now verging on crisis levels, as investors pull back. ""We are certainly at a stressed moment,"" said Tobias Adrian, financial counsellor at the IMF warned, noting that indicators of strain, like demand for dollars, have surged. ""The only times when things were worse was in times of acute crisis."" The organisation did not forecast a major financial blow-up, noting that the traditional banking system in major economies like the US and UK has become more resilient in response to regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. But there are more vulnerabilities in emerging markets, where the Fund estimates that 29% of banks are at risk of financial problems in the event of a sudden, serious downturn. In the US and UK, officials are also worried about unknown problems in the large ""shadow banking"" system - where investors develop and trade debt products largely outside the view of regulators. As central banks around the world raise interest rates, those piles of debt may come under strain. ""When we look at the safety and soundness of the financial system... we should look at not only the banks but also the non-bank lenders,"" Ben Bernanke, who led the US central bank during the 2008 financial crisis, warned on Monday. He was speaking at a press conference that was supposed to be about his winning the Nobel prize in economics, but was dominated by questions about the current economic risks. For now, the turmoil stemming from the UK appears to be a ""bump in the road,"" Jamie Dimon, head of US bank colossus JP Morgan said Friday.  But he warned: ""There are going to be other surprises""."
market volatility,UK interest rates cut to lowest level in history,2024-09-15,2020-03-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51962982,"The Bank of England has cut interest rates again in an emergency move as it tries to support the UK economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the second cut in interest rates in just over a week, bringing them down to 0.1% from 0.25%. Interest rates are now at the lowest ever in the Bank's 325-year history. The Bank said it would also increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by £200bn with an effort to lower the cost of borrowing.  It's a dramatic move by Andrew Bailey, who only took over from Mark Carney as Bank of England governor on Monday. Last week, the Bank announced a 0.5% cut in rates to 0.25% and a package of measures to help businesses and individuals cope with the economic damage caused by the virus. The move coincided with additional measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Budget. However, the Bank said the measures it had taken so far were not going to be enough, and believed ""a further package of measures was warranted"". ""The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but should be temporary,"" it added. The move comes as international investors are trying to secure more cash, in particular dollars. This means they're ditching assets such as UK government gilts, which are the ""IOU"" notes the government hands over to private investors willing to lend it money.  As the gilts are sold, the price drops and the yield - the effective interest rate compared to the price - rises. What that means is the cost of borrowing to private investors as well as to the government rises - just when the Bank of England wants it to fall and the government is about to borrow huge sums.  The Bank of England's plan to buy £200bn more bonds is aimed at fighting that effect.  The fresh rate cut takes interest rates to the lowest they can feasibly go, said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group.  ""Lower rates and additional quantitative easing can keep markets satisfied and borrowing costs for both businesses and the government down but unless money is forced into the hands of small businesses soon, then it will be for nothing; they are the ones laying off staff due to a liquidity shock,"" he added. Karen Ward, chief European market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: The support to the economy and health system will require vastly higher government borrowing. The central bank showing willing to buy government debt will ensure the market can absorb this additional issuance without undue stress."" The Bank of England Governor has said today's second emergency rate cut in just over a week occurred after financial markets became ""borderline disorderly"", with fears about coronavirus leading to a rush into the US dollar away from sterling and lending to the UK government. ""We've seen very sharp moves in financial markets in the last few days, which is the pace of which frankly, was increasing very rapidly. And we were moving into conditions that were if not disorderly, frankly, bordering on disorderly let me put it that way,"" Andrew Bailey told journalists.  The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee had an emergency call this morning so that rate cuts and further ""quantitative easing"" could be agreed and announced, with the Bank needing to be ""on the offensive"" because: ""We can't wait for the hard economic data it will be too late by then"", he said.  He said he had seen a range of private forecasts about the economic impact of the current crisis: ""We don't have a precise forecast - every picture we look at has a very sharp V in it"". The governor also partly blamed rumours that appeared to emerge from Westminster of a shutdown to London for adding to the volatility in markets that saw sterling fall 5% against the dollar. Such a shutdown would be likely to impact on the functioning of the City. He said: ""I do have to say that, you know, there were rumours going on the market this time yesterday that there was going to be a lockdown in London. And I'd observe that did cause market prices to start moving around at that point. But I think the government has been clear, and it's clear that that is not the intention at the moment."" The governor also said that he had already intervened to try to get loans to businesses to keep people in employment, and he said the Bank had its thinking cap on as regards further monetary boosts it can make.  He reiterated his lack of enthusiasm for zero or negative interest rates because of their impact on the banking system's capacity to lend, and suggested that was the reason for limiting the cut to an unusual 0.15% (rather than the usual 0.25% or 0.5%) to a record low of 0.1%.  The key Monetary Policy Committee will meet again next week."
market volatility,Madoff investigator accuses GE of $38bn fraud,2024-09-15,2019-08-15,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49352765,"A private financial investigator who flagged warnings about Bernard Madoff's $65bn Ponzi scheme is now targeting one of America's blue chip companies. In a 175-page report Harry Markopolos claimed General Electric (GE) was hiding an accounting scandal. He accused GE of concealing $38.1bn in potential losses and alleged the company's cash situation was far worse than disclosed. GE called it ""meritless, misguided and self-serving speculation"". Chief executive Lawrence Culp also accused Mr Markopolos of ""false statements of fact"" and said he had not checked his facts with GE before publishing. Mr Markopolos's analysis of GE's financial position, called General Electric: A Bigger Fraud Than Enron, claims: ""The $38bn in accounting fraud amounts to over 40% of GE's market capitalization, making it far more serious than either the Enron or WorldCom accounting frauds.""  The report highlights the conglomerate's exposure to long-term care insurance in the US and its oil industry services business. Mr Markopolos's referencing of two of corporate America's most notorious frauds in the report was seen as potentially serious, as both led to criminal prosecutions.  GE's share price fell 15% on Thursday following news of the report and an appearance by Mr Markopolos on the CNBC television network. The stock closed down 11%, GE's worse one-day fall in 11 years. As a sign of faith in his company, Mr Culp bought $2m worth of GE shares, according to reports. Mr Markopolos disclosed that he had given an advance copy of his report to an unnamed hedge fund, and would receive a percentage of the profits from any share price movement. Some analysts dismissed the report, with John Hempton, co-founder of the Bronte Capital hedge fund calling it ""silly"". However, Reuters noted that there are Wall Street analysts who have long been concerned about claims of GE's low cash flow, charges and asset writedowns, and alleged opaque financial reports. In the past two years GE has announced more than $40bn in writedowns and accounting charges. The company has also disclosed that its accounting is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Mr Culp told reporters in the US that Mr Markopolos' report contained factual errors and constituted ""market manipulation - pure and simple"", because the investigator stood to profit from short-selling tied to its release. Earlier, GE issued a robust response to Mr Markopolos: ""We remain focused on running our business every day and... will not be distracted by this type of meritless, misguided and self-serving speculation."" The company said it ""stands behind its financials"" and operates to the ""highest-level of integrity"" in its financial reporting. ""Mr Markopolos openly acknowledges that he is compensated by unnamed hedge funds. Such funds are financially motivated to attempt to generate short selling in a company's stock to create unnecessary volatility."" He is best known for alerting regulators in the early 2000s to signs that money manager Bernard Madoff's investment firm was a Ponzi scheme, a deception in which unusually high returns for early investors are generated with money from later investors.  Madoff was arrested in 2008 and later sentenced to 150 years in prison for the fraud."
market volatility,Manx Utilities seeks 5.7% sewerage rate rise,2024-09-15,2023-11-20,Alex Blake,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz42149zdn2o,"A proposal to implement a 5.7% hike in sewerage rates on the Isle of Man has been put forward by Manx Utilities. The government-owned utilities provider is set to increase water and electricity rates by inflation from April, but needs Tynwald approval for changes to the sewerage rate. The change is set to cost Manx households about £19 more a year and increase the firm's annual revenue by £800,000. The planned inflationary rises coincide with the extension of the firm's pricing strategy for a further year. The authority's current pricing strategy was agreed by Tynwald in 2018 and was in effect until 1 April this year.  Manx Utilities said more time was needed for the strategy to be ""reviewed and updated"" due to the ""significant volatility in wholesale energy markets over the last two years"". MU will formally request approval for the increase at the December sitting of Tynwald. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X? You can also send story ideas to IsleofMan@bbc.co.uk"
market volatility,The workers laid off for the first time,2024-09-15,2023-01-16,Megan Tatum,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230113-the-workers-laid-off-for-the-first-time,"Getting your job cut can be jarring, to say the least. But for workers who’ve never been through layoffs, it can sting particularly badly. Shamari Coleman never considered herself a person who’d get laid off. But in December 2022, shortly after taking a product-marketing position at multinational tech firm AvePoint, the 28-year-old found herself without a job. “I loved the team I was working with and the culture that was fostered there,” says New York City-based Coleman. “It was my first taste of working at a big tech company, and I felt like I’d be there as long as they’d have me.” But five months later, she woke up to an email from the CEO, announcing they’d decided to lay off 5% of their workforce. All Coleman could do was wait to see if she was affected. “A few hours later, I was invited to a meeting with someone from HR and a department manager, and that was that.”  The layoff was unexpected, of course, but the possibility she could be axed in the current climate wasn’t unfathomable, she says. “I was always uneasy, because working in the tech industry, I’d been seeing post after post since around May that year of people getting laid off. It was always in the back of my mind.” Indeed, according to layoffs.fyi, which has tracked tech layoffs globally since the pandemic, more than 150,000 people were laid off in 2022, across more than 1,000 tech companies.  Still, being jobless shook Coleman’s self-confidence. Having graduated with a degree in political sciences in New York, she’d immediately set her sights on the tech sector, working with early-stage start-ups in San Francisco for nearly two years before finding this large tech job. “I was the person that would go out and get interviews and get offers or leverage offers. I felt like I was always in control of my career, and this was the first time I felt like I wasn’t.” Like Coleman, many people affected by the layoffs that have swept the globe in the past 12 months have never faced redundancy before. Lots of these workers have been ambitious high achievers at top firms, who are now confronted by the brutal reality that hard work and talent isn’t always enough. Beyond scrambling to re-think career plans, some workers have found their confidence dented in an unexpected way. Yet it’s not all bad news. ‘What do I do with myself now?’ It isn’t surprising that Coleman was left with a shaken sense of identity after being laid off, says Paula Allen, global leader and senior vice-president of research and total wellbeing at Canadian HR- and tech-firm LifeWorks. “For anyone, being laid off is difficult … But for people early in their career who have always been high achievers, it can be particularly hard, because there’s a feeling they’ve always been in control of their destiny – that they’re the one that people want,” she says. As a result, they’re left questioning what they may have done or how they might have performed differently. But that often has no value, adds Allen. “You’re not going to find any insights, because you didn’t do anything wrong.” Even workers who understand their layoffs weren’t personal in nature can experience these ripple effects. Toronto-based Stella Alexandrova had been at Canadian e-commerce company Shopify for three-and-a-half years when she found out she was one of roughly 1,000 employees laid off by the firm in July last year. “It was my dream job and my dream company,” she says of her role as a growth lead. “Getting that job had felt like the next big step in my career.” In the days leading up to the cuts, she and her team had been busy working to deadlines and pursuing leads. So, when the email arrived in her inbox on a Tuesday morning, just after she’d rolled out of bed and was sipping coffee at her desk, she was shocked that her time there was abruptly over. “It’s like, what do I do with myself now?” she says. “We’d started to hear about other tech layoffs, but you just don’t think you’ll be affected until you are. It wasn’t expected in any way.” Having never experienced redundancy before, her head was initially full of questions about why she’d been chosen. “You start thinking, did something happen? I didn’t think I’d done anything that meant it could be based on my performance. And that was confirmed later. My whole team was part of the layoff. But you can't help to initially question whether it was performance-based, and that does shake up your confidence.” Being laid off can also be a financial blow, of course – and often even more so for those laid off for the first time, who may not have significant savings or experience of how to navigate a sudden loss of income; or for highly skilled workers, for whom being laid off was completely unexpected. Coleman had been contributing to multiple savings accounts since 2020, as part of a personal goal to become more financially savvy, and felt “financially OK” when the her layoff hit in December. Still, the loss of income was still a source of anxiety. “There’s a general sense of worry of, will I have a new role before this money runs out? As of right now, though, I’m doing OK.” In some cases, generous severance packages might also mitigate anxiety around a loss of income, says Dion McKenzie, co-founder of non-profit talent network Colorintech, headquartered in London. “But there’s definitely a financial impact. Let’s face it – younger people coming in at entry level, or with perhaps three-to-five years’ experience, don’t necessarily have a windfall,” says McKenzie. “That, in addition to the cost-of-living crisis definitely carries a financial burden, especially as a lot of these salaries are composed of [stock] options, which are now underwater and undervalued.” ‘Put yourself first’ Once the initial shock has subsided and people start to consider their next move, the impact of being laid off can manifest differently. For some, there’s a lingering uncertainty around putting themselves back out there in the jobs market. “For some people, this loss – of control, of income, of their expectations in terms of work identity – is extraordinarily traumatic,” says Allen. “It changes them. It changes how they approach work.” They may become obsessive over-achievers working 100-hour weeks, or develop significant anxiety in their next role, Allen adds. Coleman felt nervous about finding her next job in the tech sector. “It affected my confidence. The current tech market is fiercer than any other market I’ve worked in, and I’m not only competing with a small group of people now, but with those that were at Meta and Twitter and were also laid off. It’s a fight between that feeling of insecurity and realising that I’m qualified and capable, too.” It's also changed the way Coleman looks at potential opportunities. While it hasn’t explicitly deterred her from looking for a job in tech, despite its volatility, she says, “it's taught me to always do what's best for you, and put yourself first, because these companies will always put themselves and their bottom line first”. The experience will leave many reprioritising and rethinking their careers, adds McKenzie. They may question the job security at tech giants, and also consider early-stage start-ups with recent funding injections a safer bet. “You might also be looking more closely for companies with better foundations – i.e. profitability and growth rates that are increasing,” he says. “Or considering safer industry bets, such as financial services and consulting. Those companies will pay a huge package to convince a Google engineer to join their business.”   Silver linings  Despite the negative effects of being cut for the first time, many of these workers say losing their jobs has not been all bad news. Like Coleman, Alexandrova, too, says the layoff has changed her perspective on careers. Initially, she felt unsure about her next step. “I took a couple of days to process and figure out what was next for me. Ultimately, I knew there wasn’t anything I could do to change the situation. The only thing I could do was control my reaction.” So, she switched her focus to the potential opportunities, buoyed by a five-month severance package. Now, instead of looking for a new employer, she’s taken the decision to use her severance pay to start her own tech company: travel-app Mave, which she and a team of 11 developers, product designers and engineers are scaling, just six months after her layoff.  “I do think tech will stabilise again, but this way, my fate would be more within my control,” she says. “Anything that happens will be my decision versus someone else’s business decision.” And despite how it ended, Alexandrova also credits her time at Shopify for setting her up for her next step. “They had prepped me to be able to enter this new stage of my life,” she says. Additionally, with layoffs increasingly losing their taboo, there may never have been a better environment to be laid off for the first time. For her part, Coleman was among the workers who felt trepidation about even disclosing she’d been let go. “At first, I contemplated if I even should tell my network and close friends. Or should I hunker down and start interviewing, and then once I get a new job tell everyone what happened,” she says. However, she quickly found support once she shared the newsin a post on LinkedIn. She was met with an outpouring of messages from both her close circle and wider professional network. Sharing her experience publicly has even helped her to overcome a lot of her own negative feelings about being laid off. “I was embarrassed, ashamed and most of all, hurt. [But] I realised there’s nothing to be ashamed of when asking for help, and since making it known that I’m actively looking for work, my network has shown up in myriad ways.” This has included soliciting recommendations on her LinkedIn profile, and reaching out with possible job opportunities and referrals – all of which has given Coleman the confidence to start updating and sending out her CV. She’s optimistic about finding her next role soon. And there may be reason for these laid-off workers to feel positive. McKenzie says despite all the headlines around job layoffs, there are still plenty of opportunities in tech for those workers who’ve been cut, whether it’s for the first time or not. “Although in tech we’re seeing layoffs across the board, it seems to be the larger, more established companies who are downsizing and striving to be leaner orgs. Start-ups who are in growth-mode still need talent and are aggressively hiring to get to their next funding round,” says McKenzie. Ultimately, he says, “the power is with talent”."
market volatility,Why brands are leaving social media,2024-09-15,2023-07-12,Chris Stokel-Walker,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230712-consumer-brands-leave-social-media-meta-threads,"As new social media apps including Threads pop up, some companies are choosing to eschew the platforms. What’s going on? Another day, another social media platform to post on. The launch of Threads on 6 July marked the latest major short-form text platform available to social media users, following Twitter, Mastodon and Bluesky – plus a raft of other, smaller competitors. Like many of us, big companies are struggling to keep up with the number of social media platforms vying for their time and attention. They’re faced with the important choice of which apps to choose, in a market where social media can be an important brand-building tool and enable them to target consumers where they are most active. For the past decade, It’s been all but required for serious brands to maintain a social media presence, says Nathan Allebach, creative director at Allebach Communications, which has partnered with brands including Utz Snacks and Steak-umm to build out their social media presences. Not only is it a major avenue to meet consumers, but social media is also a key contributor for brand discovery – which companies hope will translate into sales across generations of shoppers. Yet instead of scrambling to claim digital real estate across all these newly emerging platforms, some companies are choosing to be more judicious about which platforms they choose to join. In some cases, they’re learning from brands who jumped the social media ship years ago. Bullying and polarisation One of the first large brands to make the move was Lush Cosmetics, which in November 2021 decided to stop posting on social media platforms controlled by Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The beauty company initially dropped off the platforms in 2019, due to concerns about fighting with ever-changing social media algorithms as well as the company’s worry about the potentially negative impact of social media on young people. “We are a social brand, and community has been key for us,” says Annabelle Baker, Lush’s global brand director. “When we joined social media, Facebook and those platforms were everything we were looking for initially: they were direct links to the communities.” But Baker says they withdrew when social media changed to being inherently less social and user-centric, mediated instead by algorithms controlled by companies. Although Lush re-emerged on the platforms during Covid-19 in order to reach customers during lockdowns, the beauty brand has now gone dark again. They’ve been off social media for almost two years – and don’t have current plans to come back. Time, say social media experts, is a driver pushing away brands: it can be a tall task to ask often junior employees to keep tabs on so many platforms. It’s a situation that has become more pressing with the new boom in Twitter alternatives, where a clear winner hasn’t yet emerged. But some brands have also been feeling a distinct sense of unease about social media in general. First, like Lush, some companies are unhappy about the way the platforms operate and their management. But perhaps more pressing is the risk of followers turning on brands amid the volatility and toxicity of some social media user bases. As social media has polarised society in unexpected ways, brands have found many users quick to criticise an account they believe has mis-stepped. When luxury fashion brand Bottega Veneta left much of social media in 2021, its creative director Daniel Lee cited  “a mood of playground bullying on social media”. He told The Guardian: “I don’t want to collude in an atmosphere that feels negative. ” “The main utility of an organic social media presence for most brands is activating the 1% of their super fans and haters. Ultimately, every team has to assess the risk-reward ratio of how much to invest … the investment isn’t worth it to every brand, especially with how many platforms there are to consider and how precarious they can be,” says Allebach. To join or not to join? The launch of Threads has brought the stay-or-go conversation back to the forefront. Along with audiences already on other emerging platforms, Meta’s purported Twitter killer already has more than 100 million users, less than a week after it began – in other words, a growing group of potential customers for brands. Yet deciding whether to embrace the new apps is tricky. For one, brands are still struggling with the issues of reputation and user abuse. And some brands may also have concerns with Threads specifically, as Meta has prior precedent of launching apps designed to compete with and supplant existing incumbents (Instagram Reels, for instance, was designed to tackle TikTok), which don’t always succeed. Companies could end up devoting significant resources to building a presence on a platform that disappears in a few months’ time. Brands will make their social media decisions individually – but Allebach says many still ultimately feel pressure to hang a shingle on these new platforms. “At this point, it’s hard to imagine a future where brands start pulling out of social media platforms en masse,” he says. Yet he adds it’s possible we’ll see more brands pulling back, especially if ""they can’t quantify the value or start believing the risks outweigh the rewards”. Lush’s Baker says that her company isn’t eager to leap back into social media with Threads – even with the large audience. “It’ll be a test of time to see whether people stay there and actively use it,” she says. “But I’m not tempted to jump on Threads for the time being.”"
market volatility,The rise of 'finfluencers',2024-09-15,2023-09-18,Katie Bishop,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230915-should-you-trust-personal-finance-advice-from-a-finfluencer,"A growing number of creators are doling out tips online for how to spend, save and invest. Is it a modern approach to financial literacy – or a big red flag? When Yasmin Purnell started blogging in 2017, she planned to share her experiences of becoming a digital nomad. However, the creative-writing graduate and copywriter soon found visitors to her site were more interested in how she afforded her freelance lifestyle. Noticing the hunger for personal finance advice, UK-based Purnell, now 31, rebranded her website. The Wallet Moth – a blog offering finance and frugal-living advice – was born. ""I shifted into personal finance articles, as my small-but-growing audience expressed more interest in how I had avoided debt in my 20s, how I'd budgeted to have a financial safety net for freelancing and what side-hustles I worked to support being location independent,"" she says. It's the human aspect – sharing personal stories and putting a face to the advice – that makes all the difference, she believes. ""My content doesn't necessarily offer something that is better than traditional financial advice, but people more and more want to connect with someone they can think of as an online friend, versus a faceless company."" Purnell is among the swelling tide of financial influencers: creators feeding a seemingly insatiable desire for content on spending, saving and investing. Throughout the past few years, the popularity of these 'finfulencers' has exploded, with many amassing followings into the millions. A growing part of the global influencer industry, with an estimated market size of a whopping $104bn (£83bn) as of 2022, some of these finfluencers report earning upwards of six-figures as social media presences. Their posts can provide welcome insight into the often-opaque world of personal finance – a world young people specifically are finding harder and harder to see into. Yet if trusting money advice from strangers with murky qualifications gives you pause, there's a reason. A young audience Millions of people log on every day to consume advice from financial influencers. Humphrey Yang, a former financial adviser in his 30s, leads the finfluencer pack with more than 50m likes and 3m followers on TikTok, as of this writing. US-based Yang focuses on personal finance advice, with his most popular videos explaining concepts such as retirement accounts and stock prices. In his most-watched video – more than 14 million views – Yang acts out borrowing an iPhone, selling it and then buying the same model for less a year later in order to explain the concept of short selling. Easily digestible content like Yang's appeals primarily to a young audience, says Radhika Duggal, an adjunct business professor at New York University and the chief marketing officer at fintech company Super. ""With the lack of financial education in schools, Gen Zers are being forced to learn about money on their own,"" she says. ""This is the first economic crisis that younger generations are experiencing, and it's no surprise that they're turning to influencers to ensure that they can make good decisions and weather the current climate."" Connor Campbell, a business finance expert at financial comparison site NerdWallet UK, says successful finfluencers purposely provide an easy entry point into money-related topics. ""Financial influencers tend to create content that is appealing to younger generations, specifically using terminology and examples that relate to pop-culture and simplifying financial terms,"" he says. One example of a simplified financial concept is ""cash-stuffing"", a budgeting method that went viral on TikTok in 2022. The cash-stuffing system advocates for dividing physical cash into folders or envelopes for allotted expenses, such as groceries or hobbies, meaning followers are less likely to overspend. It's not a novel concept, but it is new to many young social media users, especially those with limited personal finance exposure. Content like this is helpful to promote better financial habits among young people, believes Campbell. ""By presenting financial tips in an accessible way, they've improved financial literacy, and invoked a newfound interest in being proactive about where people are putting their money, and ways that they can bump their savings."" Purnell agrees, saying that responses from her readers has been ""overwhelmingly positive"", and that people appreciate her advice on living more frugally. She believes that the relatability of her content, combined with the simplicity of her advice, is a winning formula for young viewers. ""I'm just another person looking to save money and perhaps try out a side-hustle or two,"" she says. Experts or regular people? Yet although creators say audiences have been highly receptive to their tips, experts caution some finfluencers may also be leading followers astray – and even, in some cases, taking advantage of them. ""Some of these influencers are just regular people with no background in finance,"" says Campbell. ""Social media can cause people to rush into making uninformed decisions due to a fear of missing out on something that a lot of other people are participating in – and when these trends involve real money, this can sometimes become an issue."" Experts have recently warned of surges in self-directed investing based on questionable guidance from financial influencers, arguing some of these social media stars are offering poor advice, either because of their own lack of financial knowledge, or because it is in their interest to post increasingly outlandish content in the interest of gaining followers. In some cases, organisations have accused personal finance content creators of leveraging the vulnerabilities of a debt-ridden generation to boost their own follower counts. Last year, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned against online promotions focused on paying off debt, saying that influencers involved in these posts were attracting ""vulnerable or indebted customers"" to follow ""misleading"" financial advice. Offering questionable personal finance advice to capture a large audience has been an issue for decades. Finance mega-stars, many of whom have built profitable careers with their money-management tips, have found themselves in hot water in the past. For instance, Suze Orman, a high-profile TV personality, has come under fire for endorsing questionable financial products, and was even accused of fraud in 2009. Now, however, social media is exposing a larger, younger and often less-educated audience to often unvetted personal finance advice. There's also the added complication of how influencers make their money – social media stars often endorse products for payment, meaning their advice may not be objective. In particular, the rise in cryptocurrency adverts have raised flags, after high-profile cases of influencers endorsing new crypto products. The volatility of cryptocurrency means that it can be difficult to predict the market – and yet many social media users have been led to believe that digital currencies are a good investment. Last year, Kim Kardashian found herself under the microscope when she posted about cryptocurrency Ethereum Max. Although Ethereum saw a rapid rise in 2021, it quickly crashed, losing 97% of its value by January 2022. Investors who had suffered huge losses brought a lawsuit against Kardashian (who currently has more than 364m Instagram followers) and other celebrities who promoted the product, claiming that they had conspired to inflate the value of the tokens. The case was eventually thrown out, but the judge warned of ""celebrities' ability to readily persuade millions of undiscerning followers to buy snake oil with unprecedented ease and reach"". 'Boring but highly effective' James Beckett, 33, launched a content side-hustle after noticing how much bad investment advice was circulating online. The former social media marketer, whose YouTube channel has a small but growing following of several thousand subscribers, says many financial influencers know that engagement comes from get-rich-quick schemes and flaunting their supposed wealth. ""TikTok has reduced our attention spans to fractions of a second, and you need flashy investing content to capture an audience,"" says Beckett, based in Hertfordshire, UK. Beckett isn't the only one worried about too-good-to-be-true schemes and investment scams. Finance industry professionals and organisations have also started to speak out about these issues, and the FCA recently proposed a crackdown on finfluencers, arguing their advice can be misleading, and that they often ""have little knowledge of what they're promoting"". However, Beckett believes he and many finfluencers like him also provide what he describes as ""boring but highly effective"" financial advice. He says these tips are not only lower risk but also more reliable – he discusses the ins and out of concepts including passive investing and index funds – especially for young people without a strong financial-education background or lots of money to burn. Beckett argues social media finance content can offer an accessible way into managing money, without having to pay the high fees many financial advisors or organisations demand. ""Financial influencers can be problematic, because some of them prey on people's naivety,"" he says. ""But on the flip side, there are a lot of people doing good out there, and they are filling a huge gap left by our education system."" Proceeding with caution Without a regulatory body, the world of finfluencing remains somewhat murky. For many, finfluencers have led to accessible financial guidance, filling a gap in financial literacy among young people. And even amid questionable advice or worrying tactics, Campbell argues that, if paired with a discerning attitude and a little bit of scepticism, finfluencers can help put people on the path to responsible money management. ""Personal finances are – as the name suggests – personal to the individual, and everyone's circumstances are different,"" he says. ""It's important to assess whether an influencer's suggestions are relevant to your financial situation."" Beckett adds that although finfluencers might have a bad reputation, they can also offer a route into the confusing, and sometimes intentionally opaque, world of finance and investing. Objective influencers, who don't cash in on partnerships or present their advice as bulletproof, can be a force for good, especially for followers who've never thought about savings or growing wealth. ""Like everything in the world, there are good finfluencers and bad ones,"" he says. ""While the most obnoxious, audacious creators have a larger tendency to go viral, you can still find fantastic personal finance content on social media platforms from people who genuinely want to help. Finfluencers aren't worth shunning entirely."""

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a television interview that there were plans for co-ordinated action to recapitalise banks.  In the UK, the Bank of England has said it will inject a further £75bn into the UK economy through quantitative easing (QE). The Bank has already pumped £200bn into the economy by buying assets such as government bonds, in an attempt to boost lending by commercial banks. But this is the first time it has added to its QE programme since 2009. There have been recent calls for it to step in again to aid the fragile recovery. The Bank also held interest rates at the record low of 0.5%. European aircraft maker Airbus has struck a deal worth $9.5bn (£6.2bn) with Australia's Qantas for 110 jets. The order, said by Qantas to be the country's single largest aircraft purchase by units, will underpin the airline's expansion into Asia. Qantas, which is launching a low-cost and a premium airline in Asia, is buying 78 Airbus 320neos and 32 A320s.

market volatility,UK firms pull stock market floats,2024-09-15,2017-11-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41856441,"Arqiva, the UK's largest owner of TV transmitters and food producer Bakkavor have pulled their stock market listings because of market uncertainty. Arqiva has postponed a stock market flotation  that would have valued the group at £6bn. Bakkavor, which supplies food to M&S and Waitrose, has scrapped its plan that potentially valued it at £1bn. Both firms announced their listing plans last month, but  cited market volatility for their change of heart. In October, a number of European companies floated but saw their shares perform weakly in the following days. French fashion group SMCP shares have barely risen above their initial stock market flotation price of €21 (£19; $24) each.

Its clients include the BBC, ITV and international broadcasters and its masts cover about 98% of the UK. However, Bakkavor, the UK's largest supplier of hummus, said it will no longer proceed with its plans for an initial public offering (IPO). It said: ""Whilst the company received sufficient institutional demand to cover the offering, the board has taken the decision that proceeding with the transaction would not be in the best interests of the company, or its shareholders, given the current volatility in the IPO market."" Neil Glover, business development director for the UK and Ireland at EY, said that recently there has been a ""real lack of traditional IPOs"" which he described as companies with household or more easily recognisable names. He said: ""We believe in 2018, there will be a minor build-up of IPOs in the second and third quarter,"" adding that ""some investors are keeping their powder dry"" until then. Mr Glover also said that that companies are eager to announce their flotations before 2019: ""Everyone is a bit paranoid about Brexit and they want to move before it takes place."" Bakkavor, which operates across the UK, China and the US and employs around 18,500 people, was founded in 1986 by Icelandic brothers Lydur and Agust Gudmundsson. Mr Gudmundsson is the chief executive of the group which in 2016 reported a 3.6% rise in group sales to £1.7bn.

Aidan Baglow said the name change to Isle of Man Energy reflected a change in direction to include alternatives to natural gas. He said it also showed support for the island's move to net-zero emissions. It follows a 43.9% price hike for customers due to global volatility in the wholesale gas market. Mr Baglow said the current energy crisis meant customers were seeking ""ways to use energy more efficiently"", leading to the company ""investing locally to provide additional products"". ""In the longer term, this means we will be diversifying our services and looking at alternatives to natural gas, such as biogas and green hydrogen,"" he added. The cost of the rebrand has not been confirmed but the company has invested in a new billing system and a new website, which will soon allow customers to see how much gas they are using. Acknowledging the rebrand comes at a difficult time for gas customers on the Isle of Man, CEO of parent company Islands Energy Group Jo Cox said the firm wanted to support ""energy transition"" or moves towards greener energy. Although change ""won't be quick or easy"", the company needed to ""evolve how we're doing things and what we offer"", she said. ""Some may question the need to transform our business now, but it is actually because of the crisis that business transformation is so critical,"" she added.

market volatility,Energy bills: On the front line,2024-09-15,2022-08-26,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-62684600,"The missiles may not be flying near your neighbourhood, but be in no doubt that you're in the front line of war. The munitions are delivered by your energy supplier, direct to your email inbox, or your front door mat, with an 80% rise in your household fuel bill from 1 October. It's rising because markets say it should. That price cap protects you only from short-run volatility. It doesn't put off a reckoning with higher wholesale costs which have been met for the past six months by your supplier. Resulting from the scramble to fill European reserves for next winter, wholesale prices have been back at record levels this week. The manipulation of those markets from Moscow, by sharply reducing the gas supply, is a key strategic weapon of economic war. The tactic is intended to weaken European and British resolve in support of Ukraine, by exploiting a perceived weakness of western politics.  The Russian view of neighbours to its west is that they are decadent, with a short political attention span, and far less resilient than Russia in sustaining hardship. By turning the screw on the Nordstream pipeline, the primary route of Russian gas under the Baltic and into Germany, the Kremlin administration can watch prices rise. That piles pressure onto the political leaderships across Europe, as well as threatening to fracture the unity of the European Union. Having eliminated opposition and media scrutiny, Vladimir Putin faces no such problems at home. It's a huge gamble by Russia, because the European (and British) response is to find other sources of energy - turning back to nuclear and coal, building facilities for import of Liquified Natural Gas on tankers, while speeding up renewable power investment. Whatever the outcome in Ukraine, it's very unlikely Europe could return to being so dependent on Russia.  So the long-term game for President Putin must be to build gas pipelines to Asia, selling to India and China instead of Europe, as he is already doing with cut-price oil.  If those new customers are wise, they will watch closely how Russia uses its clout as a supplier.  This is not the first time Moscow has used energy as a weapon, to coerce neighbours to its will and secure Russia's sphere of influence. So until supplies can be secured from elsewhere, or vast quantities of fossil fuels are no longer required, what are Ukraine's European and British backers to do with this front in the energy war? That's the challenge facing, among others, the Conservative government at Westminster. From 5 September, a new prime minister will have to respond to the biggest challenge since, well, Covid.  And the choice is whether the resilience and acceptance of financial hardship is one that is for households, businesses and charity to handle? Or is it as much a function of government to defend its people's economic security as its territorial integrity? Within that are many other choices: among them, of how much to target support to those least able to handle inflated energy prices and wider inflation, or alternatively to make this a national endeavour in which everyone gets support. How much will a Tory PM in 2022 rely on the market to ration energy, in a spirit of individualism, perhaps as a reaction against the extraordinary levels of state intrusion into homes and lives through the pandemic? Germany is considering how to ration by other means, with the real possibility that it could simply have insufficient gas this coming winter to heat homes and fuel its factories. Government officials are drawing up plans for how to allocate supplies to essential factories, recognising it will be impossible to turn off the heating taps for homes. Thermostats for air conditioning are being turned up, and when autumn comes, they will be turned down. Lights are being dimmed: floodlighting and fountains turned off, while swimming pools or  showers go unheated. Rationing is a dimension to the crisis that the British have barely considered, but it will surely come.  According to the Economist magazine, evidence of what happens when prices rise, and when prices are capped, is not reassuring to governments who reach for state subsidies (it is editorially for markets and against most subsidy). It argues price caps fail to lower energy use or to change behaviour towards other sources of energy.  An American trial in lowering prices for low income households resulted in higher energy use. Ukraine offers cash to households in most needs, it reports, preserving the link between bills and energy use, and therefore also the incentive to cut back. A part of Austria offers subsidy on the first 80% of typical household use, while leaving the incentive to cut back on the remainder. What about Britain? So far, it has a dual response: a blanket £400 per household to ease the pain, and a series of grants aimed at those on means-tested benefits, disability payments and the state pension. That was a scheme devised by Rishi Sunak in May, when it seemed the price cap would rise from £1,971 per year for the typical home to about £2,800.  The scale of the increase - a typical household energy bill will now hit £3,549 a year - announced today to be applied from 1 October, is unlikely to surprise anyone applying Ofgem's formula to wholesale prices. But in a state of limbo, between prime ministers, waiting for today's formal announcement was used to buy time.  Not any longer. Downing Street now has to decide how it responds to the economic war footing being required here, as it is across Europe, and once decided, to do so swiftly."

market volatility,Crypto regulation may drive growth in poorer areas,2024-09-15,2022-05-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-61156439,"The south west is ""perfectly positioned"" to benefit from plans to regulate cryptocurrency, an expert has claimed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently announced his intention to make the UK a ""global hub"" for crypto. The move could spread wealth to areas - like parts of the south west - that have lacked investment, crypto entrepreneur Herbert Sim has said. Academic Chris Carr said he was ""doubtful"" this would happen. He explained that while ""some people have managed to get wealthy, there is still a concern that this will benefit the rich, who can afford to take risks and invest early"". Despite this, he said the emerging industry - which has been likened to a virtual form of cash - could create platforms ""that aim to distribute wealth more evenly"".  ""There are certainly people out there who have this aim in mind."" Crypto expert Mr Sim - who has even trademarked the name ""Bitcoin Man"" - is more optimistic and believes Mr Sunak's plans could ""reverse these fortunes"" in areas which have historically lacked investment. Attracting more of the £1.64 trillion global industry to areas like Swindon, Cheltenham and Gloucester would provide a welcome boost by creating highly-skilled and paid jobs like blockchain engineers and cryptocurrency developers, he said. He added: ""The UK and the south west is perfectly positioned to capitalise on the growth of crypto. ""Crypto is only going one direction - and that is firmly towards growth. There is no shortage of demand so the only question that matters is where it is going to set up base. ""With China's crackdown on Bitcoin and the crypto mines (which use vast quantities of power to create new blockchain through vast computer networks), we already see the shift of Bitcoins from China to the USA and Canada. ""Developing nations such as El Salvador and India are racing towards embracing Bitcoin, and leap-frogging  past first world countries. ""That all requires a highly-skilled and tech-savvy workforce. With all the universities and existing tech companies in UK and the south west it is ideally suited to capitalise on that opportunity."" Both men spoke after recent figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed that the region has the joint slowest growing research and development (R&D) workforce in the country. Investment in the sector is a key driver of growth and seen as vital to improving living standards in the current cost of living crisis. Figures from the ONS revealed that the number of R&D jobs in the south west has climbed just 43.8% over the past decade - less than a fifth of London's figure. The region's M4 corridor has had some success in attracting tech companies including Dyson, Just Eat and Huawei. But they have not delivered the number of highly-skilled and paid jobs to push the area up the list and is currently sits joint-bottom. Crypto is also increasingly used in ""play-to-earn"" games that are built on blockchain technology. Mr Sim - who has himself invested in play-to-earn game ETHEKing.io - says it has sparked a ""paradigm shift, which will revolutionise the gaming industry"". He believes this gaming mechanism is ""only going to explode and grow exponentially, with more and more brands jumping on the bandwagon, as the investors and gamers flood in."" University of the West of England (UWE) lecturer Xiaojun Luo agrees that crypto could ""further stimulate"" the area's economy. She thinks that ""appropriate regulations are needed to reduce the volatility of cryptocurrencies, protect consumers from illicit activities"" and generate a new source of government revenues. Dr Luo explained that ""adopting suitable regulations"" makes the market more liquid and would ""further enhance the ability of participants to buy and sell crypto assets"".  ""The higher transaction rate of crypto assets can further stimulate the south west economy."" Currently the University of Bristol and UWE both offer degrees in Fintech so have students familiar with the sector, blockchain programming and international banking and finance law. But Dr Carr - a lecturer at the University of Exeter - is not convinced that any of this would help spread wealth despite some crypto-proponents wishing to do so. He said that while remote working could benefit the south west, the ""knock on effect"" could be that the jobs are outsourced abroad. He added: ""I am doubtful on the wealth spreading, though I sincerely hope so. ""Regulation may help, but at the moment the crypto markets are heavily influenced by 'whales' who have enough money to effectively pump and dump any coin.  ""There is still plenty of things like that going on."" He urged universities in the area to create developers and coders by running courses which ""teach people how to build these technologies themselves, even if that is not their intended career path"". However the problem is that universities ""can't or don't want to"" compete financially with what top quality blockchain creators can earn in the commercial world.

market volatility,The workers laid off for the first time,2024-09-15,2023-01-16,Megan Tatum,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230113-the-workers-laid-off-for-the-first-time,"Getting your job cut can be jarring, to say the least. But for workers who’ve never been through layoffs, it can sting particularly badly. Shamari Coleman never considered herself a person who’d get laid off. But in December 2022, shortly after taking a product-marketing position at multinational tech firm AvePoint, the 28-year-old found herself without a job. “I loved the team I was working with and the culture that was fostered there,” says New York City-based Coleman. “It was my first taste of working at a big tech company, and I felt like I’d be there as long as they’d have me.” But five months later, she woke up to an email from the CEO, announcing they’d decided to lay off 5% of their workforce. All Coleman could do was wait to see if she was affected. “A few hours later, I was invited to a meeting with someone from HR and a department manager, and that was that.”  The layoff was unexpected, of course, but the possibility she could be axed in the current climate wasn’t unfathomable, she says. “I was always uneasy, because working in the tech industry, I’d been seeing post after post since around May that year of people getting laid off. It was always in the back of my mind.” Indeed, according to layoffs.fyi, which has tracked tech layoffs globally since the pandemic, more than 150,000 people were laid off in 2022, across more than 1,000 tech companies.  Still, being jobless shook Coleman’s self-confidence. Having graduated with a degree in political sciences in New York, she’d immediately set her sights on the tech sector, working with early-stage start-ups in San Francisco for nearly two years before finding this large tech job. “I was the person that would go out and get interviews and get offers or leverage offers. I felt like I was always in control of my career, and this was the first time I felt like I wasn’t.” Like Coleman, many people affected by the layoffs that have swept the globe in the past 12 months have never faced redundancy before. Lots of these workers have been ambitious high achievers at top firms, who are now confronted by the brutal reality that hard work and talent isn’t always enough. Beyond scrambling to re-think career plans, some workers have found their confidence dented in an unexpected way. Yet it’s not all bad news. ‘What do I do with myself now?’ It isn’t surprising that Coleman was left with a shaken sense of identity after being laid off, says Paula Allen, global leader and senior vice-president of research and total wellbeing at Canadian HR- and tech-firm LifeWorks. “For anyone, being laid off is difficult … But for people early in their career who have always been high achievers, it can be particularly hard, because there’s a feeling they’ve always been in control of their destiny – that they’re the one that people want,” she says. As a result, they’re left questioning what they may have done or how they might have performed differently. But that often has no value, adds Allen. “You’re not going to find any insights, because you didn’t do anything wrong.” Even workers who understand their layoffs weren’t personal in nature can experience these ripple effects. Toronto-based Stella Alexandrova had been at Canadian e-commerce company Shopify for three-and-a-half years when she found out she was one of roughly 1,000 employees laid off by the firm in July last year. “It was my dream job and my dream company,” she says of her role as a growth lead. “Getting that job had felt like the next big step in my career.” In the days leading up to the cuts, she and her team had been busy working to deadlines and pursuing leads. So, when the email arrived in her inbox on a Tuesday morning, just after she’d rolled out of bed and was sipping coffee at her desk, she was shocked that her time there was abruptly over. “It’s like, what do I do with myself now?” she says. “We’d started to hear about other tech layoffs, but you just don’t think you’ll be affected until you are. It wasn’t expected in any way.” Having never experienced redundancy before, her head was initially full of questions about why she’d been chosen. “You start thinking, did something happen? I didn’t think I’d done anything that meant it could be based on my performance. And that was confirmed later. My whole team was part of the layoff. But you can't help to initially question whether it was performance-based, and that does shake up your confidence.” Being laid off can also be a financial blow, of course – and often even more so for those laid off for the first time, who may not have significant savings or experience of how to navigate a sudden loss of income; or for highly skilled workers, for whom being laid off was completely unexpected. Coleman had been contributing to multiple savings accounts since 2020, as part of a personal goal to become more financially savvy, and felt “financially OK” when the her layoff hit in December. Still, the loss of income was still a source of anxiety. “There’s a general sense of worry of, will I have a new role before this money runs out? As of right now, though, I’m doing OK.” In some cases, generous severance packages might also mitigate anxiety around a loss of income, says Dion McKenzie, co-founder of non-profit talent network Colorintech, headquartered in London. “But there’s definitely a financial impact. Let’s face it – younger people coming in at entry level, or with perhaps three-to-five years’ experience, don’t necessarily have a windfall,” says McKenzie. “That, in addition to the cost-of-living crisis definitely carries a financial burden, especially as a lot of these salaries are composed of [stock] options, which are now underwater and undervalued.” ‘Put yourself first’ Once the initial shock has subsided and people start to consider their next move, the impact of being laid off can manifest differently. For some, there’s a lingering uncertainty around putting themselves back out there in the jobs market. “For some people, this loss – of control, of income, of their expectations in terms of work identity – is extraordinarily traumatic,” says Allen. “It changes them. It changes how they approach work.” They may become obsessive over-achievers working 100-hour weeks, or develop significant anxiety in their next role, Allen adds. Coleman felt nervous about finding her next job in the tech sector. “It affected my confidence. The current tech market is fiercer than any other market I’ve worked in, and I’m not only competing with a small group of people now, but with those that were at Meta and Twitter and were also laid off. It’s a fight between that feeling of insecurity and realising that I’m qualified and capable, too.” It's also changed the way Coleman looks at potential opportunities. While it hasn’t explicitly deterred her from looking for a job in tech, despite its volatility, she says, “it's taught me to always do what's best for you, and put yourself first, because these companies will always put themselves and their bottom line first”. The experience will leave many reprioritising and rethinking their careers, adds McKenzie. They may question the job security at tech giants, and also consider early-stage start-ups with recent funding injections a safer bet. “You might also be looking more closely for companies with better foundations – i.e. profitability and growth rates that are increasing,” he says. “Or considering safer industry bets, such as financial services and consulting. Those companies will pay a huge package to convince a Google engineer to join their business.”   Silver linings  Despite the negative effects of being cut for the first time, many of these workers say losing their jobs has not been all bad news. Like Coleman, Alexandrova, too, says the layoff has changed her perspective on careers. Initially, she felt unsure about her next step. “I took a couple of days to process and figure out what was next for me. Ultimately, I knew there wasn’t anything I could do to change the situation. The only thing I could do was control my reaction.” So, she switched her focus to the potential opportunities, buoyed by a five-month severance package. Now, instead of looking for a new employer, she’s taken the decision to use her severance pay to start her own tech company: travel-app Mave, which she and a team of 11 developers, product designers and engineers are scaling, just six months after her layoff.  “I do think tech will stabilise again, but this way, my fate would be more within my control,” she says. “Anything that happens will be my decision versus someone else’s business decision.” And despite how it ended, Alexandrova also credits her time at Shopify for setting her up for her next step. “They had prepped me to be able to enter this new stage of my life,” she says. Additionally, with layoffs increasingly losing their taboo, there may never have been a better environment to be laid off for the first time. For her part, Coleman was among the workers who felt trepidation about even disclosing she’d been let go. “At first, I contemplated if I even should tell my network and close friends. Or should I hunker down and start interviewing, and then once I get a new job tell everyone what happened,” she says. However, she quickly found support once she shared the newsin a post on LinkedIn. She was met with an outpouring of messages from both her close circle and wider professional network. Sharing her experience publicly has even helped her to overcome a lot of her own negative feelings about being laid off. “I was embarrassed, ashamed and most of all, hurt. [But] I realised there’s nothing to be ashamed of when asking for help, and since making it known that I’m actively looking for work, my network has shown up in myriad ways.” This has included soliciting recommendations on her LinkedIn profile, and reaching out with possible job opportunities and referrals – all of which has given Coleman the confidence to start updating and sending out her CV. She’s optimistic about finding her next role soon. And there may be reason for these laid-off workers to feel positive. McKenzie says despite all the headlines around job layoffs, there are still plenty of opportunities in tech for those workers who’ve been cut, whether it’s for the first time or not. “Although in tech we’re seeing layoffs across the board, it seems to be the larger, more established companies who are downsizing and striving to be leaner orgs. Start-ups who are in growth-mode still need talent and are aggressively hiring to get to their next funding round,” says McKenzie. Ultimately, he says, “the power is with talent”."
market volatility,Why brands are leaving social media,2024-09-15,2023-07-12,Chris Stokel-Walker,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230712-consumer-brands-leave-social-media-meta-threads,"As new social media apps including Threads pop up, some companies are choosing to eschew the platforms. What’s going on? Another day, another social media platform to post on. The launch of Threads on 6 July marked the latest major short-form text platform available to social media users, following Twitter, Mastodon and Bluesky – plus a raft of other, smaller competitors. Like many of us, big companies are struggling to keep up with the number of social media platforms vying for their time and attention. They’re faced with the important choice of which apps to choose, in a market where social media can be an important brand-building tool and enable them to target consumers where they are most active. For the past decade, It’s been all but required for serious brands to maintain a social media presence, says Nathan Allebach, creative director at Allebach Communications, which has partnered with brands including Utz Snacks and Steak-umm to build out their social media presences. Not only is it a major avenue to meet consumers, but social media is also a key contributor for brand discovery – which companies hope will translate into sales across generations of shoppers. Yet instead of scrambling to claim digital real estate across all these newly emerging platforms, some companies are choosing to be more judicious about which platforms they choose to join. In some cases, they’re learning from brands who jumped the social media ship years ago. Bullying and polarisation One of the first large brands to make the move was Lush Cosmetics, which in November 2021 decided to stop posting on social media platforms controlled by Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The beauty company initially dropped off the platforms in 2019, due to concerns about fighting with ever-changing social media algorithms as well as the company’s worry about the potentially negative impact of social media on young people. “We are a social brand, and community has been key for us,” says Annabelle Baker, Lush’s global brand director. “When we joined social media, Facebook and those platforms were everything we were looking for initially: they were direct links to the communities.” But Baker says they withdrew when social media changed to being inherently less social and user-centric, mediated instead by algorithms controlled by companies. Although Lush re-emerged on the platforms during Covid-19 in order to reach customers during lockdowns, the beauty brand has now gone dark again. They’ve been off social media for almost two years – and don’t have current plans to come back. Time, say social media experts, is a driver pushing away brands: it can be a tall task to ask often junior employees to keep tabs on so many platforms. It’s a situation that has become more pressing with the new boom in Twitter alternatives, where a clear winner hasn’t yet emerged. But some brands have also been feeling a distinct sense of unease about social media in general. First, like Lush, some companies are unhappy about the way the platforms operate and their management. But perhaps more pressing is the risk of followers turning on brands amid the volatility and toxicity of some social media user bases. As social media has polarised society in unexpected ways, brands have found many users quick to criticise an account they believe has mis-stepped. When luxury fashion brand Bottega Veneta left much of social media in 2021, its creative director Daniel Lee cited  “a mood of playground bullying on social media”. He told The Guardian: “I don’t want to collude in an atmosphere that feels negative. ” “The main utility of an organic social media presence for most brands is activating the 1% of their super fans and haters. Ultimately, every team has to assess the risk-reward ratio of how much to invest … the investment isn’t worth it to every brand, especially with how many platforms there are to consider and how precarious they can be,” says Allebach. To join or not to join? The launch of Threads has brought the stay-or-go conversation back to the forefront. Along with audiences already on other emerging platforms, Meta’s purported Twitter killer already has more than 100 million users, less than a week after it began – in other words, a growing group of potential customers for brands. Yet deciding whether to embrace the new apps is tricky. For one, brands are still struggling with the issues of reputation and user abuse. And some brands may also have concerns with Threads specifically, as Meta has prior precedent of launching apps designed to compete with and supplant existing incumbents (Instagram Reels, for instance, was designed to tackle TikTok), which don’t always succeed. Companies could end up devoting significant resources to building a presence on a platform that disappears in a few months’ time. Brands will make their social media decisions individually – but Allebach says many still ultimately feel pressure to hang a shingle on these new platforms. “At this point, it’s hard to imagine a future where brands start pulling out of social media platforms en masse,” he says. Yet he adds it’s possible we’ll see more brands pulling back, especially if ""they can’t quantify the value or start believing the risks outweigh the rewards”. Lush’s Baker says that her company isn’t eager to leap back into social media with Threads – even with the large audience. “It’ll be a test of time to see whether people stay there and actively use it,” she says. “But I’m not tempted to jump on Threads for the time being.”"
market volatility,The rise of 'finfluencers',2024-09-15,2023-09-18,Katie Bishop,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230915-should-you-trust-personal-finance-advice-from-a-finfluencer,"A growing number of creators are doling out tips online for how to spend, save and invest. Is it a modern approach to financial literacy – or a big red flag? When Yasmin Purnell started blogging in 2017, she planned to share her experiences of becoming a digital nomad. However, the creative-writing graduate and copywriter soon found visitors to her site were more interested in how she afforded her freelance lifestyle. Noticing the hunger for personal finance advice, UK-based Purnell, now 31, rebranded her website. The Wallet Moth – a blog offering finance and frugal-living advice – was born. ""I shifted into personal finance articles, as my small-but-growing audience expressed more interest in how I had avoided debt in my 20s, how I'd budgeted to have a financial safety net for freelancing and what side-hustles I worked to support being location independent,"" she says. It's the human aspect – sharing personal stories and putting a face to the advice – that makes all the difference, she believes. ""My content doesn't necessarily offer something that is better than traditional financial advice, but people more and more want to connect with someone they can think of as an online friend, versus a faceless company."" Purnell is among the swelling tide of financial influencers: creators feeding a seemingly insatiable desire for content on spending, saving and investing. Throughout the past few years, the popularity of these 'finfulencers' has exploded, with many amassing followings into the millions. A growing part of the global influencer industry, with an estimated market size of a whopping $104bn (£83bn) as of 2022, some of these finfluencers report earning upwards of six-figures as social media presences. Their posts can provide welcome insight into the often-opaque world of personal finance – a world young people specifically are finding harder and harder to see into. Yet if trusting money advice from strangers with murky qualifications gives you pause, there's a reason. A young audience Millions of people log on every day to consume advice from financial influencers. Humphrey Yang, a former financial adviser in his 30s, leads the finfluencer pack with more than 50m likes and 3m followers on TikTok, as of this writing. US-based Yang focuses on personal finance advice, with his most popular videos explaining concepts such as retirement accounts and stock prices. In his most-watched video – more than 14 million views – Yang acts out borrowing an iPhone, selling it and then buying the same model for less a year later in order to explain the concept of short selling. Easily digestible content like Yang's appeals primarily to a young audience, says Radhika Duggal, an adjunct business professor at New York University and the chief marketing officer at fintech company Super. ""With the lack of financial education in schools, Gen Zers are being forced to learn about money on their own,"" she says. ""This is the first economic crisis that younger generations are experiencing, and it's no surprise that they're turning to influencers to ensure that they can make good decisions and weather the current climate."" Connor Campbell, a business finance expert at financial comparison site NerdWallet UK, says successful finfluencers purposely provide an easy entry point into money-related topics. ""Financial influencers tend to create content that is appealing to younger generations, specifically using terminology and examples that relate to pop-culture and simplifying financial terms,"" he says. One example of a simplified financial concept is ""cash-stuffing"", a budgeting method that went viral on TikTok in 2022. The cash-stuffing system advocates for dividing physical cash into folders or envelopes for allotted expenses, such as groceries or hobbies, meaning followers are less likely to overspend. It's not a novel concept, but it is new to many young social media users, especially those with limited personal finance exposure. Content like this is helpful to promote better financial habits among young people, believes Campbell. ""By presenting financial tips in an accessible way, they've improved financial literacy, and invoked a newfound interest in being proactive about where people are putting their money, and ways that they can bump their savings."" Purnell agrees, saying that responses from her readers has been ""overwhelmingly positive"", and that people appreciate her advice on living more frugally. She believes that the relatability of her content, combined with the simplicity of her advice, is a winning formula for young viewers. ""I'm just another person looking to save money and perhaps try out a side-hustle or two,"" she says. Experts or regular people? Yet although creators say audiences have been highly receptive to their tips, experts caution some finfluencers may also be leading followers astray – and even, in some cases, taking advantage of them. ""Some of these influencers are just regular people with no background in finance,"" says Campbell. ""Social media can cause people to rush into making uninformed decisions due to a fear of missing out on something that a lot of other people are participating in – and when these trends involve real money, this can sometimes become an issue."" Experts have recently warned of surges in self-directed investing based on questionable guidance from financial influencers, arguing some of these social media stars are offering poor advice, either because of their own lack of financial knowledge, or because it is in their interest to post increasingly outlandish content in the interest of gaining followers. In some cases, organisations have accused personal finance content creators of leveraging the vulnerabilities of a debt-ridden generation to boost their own follower counts. Last year, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned against online promotions focused on paying off debt, saying that influencers involved in these posts were attracting ""vulnerable or indebted customers"" to follow ""misleading"" financial advice. Offering questionable personal finance advice to capture a large audience has been an issue for decades. Finance mega-stars, many of whom have built profitable careers with their money-management tips, have found themselves in hot water in the past. For instance, Suze Orman, a high-profile TV personality, has come under fire for endorsing questionable financial products, and was even accused of fraud in 2009. Now, however, social media is exposing a larger, younger and often less-educated audience to often unvetted personal finance advice. There's also the added complication of how influencers make their money – social media stars often endorse products for payment, meaning their advice may not be objective. In particular, the rise in cryptocurrency adverts have raised flags, after high-profile cases of influencers endorsing new crypto products. The volatility of cryptocurrency means that it can be difficult to predict the market – and yet many social media users have been led to believe that digital currencies are a good investment. Last year, Kim Kardashian found herself under the microscope when she posted about cryptocurrency Ethereum Max. Although Ethereum saw a rapid rise in 2021, it quickly crashed, losing 97% of its value by January 2022. Investors who had suffered huge losses brought a lawsuit against Kardashian (who currently has more than 364m Instagram followers) and other celebrities who promoted the product, claiming that they had conspired to inflate the value of the tokens. The case was eventually thrown out, but the judge warned of ""celebrities' ability to readily persuade millions of undiscerning followers to buy snake oil with unprecedented ease and reach"". 'Boring but highly effective' James Beckett, 33, launched a content side-hustle after noticing how much bad investment advice was circulating online. The former social media marketer, whose YouTube channel has a small but growing following of several thousand subscribers, says many financial influencers know that engagement comes from get-rich-quick schemes and flaunting their supposed wealth. ""TikTok has reduced our attention spans to fractions of a second, and you need flashy investing content to capture an audience,"" says Beckett, based in Hertfordshire, UK. Beckett isn't the only one worried about too-good-to-be-true schemes and investment scams. Finance industry professionals and organisations have also started to speak out about these issues, and the FCA recently proposed a crackdown on finfluencers, arguing their advice can be misleading, and that they often ""have little knowledge of what they're promoting"". However, Beckett believes he and many finfluencers like him also provide what he describes as ""boring but highly effective"" financial advice. He says these tips are not only lower risk but also more reliable – he discusses the ins and out of concepts including passive investing and index funds – especially for young people without a strong financial-education background or lots of money to burn. Beckett argues social media finance content can offer an accessible way into managing money, without having to pay the high fees many financial advisors or organisations demand. ""Financial influencers can be problematic, because some of them prey on people's naivety,"" he says. ""But on the flip side, there are a lot of people doing good out there, and they are filling a huge gap left by our education system."" Proceeding with caution Without a regulatory body, the world of finfluencing remains somewhat murky. For many, finfluencers have led to accessible financial guidance, filling a gap in financial literacy among young people. And even amid questionable advice or worrying tactics, Campbell argues that, if paired with a discerning attitude and a little bit of scepticism, finfluencers can help put people on the path to responsible money management. ""Personal finances are – as the name suggests – personal to the individual, and everyone's circumstances are different,"" he says. ""It's important to assess whether an influencer's suggestions are relevant to your financial situation."" Beckett adds that although finfluencers might have a bad reputation, they can also offer a route into the confusing, and sometimes intentionally opaque, world of finance and investing. Objective influencers, who don't cash in on partnerships or present their advice as bulletproof, can be a force for good, especially for followers who've never thought about savings or growing wealth. ""Like everything in the world, there are good finfluencers and bad ones,"" he says. ""While the most obnoxious, audacious creators have a larger tendency to go viral, you can still find fantastic personal finance content on social media platforms from people who genuinely want to help. Finfluencers aren't worth shunning entirely."""
market volatility,Market volatility and supply issues delaying A6 upgrade,2024-09-15,2022-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62793022,"Supply-chain issues and global-market volatility are delaying the completion of a new road connecting Londonderry and Dungiven, Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has said.   The 15-mile dual carriageway is part of the A6 upgrade linking Derry and Belfast. It had been due to be completed earlier this year. DfI said it is ""working closely with the contractor"" to agree a completion date. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle earlier this week, DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell criticised the ""contentious delays"" to the upgrade. He was speaking after a weekend of disruption for many residents and businesses in Dungiven, as a main road through the town was closed to allow for resurfacing work.  ""The minister [John O'Dowd] needs to get an edge on this and get this road completed,"" Mr Campbell said. The Department for Infrastructure began work on the A6 road scheme in 2018. Work was completed on the nine-mile (14.7km) dual carriageway between Toomebridge, County Antrim, and Castledawson, County Derry, last year.  The first phase of the carriageway, between the M22 motorway at Randalstown and Toomebridge, opened in 2019. The dual carriageway is part of a larger scheme to improve the route between Derry and Belfast, with work continuing on a major new road between Derry and Dungiven. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 15-mile section of dual carriageway includes a bypass around Dungiven. The whole scheme is expected to cost about £220m, according to the Department for Infrastructure. The Department said it was anticipated the scheme ""could be completed by Spring 2022"", but the Covid-19 pandemic ""had a major impact"" on its progress. The DfI said various activities had been disrupted due to ""social distancing requirements, staff absences and issues associated with the supply chain"".   ""Ongoing global market volatility has also impacted the scheme delivery,"" they said.   A spokesperson for the department said staff and contractors had continued to progress the strategically important project ""despite the exceptional challenges"". It was a weekend of disruption for many residents and businesses in Dungiven, as a main road through the town was closed to allow for resurfacing work.  It will be closed again by the Department for Infrastructure this coming weekend as well, for more resurfacing work to be carried out. ""There were problems last weekend because the road was closed at the Dungiven end, and that is going to be repeated this weekend,"" Mr Campbell said.  ""Then, at the other end of the road, at Drumahoe, the road will be closed the following weekend, so this is going to go on for the whole of September with still no end date in sight.  ""At the moment, if you're driving on that road, it is single-file traffic, a 40-mile-per-hour speed limit and no overtaking permitted - that is what we have for 17 miles for most of the road."" Mr Campbell said motorists in the north west need answers.  ""Everyone understands there may be problems. Everyone understands that at some point roads may need to be closed,"" he said.  ""But they need to explain clearly, in straightforward terms, to the travelling public in Dungiven, Drumahoe, Claudy and everywhere in between about what is happening."" The department apologised for the disruption caused to road users and those living in the vicinity. A spokesperson said the roadworks at Dungiven over two weekends were required to complete final surfacing at a new roundabout. ""We are working closely with the contractor to agree a date for completion of the scheme,"" they said."
market volatility,Moscow stock market reopens for limited trading,2024-09-15,2022-03-21,By Jennifer Meierhans,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60821258,"The Moscow stock exchange has partially reopened after a nearly month-long suspension over the war in Ukraine. Only bonds issued by the Russian government can be traded as part of a phased re-opening of the market.  The exchange closed hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February. Andrei Braginsky, a spokesman for the Moscow Exchange, said he hoped that trading in stocks would be able to start again soon. ""Technically everything is ready, and we are hoping this will resume in the near future,"" he said.  The market reopened at 13:00 (10:00 GMT) but only for OFZ bonds - the Russian acronym for Federal Loan Obligations. In pre-market trading, yields on those government bonds rose by almost 20% - the highest on record. A higher yield means the government will have to pay more to borrow and indicates the investment is more risky. The yield later settled close to 13% after trading began. Central Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Friday the bank would maintain its key interest rate at 20% and would purchase government bonds to limit volatility. Meanwhile, oil prices jumped more than $3 on Monday, with Brent crude climbing above $111 a barrel. Prices moved higher after reports that the EU was considering whether to join the US in imposing an oil embargo on Russia. The European Commission said earlier this month it aimed to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels ""well before 2030"". The invasion of Ukraine, and sanctions imposed by western governments, are taking a toll on the Russian economy. The Russian rouble was steady against the dollar on Monday, trading at 104.83 RUB. However, it is down by about a quarter since the start of the invasion. Some supermarkets are rationing sales of basic goods such as salt and cooking oil. The central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20% four days after the start of Moscow's military action in Ukraine. The continuation of the conflict and ratcheting up of sanctions have undermined confidence further. There have been concerns about Russia defaulting on its debt, but it paid $117 million in interest on two dollar-denominated bonds last week."
market volatility,UK petrol price hits fresh record above £1.50,2024-09-15,2022-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60554128,"Fuel prices have hit record highs in the UK as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect global oil prices. The RAC said the average price of petrol jumped to £1.51 a litre on Sunday, while diesel increased to £1.55. The price of both fuels has jumped since Thursday, when Russia began its assault on Ukraine. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said despite oil prices calming, prices at the pump will continue to rise. The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with unleaded petrol is now £83, or £85 for diesel. ""This week will be an important one in terms of the oil price as it's likely to reveal the speed of the inevitable upward trend or the extent of the volatility in the market,"" said Mr Williams. The price of Brent crude rose by 4.6% to $102 barrel on Monday after Western nations imposed new sanctions on Russia - one the world's largest energy producers. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because fuel, like oil is traded in dollars. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it would still be affected by global wholesale prices rising. UK consumers are already paying a high price for fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Steve Irwin, from fuel consultancy firm Portland, told the BBC that prices had risen due to concerns over oil and gas pipelines which travel through Ukraine and carry Russian products. He said there was ""potential for enormous supply disruption"" if Russia retaliated to sanctions and used oil ""as a weapon"". ""It's impossible to know what kind of trajectory we are looking at for oil prices over the coming weeks,"" he said. However, Mr Irwin added that price was a bigger concern than supply currently, as the US and Saudi Arabia are also huge oil exporters. Mandy Watts depends on her car for work, but thinks ""the cost of petrol has gone through the roof"". Going carless isn't an option for Mandy, but she is trying to use it less. ""Being a single parent as well, you have to think about these things,"" she told the BBC. ""Is it petrol, is it food, is it heating, what do you put first? Food and heating has to come before petrol. So I tend to limit a little bit where I go now."" Robert Halfon, a former Conservative minister, has called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to look at reducing VAT or fuel duty, which has been frozen for 12 years. He told the Times: ""Given what is going on it is genuinely going to be unaffordable for most families. It isn't just for motorists, it's businesses too because they can't afford transportation costs and things like that."" Luke Bosdet, fuel spokesman for the AA, said the rise in fuel costs came at the same time as households were facing energy bill rises. ""To think that, less than two years ago, fuel at £1 a litre beckoned,"" he said.  ""If there is a silver lining, the predictions of 160p or even 170p-a-litre fuel now look exaggerated as the oil price fell back after one day's surge last week."""
market volatility,Catcher in the Briny,2024-09-15,2017-12-27,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-42491696,"The Catcher area has cost $1.6bn to bring on-stream. That's 29% under its budget when the investment was approved. Making its announcement on Wednesday morning, Premier Oil wants the first oil, on 23 December, to signal to the market that it is a serious player in getting an offshore field to first oil, and beyond. It starts with 10,000 barrels a day. Once all 19 wells from various fields in the Catcher area are producing, it should hit the target 60,000 barrels per day some time in 2018. To put that in context, UK offshore production has been between 1.4m and 1.9m barrels in the past couple of years. World production is over 90m per day. Happily for Premier Oil, the price of Brent crude oil surged just as it came on-stream, reaching $67 per barrel on very light Christmas trading. Also happily, for the North Sea industry, this coincided with the Forties Pipeline Network being brought back onstream, after three weeks of repairs forced by a crack found at an underground section in Aberdeenshire. It's not up to speed yet, while the new owner, Ineos, limits the flow and pressure. That is estimated to have cost $20m a day in lost production from the 85 fields linked to Forties.  It wasn't much of a catch for Catcher, however, as it is based on a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) model - a rather large ship that bobs in the North Sea, the length of two football pitches, and holding up to 650,000 barrels of oil.  Once full, a tanker can take its contents to Rotterdam or Grangemouth. These developments remind us of five key elements to the North Sea oil and gas story at its present stage 1.  While the 'basin' is in decline, it's enjoying an uptick because of vast investment in recent years, from which new fields continue to come on-stream. 2. Much of the new investment is from smaller companies, such as Premier. While being the producer, it owns half of the Catcher area, and Cairn Energy, based in Edinburgh, owns a fifth. 3. ""Mature"" North Sea hardware is vulnerable to expensive outages as it shows signs of wear and tear. 4. The price of oil remains volatile. The past year has seen Brent crude rise by 17%, much of that in the past two months, after sharp falls from later 2014.  It was buoyed by the Forties Pipeline shutdown. It was raised further in the past three days by an explosion in a Libyan pipeline that has set back that country's hopes of re-establishing a reliable supply despite its continued civil war. 5. That 29% saving on the original budget for Catcher is not unique to Premier. Costs have been tumbling in oil production. So while the price picks itself off the floor of $30, with a steady run through this year in the upper 50s, some oil fields begin to look financially attractive for development. That's certainly true of the onshore fields in the US, where fracking is back. While OPEC, the cartel of oil exporters, a month ago agreed another phase of production cutbacks, in order to put a floor under the price, the American industry can step in with a quick hit of new, fracked production, thus keeping a ceiling on the price. In this, the North Sea has some influence. You could see that from the impact of the Forties Pipeline shut-down on the world price.  But not much influence. Beyond the short-term, offshore producers in the North Sea know that they have to accept the price set by forces controlled far away. What they can control is cost, and more than you might think. An industry survey published earlier this month showed a sharp rise in the extent of collaboration between oil producers, mostly in order to reduce costs. Deloitte found 95% of respondents see collaboration as being built into their business model. Success rates were more modest, at 47%, but they're improving a lot as the industry learns, up from 27% in 2015. As decommissioning efforts are ramped up, around 80% of those involved say collaboration will have to become part of the financial case. And if Catcher looks impressive, consider the case of Johan Castberg, a field with reserves of more than 650 million barrels of oil. It's located to the north of Tromso, off the north of Norway, which has both challenging and controversial elements of Arctic drilling. The original costing was for 100bn Norwegian kroner (£9bn) and breakeven point at a world oil price of $80 per barrel. After re-engineering the thinking, and re-thinking the engineering, the design and putting pressure on suppliers' prices, that initial investment was halved, and it can be profitable at below $35 per barrel.  That's why it got approval from the Statoil board earlier this month, to be a major part of its investment in Norwegian waters through to first oil, scheduled for 2022. Two months ago, Norway's state-controlled driller had an oil find at the Verbier field in the UK sector, and it's investing in drilling off South America.  But it isn't resting on an oily future. At the same time, it's seen a UK offshore wind array opened, invested in solar, and started work on the world's first floating offshore wind array, the Hywind project in the Moray Firth. On the same theme, nor is Royal Dutch Shell sticking with the knitting. It has just bought First Utility, a British energy retailer, signifying a shift into downstream energy and smart grid technology."
market volatility,Isle of Man electricity bills to rise by 30%,2024-09-15,2022-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-60772655,"Electricity prices on the Isle of Man are to rise by 30%, Manx Utilities (MU) has announced. The increase will by applied in two increments of 15%, one in April and then one in July. The price hikes come on the heels of a 27.5% rise in Manx Gas bills, which was approved by Tynwald in October. Current volatility in the global wholesale gas market has been cited as the reason for both electricity and gas price rises. MU had previously warned the rising cost of natural gas, used to produce most of the island's electricity, could lead to an increase of up to 39%. Under MU's agreed pricing strategy, which is linked to inflation, water and sewerage rates will also rise by 5% next month.  Chief Minister Alfred Cannan said prices of oil, gas, petrol, and diesel had ""increased significantly in recent months with further sharp price spikes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine"". ""These rising prices mean that it is going to become considerably more expensive to heat and light our homes, to drive our vehicles, to operate businesses and to run essential public services,"" he added. Mr Cannan said the government-owned electricity provider had worked with the Council of Ministers to ""to determine a way forward that reflects the increased cost of generating electricity, but which also reduces the impact of such a sharp price rise"". The phased increase would ""buy some time"" for the government to better understand the ""longer term implications for the energy markets"" and to consider what broader economic support may be needed, he said. Treasury Minister David Ashford said global volatility would bring a ""substantial increase"" in the cost of living and an assessment of that impact and any necessary action would be presented to Tynwald in April.

market volatility,University facing possible £11m energy bill rise,2024-09-15,2023-01-18,By Julia Causton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-64292532,"A university says it could be facing an energy bill rise of more than £11m. Steve West, vice chancellor of the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, said costs might be as high as £18m in 2023-2024. He said the price increase would not be passed on to students, despite the impact on the university's budget. ""We're looking at how we can save energy, save costs, but also we're having to look hard about how and where we invest going forward,"" Mr West said. UWE's energy bill for the 2021-2022 academic year was £6.5m, while in 2022-23 it was £10.5million, he added. ""Many universities forward purchase [energy], so we forward purchase two years ahead, and that gives us some security. ""But at the moment the market is so volatile, we're going to see a significant increase. We don't quite know how much and that's a big problem for us,"" said Mr West. He warned the rising energy prices could ""impact on our capital investments going forward"". ""At the moment we're prioritising all of the things we can do to reduce our energy to net zero carbon emissions for the university itself,"" added Mr West. Meanwhile, the University of Bath told the BBC it generated about 10 per cent of its electricity on campus through the use of renewables and mini-power stations. The University of Gloucestershire said its energy rate was fixed every six months so, although it was likely to face significantly higher prices later in the year, it was currently protected from market volatility. While its energy bills have increased ""significantly"", the University of Bristol said they remained a small part of its overall expenditure. It said its priority was to help students who were struggling, via hardship funding. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk"
market volatility,A6 Derry-Dungiven road 'could open' in late April,2024-09-15,2023-01-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-64473982,"The new A6 road between Londonderry and Dungiven could open at the end of April, according to a Department for Infrastructure (DfI) official. The DfI's Kaine Lynch said that was the deadline it was working towards, ""subject to any unforeseen circumstances"".  The 15-mile (24km) stretch is part of the A6 road that links Derry and Belfast.  It was due to open last autumn and there has been frustration over delays. The new stretch of road mostly runs parallel to the existing road and includes a bypass of Dungiven. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday, Mr Lynch, the DfI's director of major projects and procurement, said he understood the concerns of ""local people and the travelling public"". ""They have waited a long time for the upgrade and understandably want to know when it will open,"" he said.   His comments follow an interview with DUP MP Gregory Campbell on BBC Radio Foyle on Tuesday. He said officials from the department had warned him that, in a worst case scenario, the road would open in July. Mr Campbell also criticised a lack of transparency on the issue.  ""We're now virtually in the spring of '23 and they're still not giving a final deadline,"" he added. Following Mr Campbell's comments, Mr Lynch said a road safety audit was now in process and that the main line construction work was ""now largely complete with the exception of road signs and street lighting connections"". He said ""the end of April"" was the target the DfI was now working towards to open the road to the public.  ""The street lighting connections will be complete within the next fortnight. Now the signs won't be complete until next month, but we are running that road safety audit process in parallel. ""We have already identified minor issues in terms of that road safety project and we are actively working towards those."" The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. On Tuesday, the head of a Dungiven community group said there have been two consecutive weekends of major traffic disruption around the town due to the road works.  Mairead McCormack, who is chief executive of Glenshane Community Development, said locals were deeply frustrated by the traffic, with its associated noise and air pollution. ""Last Friday there were two sets of traffic management schemes in Dungiven, with four-mile tailbacks,"" she said. ""There is really no need when you have a perfectly good road that could be open at times like that. ""We're concerned that there's no transparency as to why the bypass has not been opened. We are taxpayers, we should be informed as to why there are issues and what the issues are."" Mr Lynch said there are many factors as to why there has been delays to the road opening, citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the increased costs of building materials and some materials being in short supply. ""We have had supply issues in terms of the signs, we have also had inefficiencies with working in quarantine and all the rest. It's a combination of issues in terms of the delays we are dealing with today."" The department said in a statement: ""The scheme is well advanced and mainline construction work is now largely complete with the exception of a proportion of road signs and street lighting connections. ""We have recently commenced the road safety audit process, which must be completed before the road can be opened. ""Subject to any unforeseen circumstances, the current programme indicates the road could open at the end of April."""
market volatility,Bank of Ireland UK pulls mortgage deals,2024-09-15,2022-09-27,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63039476,"Bank of Ireland UK is among lenders to temporarily withdraw mortgage products in the wake of financial market turmoil.  The bank said it had withdrawn all residential and buy-to-let rates on Monday and will launch new ranges as soon as possible. The price of UK government borrowing has increased since Friday's budget which has an impact on lenders. Borrowers have been urged to ""act fast"" to secure new deals.  Virgin Money and Skipton Building Society halted mortgage offers for new customers, but said submitted applications would still be processed. Halifax said it would stop mortgages with product fees. Danske Bank, one of the biggest lenders in Northern Ireland, said: ""We are monitoring the competitive landscape closely to ensure our mortgage product offering is in line with the wider market."" The Bank of England said on Monday it would ""not hesitate"" to hike interest rates after the pound hit record lows. The bank's base rate influences borrowing costs across the economy for things like mortgages and personal loans. It said it would make a full assessment as to whether it should change interest rates at its next meeting on 3 November, following speculation it might have intervened earlier. Following Monday's volatility, financial markets updated predictions and said interest rates could now more than double by next spring to 5.8%, from their current level of 2.25%, to curb inflation. Experts said a rise in the cost of long-term borrowing meant the current cost to mortgage lenders of offering new deals was now more expensive.  Owen Peden, managing director at PropertyPal Mortgages in Northern Ireland said people ""were concerned"" but not to panic.   ""We need to educate people to get on the ball and talk to a mortgage broker,"" he said.  ""If your fixed rate is coming to an end in six months, act quick to secure the best rate. ""Prolonging it doesn't help. It's unlikely it's going to get better. I don't have a crystal ball but it looks like rates will get higher."" The Bank of England has already lifted interest rates seven times in a row since December to the highest level in 14 years. If rates continue to increase as forecasted the average household in NI could see an increase of around £200 per month to their mortgage payments, according to PropertyPal.

market volatility,Market volatility and supply issues delaying A6 upgrade,2024-09-15,2022-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62793022,"Supply-chain issues and global-market volatility are delaying the completion of a new road connecting Londonderry and Dungiven, Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has said.   The 15-mile dual carriageway is part of the A6 upgrade linking Derry and Belfast. It had been due to be completed earlier this year. DfI said it is ""working closely with the contractor"" to agree a completion date. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle earlier this week, DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell criticised the ""contentious delays"" to the upgrade. He was speaking after a weekend of disruption for many residents and businesses in Dungiven, as a main road through the town was closed to allow for resurfacing work.  ""The minister [John O'Dowd] needs to get an edge on this and get this road completed,"" Mr Campbell said. The Department for Infrastructure began work on the A6 road scheme in 2018. Work was completed on the nine-mile (14.7km) dual carriageway between Toomebridge, County Antrim, and Castledawson, County Derry, last year.  The first phase of the carriageway, between the M22 motorway at Randalstown and Toomebridge, opened in 2019. The dual carriageway is part of a larger scheme to improve the route between Derry and Belfast, with work continuing on a major new road between Derry and Dungiven. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 15-mile section of dual carriageway includes a bypass around Dungiven. The whole scheme is expected to cost about £220m, according to the Department for Infrastructure. The Department said it was anticipated the scheme ""could be completed by Spring 2022"", but the Covid-19 pandemic ""had a major impact"" on its progress. The DfI said various activities had been disrupted due to ""social distancing requirements, staff absences and issues associated with the supply chain"".   ""Ongoing global market volatility has also impacted the scheme delivery,"" they said.   A spokesperson for the department said staff and contractors had continued to progress the strategically important project ""despite the exceptional challenges"". It was a weekend of disruption for many residents and businesses in Dungiven, as a main road through the town was closed to allow for resurfacing work.  It will be closed again by the Department for Infrastructure this coming weekend as well, for more resurfacing work to be carried out. ""There were problems last weekend because the road was closed at the Dungiven end, and that is going to be repeated this weekend,"" Mr Campbell said.  ""Then, at the other end of the road, at Drumahoe, the road will be closed the following weekend, so this is going to go on for the whole of September with still no end date in sight.  ""At the moment, if you're driving on that road, it is single-file traffic, a 40-mile-per-hour speed limit and no overtaking permitted - that is what we have for 17 miles for most of the road."" Mr Campbell said motorists in the north west need answers.  ""Everyone understands there may be problems. Everyone understands that at some point roads may need to be closed,"" he said.  ""But they need to explain clearly, in straightforward terms, to the travelling public in Dungiven, Drumahoe, Claudy and everywhere in between about what is happening."" The department apologised for the disruption caused to road users and those living in the vicinity. A spokesperson said the roadworks at Dungiven over two weekends were required to complete final surfacing at a new roundabout. ""We are working closely with the contractor to agree a date for completion of the scheme,"" they said."
market volatility,UK firms pull stock market floats,2024-09-15,2017-11-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41856441,"Arqiva, the UK's largest owner of TV transmitters and food producer Bakkavor have pulled their stock market listings because of market uncertainty. Arqiva has postponed a stock market flotation  that would have valued the group at £6bn. Bakkavor, which supplies food to M&S and Waitrose, has scrapped its plan that potentially valued it at £1bn. Both firms announced their listing plans last month, but  cited market volatility for their change of heart. In October, a number of European companies floated but saw their shares perform weakly in the following days. French fashion group SMCP shares have barely risen above their initial stock market flotation price of €21 (£19; $24) each.  Austrian bank Bawag listed at €48 a share and is now trading at €45.76 while Spanish housebuilder Aedas Homes floated at €31.65 and its shares are now worth €31.00. Arqiva, which is owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Australian bank Macquarie, may proceed with a float next year if market conditions improve. Its clients include the BBC, ITV and international broadcasters and its masts cover about 98% of the UK. However, Bakkavor, the UK's largest supplier of hummus, said it will no longer proceed with its plans for an initial public offering (IPO). It said: ""Whilst the company received sufficient institutional demand to cover the offering, the board has taken the decision that proceeding with the transaction would not be in the best interests of the company, or its shareholders, given the current volatility in the IPO market."" Neil Glover, business development director for the UK and Ireland at EY, said that recently there has been a ""real lack of traditional IPOs"" which he described as companies with household or more easily recognisable names. He said: ""We believe in 2018, there will be a minor build-up of IPOs in the second and third quarter,"" adding that ""some investors are keeping their powder dry"" until then. Mr Glover also said that that companies are eager to announce their flotations before 2019: ""Everyone is a bit paranoid about Brexit and they want to move before it takes place."" Bakkavor, which operates across the UK, China and the US and employs around 18,500 people, was founded in 1986 by Icelandic brothers Lydur and Agust Gudmundsson. Mr Gudmundsson is the chief executive of the group which in 2016 reported a 3.6% rise in group sales to £1.7bn. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) increased by 12.3% to £145.6m."
market volatility,Bitcoin or bust?,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131219-bitcoin-or-bust,"Digital Currency Primer Digital currencies are “mined,” traded and exchanged. (The
Chicago Federal Reserve has published Bitcoin:
A Primer. Bitcoin.org and Blockchain.info which are repositories
for information and transactions. And numerous Bitcoin exchanges exist around
the world for swapping Bitcoin with other currency.)  According to the Chicago Fed, Bitcoin is a fiduciary
currency and “inherently fragile.” Most fiduciary currency derives its value
from “government fiat,” which means the government says it has value or at
least someone else is willing to accept it as valuable. This is in contrast to
commodity-based currency which is itself often a precious metal of value. Is digital currency finally moving from mania to mainstream? In the past few weeks, Bitcoin — the most widely used digital or virtual currency — has “gone parabolic,” as financial market watchers like to say, soaring from a value of $800 to $1200, then rapidly losing half as much as half its value after a Chinese exchange stopped accepting yuan deposits. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have captured the world’s collective imagination. Not so much for their use, but more for what the emerging phenomena say about the global economy, government-issued fiat currencies and central bank policies. To true believers — and even some academics and wealth managers — investors should hold Bitcoin in addition to gold and other alternatives to help diversify their existing portfolio of investments. But not so fast, say others. It’s a volatile and unproven currency, often fluctuating more than 10% in one day.  The US dollar? Fractions of a percent. Same for the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound. Even gold’s rapid decline in 2013 has been measured on a daily basis, aside from a 9% drop on April 15. In the spotlight So, should consumers be joining the digital currency revolution, and holding Bitcoin alongside other alternatives like gold? Not exactly. But the increasing volume of alternative, cross-border currency is still worthy of attention. Even legitimate currency strategists from both Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have attempted to tackle Bitcoin’s place in the world. But there’s also broad concern. A hearing on the “risks, threats and promises” of virtual currencies was recently held by a US Senate committee. The People’s Bank of China has moved to bar financial institutions from Bitcoin transactions. Other central banks — in France and South Korea, for example — have issued consumer warnings on Bitcoin, cautioning buyers and merchants that its volatility could undermine its utility. Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who coined the term “irrational exuberance” to explain the Japanese real estate bubble and, in turn, warn about late 1990s tech stock valuations, has said that digital currencies have no “intrinsic value.” Outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, however, took a more hedged approach, saying that virtual currencies “may have long-term promise.” Still, for many people, the lure of Bitcoin and other alternative currencies may be too much to ignore. Treading cautiously — and understanding the pitfalls — is key to mitigating your risk of getting burned. “Technology is a tremendously disruptive force in society, and it knows no boundaries,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist for broker ConvergEx, in reference to the advance and hype around Bitcoin. How, exactly, does digital currency work? Created in 2009, Bitcoin are finite (21 million will ultimately exist) and can be transacted in units as low as one “Satoshi” or 0.00000001 BTC, as Bitcoin are abbreviated. Bitcoin are created and recorded on a decentralized computer network, which work together to verify the “mining” of new Bitcoins and cross-reference and record any Bitcoin transaction. Bitcoins move from one owner to the next when each party to a transaction sends (and confirms) an exchange. It could be anything from an online purchase to an international money transfer to settling a sports bet. Transactions are then verified across the network, to prevent double-spending of Bitcoin. As described by a Chicago Federal Reserve primer, Bitcoin and other digital currencies are “inherently fragile” because there’s no way to gauge actual value or price. Buyers and sellers of the currency can debate its value or one side can simply chose not to accept it as payment. The value of official currencies, also called legal tender, is not ever in dispute. Virtual utility? Early on, Bitcoin was used to pay software programmers for their time and effort developing Bitcoin protocols, but its use has extended to general merchandise, online gambling, and, until recently, an intricate illegal drug-dealing network called “The Silk Road.” So far, though, no major retailer has opened up their cash registers for volatile digital currencies. So the currency is used mainly by  an ad hoc network of small buyers and sellers, although their numbers are growing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch FX and Rates Strategist David Woo attempted to divine a fair value for Bitcoin, triangulating its usage in e-commerce and money transfer and its use as a store of value. Woo pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility undermines its role as a medium of exchange — that is transactions plummet as volatility rises. In spite of this, Woo wrote in his note that Bitcoin’s low transaction costs can make it attractive: it is inherently a peer-to-peer currency system and doesn’t require banks or other financial intermediaries to take their cut on transfers or storage. Its encrypted format also makes it more impervious than cash to theft or counterfeiting, he said. That said, Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and suffered network outages, resulting in wild price fluctuations and stolen Bitcoins. “The combination of legal tender status and supply anchors the value of dollars in transactions in a way that Bitcoin will never be anchored,” said CitiFX strategist Steven Englander. And then there’s the competition. Developers for other digital currencies such as Litecoin and open-source payment networks are constantly looking to improve upon (replace) Bitcoin. It’s an “issue that the internet currencies will not be able to overcome easily,” said Englander. Considering the traditional national and international system of currency that exists today, it’s not unreasonable to think cooperating governments could eventually come together to build in some of the features of a digital currency — with transaction verification and security to limit fraud and theft. They could “steal” some of the appeal of Bitcoin by making the alternative safer. In our networked world, we often see companies and governments work to cut out alternative (sometimes illicit) activity and bring it to light. Napster was co-opted first by litigation, then by Apple and iTunes. In the US, marijuana prices have been challenged by fresh legality in various states. Even loan-sharking in emerging economies has been diminished by innovative micro-lending platforms. Eventually Bitcoin will be challenged when governments, banks, merchants and individuals at the centre of the existing structure come together, experts said. Don’t think it could happen? The euro, born from the strength of the German Deutschmark, didn’t come in to existence until January 1, 1999 — then as a digital-only currency. "
market volatility,Tremors in emerging markets,2024-09-15,2014-02-18,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140218-tremors-in-emerging-markets,"Signs of strengthening recovery from developed economies have sent shudders through emerging markets in recent months, prompting heavy outflows of money from countries spanning the globe from India to China and Brazil. Emerging market stocks first started to wobble as far back as last spring, when the US Federal Reserve began to discuss its timetable for pulling back on fiscal stimulus, bringing its era of ‘cheap money’ to a close. But if turbulent stock markets sound like a challenge for people in Ivory Towers or city skyscrapers, think again. The return of higher long-term interest rates in the US and Europe means marginal money and projects are being pulled-out of emerging market countries and businesses. Investors have been rapidly shifting their investments in favour of what look like tried-and-tested markets. Stock markets, interest rates and currency exchange rates around the world are all connected and they have a direct impact on your wallet and pay cheque. In short, this interconnectivity all boils down to how businesses grow. Businesses look at the cost of labour and the price of resources when they decide where to build plants and produce goods, as well as what to pay workers. So ultimately, the price you pay for everything from clothes to computers begins to shift as markets, interest rates and currencies fluctuate. Understanding how global business decisions trickle down to consumers can be challenging, even for the most-sophisticated analysts. Yet it is important for consumer to have a firm grasp on how it all works. At their most basic, exchange rates indicate the price of one currency against another. Underlying those rates are the costs of goods and services that can be bought in the respective currencies, as well as the cost to borrow that currency, i.e. the interest rate. The baseline for these rates is generally targeted by central banks – the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England – and individual and corporate rates are set in reference to that “risk-free” rate. Exchange rates and interest rates adjust daily, based on views of investors and borrowers and which countries/currencies they want to invest in. To get a clearer picture of the ties that bind global currencies and exchange rates together, BBC Capital spoke to Steven Englander, global head of G10 currency strategy at Citibank. Edited excerpts follow. BBC Capital: For many of us, our experience with exchange rates occurs only at a foreign bank if we are travelling or sending money to family abroad. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of “exchanging” going on, so what will really move exchange rates? Englander: It takes a bit of time for the full exchange rate [fluctuation] to really go through into prices [people pay at stores or charge for labour]. In many emerging economies, it moves quicker than in the US, UK and other developed economies. What does happen quickly is the perception that the economy is slowing down and [that] projects are not viable anymore. Economic activity, both corporate and consumer, gets hit very quickly as businesses stall projects [and stop paying workers, cut worker hours or delay buying goods.] BBC Capital: So how do people under, say, the euro which serves many countries and economies, feel the effects of and adjust to these shocks when the individual countries in the eurozone have little influence over their exchange rate and monetary policy? Englander: In the eurozone, the adjustment comes by incomes shrinking, which brings down borrowing levels [as business can’t afford to borrow for expansion and hiring.] This process is very painful, because it takes much longer for competitiveness to be restored. In addition, if foreign investors see an extended period of weakness [they are less likely to invest in the area]. BBC Capital: We've been reading a lot recently about emerging markets and the effect of the US Federal Reserve tapering off its bond buying. How are these related? Englander: The emerging market story is actually threefold. China is slowing and its support for commodity demand is dissipating. [This affects the price of commodities like copper and crude oil and demand for related currencies in Canada and Australia, for example.] The US is beginning to pull rein in bond purchases [which can contribute to long-term interest rates rising.] But some emerging markets responded to global liquidity of the past few years by borrowing more and consuming, rather than investing and implementing structural reform. Now we have a slower China, tighter credit, slower growth and lower commodity prices all happening at once, so countries that were eager to borrow are crunched. BBC Capital: It sounds like investing broadly in emerging markets and China could be challenging in the short-term. So how should investors view these inevitable fluctuations? Do they need to ‘hedge’ their currency exposure? Englander: Currency exposure is part of a diversified portfolio and helps reduce portfolio volatility. Many economists and strategists recommend at least 20% to 30% of a portfolio to be exposed to foreign currencies. This can be done by directly owning foreign currencies or through equity investments abroad or companies with significant business outside their home region. If you hold large US and UK companies — such as those in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index or FTSE 100 — you implicitly have foreign currency exposure. This should also be part of your core financial planning process, understanding how your portfolio and the companies you own are sensitive to individual regions, countries and currencies."
market volatility,Cashing in on the robot revolution,2024-09-15,2015-09-24,Bryan Borzykowski,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20150922-does-this-compute-cashing-in-on-robot-revolution,"When people think of robots, they often imagine armies of droids destroying the human race or, at the very least, taking our jobs and leaving most of us out of work. Of course, both of those things are possible, but Randy Bateman isn’t worried. “The face of armed conflict may be dramatically altered,” said the Orlando, Florida-based president and CEO of Balcones Investment Research, an investment research firm, “but there are greater implications in, say, large-scale manufacturing.”  To Bateman, robots will one day do everything from complicated surgeries and dangerous mining missions to cleaning homes and mowing lawns. “People used to think of The Terminator, but now there’s a more general public acceptance of robotics,” he said. “People are understanding the value of this sector.” While factories already make use of robots — for painting and welding vehicles, for instance — and many people have small iRobot vacuum cleaners scooping up dirt off messy floors, the robot revolution is only beginning. And for Bateman, who buys robotics-related stocks, it’s a new frontier to invest in with it’s own set of risks and rewards.  Robot returns? Those who want to make money off robotics and automation will have to be patient, though. While some stocks have done well, Bateman said interest in this area has only picked up over the last year. And, many stocks remain volatile as some companies may have potential but aren’t yet proven operations — in part because this is still a young and rapidly growing area. If inflows into the only Robotics exchange-trade fund are any indication, then he’s right. In January 2014, $48m went into the ROBO-STOX Global Robotics and Automation ETF, which holds 83 companies in 17 different countries. At the start of this year, $103 million has flowed into the fund. Despite the strong inflows, the fund’s performance is down 10% year-to-date and 7.5% since it launched on the US-based NASDAQ exchange in November 2013. Travis Briggs, ROBO-STOX’s CEO, said the underperformance was mostly due to bad timing. When it launched, the bubble around 3D printing equities, which fall into the robotics category, deflated, while several robotics-related energy sector stocks got hit due the dropping price of oil, he said. Bateman agreed. General market volatility, especially in the energy sector, has caused a lot of these stocks to suffer. Other companies, such as NASDAQ-listed iRobot, which is down 12% year-to-date, have already peaked, Bateman said. This Bedford, Massachusetts, -based consumer-tech company, which makes home robotics such as the Roomba vacuum cleaner and the Mirra Pool Cleaning Robot, hit its all-time share in February 2014. Robotics companies will start performing better when the market settles down, but investors have to be patient, too, said Bateman. “It’s going to take some time,” he said. “There’s no magic bullet, but there are long-term opportunities.” The upside Nonetheless, many people believe robots and automation will form an integral part of future economic growth. According to New York-based Staista, a firm that aggregates research on a number of different topics, global spending on robotics will grow from $27bn today to $67bn in 2025. In the future, robotics could be a part of nearly everything we do from self-driving cars and personal maids to a creating a nation’s soldiers and nurse-like devices to assist the infirm, said Renaud Champion, a partner at Robolution Capital, a Paris-based venture capital firm that invests in robotics-related companies, including the privately held NAVYA Technology, a Villeurbanne, France, -based company that makes electric, driverless vehicles. He thinks many robotics companies will see double-digit growth in sales over the next five years. Ahead of the curve In Japan, which has one of the world’s oldest populations, robotics is already a booming business. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called for a robot revolution and wants to expand the country’s robotics market from 660bn yen ($5.5 bn) to 2.4tn yen ($20bn). Robots could in the future replace those older workers, while androids could help the aging population with its health needs.  { China, with its one-child policy, will also be a major market for robots, as it gears up for an industrial robot revolution, Bateman said, in part because it doesn’t have enough people to meet its manufacturing needs. At the moment, China has 30 industrial robots for every 100,000 people, which is 10 times lower than Germany and 14 times lower than South Korea, Briggs said. “It’s a massive undertaking where billions will be invested in robotics and automation.” Investment potential With technological advances happening rapidly, there are a few ways to make a play in robotics. The average investor could purchase the ROBO-STOX ETF, which would give the buyer an easy way to own a diversified basket of robotics-related companies, Champion said. Or one could buy shares in the companies themselves. Briggs segments the market into two areas: the tech companies like Mobileye and Immersion Corporation that develop the things needed to make the robots — like sensors or machine equipment — and the companies like KUKA Industrial Robots and FANUC America that sell robots for use.  Both areas have plenty of opportunities. The key, though, is to find companies that have strong end-markets. That could be a sector, like agriculture or health care, or a country, such as Japan, that gives incentives to companies to become more autonomous. As well, read financial statements and reports from the executive teams to make sure they’re committed for the long haul, Bateman said. “That’s always important, but especially important here when you don’t know for sure yet what the payoff, if there is one, will look like,” he said. For high net-worth investors, contributing to an early-stage, robotics venture capital fund is an option, particularly if you're not risk averse.  For now, you’re mostly making a bet on the future. Will robots really take over? Briggs said it’s only a matter of time. “They’ll be seamlessly integrated into your life,” he said. “Think about a washing machine or dryer — those are already machines [in our house] and we’ll soon see more them.” This story was produced under the BBC's guidelines for financial journalism.

market volatility,Will flying get more expensive?,2024-09-15,2020-05-29,John Walton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200528-will-the-price-of-flights-increase-due-to-coronavirus,"Covid-19 has caused unprecedented turmoil in the aviation industry. What does that mean for pricing when planes take to the skies again? As more countries start to ease their Covid-19 lockdowns, attention is returning to the global aviation industry, almost entirely grounded for months. Some passenger airlines have kept skeleton fleets flying for repatriation missions, some have converted passenger jets to use as cargo planes, but all of them would much rather return to their primary objective: flying people safely around the world. But when planes do take to the skies again, how much impact will the pandemic have on what they charge? “We know airlines want to get planes back in the air and bums back on seats,” says Benjamin Cany from Amadeus, a technology company that provides IT services to the travel industry, including one of its principal booking systems. In the short-term at least, that would point to lower fares aimed at incentivising consumers. Yet look past the next few months and there are factors that could push fares up, from airline bankruptcies that could reduce both supply and competition, to reduced fleets caused by retiring aircraft early. And the great unknown is how quickly passengers will return to flying, with the general feeling in the industry that aviation won’t return to pre-pandemic numbers until 2022, 2023 or beyond.   Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends. But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?” The pricing equation Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.” This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.” The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes. But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving. When will demand return? In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.  “Short-term, aircraft will continue to be much less full and airlines will be motivated to price seats to get customers flying safely in a Covid-19 world,” says Joe Leader, chief executive officer of APEX, a trade association whose members include airlines and their suppliers. “Airlines have cut back their flights to absolute connectivity minimums and are losing money on the vast majority of remaining flights… Hopefully, the combination of increased Covid-19 safety measures alongside low prices will encourage a travel rebound.” Paul Simmons, a senior airline executive with experience at numerous airlines worldwide including easyJet and Malaysia Airlines, suggests much will depend on what part low pricing can play as a tool to persuade people to travel. “It could be that airlines find their traditional lever of low pricing to drive bums on seats does not work as well as it used to. People may have higher concerns.” The general view is that domestic travel will recover first, a view with which Peter Foster, CEO of Kazakhstan’s national carrier Air Astana, agrees. “Initial indications from our recently-restarted limited domestic flights are that there is pent-up demand for these routes. We believe that business, worker and student travel will recover well before leisure travel.” IATA, an airline trade association, expects low demand when countries first start to travel again, despite some business travellers needing to fly and a desire for what’s known as VFR — visiting friends and relatives — traffic as people miss their families. On the plus side for airlines, IATA notes that the biggest variable cost in aviation, fuel, will be low: as drivers in many places are noticing, there’s oversupply in the petroleum industry keeping prices down. Will supply fall?  If there are major unknowns on the demand side, there are also evolving factors influencing pricing on the supply side. One of the starkest images for the airline industry has been the sight of line after line of jets parked on runways and put into storage at aircraft recycling ‘boneyards’. While older and less efficient planes will be retired, some of them years ahead of schedule, airline executive Paul Simmons points out that most of the planes taken out of fleets have been stored, not scrapped. “This is an important distinction,” he says. Joe Leader from airline association APEX suggests that “there will be more than enough supply even with all of the early aircraft retirements”. Certainly to start off with, demand will be low enough to be met by the aircraft that haven’t been retired. Airbus and Boeing have both announced cuts to the numbers of new aircraft they’re building every month, but as demand rises again, the aircraft manufacturers can increase production, airlines can extend the life of aircraft they’re using, or older aircraft can be brought back into use from storage. It’s already clear that the airline landscape, and indeed the names painted on the side of the aircraft, are likely to be forever changed. Some airlines have already filed for various forms of bankruptcy protection or indeed have simply gone under. This will, in many cases, lead to less competition – and the possibility of monopoly pricing, which tends not to favour consumers. Yet it’s likely that regulators will come down hard on airlines seen to profiteer, while other carriers will seek to jump into monopoly markets where that is possible, or new entrants will arise. For passengers, that’s likely to mean a fair amount of volatility in fares. “Although some airlines will inevitably go out of business, others will scale up to fill the void,” comments Simmons. “The ‘rightsizing’ of supply and demand may take time, however, leading to higher pricing in the medium term.” No easy answers The watchword for aviation, as for so many industries looking to rebound from Covid-19, is going to be uncertainty. New waves of infection, or treatment breakthroughs, would both influence the future path. So too will political and regulatory responses, as well as the wider global economic fallout that is being forecast. Demand, crucially, is not rising evenly; different government restrictions ­– especially quarantine periods on arrival for travellers from some nations – will have effects that are very complex to model, and will necessarily differ between nations or even within regions of the same nation. The US is an example of how perceptions and thus demand can vary across a nation. Scott DeAngelo, chief marketing officer of niche leisure carrier Allegiant Air, said on an earnings call that customer surveys revealed that “in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic, the Upper West, I got to tell you they don’t share the opinion that the evening news is putting out there” around travel. Pictures over the US Memorial Day holiday weekend have shown leisure destinations in some parts of the country packed with partygoers. It seems likely that travel resumption “bubbles” between neighbouring countries and regions with acceptably low infection rates (where “acceptably” will also vary) will continue, and while these may stimulate demand travellers will also not want to be caught overseas if restrictions return swiftly. The question of whether any travel insurance would cover Covid-19-related issues is also crucial. Airlines also need to start flying for people to start buying tickets even in a reduced demand scenario, and we are only just starting to see a very limited number of airlines resuming very limited schedules. That all makes predicting the effects of the interlocking factors upon which airline pricing is based challenging. The demand side of the curve is particularly tricky for long-haul pricing, says Air Astana CEO Peter Foster, who nevertheless expects that the stronger long-haul airlines are likely to try to kickstart demand with lower fares. Short-haul carriers, meanwhile, may benefit from low oil prices, reduced aircraft prices that enable counter-cyclical orders and lower salaries due to surplus aviation workers. “The prognosis may well be lower airfares on short/medium haul routes for at least 18 months to two years,” Foster expects. And while Covid-19 is unprecedented, he believes the past can offer indicators for future trends. “After every major crisis of the last 20 years – the Asian financial crisis of 1998, 9/11, the global financial crisis – low-cost airlines have emerged faster and stronger because suppressed demand combined with depressed consumer spending power has driven people to them,” he says. “I doubt 2020/21 will be any different.” Aviation journalist John Walton writes about airlines, aircraft and everything aeronautical.

market volatility,The one-company workers who never leave,2024-09-15,2022-10-10,Alex Christian,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221005-the-one-company-workers-who-never-leave,"Expected tenure in a role has shrunk at an alarming pace amid the Great Resignation. But some workers are reaping the rewards of spending decades in the same job. As the labour market has favoured workers throughout the past two years, many employees have taken advantage of the changing employment landscape, becoming job-hoppers and industry-switchers. While job opportunities thrive, this reshuffling has upended the idea of the ‘company man’, making it seem outdated at best.  Yet although this swath of highly-mobile workers has stolen much of the conversation around employment in the pandemic-era, plenty of other workers have still chosen to stay in one place. Moving roles may be tempting, but factors such as strong organisational culture, clear career pathways and job security have more allure for some employees. And they’re happy with their choice to stay put at the same place they’ve worked for years and years.  According to workers and experts, there are two main reasons employees remain with companies for life. First, some large companies are set up to develop, promote and retain workers in ways others are not, which means ambitious employees can reach the pinnacle of their careers without ever changing jobs. In other cases, employees may prioritise financial comfort and stability, see their career as a means to an end, and occupy their niche until retirement.  Climbing the ranks  The need to advance in life and achieve is innate, says Allan Lee, a senior lecturer in organisation studies and management at University of Exeter Business School, UK. A single company can fulfil this desire, and meet the needs of ambitious workers, by providing a well-defined career pathway and a sense of progression. “Feeling that you’re building towards a goal is a strong motivator in staying in a job,” says Lee. New York-based architect Nick began at his firm in an entry-level position 30 years ago, then quickly ascended the ranks. Each promotion gave him the opportunity to work on bigger and more prestigious projects, designing developments in some of the most coveted neighbourhoods in the US. “I was motivated by being in a company where I was encouraged to grow: one where I thought my contribution was valued,” he explains. As Nick accumulated more experience, he took on more senior roles, leading colleagues on global multimillion-dollar projects, from Manhattan to Shanghai. “I was lucky I could build a team of people motivated to work together and investigate architecture,” he says. “It meant it was more than just doing a job: there was a culture that allowed everyone to deliver meaningful work.” Nick is now at the pinnacle of his career: an executive and design leader for his firm. Through decades of experience, he’s been able to command a wealth of knowledge, inspire the direction of his company and be part of its history. “When I joined the firm, it was 35 people in one office – now it’s 1,100 employees, in 24 studios around the world,” he explains. “I think longevity builds respect and trust, and a chance to build something bigger than yourself.” Comfort and security  Not every worker who remains at their employer for decades will necessarily steadily climb the top of the career ladder like Nick. Some employees may be content in a stable, mid-level ranking until retirement.  “They may value mastering a position and obtaining the role of an expert,” says Johnny C Taylor Jr, the president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management (Shrm), based in Washington, DC. “This then allows them to enjoy stability, routine and a greater work-life balance, versus higher-level management and executive positions.”  Moves also come with risk: career stability and comfort can persuade employees to remain at an organisation. Further, financial practicalities can mean an organisation offering steady pay rises and pension plans is more able to lock in workers for the long haul. “Uncertainty can be a source of stress,” says Lee. “People want security. And although staying at one company for life may no longer be the expectation, someone knowing they have a job for the foreseeable future can be a strong motivator to remain.”  Lifetime employment is typically more common in long-established multinational corporations, where good pension provision, transparent pay structures and varied departments mean workers may have less incentive to search the job market for a fulfilling career elsewhere. “If the job offers what people have always sought from work – a way to make a decent living as well as find dignity and fulfilment – then employee loyalty is much easier to come by,” says Rick Wartzman, of management thinktank the Drucker Institute, and author of The End of Loyalty, based in Los Angeles.  Public-sector roles can also offer employees greater long-term stability. “Private sector businesses are more impacted by market volatility and generally can be subject to employment at will,” says Taylor, “whereas the public sector is more likely to offer pension plans and job security.” One such worker is Anthony. He joined the Civil Service in the 1970s as an 18-year-old, working in a government department assessing the tax valuations of properties in suburban London. He remained in the same department until 2017, reaching management level and retiring early on a pension reflecting his final salary. “I wasn’t someone [who was] that career-driven,” he says. “It was my first job after finishing school, I just wanted something that would offer a good salary and long-term stability: it was all I needed.”  ‘Why stay?’  Ambition isn't universal. If an organisation can keep a worker busy, relatively happy, engaged and decently remunerated, some people will stay. Although Anthony says he ultimately saw work as a means to an end, he was quietly content being able to lead a team, form workplace friendships and confidently carry out technical, time-consuming work. “I never really considered leaving: it was a job I enjoyed and it gave me financial security.”  Relationships and loyalty are also crucial factors in an employee choosing to stay at one company for so long. “It’d be unhealthy if you didn’t ever question ‘why stay?’,” says Nick. “But I’m dedicated to the people who have stood by me, and there are always opportunities to do better. And when you have a family to support there is value in stability.” Workers may choose to stay at one employer for decades because of an inbuilt drive to feel a sense of belonging, says Lee. “An employee may be less likely to change jobs if they feel they’re losing a part of themselves by leaving: our social identity often comes from groups; the workplace can be a strong source of that. And a main predictor of whether someone stays in a job or not is whether they feel they have good relationships with their leaders and co-workers.”  Today, the expectation is that no job is for life; workers increasingly feel compelled to change jobs to appear dynamic. However, even as expectations around employee tenure and the job-seeking mindset change, a subset of the workforce will still choose to spend decades at the same organisation. Some will lurk happily in solid roles that meet their lifestyle needs; others will soar up companies that offer development and progression.  “I’m in a leadership position now: how I do as a leader sets up other people for success,” says Nick. “There’s nothing more satisfying than working with a group of people and, together, producing something that’s bigger than all of you – something that has a positive impact.”"
market volatility,My savings suddenly disappeared,2024-09-15,2016-04-18,Kate Ashford,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160415-it-was-jaw-dropping,"An emergency or sudden market downturn depletes the savings you’ve worked so hard to build. Here's what to do when you go broke and run out of money. Jon Dulin and his wife were doing all the right things financially. They put money away for retirement and had a solid emergency fund. That is, until they noticed that there was staining on the outside of their house, around the windows and gutters. “We found out that it was actually a pretty big problem,” said Dulin, 37, who lives in Pennsylvania in the US. Due to poor construction, water was getting trapped in the walls of their house, rotting the wood. The repair cost: $50,000. “It was jaw dropping,” said Dulin, who writes at MoneySmartGuides.com. “This is basically wiping out our emergency fund.” Because of the unexpected dent in their savings, the couple will have to slow their retirement savings for the next few years while they rebuild their emergency money. “It’s frustrating.” An unexpected — and major — expense is just one way your savings could take a bad turn. A losing stock market turn could also wipe out years of savings. Just ask anyone who lost money when stocks plunged in 2008. In the US, workers lost an average of 24% from their 401(k) retirement accounts that year. And more than half of US parents with 529 college savings plans saw their balances go down in 2008, with almost a quarter reporting a decline of more than 30%. In the UK, the 2008 financial crisis led to an £815bn ($1.16tn) decrease in wealth overall — an average of almost £31,000 ($44,190) per household — because of a plunge in housing prices and a drop in the value of pension funds and investments. When your savings suddenly disappear, what you do next matters. “The bottom line is that you now have fewer resources than you expected,” said Mark LaSpisa, a financial planner with Vermillion Financial Advisors in Illinois in the US. “So you need to make some decisions.” Here are a few strategies for dealing with a big financial hit. What it will take: You’ll need patience, fortitude and the ability to look at the big picture. Losing a lot of money can be stressful and daunting, and you’ll have to make smart, but possibly different, decisions about saving and spending moving forward. How long you need to prepare: Most big financial losses come as a surprise, but there are things you can do to absorb the hit. A healthy emergency fund with three to six months of living expenses can give you breathing room while you weigh your options — or even cover an expense in the short term. If your investment portfolio has taken a dive, it’s important to take some time to consider your options rather than take money out in a reactionary way. One option is to borrow strategically. Sometimes it pays to use debt in the short-term while your savings recover, rather than withdrawing money from a decimated portfolio. “In 2009 one recently retired client chose to borrow money on her line of credit, rather than pull money from her IRA,” which had seen a loss, said David Demming, a financial planner with Demming Financial Services in Ohio in the US. “You want to have choices, which is why liquidity is so important. We use debt selectively, in lieu of assets, in certain environments.” When interest rates are near zero or very low, as they have been the last several years, this might make even more sense. Do it now: Assess the impact. “Now is the time to look objectively at all income streams and outgoings and see if savings in expenditures or increases in income from other sources could make up for some of the impact of the recent loss,” said Peter Brooke, a financial planner with the Spectrum IFA Group in Valbonne, France. “Are there things that could be sold or small jobs that could be undertaken to bring in a bit more money?” Work longer. If retirement is the thing in danger, you might have to rethink your retirement date. “I frequently counsel people that they should work a year or two or three years more, or once they go into retirement, take a part-time job,” said Larry Luxenberg, a financial planner with Lexington Avenue Capital Management in New York in the US. If you’re working at a job now making $100,000 a year, you might not think that working part time and making $20,000 in retirement is worth it. “But it could be the critical piece that lets you have a comfortable retirement,” Luxenberg said. Work more. Alternatively, a part-time job or some freelance or consulting work on the side could cover an unexpected expense or replenish your depleted savings faster. Spend less. Planning to buy a house with a down payment that was just obliterated? Consider renting or purchasing something more affordable. Ponder buying a used car rather than a new one, which depreciates the moment you drive it off the lot. Or take a road trip for your next vacation rather than flying, to save on airfares. “It’s really sitting down and investigating your options and figuring out what’s best for you,” LaSpisa said. “In most cases it’s some kind of logical compromise.” Don’t panic. Stock markets are cyclical. If your portfolio has plunged during a downturn and you don’t need the money immediately, don’t be too quick to cash in all your holdings. “If you’re invested in the stock market, your portfolio is going to go up and down,” Luxenberg said. “If you have a widely diversified portfolio, it’s highly likely to come back. Retirement plan investors in the US who maintained their stock allocation after the 2008 and 2009 downturn showed average account balance increases of 50% by mid-2011, according to one study. And according to another, continuous participants in retirement plans between December 2008 and December 2013 saw median account balance growth of 182%.   By the same token, if it’s your home value that’s plummeted, don’t worry unless you need to move. “If my home goes down in value, but I am not planning on either moving or extracting cash from it, has anything really changed other than the number on a given line of my balance sheet?” said David Mendels, a financial planner with Creative Financial Concepts in New York. “While all losses are painful, they are not all the same.” This one, for the most part, could just be in your head. Consult your financial professional. An objective third party can lend some perspective on where you are and whether your shortfall is going to wreck your financial picture. It may be that there are resources you haven’t considered and that a few small tweaks to your plan could put you on the right track. Do it later: Decrease risk appropriately. As you approach a big milestone — college, retirement — consider putting more of the money you need into lower-risk investments. That way, you aren’t as vulnerable to a market tank right before you need the cash. Do it smarter: Keep at it. “Honestly, the biggest mistake is giving up,” said Shannon Simmons, a financial planner with Simmons Financial Planning in Toronto. “A financial blow can be devastating and really hard on motivation. Many people who have suffered a large financial loss risk hitting the ‘screw-it’ point — the point where you stop trying.” This can lead to spiralling consumer debt, a stop to savings or an unhealthy fear of market volatility, none of which is helpful. “The most important thing to do is keep trying,” Simmons said. “Make a plan that is realistic. Don’t set yourself up for failure with lofty goals that are completely unrealistic. Take it a little bit at a time to rebuild. Don’t lose hope.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
market volatility,Why a desert city imports its sand,2024-09-15,2016-05-05,Renuka Rayasam,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160502-even-desert-city-dubai-imports-its-sand-this-is-why,"The global construction boom has created huge demand for sand – even in cities surrounded by the coarse commodity. Sand. We take it for granted. From deserts to beaches to children’s playgrounds, it seems ubiquitous. Yet the abundant resource is feeding a global land grab that’s even bred a sand-smuggling underworld. While researching beach erosion in Negril, Jamaica about six years ago, scientist Pascal Peduzzi’s conversation with residents in a fishing village left him astounded. Despite the high-tech geospatial modelling and remote sensing tools he was using to survey the damage, he’d never have surmised one reason for erosion on the country’s western coastline. Locals told him about the local mafias — armed men who came to the beach in the middle of night, hauled away bags of sand and sold them for the construction of beachfront developments. “I was shocked that people would fight for sand,” said Peduzzi, director of science at the United Nations Environment Programme’s Division of Early Warning and Assessment. “I have been working for more than 20 years in the environment sector, but sand came to me as a surprise.” As a building material, sand has withstood the test of time. In 3500BC, ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians were using sand, mostly formed when wind and water grind rocks into silica-rich grains, to make glass. Today, builders the world over use the natural resource, found in quarries, rivers, lakes and oceans, for many of their materials including paint and cement. With a global building boom and the arrival of hydraulic fracturing technology for oil and gas in the United States, the demand for sand has been skyrocketing. In 2014, 196 million tons of sand and its bigger counterpart gravel were mined around the world, according to the US Geological Survey. After water, it’s the most abundantly used natural resource, Peduzzi said. It’s used in everything from swimming-pool filters, metal castings and oil wells to smartphone screens and toothpaste. The overall sand and gravel market was valued at $8.3bn in the US last year and £1.7bn ($2.5bn) in the UK in 2013, according to the USGS and the UK’s Mineral Products Association. Global demand for sand is expected to rise 5.5% a year through 2018, according to a December 2014 report from the Freedonia Group. Investors willing to weather the volatility, sift through the fragmented market and take on potential environmental risks could stand to profit from the growing appetite for this global commodity. For years the sand market had been pretty “boring,” said Sonny Randhawa, a vice president in charge of research for the energy sector at D.A. Davidson, an Oregon based investment firm. But in the past few years the sand market has been more “feast or famine”, he said, particularly in the US. Uneven global demand Demand for sand is spread unevenly across the globe. Building booms in China and India have increased the need for sand in those markets. Globally, China accounts for a fifth of the world’s sand imports, according to the Trade Statistics Branch of the United Nations.  Because of the frenzied development of new dams, roads, buildings and factories the country has used more sand in the last four years than the US has in the last century, according to Peduzzi. China has even been piling huge amounts of sand onto reefs to create new islands and expand its foothold in the South China Sea. Even the United Arab Emirates imported $456m worth of sand, stone and gravel in 2014, according to the UN. Despite being in the heart of the desert, imported sand built Dubai, according to Pascal. Wind-formed desert sand is too smooth for construction. Meanwhile, in the UK, the need for sand has dropped off as new construction cools and recyclables get a political push. Demand for rock, gravel and sand is 25% below 2007 levels, according to the UK Mineral Products Association.  And in the US, the rise of hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” has created a huge appetite for sand. In 2013, the production of sand for fracking wells was 19 times higher than a decade earlier, according to the USGS. The process involves injecting water, sand and chemicals down a horizontally drilled well thousands of feet below the earth’s surface into a rock formation to extract oil or natural gas. While the market for industrial sand has tracked overall economic growth in the US, the demand for frac sand has been as volatile as oil prices. From 2011 to 2014 the demand for frac sand more than doubled from 24 million tons to 59 million tons, but then dropped off last year to 50 million tons, said Randhawa. But even as oil prices tail off, demand for sand is growing, largely due to the increased amount of sand going into wells in an attempt to extract more oil, according to Marc Bianchi, a managing director at Cowen and Company. As fracturing technology becomes better at extracting more oil per well, the amount of sand used per well has also doubled, from 2,000 tons a well in the second quarter of 2013 to 4,400 tons in the fourth quarter of 2015, he said.  How to invest It takes deep pockets and pioneering spirit to buy up a sand mine or offshore facility directly. Many countries regulate sand extraction, handing out a limited number of licenses to prevent overmining. And the technology to extract, process and transport sand will likely be far too expensive for individual investors.   Even investing in existing sand companies requires untangling complex layers across the value chain, from smaller mom-and-pop operations that may own a single mine, to large multinational players like Belgium-based Sibelco Group, a 144-year-old company that operates in 41 countries, or Germany’s Heidelberg Cement, which makes and sells cement in 40 countries and owns and operates sand facilities globally. For the most part, the highly fragmented market is regionally focused. On the European side, the European Association of Industrial Silica Producers maintains a comprehensive list of major players on the continent. In the US, 230 companies have 335 sand operations across 35 states, according to the USGS. Within the past few years, four US sand companies have started selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Randhawa has “buy” ratings on all them. Two of the companies — Emerge Energy Services and Hi Crush Partners — focus exclusively on the frac sand market, while Fairmount Minerals and U.S. Silica also have industrial sand operations. Because of their recent listings, Randhawa said that it’s tough to track returns, but with unpredictable oil prices, investors willing to take the risk should be prepared for volatility. Both Randhawa and Bianchi believe that U.S. Silica, which has been around since 1900, is best prepared to survive the roller coaster. They said the company’s long-standing customers provide the company a stable source of revenue even if demand for frac sand levels off. Plus, the company has been churning out new sand-related products such as adding antimicrobial coating to swimming pool-filter sand. Future concerns Finally, there are legal and environmental concerns to think about around the world. Beaches have eroded on average 40m from 1968 to 2008, according to Peduzzi. In some areas, such as South Carolina and California in the US, erosion from overmining and global warming has measured hundreds of metres. In other parts of the world, islands have disappeared altogether. “We do still have a huge amount of sand,” said Peduzzi. But “because we use it so much, sand is becoming rare. That’s not to say we should stop using sand, but we should be a bit more cautious.” This story was produced under the BBC's guidelines for financial journalism.

market volatility,The gold mine beneath London's streets,2024-09-15,2016-04-19,Pádraig Belton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160419-the-city-with-248-billion-beneath-its-pavement,"Under London’s streets lies a hidden gold mine. It stretches across more than 300,000 square feet under the City, the finance quarter in the heart of Britain’s capital. There, beneath the pavement and commuters of Threadneedle Street, lies a maze of eight Bank of England gold vaults – each stacked with gold bars worth a total sum of around £141 billion ($200 billion). The bars sit on rows of blue numbered shelves. Every bar weighs precisely 400 troy ounces (about 12kg), making each currently worth some £350,000 ($500,000), comfortably more than the average price of a house in the UK. Each bar looks subtly different depending on where it was refined. Some bars have sloping edges to make them easier to pick up; others look more like a loaf of bread. There is no smell here: metal has none. There is no noise, either, on account of the vaults’ thick concrete walls. What there is, however, is one of the world’s most important traded assets. Deals are still done in gold in almost every country in the world. Its price is a crucial barometer for consumer confidence. Prices rise when markets are uncertain, and before US elections – like now. “Gold is a hedge against uncertainty,” says Jonathan Spall, a long-time gold trader and now managing director of G Cubed Metal. These vaults lie right at the heart of this volatile, incredibly important market. About one-fifth of all the gold held by the world’s governments is in London. In total, 6,256 tonnes of gold are stored in vaults in and around London – collectively worth about £172 billion ($248 billion). The Bank of England vaults alone hold 5,134 tonnes, including the official reserves of the UK Treasury and the vast majority of the physical gold traded in London. Gold owned by 30 other countries is also in these vaults along with the hoards of about 25 banks. So much gold is kept in Britain’s capital partly to keep it near where the metal is traded. It’s also a reflection of the security of London’s vaults. Hiding your stash The Bank of England vaults were built in the 1930s. During World War II, when Britain’s bullion was secretly moved to Canada to continue the war effort if Britain was overrun, one vault was used as a staff canteen for Bank of England employees. Vintage advertisements for the P&O cruise line, enticing Bank employees away to holiday, are still plastered across the walls. Later, in the 1940s, the vault was used as a bomb shelter. But since 1945, the vaults have been used primarily for gold. Storing your assets in a huge safe might seem more fitting for a Tudor monarchy than a modern central bank. But the Bank of England still uses not only vaults, but several 3ft-long keys for access. Insiders believe that electronic access alone could be more prone to abuse. (You do still have to speak a password into a microphone and a computer matches your voice against a saved sample). The bars arrive in London by surprisingly traditional methods, too. Some come by sea, shipped from refineries like PAMP in Switzerland or Rand Refinery outside Johannesburg in South Africa. Gold is also moved on regular passenger aeroplanes. “In the cargo hold of commercial passenger planes, you often find gold, fresh flowers, and dead bodies,” says Ruth Crowell, chief executive of the London Bullion Market Association. But more difficult than finding transport can be finding a place to house it. Because much of the City of London is on clay ground and because gold is such a dense substance, you can only stack the bars so high before the vault starts sinking into the clay, Crowell says. (The weight of a City skyscraper is spread over a larger footprint, which makes that risk less likely). This is less of a problem in other cities. In Manhattan, which sits on bedrock, the Federal Reserve Bank can stack bars from floor to ceiling. As a result, there are restrictions on how much gold can be stacked in the Bank’s vaults. On the top level, the gold bars can only be stacked four pallets high. On the lower, they can only be stacked up to six. This means London needs to spread out its gold more to stop it sinking, and needs more vaults of smaller sizes. As a result, it isn’t just the City’s streets that are paved with gold. There are seven smaller vaults inside the M25 (the motorway that encircles Greater London) owned by banks like JP Morgan and HSBC, including three at transport companies around Heathrow Airport. Each owner attempts to keep their vault’s location secret. When CNBC journalists visited JP Morgan in 2011, for example, they had to surrender their mobile phones and travel in a car with blacked-out windows. Getting your gold fix It isn’t just vault locations that are kept under wraps. The gold market itself is secretive and steeped in tradition and ritual, particularly around the fixing system used for setting the price. The price setting meetings or “fixes” – in which there are now 12 direct participants hailing from the UK, US, Canada, China and France – take place twice a day. When a price matches supply and demand, the price is fixed. Until 2015, this was done verbally: a chairman would try different prices on the participants, each of whom would say if, at that price, they would be buyers or sellers. From 1919 until 2004 fixes were done in person in the City of London. Originally, if a participant wished to pause proceedings – to change between buying and selling, for example – he would raise a small UK flag. In 2004, the fixes were moved to a conference call. Only last year did the system change to a more modern electronic auction platform run by the Intercontinental Exchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. “If everyone knows there are two key points in the day to show up, you get the best liquidity balance between buying and selling,” says Matthew Glenville, chief operating officer of the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration. This ‘spot’ price is then used as a benchmark for people buying and selling gold around the world, a market where transactions total around £85 billion ($120 billion) a day. Portable assets During good times, gold is less in demand. But when the economy is tough, the metal is highly prized as a safe haven asset – not quite like storing cash under the mattress, but still a way to hedge against risk in other markets. As a result, gold increases in value when markets are volatile. Since the 1,000-point Dow Jones plunge of August 2015, the average price of the morning fix has increased each month, rising from £705 ($1,000) in December to £870 ($1,250) in March. When stock markets slump, governments and private investors ditch equities and buy gold – like Russia and China are doing now. Even so, only 32% of the world’s yellow metal is actually held by governments, banks and investors under lock and key. About 12% is used industrially, such as in electronics circuits. And more than half is used for jewellery. China and India are particularly significant markets for jewellery, together accounting for half of world demand. In India alone, an average of 30 to 40 grams of gold are purchased for each of the country’s 10 million weddings each year. “China and India, between the two of them, accounted for less than 10% of global demand in 2000,” says Ross Norman, chief executive of the bullion dealer Sharps Pixley. “Now it’s north of 90%.” With the current volatility of major currencies and stock markets, it’s little surprise that gold has returned to fashion. One sign? The opening of London’s first high street gold showroom in January. Sharps Pixley is located directly across from the private clubs White’s and Boodle’s in the heart of the upmarket St James’s neighbourhood. The building, which is owned by The Apprentice star Lord Sugar, has an exclusive and club-like interior with dark timber, brass and a large chandelier. If you want to get your hands on some bullion today, Sharps Pixley sells gold over the counter, in bars ranging from a kilogram (£28,058) down to one gram (£33.89). But with prices on the increase, you’d best bring your gold card. This story is a part of BBC Britain – a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

market volatility,Oil prices rise after Iran seizes tanker,2024-09-15,2024-01-11,By Sam Gruet & Katy Austin,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67946344,"Oil prices have risen after Iran seized a tanker off the coast of Oman, raising concerns fuel prices could increase. The oil tanker was heading for Turkey on Thursday when armed men ordered it to sail to an Iranian port. The price of Brent crude oil jumped by more than 2%, to $78.40 a barrel following the incident.  Meanwhile, the UK government has modelled scenarios suggesting the disruption in the Red Sea could further shrink the British economy. The BBC understands the Treasury has considered a rise of at least $10 (around £7.83) per barrel in the international price of crude oil and a 25% increase in the price of natural gas. Europe, in particular, is now more dependent on exports of gas coming through the Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz.  The seizure of the oil tanker by Iran, reported by local state media as retaliation for the hijacking last year of the same vessel by the US, raises prospects of growing conflict in the Middle East, which could have a knock-on effect on UK fuel prices. A rise in oil prices can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%. The average price of a litre fell below £1.40 on Thursday for the first time since October 2021, according to motoring group, the AA.  Diesel now averages 147.83p a litre across the country, down to a level last seen in early August. This time last year, petrol and diesel averaged 149.47p and 171.93p a litre respectively. ""Drivers should be ready for pump price volatility, perhaps even a shock, but current pump prices are a huge relief for consumers and inflationary pressures,"" the AA's Luke Jones added.  This most recent incident appears to be separate from attacks carried out by Houthi rebels from Yemen in the Red Sea, on the opposite side of the Arabian peninsula. But as Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics points out, the reaction in the oil market has been fairly muted to these attacks and the Israel-Hamas war. ""Initially, when the war broke out, there were fears that some of the major oil producers in the region - particularly Iran, but also Saudi Arabia - would become actively involved,"" she said. However, this no longer appears as likely and the risk of disruption to oil supply has been reduced. Demand for oil has dropped, following the slowdown in the EU and US economies and lack of growth in China, so there is less fear of supply shortfalls.  Conversely, there has been a ""surprisingly strong growth in US oil production in 2023 and in some other non-OPEC producers such as Brazil and Guyana,"" Ms Bain said, which has ""allayed fears of disruption to Middle East supply.""   ""If there were a further escalation in tensions in the Middle East/Red Sea, I think prices would rise more markedly,"" she added. "
market volatility,Will flying get more expensive?,2024-09-15,2020-05-29,John Walton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200528-will-the-price-of-flights-increase-due-to-coronavirus,"Covid-19 has caused unprecedented turmoil in the aviation industry. What does that mean for pricing when planes take to the skies again? As more countries start to ease their Covid-19 lockdowns, attention is returning to the global aviation industry, almost entirely grounded for months. Some passenger airlines have kept skeleton fleets flying for repatriation missions, some have converted passenger jets to use as cargo planes, but all of them would much rather return to their primary objective: flying people safely around the world. But when planes do take to the skies again, how much impact will the pandemic have on what they charge? “We know airlines want to get planes back in the air and bums back on seats,” says Benjamin Cany from Amadeus, a technology company that provides IT services to the travel industry, including one of its principal booking systems. In the short-term at least, that would point to lower fares aimed at incentivising consumers. Yet look past the next few months and there are factors that could push fares up, from airline bankruptcies that could reduce both supply and competition, to reduced fleets caused by retiring aircraft early. And the great unknown is how quickly passengers will return to flying, with the general feeling in the industry that aviation won’t return to pre-pandemic numbers until 2022, 2023 or beyond.   Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends. But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?” The pricing equation Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.” This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.” The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes. But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving. When will demand return? In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.  “Short-term, aircraft will continue to be much less full and airlines will be motivated to price seats to get customers flying safely in a Covid-19 world,” says Joe Leader, chief executive officer of APEX, a trade association whose members include airlines and their suppliers. “Airlines have cut back their flights to absolute connectivity minimums and are losing money on the vast majority of remaining flights… Hopefully, the combination of increased Covid-19 safety measures alongside low prices will encourage a travel rebound.” Paul Simmons, a senior airline executive with experience at numerous airlines worldwide including easyJet and Malaysia Airlines, suggests much will depend on what part low pricing can play as a tool to persuade people to travel. “It could be that airlines find their traditional lever of low pricing to drive bums on seats does not work as well as it used to. People may have higher concerns.” The general view is that domestic travel will recover first, a view with which Peter Foster, CEO of Kazakhstan’s national carrier Air Astana, agrees. “Initial indications from our recently-restarted limited domestic flights are that there is pent-up demand for these routes. We believe that business, worker and student travel will recover well before leisure travel.” IATA, an airline trade association, expects low demand when countries first start to travel again, despite some business travellers needing to fly and a desire for what’s known as VFR — visiting friends and relatives — traffic as people miss their families. On the plus side for airlines, IATA notes that the biggest variable cost in aviation, fuel, will be low: as drivers in many places are noticing, there’s oversupply in the petroleum industry keeping prices down. Will supply fall?  If there are major unknowns on the demand side, there are also evolving factors influencing pricing on the supply side. One of the starkest images for the airline industry has been the sight of line after line of jets parked on runways and put into storage at aircraft recycling ‘boneyards’. While older and less efficient planes will be retired, some of them years ahead of schedule, airline executive Paul Simmons points out that most of the planes taken out of fleets have been stored, not scrapped. “This is an important distinction,” he says. Joe Leader from airline association APEX suggests that “there will be more than enough supply even with all of the early aircraft retirements”. Certainly to start off with, demand will be low enough to be met by the aircraft that haven’t been retired. Airbus and Boeing have both announced cuts to the numbers of new aircraft they’re building every month, but as demand rises again, the aircraft manufacturers can increase production, airlines can extend the life of aircraft they’re using, or older aircraft can be brought back into use from storage. It’s already clear that the airline landscape, and indeed the names painted on the side of the aircraft, are likely to be forever changed. Some airlines have already filed for various forms of bankruptcy protection or indeed have simply gone under. This will, in many cases, lead to less competition – and the possibility of monopoly pricing, which tends not to favour consumers. Yet it’s likely that regulators will come down hard on airlines seen to profiteer, while other carriers will seek to jump into monopoly markets where that is possible, or new entrants will arise. For passengers, that’s likely to mean a fair amount of volatility in fares. “Although some airlines will inevitably go out of business, others will scale up to fill the void,” comments Simmons. “The ‘rightsizing’ of supply and demand may take time, however, leading to higher pricing in the medium term.” No easy answers The watchword for aviation, as for so many industries looking to rebound from Covid-19, is going to be uncertainty. New waves of infection, or treatment breakthroughs, would both influence the future path. So too will political and regulatory responses, as well as the wider global economic fallout that is being forecast. Demand, crucially, is not rising evenly; different government restrictions ­– especially quarantine periods on arrival for travellers from some nations – will have effects that are very complex to model, and will necessarily differ between nations or even within regions of the same nation. The US is an example of how perceptions and thus demand can vary across a nation. Scott DeAngelo, chief marketing officer of niche leisure carrier Allegiant Air, said on an earnings call that customer surveys revealed that “in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic, the Upper West, I got to tell you they don’t share the opinion that the evening news is putting out there” around travel. Pictures over the US Memorial Day holiday weekend have shown leisure destinations in some parts of the country packed with partygoers. It seems likely that travel resumption “bubbles” between neighbouring countries and regions with acceptably low infection rates (where “acceptably” will also vary) will continue, and while these may stimulate demand travellers will also not want to be caught overseas if restrictions return swiftly. The question of whether any travel insurance would cover Covid-19-related issues is also crucial. Airlines also need to start flying for people to start buying tickets even in a reduced demand scenario, and we are only just starting to see a very limited number of airlines resuming very limited schedules. That all makes predicting the effects of the interlocking factors upon which airline pricing is based challenging. The demand side of the curve is particularly tricky for long-haul pricing, says Air Astana CEO Peter Foster, who nevertheless expects that the stronger long-haul airlines are likely to try to kickstart demand with lower fares. Short-haul carriers, meanwhile, may benefit from low oil prices, reduced aircraft prices that enable counter-cyclical orders and lower salaries due to surplus aviation workers. “The prognosis may well be lower airfares on short/medium haul routes for at least 18 months to two years,” Foster expects. And while Covid-19 is unprecedented, he believes the past can offer indicators for future trends. “After every major crisis of the last 20 years – the Asian financial crisis of 1998, 9/11, the global financial crisis – low-cost airlines have emerged faster and stronger because suppressed demand combined with depressed consumer spending power has driven people to them,” he says. “I doubt 2020/21 will be any different.” Aviation journalist John Walton writes about airlines, aircraft and everything aeronautical.

market volatility,Gas supplier announces price rise,2024-09-15,2024-01-17,By Olivia Copeland,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-68006681,"The gas supplier for Jersey and Guernsey has announced prices will rise from 31 January. Islands Energy Group (IEG) said gas tariffs would increase by 8% in Guernsey and by 12% in Jersey. The changes mean the average household in Guernsey will pay £8.30 more every month, with households in Jersey paying £13.80 more. IEG's CEO Jo Cox said the company was ""fully aware of the challenges households are facing"". The firm plans to review the rises in six months. Ms Cox said the ""difficult decision"" was due to changes to costs of importing gas, high interest rates and a ""continued volatility"" in the market. She said: ""We're confident that our prices truly reflect the cost of gas we supply to our customers. ""We are working closely with both the Government of Jersey and the States of Guernsey to ensure they are fully up to date on the situation and that they are able to offer support where they can."" IEG's tariffs had been kept the same for more than a year. Ms Cox said the firm offered a Priority Customer Care scheme that offers support to vulnerable customers as well as reviews for customers to see where they can save energy and advice on using smart technology to manage consumption. She said: ""If any customers are struggling with their bills, we would urge them to get in touch with us."" Follow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

market volatility,Asia markets drop sharply after US falls,2024-09-15,2018-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42998819,"Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street. In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.3%, while China's Shanghai Composite slumped by 4.1%.  Earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week. Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.8% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.9%. Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors.  On Thursday, the Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%. European exchanges also headed south on Thursday.  China was the worst performer in Asia on Friday as losses deepened from declines seen earlier this week.  Chinese stock markets tend to be volatile and are dominated by retail investors, rather than big institutions like many other major markets.  But falls in China can spark nervousness around the world over sentiment in the world's second largest economy.  As well as the broader sell-off, analysts said stocks in China were weighed down by people selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is a common trend as the need for cash grows during this period - a time when Chinese companies typically pay bonuses and people also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted the pull-back from stocks.  On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates are on the up. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was a government budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. And more turbulence could be on the way.  ""The return of volatility after two relatively calm days supports the idea there are further losses to come in the days and weeks ahead,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy.  The chaotic week on global markets also comes as several markets around the world sit on, or near record highs.  Analysts have said for months that financial markets were due a correction, after a long period of rising prices. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Fidelity International's chief investment officer for Japan, Takashi Maruyama, said the ""massive volatility"" was a reaction to the rapid rise on the Japanese market since last year.  He added the sell-off presented a opportunity to buy shares at more ""reasonable"" prices. "
market volatility,Manx Gas rebrand 'reflects future diversification',2024-09-15,2022-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-62797887,"A rebranding of Manx Gas reflects the future diversification of the firm's services, the company's managing director has said. Aidan Baglow said the name change to Isle of Man Energy reflected a change in direction to include alternatives to natural gas. He said it also showed support for the island's move to net-zero emissions. It follows a 43.9% price hike for customers due to global volatility in the wholesale gas market. Mr Baglow said the current energy crisis meant customers were seeking ""ways to use energy more efficiently"", leading to the company ""investing locally to provide additional products"". ""In the longer term, this means we will be diversifying our services and looking at alternatives to natural gas, such as biogas and green hydrogen,"" he added. The cost of the rebrand has not been confirmed but the company has invested in a new billing system and a new website, which will soon allow customers to see how much gas they are using. Acknowledging the rebrand comes at a difficult time for gas customers on the Isle of Man, CEO of parent company Islands Energy Group Jo Cox said the firm wanted to support ""energy transition"" or moves towards greener energy. Although change ""won't be quick or easy"", the company needed to ""evolve how we're doing things and what we offer"", she said. ""Some may question the need to transform our business now, but it is actually because of the crisis that business transformation is so critical,"" she added.

market volatility,Bitcoin sets fresh records after Musk investment,2024-09-15,2021-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55984393,"Bitcoin has hit record highs for a second day after Elon Musk's car company Tesla said it had bought about $1.5bn (£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin rose above $48,000 (£34,820) before falling back, but it remains about 25% higher than a week ago. Some investors took Tesla's move as a signal that Bitcoin would become a mainstream financial asset. However, there was some criticism about a green car firm investing in such an energy intensive currency. Bitcoin currently uses more energy than Argentina every year, according to analysis from the University of Cambridge. Production of the cryptocurrency, known as ""Bitcoin mining"", needs energy-hungry computer hardware and ever-greater amounts of processing power. Mike Butcher, an editor at news website Techcrunch, tweeted: ""Tesla: Sells carbon credits to buy Bitcoin, which requires as much energy (not always Green energy) as a small country to mine."" Bitcoin is a form of digital money. This means it doesn't have a physical form. Instead, units of digital currency are traded over a computer network. It operates over a global network with thousands upon thousands of nodes - a machine within a network like a computer or some other device - which together process and store transactions. Explaining its investment on Monday, Tesla said that it wanted to maximise returns on cash lying dormant in the company's accounts. It also expects to accept payment for its electric cars in Bitcoin in future.  The moves sparked market interest which carried on into Tuesday. Shares of companies that provide trading platforms for Bitcoin and the technology to mine the cryptocurrency have surged in China, South Korea and Australia, and big computer chip-making firms such as SK Hynix also rose. The cryptocurrency has already risen in value by 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally in 2020, as investors search for alternative assets at a time when interest rates in many countries are at record lows. Bitcoin has had some interest from big investment firms, including Blackrock, which recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency. However, central banks remain sceptical about the cryptocurrency. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method, saying it lacked ""intrinsic value"" unlike cash or gold.  Some institutional investors are also wary of the price volatility of Bitcoin. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said: ""The average institutional investor is shaking their head. ""For these folks who are believers in cryptocurrency, [Tesla's investment] gives them another layer of support that crypto is the future."" But Bitcoin scepticism does not mean that central banks and regulators are against digital currencies per se. In China in particular regulators are starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use."
market volatility,How climate change will transform work,2024-09-15,2017-07-10,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170705-how-climate-change-could-transform-the-work-force,"Our planet is already feeling the effects of climate change, but it’s also poised to cause irreversible shifts in the ways we work, and the skills that employers need. When we think of climate change, most of us think of environmental consequences like rising sea levels, elevated temperatures and melting glaciers. In some parts of the world, like south Florida or the mountains of Switzerland, those shifts already are affecting daily life. In Miami, for example, wastewater treatment plants are being re-built higher, seawalls raised and car parks designed with flood gates – not only in response to flooding today, but with an eye to the sea levels of tomorrow. But experts say that those effects may only be the tip of the (melting) iceberg. Climate change is shaking up everything from finance to health. As a result, it isn’t only urban planners in at-risk areas who will have to shift their framework for planning for the future. From financial planners to farmers, civil engineers to doctors, an increasingly wide range of other professionals are likely to find their industries affected. That means there may be another consequence of climate change that often gets overlooked: what it means for your career. “Everyone is going to need to understand [climate change] the same way you’d assume everyone in business needs to have some fluency in social media today, or that everyone would able to use a computer 20 years ago,” says Andrew Winston, author of the book The Big Pivot: Radically Practical Strategies for a Hotter, Scarcer, and More Open World. Because it is difficult to know exactly how dramatic the effects of climate change will be, it is hard to know just how much it will affect various industries. But some of the changes already are being seen. Climate-related disasters like droughts and hurricanes, for example, are hitting pocketbooks and insurance premiums – even for people living on the other side of the world. Meanwhile, the complicated supply chains of a globalised retail industry mean that a disruption in one place can cause consequences elsewhere. That was shown recently when earthquakes hit Japan in April 2016, damaging plants that sold parts to Toyota and forcing the auto giant to suspend production. Even the health industry may be affected. As well as affecting the availability of clean water and food, warmer weather is increasing the vulnerability of areas already at risk of diseases like malaria and dengue. The recent Zika epidemic may have been exacerbated by warmer weather patterns. Between 2030 and 2050, the World Health Organisation predicts that climate change will cause roughly 250,000 additional deaths per year. “One of the most interesting things that hasn’t been talked a lot about, but that there’s a lot of work on in WHO and NIH, is what’s coming at us in terms of disease, and how the weather is changing and spreading diseases and epidemics faster,” says Michelle DePass, dean of the Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at the New School in New York. “We might listen to the BBC to hear all about Ebola and other things, and not quite grasp that we are very, very vulnerable to [these kinds of epidemics] here in the United States, as well, because of what’s happening with climate.” In fact, this year, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report, which draws on assessments from 750 experts, found that one of the five biggest risks faced by the world in 2017, in terms of potential impact, is weapons of mass destruction. All of the four others are climate-related: extreme weather events, water crises, major natural disasters, and failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation. Despite the size of the challenge, fewer employees are trained in incorporating climate patterns in their planning for the future than should be, says Daniel Kreeger, executive director of the nonprofit Association of Climate Change Officers. (One of ACCO’s initiatives is to run training and credentialing programmes in climate-related skills). “We don’t have the right people with the right skills in the right places,” he says. He points to one example: civil engineering. “We don’t expect to get monster inundations of rain, and then drought for six months. We expect to get periodic, smaller amounts of rain. So our systems aren’t equipped to deal with larger rainfalls,” Kreeger says. “When those parameters change, you need a workforce to deal with those changes. “Well, our civil engineers haven’t been trained to deal with climate change in their training. Our urban planners, our city managers, our architects. Nobody’s been taught this stuff.” Hiring climate  Right now, the top 10 most-desired skills for getting hired, according to LinkedIn’s data analysis, all have to do with tech: think cloud computing, SEO marketing and web architecture. In the same way tech has transformed today’s workforce, some say that climate change could transform tomorrow’s.   One industry that already shows some of that evolution is energy. According to data provided by job listings search engine Indeed, in the first quarter of 2014 in the UK, job postings in the renewable energy sector – made up of bioenergy, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, and wind – accounted for a third (32.9%) of all energy-sector job postings in the first quarter of 2014. In 2017, that had risen to over half of all energy sector job postings, or 51.5%. Although these numbers are UK-specific, the same pattern of a shift to renewables was seen worldwide, says Tara Sinclair, Indeed’s senior fellow and an economist at George Washington University. Those changes have been the result of a variety of factors, including the fall in oil prices and competitiveness of natural gas: over the same three years, job postings for oil and coal in the UK fell from two-thirds (66.5%) of the energy sector to under half (47.7%). But it’s also a result of how both employers and job-seekers are becoming interested in mitigating emissions and climate change, says Sinclair. After oil prices declined several years ago, she says, jobs in the oil industry dropped off, as did job-seekers’ interest in them. “Part of it is there are fewer opportunities, and people respond to that they know what the landscape of the labour market is, broadly,” she says. “But also there does seem to be this increasing attractiveness of green economy jobs.” In the same way that many people from the oil and gas industry have been able to transition into green energy, says Sinclair, many employees already should have skills which are transferable to climate change-specific issues. Take production and supply chains. “Generally, planning production differently around potentially volatile weather phenomena, etc, is going to be a piece of the skill set you’d be required to have”, Sinclair says. “But I don’t see that that’s so much different than planning around other sorts of destructive phenomena, whether they be political or anything else. I don’t think that as new skill we haven’t seen before.” Money talks It remains to be seen how much climate change will affect the expected skill sets for employees in industries less immediately affected by climate change than, say, civil engineering or catastrophe bonds. But even companies in industries that would appear to be less directly affected by climate change are tuning into the issue. Winston, who consults with a variety of businesses to help them get ahead of global trends – one of which is climate change – points to Unilever. The mega-corporation, which makes everything from Dove soap to Magnum ice cream, has pledged serious action on a variety of sustainability initiatives – including sourcing 100% of its energy for production from renewable sources by 2030 (it already cut its carbon emissions by 43% from 2008 to 2016). Other companies are working on similarly ambitious initiatives: Coca-Cola, Ikea and Walmart also have committed to 100% renewable energy. If it seems odd that companies seem to be talking the kind of talk heard more at NGOs, it shouldn’t. For one, it appeals to consumers. Recent research by Cone Communications, a PR agency for consumer brands, found that 87% of Americans said they would purchase a product because of a company’s alignment on an issue they cared about. It also attracts would-be workers: nearly two-thirds of millennials – the generation that will make up half of all US employees by 2020 – said they take a company’s social and environmental commitments into account when weighing a job offer. But it isn’t just about brand appeal. As Unilever outlines on its site, cutting waste and energy use, for example, means cutting both costs and exposure to price volatility. (The company says it already has shaved €700 million in costs since 2008 in this area alone). Corporate interest in climate change mitigation is also, of course, out of concern for global economic health. One 2016 study found that simply the effect of rising temperatures on workers’ productivity, particularly in already-warm climates like Asia and Africa, could cost the global economy more than $2 trillion by 2030. “The change in discussions in corporate boardrooms, and companies in general, on climate has been pretty profound,” says Winston. “There isn’t a large company in the world that isn’t talking about sustainability or climate. It’s just not possible to operate your business without talking about this.” Those factors may help explain why executives of companies from Goldman Sachs to Facebook expressed anger at President Trump’s announcement to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. Some US CEOs, including Walt Disney’s Bob Iger and Tesla’s Elon Musk, resigned from the president’s advisory board in protest. Another signifier of how much corporations are not only taking climate change seriously, but also valuing climate-related skills, is in the salaries they’re paying people with that kind of expertise. In 2016, a survey of employees working in the corporate responsibility and sustainability sector, most of whom were in North America or Europe, found that the average salary was £61,000 ($87,000 in 2016 values); 12% of respondents earned £100,000 ($143,000) or more. Even in the UK, where the average salary was under that at £57,000, the average corporate responsibility professional pulled in twice the amount of the average full-time UK employee – who in 2016 made £28,000. Still, 63% of the same professionals in the study had a master’s or doctorate. “Frankly, they are underpaid relative to the expertise and value that they offer,” writes director of SystemiQ Jeremy Oppenheim in the study. One explanation, he says, is that “not enough companies still fully appreciate the economic value which the sustainability team brings to their business.” Similarly, says Winston, in their search for potential employees, most human resources departments, particularly in the US, seem to be behind in terms of how much they are weighing potential employees’ climate change competencies. “It’s lagging given the scale of the challenge. That’s because, for so many years, people thought it was political. You wouldn’t get in trouble saying ‘Hey, everyone should be trained in social media’, but you could if you were saying, ‘Hey, everyone should be trained in climate change,” he says. “But,” Winston adds, “that’s changing.” And that shift is already happening, he says – with or without US participation in the Paris Agreement.  -- Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.

market volatility,The one-company workers who never leave,2024-09-15,2022-10-10,Alex Christian,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221005-the-one-company-workers-who-never-leave,"Expected tenure in a role has shrunk at an alarming pace amid the Great Resignation. But some workers are reaping the rewards of spending decades in the same job. As the labour market has favoured workers throughout the past two years, many employees have taken advantage of the changing employment landscape, becoming job-hoppers and industry-switchers. While job opportunities thrive, this reshuffling has upended the idea of the ‘company man’, making it seem outdated at best.  Yet although this swath of highly-mobile workers has stolen much of the conversation around employment in the pandemic-era, plenty of other workers have still chosen to stay in one place. Moving roles may be tempting, but factors such as strong organisational culture, clear career pathways and job security have more allure for some employees. And they’re happy with their choice to stay put at the same place they’ve worked for years and years.  According to workers and experts, there are two main reasons employees remain with companies for life. First, some large companies are set up to develop, promote and retain workers in ways others are not, which means ambitious employees can reach the pinnacle of their careers without ever changing jobs. In other cases, employees may prioritise financial comfort and stability, see their career as a means to an end, and occupy their niche until retirement.  Climbing the ranks  The need to advance in life and achieve is innate, says Allan Lee, a senior lecturer in organisation studies and management at University of Exeter Business School, UK. A single company can fulfil this desire, and meet the needs of ambitious workers, by providing a well-defined career pathway and a sense of progression. “Feeling that you’re building towards a goal is a strong motivator in staying in a job,” says Lee. New York-based architect Nick began at his firm in an entry-level position 30 years ago, then quickly ascended the ranks. Each promotion gave him the opportunity to work on bigger and more prestigious projects, designing developments in some of the most coveted neighbourhoods in the US. “I was motivated by being in a company where I was encouraged to grow: one where I thought my contribution was valued,” he explains. As Nick accumulated more experience, he took on more senior roles, leading colleagues on global multimillion-dollar projects, from Manhattan to Shanghai. “I was lucky I could build a team of people motivated to work together and investigate architecture,” he says. “It meant it was more than just doing a job: there was a culture that allowed everyone to deliver meaningful work.” Nick is now at the pinnacle of his career: an executive and design leader for his firm. Through decades of experience, he’s been able to command a wealth of knowledge, inspire the direction of his company and be part of its history. “When I joined the firm, it was 35 people in one office – now it’s 1,100 employees, in 24 studios around the world,” he explains. “I think longevity builds respect and trust, and a chance to build something bigger than yourself.” Comfort and security  Not every worker who remains at their employer for decades will necessarily steadily climb the top of the career ladder like Nick. Some employees may be content in a stable, mid-level ranking until retirement.  “They may value mastering a position and obtaining the role of an expert,” says Johnny C Taylor Jr, the president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management (Shrm), based in Washington, DC. “This then allows them to enjoy stability, routine and a greater work-life balance, versus higher-level management and executive positions.”  Moves also come with risk: career stability and comfort can persuade employees to remain at an organisation. Further, financial practicalities can mean an organisation offering steady pay rises and pension plans is more able to lock in workers for the long haul. “Uncertainty can be a source of stress,” says Lee. “People want security. And although staying at one company for life may no longer be the expectation, someone knowing they have a job for the foreseeable future can be a strong motivator to remain.”  Lifetime employment is typically more common in long-established multinational corporations, where good pension provision, transparent pay structures and varied departments mean workers may have less incentive to search the job market for a fulfilling career elsewhere. “If the job offers what people have always sought from work – a way to make a decent living as well as find dignity and fulfilment – then employee loyalty is much easier to come by,” says Rick Wartzman, of management thinktank the Drucker Institute, and author of The End of Loyalty, based in Los Angeles.  Public-sector roles can also offer employees greater long-term stability. “Private sector businesses are more impacted by market volatility and generally can be subject to employment at will,” says Taylor, “whereas the public sector is more likely to offer pension plans and job security.” One such worker is Anthony. He joined the Civil Service in the 1970s as an 18-year-old, working in a government department assessing the tax valuations of properties in suburban London. He remained in the same department until 2017, reaching management level and retiring early on a pension reflecting his final salary. “I wasn’t someone [who was] that career-driven,” he says. “It was my first job after finishing school, I just wanted something that would offer a good salary and long-term stability: it was all I needed.”  ‘Why stay?’  Ambition isn't universal. If an organisation can keep a worker busy, relatively happy, engaged and decently remunerated, some people will stay. Although Anthony says he ultimately saw work as a means to an end, he was quietly content being able to lead a team, form workplace friendships and confidently carry out technical, time-consuming work. “I never really considered leaving: it was a job I enjoyed and it gave me financial security.”  Relationships and loyalty are also crucial factors in an employee choosing to stay at one company for so long. “It’d be unhealthy if you didn’t ever question ‘why stay?’,” says Nick. “But I’m dedicated to the people who have stood by me, and there are always opportunities to do better. And when you have a family to support there is value in stability.” Workers may choose to stay at one employer for decades because of an inbuilt drive to feel a sense of belonging, says Lee. “An employee may be less likely to change jobs if they feel they’re losing a part of themselves by leaving: our social identity often comes from groups; the workplace can be a strong source of that. And a main predictor of whether someone stays in a job or not is whether they feel they have good relationships with their leaders and co-workers.”  Today, the expectation is that no job is for life; workers increasingly feel compelled to change jobs to appear dynamic. However, even as expectations around employee tenure and the job-seeking mindset change, a subset of the workforce will still choose to spend decades at the same organisation. Some will lurk happily in solid roles that meet their lifestyle needs; others will soar up companies that offer development and progression.  “I’m in a leadership position now: how I do as a leader sets up other people for success,” says Nick. “There’s nothing more satisfying than working with a group of people and, together, producing something that’s bigger than all of you – something that has a positive impact.”"
market volatility,Should you invest in Bitcoins?,2024-09-15,2013-07-03,Constance Gustke,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130702-should-you-invest-in-bitcoins,"Bitcoin has leapt onto the global stage with a bang — and a crash. The digital money has already plunged from a high of $260 in April to today’s value of about $92 Still, Bitcoins, used to purchase goods online or transfer money to other people, have steadily gained traction since they were invented in Japan in 2009. Germany has Bitcoin marketplaces where holders can exchange the currency. Designed to be a global currency, Bitcoin is also gaining popularity in countries like Argentina and Kenya, amid worries about local currency devaluation. Merchants, such as online dating site OkCupid, are slowly starting to accept the digital money for goods and services. On Monday, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known for their legal dispute with Facebook Inc’s Mark Zuckerberg over the origin of the social networking site, unveiled plans to offer shares of a Bitcoin trust — designed to operate like an exchange-traded fund — to the public. According to an initial public offering filing in the United States, the shares would allow investors to “gain exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk.” Despite the hoopla, Bitcoin is still a niche digital currency. It faces numerous challenges on the road to wide-spread acceptance, including volatile price spikes and daily volume surges that point to rampant speculation. Also hindering growth: even sophisticated financial thinkers have trouble understanding how it works. So far, global adoption is still tiny. Less than 1% of the world’s population uses Bitcoin actively, according to estimates, though use is accelerating in the US and parts of Europe. The next 24 months will be crucial to whether the currency will survive and grow, say some experts. Though venture capitalists and technology start-ups are rushing to solve concerns around Bitcoin, any significant expansion is still uncertain given recent market fluctuations. Long-term investors may walk away if volatility continues. Much more likely, Bitcoin may become one digital currency among many others coming to market. “Even if Bitcoin doesn’t survive, cypto-currencies will,” said California-based Andreas Antonopoulos, who advises organisations on emerging technologies and trends.    Origins Bitcoin is a form of electronic money that is not controlled by a person or institution. New units are mined by programs that crack complex mathematical problems and release new blocks of coins, though release is limited to only 21 million virtual coins. Only 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes can be created to control inflation. There are currently about 11.3 million in circulation. The limited supply makes them like digital gold, said Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Bitcoin Education Project. To buy Bitcoin, most people go to Japan-based Mt.Gox, which accepts 17 currencies. Fees are less than .60%.    Ease of use depends on where you live. Adoption is ramping up with small merchants in the US, Canada and parts of Europe, say experts. New trading platforms like Russia-based Bitc-e.com, which also accepts other alternative currencies like Webcreds.com, are even popping up. France recently launched its Bitcoin Central exchange, too. “Europe is a bit ahead of the US,” said Jonathan Waller, who runs a Bitcoin meet-up in Tokyo. Uphill climb Despite this frenzied activity, Bitcoin faces an uphill climb. Its greatest strength — sitting outside the global financial system — is also a weakness. Few retailers accept the currency, though more, like the San Francisco-based social news site Reddit and even US-based blogging platform Wordpress, are accepting it. Rigorous control of new Bitcoin makes expanding usage beyond a cult currency difficult. The biggest challenge might be volatility. As little as $3 million injected into Mt.Gox can spike prices, say experts. In April, Bitcoin plummeted $130 in a day, from a high of $260.  This volatility is catnip for speculators, who seek to profit from sudden price fluctuations. Bitcoin’s main problem is that value is based on whatever the next guy will pay, said Brian Riley, a senior research analyst at the Boston-based research and advisory firm CEB TowerGroup.  “This makes them a speculative currency,” he said. “Speculators are making a mess of Bitcoin,” said Antonopoulos. When traders jump in and out of the currency, it adds to volume spikes. There are currently 182 global currencies, said Riley. “Why do we need another one?” he said. Bitcoins are so volatile that owners must either spend them immediately, before they lose value, or hold them as investments. Turning cash into Bitcoins can take days. Many people rely on cumbersome in-person Bitcoin exchanges facilitated by Bitcoin web sites such as localBitcoins.com, where people meet and exchange currency. For these reasons, investors and consumers should not put more than 5% of their money into the currency, added Waller.  “Bitcoins are one big monetary experiment,” said Hoskinson. Easing concerns There is a chance that these Bitcoin choke points will be solved by an influx of new technology. In the US, a flurry of well-known venture capitalists such as New York City tech wizard Fred Wilson, an early investor in Tumblr and Foursquare, are spearheading Bitcoin startups. The aim: developing better e-wallets, payment systems and even automatic teller machines (ATMs), where you can exchange cash for Bitcoin. Dozens of startups in California’s Silicon Valley are also attacking Bitcoin distribution problems, said Antonopoulos. “Lots of venture capitalists are pouring money into Bitcoin without understanding them,” he added.   History is rife with examples of early movers — Myspace is one — that ended up in technology graveyards due to stronger competitors, though. And currently, at least one dozen virtual currencies like litecoin and ripple are vying for a piece of the digital currency market. These new currencies aren’t tough competitors, said Waller, though there’s still a real risk that Bitcoin won’t survive this onslaught."
market volatility,Investing in natural gas,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Bryan Borzykowski,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130829-investing-in-natural-gas,"British Columbia is best known for its beautiful mountain views and world-class skiing, but by 2015 it could be famous for something else: natural gas transportation. That may not sound as exciting as a night out in Whistler, but if the Canadian province can successfully build North America’s first major liquefied natural gas terminal, it could dramatically alter the energy industry. With many people’s money tied up in energy stocks, it could boost the average investor’s returns too. Here’s why: for one, it’s impossible to get natural gas off North American shores. Liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals, though, like the one proposed in Kitimat, British Columbia, will turn gas into a liquid state. It can then be put on tankers and shipped to Asian and European destinations, where demand for a cleaner, more efficient fuel is soaring. Several other LNG terminals along the continent’s east and west coasts will also be built in the coming years. While other LNG terminals in places like Malaysia, Qatar, Yemen, Australia and Norway already send gas to Europe and Asia, it is cheap, abundant North American gas, that many utilities and gas companies are waiting to get their hands on. Demand for the commodity is highest in Asia. One reason why people are excited about North American gas is that many gas-using companies want to buy from a locale that doesn’t face political risks, said Maartin Bloemen, a Toronto-based portfolio manager with Templeton Global Equity Group. European companies import a lot of gas from Russia, while Japanese and Chinese businesses buy from the Middle East. Currently, natural gas sells for about $3.50 per 1,000 cubic feet in North America; it goes for $9 in Europe, and about $16 in the growing Asian market. Many investment experts think that once China, Japan and other markets get a hold of North America’s abundant supply of gas, the price gap between North American and Asian gas could close, said Ted Davis, portfolio manager at Denver-based Fidelity Investments. A more global market could give people’s investment portfolios a boost, said Andrea Williams, a London-based portfolio manager with Royal London Asset Management. Since 2008, investors around the world have suffered from falling North American natural gas prices. The price of gas plummeted by about 85% over the last five years and that has impacted the earnings and stock prices of the many energy operations exposed to the region. If North American gas prices rise, so too should the fortunes of the continent’s companies, said Davis. Conversely, if gas prices fall overseas — it’s likely they’ll drop somewhat after North American supply hits Asian shores, said Williams — the Russian, Middle Eastern and Australian companies that supply Europe and Asia now could be in trouble, she said. Getting excited While the first North American gas plants are still a couple of years away from being built, investors are already getting excited about North American investment opportunities, said Davis. According to the US Energy Information Administration, North America produces the most natural gas out of any region in the world. With such rich resources, many companies will be able to grow production for decades, said Davis. Right now, all that production is a problem — there’s not enough domestic demand to reduce supply — but investors are anticipating that once gas goes offshore, that imbalance will be fixed. Historically, European and emerging market producers traded at a premium to North American companies, but that’s starting to change. For example, Russian energy companies have traded at an average 24% premium over the past decade, but now trade at a 70% discount, said Davis. Major European energy companies have traded at a 26% premium over the last 10 years, but now trade at a 27% discount. Despite the rising valuations, Davis still thinks that North America companies are the better bets in this changing energy environment. Best bets? The best bets are the mega-cap energy players, such as Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil, said both Williams and Bloemen. Many already have a stake in LNG terminals being built in North America. They are also buying stakes in terminals in Australia, which will help get gas off that continent, too.  In addition, these heavyweight companies have a leg up on signing long-term contracts with utility companies. “You want someone who already has projects on the go,” Bloemen said. “Newer projects are way behind the eight ball and you want to own a company that can scale up easily.” Williams is partial to integrated producers — companies that sell gas, but also produce and refine oil as well. These operations are more diversified and should therefore be better able to withstand short-term volatility in the sector than a pure gas producer, she said. While Davis is keen on the bigger players too, he also suggests looking at small North American exploration and production companies, such as EOG Resources and Apache Corp, which have been much more successful at finding resources than their European and Asian peers. These operations aren’t necessarily involved in transporting gas overseas, but they are assisting other nations, such as China, Latin America and the U.K., tap into their own gas fields. “These are the companies that took the risk and unlocked these resources over time,” said Davis. “Their technology will be applied elsewhere in the world.” Energy experts say there’s no question that global demand for natural gas is increasing and that the industry will forever change once natural gas gets shipped from North America to Asia. While it’s likely big global companies that will benefit first, nearly all investors with exposure to the energy sector should see some bump in their portfolio starting in 2015, said Williams. “We’re happy to invest in this sector,” she said. “As emerging markets become more westernised, the need for gas will just go up.” Follow us on Twitter @BBC_Capital Follow BBC Capital on Facebook"
market volatility,"Floods, drought, pollution, oh my",2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Andrea Murad,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130917-floods-drought-pollution-oh-my,"When it rains in Pakistan, investors who hold shares of Sweden’s apparel chain H&M might need umbrellas — no matter where they are. In 2011, the resulting floods coupled with drought in China destroyed cotton crops and caused prices to rise to record levels. The apparel maker posted a 30% drop in net profits, and investors took a hit. Emerging market funds and the stocks of multinationals forging ahead in those markets have been among the hottest investments in the past decade. But as H&M’s experience shows, doing business in emerging markets can be full of unanticipated shocks, especially on the environmental front. Some of the recent pullback in emerging markets investments — which fell from $162 trillion in March to $85 trillion in April, according to EPFR Global — is likely attributable to investors’ growing realization of the risks, said experts. “Part of the issue is that investors are starting to recognize the inherent risk in the markets — political, cultural, and economic — that makes it very difficult for foreign investors to understand these markets,” said Robert Salomon, associate professor of management and organisations at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “They underestimate the cost and overestimate the benefits associated with investing in foreign countries.” Environmental risks — from pollution, to extreme weather, to changing government regulations and more — are among the most difficult to quantify because they are so broad and diffuse, but they are also some of the most crucial to understand. Investors aware of the effect of environmental problems on emerging markets funds will have a better sense of the volatility they can expect from those investments. “The investor who’s able to incorporate environmental information into their analysis before it becomes evident in a company’s financials is ahead of the game,” wrote Steven Soranno, senior equities analyst at Calvert Investments in Bethesda, Maryland, in an email. It’s not an easy task, in part because companies themselves have only begun to grapple with environmental risks, especially as they affect their complex supply chains. What do the risks look like? Companies operating in developed markets face environmental risks, too, from hurricanes to oil spills. But such issues are magnified in emerging markets, wrote Loic Dujardin, director of Research Products at sustainability research and analysis firm Sustainalytics in Singapore, in an email. “A lack of adequate infrastructures and institutions amplify the impacts of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.” For instance, in an emerging market, droughts causing water scarcity can close power plants that use water for cooling purposes, reducing power to factories. Floods can also temporarily close factories, as the monsoons in Thailand did when flooded plants were closed, and a shortage of hard drives in 2011 affected PC inventories. Along with water scarcity issues, pollution and deforestation are major issues. Companies that generate “externalities,” as they are called, may be fined or lose their license to operate in some countries, wrote Dujardin. “A chemical plant that discharges its wastes in a nearby water stream may be shut down by local authorities... [any] downstream companies impacted by polluted water may lose their competitiveness.” Researchers at London-based Trucost, an environmental data company, analyzed the affect of limited to no available natural capital, such as clean air, water and land, which implies costs down the road, and industries’ ability to absorb those costs. It reported that the industries most vulnerable to environmental risk were: coal power generation in Eastern Asia, cattle ranching and farming in South America, iron and steel mills in Eastern Asia and wheat farming in southern Asia. The bottom line? Companies that examine supply chain risks in their analyses early on are ahead of the game, experts said. Many do not — but that’s something any investor can try to assess, too. “A lot of companies fall short on having robust assessments of their supply chain risk profile — this is where an informed investor can add value,” said Soranno. Shally Venugopal, project manager of Climate Finance & the Private Sector at the World Resources Institute in Washington, DC, suggests investors look through annual reports and sustainability reports to see whether a company is proactively addressing environmental risks, and if their competitors are doing it better. Rankings and sustainability reports from Global 100, Bloomberg New Energy Finance or Trucost, can be good sources. Within the supply chain, companies can find the most efficient use of resources and minimizing waste. Partnering with suppliers to use environmentally friendly technologies is another sign a company takes risks seriously, especially with exclusive suppliers that provide a key commodity. When expanding or planning a supply chain, companies can locate and design facilities to be sustainable and “green” as well as avoiding flood areas. Look for these things in a firm’s annual report to get a sense of how much they’ve considered the risks — and the reward — of environmental issues in emerging markets. Libby Bernick, senior vice president of North America at Trucost, considers whether a company measures and manages environmental risks to be a sign of good management overall.  Companies’ analyses of risk should also show they are aware of the long-term implications of environmental problems. For instance, multinationals in China might eventually have to relocate if air pollution keeps them from attracting or retaining personnel. If a manufacturer in China points to this risk in its sustainability reports, that’s one sign of a solid assessment of environmental risk. Another example: the cost of polluting is low until a company is caught depleting or contaminating water tables, burning down forests or opening factories in environmental zones. The resulting headlines and fines are bad – but they’re just the beginning. “The issue is the long-term liability of the cleanup and the accumulation of the pollution in the ground.” said Karl Russek, senior vice president of Environmental at ACE Overseas General, based in Philadelphia. Investors should look though sustainability and corporate social responsibility reports for how a company operates within emerging markets. Social media and local newspapers can help investors better understand environmental issues within an emerging market.

market volatility,Bitcoin or bust?,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131219-bitcoin-or-bust,"Digital Currency Primer Digital currencies are “mined,” traded and exchanged. (The
Chicago Federal Reserve has published Bitcoin:
A Primer. Bitcoin.org and Blockchain.info which are repositories
for information and transactions. And numerous Bitcoin exchanges exist around
the world for swapping Bitcoin with other currency.)  According to the Chicago Fed, Bitcoin is a fiduciary
currency and “inherently fragile.” Most fiduciary currency derives its value
from “government fiat,” which means the government says it has value or at
least someone else is willing to accept it as valuable. This is in contrast to
commodity-based currency which is itself often a precious metal of value. Is digital currency finally moving from mania to mainstream? In the past few weeks, Bitcoin — the most widely used digital or virtual currency — has “gone parabolic,” as financial market watchers like to say, soaring from a value of $800 to $1200, then rapidly losing half as much as half its value after a Chinese exchange stopped accepting yuan deposits. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have captured the world’s collective imagination. Not so much for their use, but more for what the emerging phenomena say about the global economy, government-issued fiat currencies and central bank policies. To true believers — and even some academics and wealth managers — investors should hold Bitcoin in addition to gold and other alternatives to help diversify their existing portfolio of investments. But not so fast, say others. It’s a volatile and unproven currency, often fluctuating more than 10% in one day.  The US dollar? Fractions of a percent. Same for the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound. Even gold’s rapid decline in 2013 has been measured on a daily basis, aside from a 9% drop on April 15. In the spotlight So, should consumers be joining the digital currency revolution, and holding Bitcoin alongside other alternatives like gold? Not exactly. But the increasing volume of alternative, cross-border currency is still worthy of attention. Even legitimate currency strategists from both Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have attempted to tackle Bitcoin’s place in the world. But there’s also broad concern. A hearing on the “risks, threats and promises” of virtual currencies was recently held by a US Senate committee. The People’s Bank of China has moved to bar financial institutions from Bitcoin transactions. Other central banks — in France and South Korea, for example — have issued consumer warnings on Bitcoin, cautioning buyers and merchants that its volatility could undermine its utility. Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who coined the term “irrational exuberance” to explain the Japanese real estate bubble and, in turn, warn about late 1990s tech stock valuations, has said that digital currencies have no “intrinsic value.” Outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, however, took a more hedged approach, saying that virtual currencies “may have long-term promise.” Still, for many people, the lure of Bitcoin and other alternative currencies may be too much to ignore. Treading cautiously — and understanding the pitfalls — is key to mitigating your risk of getting burned. “Technology is a tremendously disruptive force in society, and it knows no boundaries,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist for broker ConvergEx, in reference to the advance and hype around Bitcoin. How, exactly, does digital currency work? Created in 2009, Bitcoin are finite (21 million will ultimately exist) and can be transacted in units as low as one “Satoshi” or 0.00000001 BTC, as Bitcoin are abbreviated. Bitcoin are created and recorded on a decentralized computer network, which work together to verify the “mining” of new Bitcoins and cross-reference and record any Bitcoin transaction. Bitcoins move from one owner to the next when each party to a transaction sends (and confirms) an exchange. It could be anything from an online purchase to an international money transfer to settling a sports bet. Transactions are then verified across the network, to prevent double-spending of Bitcoin. As described by a Chicago Federal Reserve primer, Bitcoin and other digital currencies are “inherently fragile” because there’s no way to gauge actual value or price. Buyers and sellers of the currency can debate its value or one side can simply chose not to accept it as payment. The value of official currencies, also called legal tender, is not ever in dispute. Virtual utility? Early on, Bitcoin was used to pay software programmers for their time and effort developing Bitcoin protocols, but its use has extended to general merchandise, online gambling, and, until recently, an intricate illegal drug-dealing network called “The Silk Road.” So far, though, no major retailer has opened up their cash registers for volatile digital currencies. So the currency is used mainly by  an ad hoc network of small buyers and sellers, although their numbers are growing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch FX and Rates Strategist David Woo attempted to divine a fair value for Bitcoin, triangulating its usage in e-commerce and money transfer and its use as a store of value. Woo pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility undermines its role as a medium of exchange — that is transactions plummet as volatility rises. In spite of this, Woo wrote in his note that Bitcoin’s low transaction costs can make it attractive: it is inherently a peer-to-peer currency system and doesn’t require banks or other financial intermediaries to take their cut on transfers or storage. Its encrypted format also makes it more impervious than cash to theft or counterfeiting, he said. That said, Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and suffered network outages, resulting in wild price fluctuations and stolen Bitcoins. “The combination of legal tender status and supply anchors the value of dollars in transactions in a way that Bitcoin will never be anchored,” said CitiFX strategist Steven Englander. And then there’s the competition. Developers for other digital currencies such as Litecoin and open-source payment networks are constantly looking to improve upon (replace) Bitcoin. It’s an “issue that the internet currencies will not be able to overcome easily,” said Englander. Considering the traditional national and international system of currency that exists today, it’s not unreasonable to think cooperating governments could eventually come together to build in some of the features of a digital currency — with transaction verification and security to limit fraud and theft. They could “steal” some of the appeal of Bitcoin by making the alternative safer. In our networked world, we often see companies and governments work to cut out alternative (sometimes illicit) activity and bring it to light. Napster was co-opted first by litigation, then by Apple and iTunes. In the US, marijuana prices have been challenged by fresh legality in various states. Even loan-sharking in emerging economies has been diminished by innovative micro-lending platforms. Eventually Bitcoin will be challenged when governments, banks, merchants and individuals at the centre of the existing structure come together, experts said. Don’t think it could happen? The euro, born from the strength of the German Deutschmark, didn’t come in to existence until January 1, 1999 — then as a digital-only currency. "
market volatility,Performance anxiety,2024-09-15,2013-11-12,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131111-performance-anxiety,"“How am I doing?” That question was famously asked by 1980s New York City Mayor Ed Koch, but it’s likely one that you might — and should — ask yourself concerning your finances. To gauge the performance of your stocks, bonds or mutual funds, you might check major stock indexes daily. Or perhaps you’ll turn to your smartphone for the latest moves in the bond market. But that can steer you wrong when it comes to saving for the future. Why? Everyone has their own personal savings goals, their own financial challenges, and their own financial needs.   All that really matters? The Benchmark of You. That benchmark lies somewhere in the intersection between your savings objectives (retirement, education, a new car), the performance of widely-accepted benchmarks (the US Standard & Poor’s 500 index, the DAX, the price of gold and more) and your investments. While it can be challenging to define your personal sweet spot in the middle of these priorities, it is a valuable exercise.  Understanding the Benchmark of You, or your blended benchmark, if you prefer, can relieve you of some of the daily angst of watching the market. It can also steer you to smarter investments and less short-term thinking. Whether you actually build the Benchmark of You or just use this exercise as a way to see your investments — and your risks — in a new light, the process should help you focus on an understanding of your personal financial goals.  First steps To get started, first focus on your asset allocation, and how different mixes of stocks and bonds influence future potential returns and current income, said Fran Kinniry, an investment strategist for the Vanguard Group. This is important for gauging the risk of your investments. For example, stocks pay dividends but can also be very volatile. They increase/decrease based on the market’s view of future earnings. Bonds pay interest and return principal, but with some exceptions, are not particularly effective in times of inflation. Precious metals just sit there. In most cases, if you hold broadly diversified portfolios and don't try to time the market by trading, your risk and return will depend almost entirely on your asset mix and costs. “Once you’ve identified your asset allocation, then work down to make sure the benchmarks make sense: domestic stocks, foreign stocks, taxable bonds…etc,” said Kinniry.  If 10% of your portfolio is invested in US small cap stocks, then you should identify an appropriate benchmark index — such as the Russell 2000 — and make note of how that index does on a daily basis.   Two notes of caution before starting this exercise: The more individual stocks, bonds and funds you throw into the mix, the more benchmarks you may have to track. Also, remember to account for fees.  They vary, depending upon the investment, and can diminish your overall performance.  Here’s how you might go about pairing your investments with the appropriate benchmarks on the way to the Benchmark of You. 1. Start with your stocks and bonds: Identify the industry or sector in which the security would be grouped.  Then, you need to locate an index (or low-cost index fund) that closely corresponds with that security. Be careful, some companies may be hard to categorize. In some taxonomies, internet retailer Amazon.com is considered a “Services” business in the “Catalog & Mail Order Houses” industry. Apple is a “Consumer Goods” business in the “Electronic Equipment” industry. In the end, you are trying to match up your individual holdings with indexes that represent the industry the company is in. 2. Then move to your mutual funds:  You want to find which benchmark by which that fund is measured. (Most openly disclose this in the prospectus. Read it.) At the same time, make sure you understand the strategy of the fund. If it is an index fund, what is it trying to do? Is it tracking a traditional market-cap weighted index, which holds each company in an index according to its market weighting like the S&P 500, or is it trying to make a risk-return trade-off with different weightings and different sector exposures? All funds, index or not, disclose their objectives and what index or composite they are attempting to match or outperform. Data providers like Morningstar and Lipper can also provide some context by placing a fund in a peer group and comparing it against an index.   Some funds have split personalities. An “unconstrained bond fund” invests in anything with a coupon payment. A balanced fund may be 60% stocks and 40% bonds. There are dozens of flavours of hedge funds. Once you know what index your fund is trying to beat or match, track that alongside the fund quarterly and annually. 3. Pulling it all together: Once you’ve matched up all of your measurable investments to indexes or index funds, you can do one of two things. The simple solution is to track the total return of the indexes (or index funds) against your own holdings on a one-to-one basis. Size up the discrepancies quarterly or annually, whenever you rebalance your portfolio. The more complicated solution is to use an online portfolio tool at Yahoo Finance or Morningstar and create a “dummy portfolio” invested in index funds in proportion to your own stocks, bonds and funds. It gets even trickier when you want to rebalance or reinvest dividends. Unless you really want to manage your “dummy portfolio,” stick with option 1. Vanguard’s Kinniry cautions, however, that a blended benchmark can be distracting and lead to performance chasing. “If there’s a lot of volatility to your performance, overall and above or below the benchmark for each investment, then either you are looking at the wrong benchmarks or you are taking more risk than you expected,” said Kinniry. And for those who are still out there gunning to beat a benchmark, just bear in mind that a majority of investment funds can't consistently beat their own benchmarks."
market volatility,Tremors in emerging markets,2024-09-15,2014-02-18,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140218-tremors-in-emerging-markets,"Signs of strengthening recovery from developed economies have sent shudders through emerging markets in recent months, prompting heavy outflows of money from countries spanning the globe from India to China and Brazil. Emerging market stocks first started to wobble as far back as last spring, when the US Federal Reserve began to discuss its timetable for pulling back on fiscal stimulus, bringing its era of ‘cheap money’ to a close. But if turbulent stock markets sound like a challenge for people in Ivory Towers or city skyscrapers, think again. The return of higher long-term interest rates in the US and Europe means marginal money and projects are being pulled-out of emerging market countries and businesses. Investors have been rapidly shifting their investments in favour of what look like tried-and-tested markets. Stock markets, interest rates and currency exchange rates around the world are all connected and they have a direct impact on your wallet and pay cheque. In short, this interconnectivity all boils down to how businesses grow. Businesses look at the cost of labour and the price of resources when they decide where to build plants and produce goods, as well as what to pay workers. So ultimately, the price you pay for everything from clothes to computers begins to shift as markets, interest rates and currencies fluctuate. Understanding how global business decisions trickle down to consumers can be challenging, even for the most-sophisticated analysts. Yet it is important for consumer to have a firm grasp on how it all works. At their most basic, exchange rates indicate the price of one currency against another. Underlying those rates are the costs of goods and services that can be bought in the respective currencies, as well as the cost to borrow that currency, i.e. the interest rate. The baseline for these rates is generally targeted by central banks – the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England – and individual and corporate rates are set in reference to that “risk-free” rate. Exchange rates and interest rates adjust daily, based on views of investors and borrowers and which countries/currencies they want to invest in. To get a clearer picture of the ties that bind global currencies and exchange rates together, BBC Capital spoke to Steven Englander, global head of G10 currency strategy at Citibank. Edited excerpts follow. BBC Capital: For many of us, our experience with exchange rates occurs only at a foreign bank if we are travelling or sending money to family abroad. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of “exchanging” going on, so what will really move exchange rates? Englander: It takes a bit of time for the full exchange rate [fluctuation] to really go through into prices [people pay at stores or charge for labour]. In many emerging economies, it moves quicker than in the US, UK and other developed economies. What does happen quickly is the perception that the economy is slowing down and [that] projects are not viable anymore. Economic activity, both corporate and consumer, gets hit very quickly as businesses stall projects [and stop paying workers, cut worker hours or delay buying goods.] BBC Capital: So how do people under, say, the euro which serves many countries and economies, feel the effects of and adjust to these shocks when the individual countries in the eurozone have little influence over their exchange rate and monetary policy? Englander: In the eurozone, the adjustment comes by incomes shrinking, which brings down borrowing levels [as business can’t afford to borrow for expansion and hiring.] This process is very painful, because it takes much longer for competitiveness to be restored. In addition, if foreign investors see an extended period of weakness [they are less likely to invest in the area]. BBC Capital: We've been reading a lot recently about emerging markets and the effect of the US Federal Reserve tapering off its bond buying. How are these related? Englander: The emerging market story is actually threefold. China is slowing and its support for commodity demand is dissipating. [This affects the price of commodities like copper and crude oil and demand for related currencies in Canada and Australia, for example.] The US is beginning to pull rein in bond purchases [which can contribute to long-term interest rates rising.] But some emerging markets responded to global liquidity of the past few years by borrowing more and consuming, rather than investing and implementing structural reform. Now we have a slower China, tighter credit, slower growth and lower commodity prices all happening at once, so countries that were eager to borrow are crunched. BBC Capital: It sounds like investing broadly in emerging markets and China could be challenging in the short-term. So how should investors view these inevitable fluctuations? Do they need to ‘hedge’ their currency exposure? Englander: Currency exposure is part of a diversified portfolio and helps reduce portfolio volatility. Many economists and strategists recommend at least 20% to 30% of a portfolio to be exposed to foreign currencies. This can be done by directly owning foreign currencies or through equity investments abroad or companies with significant business outside their home region. If you hold large US and UK companies — such as those in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index or FTSE 100 — you implicitly have foreign currency exposure. This should also be part of your core financial planning process, understanding how your portfolio and the companies you own are sensitive to individual regions, countries and currencies."
market volatility,House prices up 8.5% in 2020 amid tax holiday,2024-09-15,2021-02-17,By Simon Read,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56095357,"UK house prices climbed 8.5% in 2020, the highest annual growth rate since October 2014, according to official figures. The average UK house price reached a record high of £252,000 in December 2020, the Office for National Statistics said. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. The stamp duty holiday due to end this March contributed to the rise, the ONS said. Spending more time at home in the pandemic meant some people also decided they needed more space. That was reflected in the average price of detached properties climbing by twice as much as flats and maisonettes during 2020, up 10% and 5% respectively. Meanwhile Wales experienced the fastest price growth, with property values rising 10.7% to £184,000. In England, prices climbed 8.5% to £269,000, in Scotland, 8.4% to £163,000 and in Northern Ireland 5.3% to £148,000. ""Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations,"" the ONS said. The UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions. Although average London prices were up by 3.5%, over last year, prices fell in the capital by £5,000 between November and December, despite a UK-wide price increase of 1.2% over the month. But the city still has the highest average house price in the UK, at £496,000. The North East continued to have the lowest average house price at £141,000, and has become the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007. ""2020 was the year that fundamentals came home to roost,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country.  ""There was no escaping a lack of space for households who suddenly found they were living on top of each other with little respite. That has powered annual growth that reached a six-year high."" There were four major drivers of overall house price rises in 2020, said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital. ""The temporary stamp duty reduction and cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which give buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners; and the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to keep their money in a stable asset with low volatility. ""But looking to the future when the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises,"" she said. ""However, there is still some life in the market as lockdown helps to concentrate many potential buyers and sellers' minds as far as moving is concerned,"" said north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf.  ""Intense speculation remains as to whether the 31 March stamp duty deadline will be extended and we can't help but have sympathy for many who have started the process several months ago who have been unavoidably delayed by a backlog in searches, surveys, conveyancing, or all three, to say nothing of problems in the new-build industry."""
market volatility,Q&A: Dutch parliamentary election,2024-09-15,2012-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19488679,"Rival parties are featured on election posters in Amsterdam Dutch voters will go to the polls on 12 September to elect a new lower house. The 150 seats will be allocated to political parties on the basis of proportional representation. The election was called early after the anti-Islamic Party for Freedom (PVV) withdrew its support for the centre-right minority government led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The previous government was formed by Mark Rutte's conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and depended on the PVV's support in parliament. In the 2010 election, the VVD won 31 seats, Geert Wilders' PVV 24, and the CDA 21.  Mark Rutte called an election after his coalition deal broke down The biggest party on the left has traditionally been the Labour Party (PvdA), which won 30 seats in 2010. This year the more left-wing Socialist Party (SP), which won only 15 seats in 2010, has also been doing well in opinion polls. Other parties represented in the current lower house are the liberal D66 (10 seats), Green Left (10), the Christian Union (5), the Protestant conservative Reformed Political Party (2), and the Party for Animals (2). Austerity measures and the country's relationship with the EU are two of the main issues in this election campaign. Geert Wilders' Freedom Party withdrew its support for Mark Rutte's government Mark Rutte tendered his government's resignation in April after Geert Wilders refused to back budget cuts intended to bring the deficit in line with EU rules. The PVV has since made leaving the EU and the euro its top priority, while continuing to call for a stop to ""Islamisation"". The VVD says it wants to address the country's financial problems now rather than leaving them to future generations. It emphasises the benefits of the EU's internal market while urging ""not more Europe but a better Europe"". On the left, the SP calls for ""more social, humane and sustainable"" policies and opposes the outgoing government's austerity plans. The party castigates the EU's ""regulation mania"" and urges respect for national sovereignty. The PvdA wants to balance ""responsible"" financial policies with investments and job creation, both in the Netherlands and in the EU. Yes, and they are said to have had a noticeable impact on the race. On 26 August, Mark Rutte for the VVD, Emile Roemer for the SP, Diederik Samsom for the PvdA and Geert Wilders for the PVV clashed in an RTL 4 TV debate described by Dutch media as ""lively"" and ""passionate"". Mr Samsom (L) has overtaken Mr Roemer (C) in opinion polls (Screengrab Dutch NOS website) Mr Samsom was judged to have won the debate by 51% of viewers taking part in an RTL online poll, while Mr Roemer came last on 6%. Since then the PS has lost a lot of ground to the PvdA in opinion polls. Another RTL 4 TV debate on 4 September, judged to be more ""orderly"", was again won by Mr Samsom, closely followed by Mr Rutte, according to an online poll. The newspaper de Volkskrant commented that debt-ridden Greece was the loser because for the first time Mr Rutte had said that he did not want to give Athens any more aid.  A final TV debate is due to be held by the NOS public broadcaster on the eve of the election. The race is wide open as opinion polls point to great volatility in voting intentions. For months it looked as if the VVD and the SP were vying for the top spot, but in recent days the SP has slumped and the PvdA has surged to put it neck-and-neck with the VVD. Meanwhile the PVV is still trailing in fourth place, followed by the CDA and D66. Neither the main right-wing nor the main left-wing parties appear to be heading for a clear majority, raising the prospect of another minority government or a multi-party coalition. Coalition negotiations in the Netherlands tend to be drawn-out affairs. They lasted 127 days in 2010, while the post-war record stands at 208 days in 1977.

market volatility,UK growth rebound eases recession fears,2024-09-15,2019-09-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49632627,"The UK's economy grew faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. The economy grew 0.3% in July, the UK's official statistics body said, helped by the dominant services sector. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement on the 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. This contraction, coupled with some weak business surveys, raised concerns the UK was heading for recession. An economy is generally deemed to be in recession if it contracts for two quarters in a row. However, while growth in the services sector - which accounts for about 80% of the UK economy - helped to drive July's stronger-than-expected growth figure, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) warned that the sector remained weak. ""While the largest part of the economy, the services sector, returned to growth in the month of July, the underlying picture shows services growth weakening through 2019,"" the ONS said. The pound rose in reaction to the figures, rising 0.6% against the dollar to $1.2357. The return to growth in the economy in the month of July will be a political relief for a troubled government keen to avoid recession headlines in early November. It makes unlikely the notion of another consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September, the definition of a recession.  But that does not make the economic reality rosy. In the three months to July, the economy did not grow. Even with a Q3 registering 0.3% growth, it would be the weakest first three quarters of a year since the financial crisis.  Over nine months, much of the volatility around no-deal - stockpiling effects and car industry shutdowns - should have been stripped out too. There is some evidence in the figures that firms are beginning to restart stockpiling in anticipation of the rising possibility of no-deal Brexit next month.  It is difficult to predict how the current political impasse affects those patterns. But a prolonged squeeze on business investment was always going to hit productivity and growth.  The global context is far from benign too, with the German economy looking likely to be in recession and the eurozone as a whole growing sluggishly.  Other survey indicators for the UK look more difficult too. But if July's pattern continued last month and into this, the government should, when full Q3 figures are released in November, be able to avoid the R-word, for now.  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also said that concerns remained. ""Although there was a rise in GDP between June and July, the zero growth recorded on the underlying three-month measure points to an economy under pressure from uncertainty over Brexit and weakening global economic conditions,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC. ""The manufacturing sector remains an area of concern, with tightening cash-flow, concerns over disrupted supply chains and weakening demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector."" Last week, a series of downbeat surveys of various sectors of the economy had raised fears that the UK was at risk of slipping into recession. However, analysts said the latest GDP figures appeared to have dampened these concerns. ""The pick-up in GDP in July is a reassuring sign that the economy is on course to grow at a solid - perhaps even above-trend - rate in Q3,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that figures ""substantially"" weakened the case for any cuts in UK interest rates ""before Britain's Brexit path is known"". ""The upside surprise came from the services sector, which displayed broad-based strength and did not seemingly benefit from any one-off stimuli,"" Mr Tombs said. Analysts also noted that August's growth figure should be boosted by car manufacturers, which were operating last month, contrary to normal practice. Many carmakers had brought their annual shutdown forward for the original Brexit date in March. ""GDP will get a further boost of about 0.2% in August, when car manufacturers will be at work when they are usually on holiday,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""Overall, the economy is still fairly weak - we estimate that the underlying pace of growth is around +0.2% quarter-on-quarter - but it's not in recession. Political chaos, yes. Economic chaos, no."""
market volatility,US stocks see worst first half drop since 1970,2024-09-15,2022-07-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62005360,"US stocks have seen their worst first half of a year since 1970, as concerns grow over how steps to curb inflation will affect economic growth. In the last six months, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 20.6%, while other major US indexes also dropped sharply. Stocks in the UK, mainland Europe and Asia have also suffered steep losses. It comes as central banks around the world are trying to rein in soaring living costs, with prices of essential goods like food and fuel jumping. Some economists expect the US, which is the world's biggest economy, to go into a recession as early as this year as interest rates continue to rise. ""If the US Federal Reserve continues hiking rates the stock market will react quite negatively,"" Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, told the BBC. Shane Oliver at AMP Capital said: ""Shares are likely to see continued short-term volatility as central banks continue to tighten to combat high inflation, the war in Ukraine continues and fears of recession remain high."" Another major US stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell by more than 15% in the first half of this year, the biggest drop for the period since 1962. At the same time the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite lost almost 30%, marking its largest percentage drop for the first half of a year. Major stock market indexes outside the US have also fallen sharply this year. The UK's FTSE 250 has dropped by more than 20%, while Europe's Stoxx 600 index has slipped by almost 17% and the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific markets has fallen by more than 18%. It comes as many of the world's biggest central banks take steps to slow the rising cost of living, including raising interest rates. Earlier this week, the bosses of three of the world's biggest central banks warned that the era of moderate inflation and low interest rates had ended. At an annual meeting in Portugal, the heads of the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England said action must be taken quickly to prevent price rises from getting out of control. However, they also cautioned that measures to rein in an inflation shock caused by the Ukraine war and pandemic may have a significant negative impact on global growth. ""Is there a risk that we would go too far? Certainly there's a risk, but I wouldn't agree that it's the biggest risk to the economy,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said. ""The bigger mistake to make, let's put it that way, would be to fail to restore price stability,"" he added. Last month, the Fed announced its biggest rate rise in nearly 30 years as it ramped up its fight to rein in soaring consumer prices. The Bank of England also raised its key interest rate to the highest level in 13 years, from 1% to 1.25%. You may also be interested in:"
market volatility,A million more will struggle to pay energy bills,2024-09-15,2021-10-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58831110,"More than a million extra British households won't be able to afford to heat and power their homes next spring, according to a charity. Energy bills are expected to rise again in April to reflect the rising wholesale price of gas. National Energy Action says 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households will be plunged into fuel poverty. Households that spend a high proportion of their income on energy bills are considered to be in fuel poverty. At the start of October the energy price cap, which limits the impact of rising energy prices on households in England, Scotland and Wales, was raised to take the sharply rising wholesale gas price into account. But Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the price cap would have to rise again next year if wholesale gas prices continue to go up. Analysts said this could mean a typical customer paying between £400 and £600 more per year.  Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they aren't protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. National Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty. ""It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by £400 to £600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,"" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer. NEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April.  Its chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was ""designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time"". Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis.  As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Even with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties. ""Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,"" he told an energy conference on Thursday. Nine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Those households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy. The government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he said. Decarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said.  ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. However, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by £400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around £1,660 a year. However the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap could be £500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of £600, £700 or even £800 cannot be ruled out."" Businesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs. Firms are warning that could lead to higher prices for their goods as increases are passed on to consumers. Richard Walker, managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, said steep rises in energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world,"" he told the BBC. ""Our margins are very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Mark Nicholson and his business partner set up their firm Harvey George Furniture four years ago in Hull. Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture.  The past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about £500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand. ""It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,"" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster.  ""Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought. Our last bill was £8,000 - it was a shock. ""We'll keep going. But we could just do with some stability on our costs. It feels like everything - rates, recruitment, materials, shipping - now energy... feels very up and down.""  The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. When the cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of £139 - from £1,138 to £1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a £153 increase. That is a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by £84, to £1,042. Will you be affected by rising energy prices?

market volatility,When will we start seeing energy bill deals again?,2024-09-15,2023-05-25,Vishala Sri-Pathma & Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65712145,"Since gas and electricity prices soared in the UK last year, fixed energy deals have all but disappeared as an option for households. But with bills due to drop from July, could they be about to make a comeback? Under the new price cap - which is the maximum price suppliers can charge customers per unit of gas and electricity - a typical household will pay £2,074 a year for gas and electricity from July. That is £426 a year less than what they pay now, although still far higher than what we saw before the energy crisis. So far, most big suppliers have said they will bring their tariffs in line with the new cap but none have set out cheaper fixed deals for customers. Such deals have effectively been off the table since the government stepped in to subsidise bills with its Energy Price Guarantee in October, holding them at £2,500 a year for the average household.  Suppliers have claimed they are not able to offer more competitive pricing plans, and so consumers have not been able to shop around. However, Natalie Mathie, an energy expert at the switching site Uswitch.com, believes the fall in the price cap will be ""a watershed moment"" for suppliers, ""who can now look to start offering fixed deals again given the market conditions"". ""The majority of homes are on standard variable tariffs and now subject to the volatility of price cap changes every three months,"" she says.  ""But customers should have the choice of whether to lock in the benefits of lower wholesale prices for 12 months, just as they do in the mortgage market.  ""We see no reason why energy suppliers cannot offer competitive fixed deals around the £2,000 level."" Emily Seymour, of consumer group Which?, thinks we could start seeing such deals some time this year.  ""We hope to see consumers back able to make some choices,"" she said.  ""It will be worth doing a bit of research to see if there's a deal out there that could be cost effective while also offering good customer service and low exit fees."" However, she says it will depend on where energy prices go next, with fixed deals less likely if the cap has to go up again.  Others meanwhile warn that fixed deals may not be best for everyone given the uncertainty over future prices.  For example, energy supplier Ovo launched a fixed deal for existing customers in March that was cheaper than the government's limit on household bills.  It offered a fixed 12-month tariff of £2,275 for existing customers, but anyone who signed up is now locked into that rate, meaning they will miss out when the new cap comes into effect. Martin Lewis, from personal finance website Money Saving Expert, has also questioned just how much choice consumers will get when fixed deals finally return.  ""I am expecting to see existing customer offers - where you will get a bespoke offer from your firm rather than deals offered across the market,"" he told BBC Radio 4. This could stifle competition, he warned, as the rules say companies do not have to publish the details of their existing customer offers.  ""It makes it very hard for people like me to assess,"" he said.  In any event, the energy analysts Cornwall Insight have suggested consumers should not expect to see huge savings from deals that do emerge.  That is because further substantial falls in energy prices will be unlikely, particularly if there is a cold winter in Europe, with the UK competing to buy gas and electricity with other countries. ""Our forecasts suggest until the end of this decade, higher and more volatile prices are going to be seen, and that includes the impact they're going to have on domestic bills unfortunately,"" Cornwall analyst Kate Mulvany told the BBC. Energy suppliers should be in touch in the coming weeks to let customers know what their bill will look like under the new cap. However, Ms Seymour says it is always worth having a conversation with your supplier about any bespoke deals they can offer you.  If you find yourself struggling to pay bills, consumer experts suggest speaking to your energy supplier about a payment plan that is manageable. By paying what you can - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears will grow more slowly and your supplier is likely to be less worried about your debt. Your supplier could also check if you qualify for any government schemes.  It's also important to check the amount you pay each month if you use a direct debit.  Your monthly payment is based on your estimated usage through the year not what you actually use so keep a close eye and update your supplier with your meter readings. Listen to The Martin Lewis Podcast for more on the new energy price cap Here are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips. What do I do if I can't afford to pay my debts? What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?"
market volatility,Firms warn of price rises as energy costs soar,2024-09-15,2021-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58824121,"High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Iceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". The warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year. They said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by £400 in the spring. Cornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about £1,660 by next summer. That is about 30% higher than the record £1,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October. ""With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,"" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight. Energy regulator Ofgem said the price cap ""will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter"". But if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said. The regulator said its ""number one priority is to protect customers"", but acknowledged ""this is a worrying time for many people"".  But while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. Mr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by £20m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase. ""It's inevitable that we will see price rises,"" he told the BBC. ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world.  ""Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Andrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: ""This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can."" One paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been ""left to fend for itself"" in the face of ""horrendous"" knock-on effects from the gas price rise. ""The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,"" said chairman Paul Fecher. Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production ""due to uneconomic higher energy costs"". This could cause ""severe damage"" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK. He said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help. ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be £500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of £600, £700 or even £800 cannot be ruled out."" Nine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate. They were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared.  Their customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered. Some of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe. UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention. But price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. The cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of £139 - from £1,138 to £1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a £153 increase.

market volatility,Energy prices could vary at different times of day,2024-09-15,2024-03-25,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68655725,"Domestic energy prices could be capped based on the time of day that households use their appliances, the regulator Ofgem has said. The watchdog said it has launched early discussions about a ""dynamic"" price cap that changes as consumers became more flexible. It said it would become harder to retain a universal price cap that is suitable for everyone. So it is considering a range of options for changing the current system. At present, Ofgem fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. That affects about 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of energy will fall to £1,690 from April to the lowest for two years - and down £238 a year from now. Ofgem said the price cap had worked well to protect customers from the ""loyalty penalty"", where customers on default tariffs paid higher prices, and from the worst of the recent volatility seen in the wholesale energy sector. But it said habits and the market were changing as increasing numbers of consumers changed the way they consumed energy and began using electric vehicles, heat pumps and solar panels. A new price cap would need to be flexible for tariffs that allowed price differences if appliances switched on when there is lower demand for energy such as in the night, or when there is more supply from renewables such as when the wind blows. Tim Jarvis, Ofgem's director general of retail and markets, said: ""We recognise the systems we have in place may need to change too. ""We're looking in detail at the elements of the price cap that have worked well and the challenges we've identified in recent years, while also considering how a wide range of future consumers will use and pay for energy to make sure we develop the right measures that will protect and benefit consumers across the board."" Other options included: Mr Jarvis said there would be widespread consultation and the regulator's aim was to ensure the market worked for everyone.  It is impossible to say at this stage how prices would change compared with now for different households if any of these ideas were taken on.  There has been some experimentation with tariffs that vary according to when energy is used. Some households have been offered discounts to use less electricity at peak times in an attempt to ease demand during cold snaps. Simon Virley, head of energy and natural resources at global business services firm KPMG UK, said that while the existing price cap had saved money for customers, this had ""come at a price"". He said it meant ""effective competition and innovation in the market suffering and switching levels falling off a cliff"". ""As we look to what a future retail energy market looks like - it will be key to balance proportionate consumer protection with incentives for investment and innovation in a smarter energy system that benefits all consumers,"" he added."
market volatility,"UK failing to sort gas price rises, steel boss says",2024-09-15,2021-10-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58846999,"The government has failed to find solutions to halt soaring energy prices, UK Steel boss Gareth Stace has said. He was speaking after leaders of energy-intensive industries met with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. ""We can't wait until Christmas and beyond. Or even a few weeks. We need action now, it needs to be swift, decisive action,"" Mr Stace said. The government said it was exploring ways to manage high energy costs. Gas prices have risen 250% since January, pushing up costs dramatically. Mr Stace told the BBC that Mr Kwarteng had listened but had provided ""no immediate solutions or guarantees"". The UK Steel director general said he was ""baffled"" because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry, although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK. Representatives from energy-intensive sectors including paper, glass, cement, lime, ceramics, chemicals and steel were at Friday's talks with the business secretary. The Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) said it hoped the government would find ways to support those sectors. Mr Kwarteng told the business representatives he would continue to work with them to tackle the problem.  His department said the government would assess the options put forward by the industry, with his spokesperson saying: ""We recognise the recent increase in global gas prices will be a cause of concern for businesses in the UK. ""We are in regular contact with Ofgem and business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of rising global prices."" Mr Kwarteng also stressed government confidence in the security of gas supplies this winter. After the meeting, EIUG chair Richard Leese said the government had made ""positive first steps to develop practical solutions"". ""EIUG will work with government to avoid threats both to the production of essential domestic and industrial products, as well an enormous range of supply chains critical to our economy,"" he said. Andrew Large, director-general at the Confederation of Paper Industries, said there were ""serious"" risks factories could stop operating as a result of the gas prices being too high. There have already been stoppages at fertiliser and steel plants due to high energy costs. However, he said the business secretary appeared to share industry's desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption. On Thursday Mr Kwarteng said the government's strategy to shift to ""clean"" power sources by 2035, including wind, solar and nuclear, would reduce reliance on fossil fuels. ""The volatility of the gas price has shown we do need to plan strategically and net zero helps us do that,"" he said. Speaking before the meeting, Mr Stace had said if the government failed to act it could ""strangle steel production"" in the UK. A crisis in steel production as a result of high energy prices would affect the wider economy, he added, saying the government should consider taking additional action in the short term. ""We're pausing production already in terms of some steel producers in the UK.... and it's going to happen more often unless something is done, or the energy market corrects itself and I don't think that will happen any time soon."" He said the government should address the disparity in energy costs for UK steel makers who he said were paying 50-80% more for electricity than German producers. Other countries, such as Italy and Portugal, had ""committed billions of euros"" to address the rising cost of gas, he added.  ""If the government does nothing then tomorrow, there'll be a steel crisis, and given in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel is, but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he said. The price of wholesale gas has soared since the start of the year. And the UK has lower levels of gas stored than other European countries, which could help cushion price volatility. Domestic customers' bills are partly protected from these sharp rises by a price cap, managed by the regulator Ofgem, which limits how far and how fast bills can rise. Nevertheless, UK households have felt the impact after the price cap was raised at the start of October. Customers will see further ""significant rises"" in the spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. It applies to households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain."
market volatility,Winter energy bills drop slightly but remain high,2024-09-15,2023-08-24,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66607005,"An annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall to £1,923 in October under regulator Ofgem's new price cap. Bills will be £151 lower than current rates and £577 down on last winter. But many people will see little difference in what they pay despite the fall because some government support has been withdrawn. Charities said the government must protect the most vulnerable households.  Average annual gas and electricity bills remain high by historical standards. In winter 2021, an energy bill for a typical household was £1,277.  Analysts also suggest that prices could rise again at the start of next year. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: ""We know people are struggling with the wider cost of living challenges and I can't offer any certainty that things will ease this winter.""  Volatility in the market gave little long-term certainty to customers, he said. Ofgem's price cap affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. It sets the maximum amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill. If you use more, you will pay more. For a home using a typical amount of gas and electricity and paying by direct debit, the current annual bill is £2,074. This will fall to £1,923 between 1 October and 31 December. Specifically, the price of gas will fall from 7.5p per kilowatt hour (kWh) now to 6.89p for the final three months of the year. The price of electricity will fall from 30.1p per kWh to 27.35p. The typical bill is calculated on an estimate that the average household uses 2,900 kWh of electricity and 12,000 kWh of gas. Those who pay bills every three months, often by cheque - known as standard credit - will pay £129 more a year than those using direct debit. Domestic energy bills will be lower than the £2,500 a year paid last winter and spring, when the government stepped in to limit further rises. Prices rose following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   But last winter's government-funded £400 discount to every household, which was paid in six instalments between October and March, has finished and will not be repeated. Adam Scorer, from charity National Energy Action, said costs would be higher for many if the weather is colder than last year. ""Millions will still face unaffordable bills this winter and we are concerned about a mood of complacency. Government must remain laser focused on the risk of vulnerable households struggling in cold homes this winter,"" he said. Citizens Advice called for more targeted government support for those who need it most. The charity said the number of people getting in contact for advice about paying energy bills jumped by 17% in the first half of this year.   Ofgem's Mr Brearley said that social tariffs, for lower-income households, should be considered as a future option. Asked about families being concerned they will again struggle to pay their bills this winter, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government was working ""night and day to ensure the money in people's pockets goes further"". ""I want to make sure the most vulnerable in our society do get help, even when prices are coming down,"" he said. Meanwhile, households are paying more for standing charges, which are a fixed daily payment covering the costs of supply and other levies. They are also capped and part of the typical energy bill but, because they are fixed, consumers have no way of reducing them even if they cut back on energy use. Ofgem officials said that the latest rise was the result of a higher rate of inflation. That meant suppliers' operating costs, such as running call centres, were higher. Mr Brearley said that it was difficult to shift some of these costs onto usage prices.  The average standing charge for electricity will be 53.37p per day from October. For gas customers, it will be 29.62p per day.  Jay Cross, who runs a barbers shop, said he and his wife Andrea found their direct debits were failing to cover their bills last year.  ""We ran over on the bills and then made payment plans to catch up with it,"" he said.  ""We've got no choice, we've got to have the heating on - especially with the baby. We're still in arrears but we are going to get back on top of it ready for this winter.""  Analysts suggest domestic energy bills are unlikely to fall significantly for the next decade. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said higher energy bills were ""here to stay"" and that Labour would bring in a ""proper windfall tax"". Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse said high bills reflected a ""shocking failure"" by ministers. Cost-of-living payments will continue to be made to people on lower incomes and those receiving certain benefits to help with high bills.

market volatility,Warning of fresh energy bill shock in October,2024-09-15,2022-04-01,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60959357,"People have been warned to brace for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October.  This could add another £629 a year to a typical bill, on top of Friday's unprecedented £700-a-year rise, says energy consultancy Cornwall Insight. The expected rise in bills just as colder weather kicks in has prompted calls for fresh government support to those struggling to pay. Energy prices have been affected by the Ukraine war and pressure on suppliers. The most up-to-date prediction from Cornwall Insight would, if accurate, push annual energy bills for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to up to £2,600 from October. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky. Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating. ""We are going to see an extra £500 or £600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households,"" he told the BBC. ""He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."" The warning comes on top of a huge rise in what energy suppliers can charge customers from Friday. The £693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year. At the same time, a host of bill hikes take effect with council tax, water bills and car tax  going up for some on 1 April. Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow. Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals. New official figures suggest four in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the UK's largest supplier British Gas, said his business was supporting struggling customers and was giving grants to those most in need. ""We would love to do more. The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,"" he told the BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. The government has said it was taking ""decisive action"" to help people with the cost of living, including a £200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a £150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers.  Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as ""pathetic"". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Newscast: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly.""

Prices in the bloc are rising at the highest pace for half a century as energy costs soar. The ECB lifted all its key rates by three-quarters of a percentage point and warned that it was likely to raise rates again later this year. The bank had raised interest rates in July, its first increase in more than 11 years. ""Price pressures have continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy,"" the ECB said after its latest decision. The ECB raised its key deposit rate - how much interest it pays on deposits - to 0.75% from zero, and lifted its main refinancing rate - how much banks have to pay when they borrow money from the ECB - to 1.25% from 0.5%. Central banks raise interest rates to increase the cost of borrowing, which should lead people to borrow and spend less, and to save more. In theory, this helps curb price rises. Inflation around the world is being driven by higher energy prices. Prices were rising more quickly as economies recovered from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, but they jumped further due to Russia's war in Ukraine. ECB president Christine Lagarde said the central bank could not control high energy prices. ""I cannot reduce the price of energy,"" she said. ""I cannot convince the big players of this world to reduce gas prices. I cannot reform the electricity market. And I am very pleased to see that the European Commission is considering steps to that effect because monetary policy is not going to reduce the price of energy."" She added that if gas prices continue to ""skyrocket"", that would be ""recessionary"". If Russia were to cut gas supplies to the EU completely, then one scenario the ECB envisages - if it is not possible to secure alternative gas supplies from Asia, Norway and the US - is gas rationing across the whole euro area and a recession in 2023, Ms Lagarde said. With the ECB statement explicitly saying more rate hikes would be needed, markets continue to expect another half-point rise at the bank's October meeting. Euro area inflation is expected to be 9.1 % in August, up from 8.9 % in July, according to Eurostat. Janet Mui, head of market analysis at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said the ECB was ""playing catch up"" with the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have already been raising rates. The ECB has forecast eurozone inflation of 8.1% this year, 5.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024, but ""these are subject to a high degree of uncertainty given the volatility in gas prices"". With high energy prices sapping purchasing power, some economists predict a eurozone downturn. Some policymakers have talked about a recession, and the ECB's new projections also show sharply lower growth in the coming years. ""After a rebound in the first half of 2022, recent data point to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in the year and in the first quarter of 2023,"" the ECB said."
market volatility,Bill shock for millions as energy price rise hits,2024-09-15,2022-03-31,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60943192,"Millions of people will now feel the impact of an unprecedented £700-a-year rise in energy costs - at the same time as a host of bill hikes take effect. The 54% rise in the energy price cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay £1,971 per year. A further rise pushing the annual bill up to £2,600 should be expected in October, one analyst has told the BBC. Council tax, water bills and car tax are also going up for some on 1 April. Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow. The £693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year. Among them is Winston Carrington, a grandfather in his 70s, who said he was growing vegetables in the garden of his Manchester home to help ease the impact of the rising cost of living. ""I'm going to grow, and I'm going to fill my freezer this year with my own produce. I'm going to have to,"" said Mr Carrington, who uses a prepayment meter. ""I can't go away this year again, not because of Covid or anything. I just can't afford to go away. The state pension that we're getting at the moment does not cover what I need."" Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals.  New official figures suggest four in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. However, official forecasters and analysts have warned people to be braced for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October. Wholesale prices have been affected by the war in Ukraine and ongoing pressure on suppliers. This could add another £629 to a typical bill in October, according to the most up-to-date prediction, provided to the BBC from leading energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight. If this proved to be accurate, then the average bill next winter would be double that of the winter just gone. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?  Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating. ""We are going to see an extra £500 or £600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."" Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the UK's largest supplier British Gas, said his business was supporting struggling customers and was giving grants to those most in need. ""We would love to do more. The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,"" he told the BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. Council taxes and water bills are also going up for many people, added to the rising cost of food and household items.  One estimate suggests that a typical consumer is now facing a £73 a month increase in bills, of which about £58 is from rising energy costs. ""The added cost pressures set to come into play in April threatens to obliterate even the most finely tuned budgets."" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor.  The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. Even before the latest increases, charity Citizens Advice said that in March, it referred 24,752 people to food banks or to other charitable support, up by 44% compared to the same month last year. The government has said it was taking ""decisive action"" to help people with the cost of living, including a £200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a £150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers.  Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as ""pathetic"". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Newscast: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly."""
market volatility,Magnum-maker's profits soar after it raises prices,2024-09-15,2023-07-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66299138,"Magnum and Marmite-maker Unilever has reported profits soared over the first six months of this year, based almost entirely on raising its prices. The consumer goods giant said that across the business, pre-tax profit rose 21% to €3.9bn (£3.34bn) but the number of goods that it sold fell.  Supermarkets, such as Tesco, have been critical of suppliers lifting their prices amid high inflation. Unilever's boss said it had not passed on higher costs to its customers. Chief executive Hein Schumacher added that he believes that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - had peaked.  ""We do see inflation moderating by the end of the year and that will lead to more moderated pricing our end. ""We've seen high volatility because of drought in Europe and rice shortages in India, as well as geopolitical issues so we've had a lot to contend with,"" he said, referring to the costs the company has to pay for raw materials. Supermarkets, who themselves have been accused of so-called ""greedflation"" - exploiting high inflation to increase their profits - have accused suppliers of hiking prices. So too have some trade unions. ""Unilever's profits are greedflation in action,"" said Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union. ""This isn't about the company shifting more stock - sales volumes have fallen."" But Mr Schumacher said: ""We have not passed inflation on to customers and as you can see we have felt higher costs through lower margins as a group."" A profit margin is calculated by taking away all the costs of doing business, such as wages and energy bills, from the total sales a company generates. Unilever's profit margin edged higher to 17.1% in the six months to June compared with a year ago, but is lower than margins seen pre-pandemic. In 2019 the figure hovered around 19% for the company. According to analyst Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at the stockbrokers Fidelity Investment, it is clear that higher prices are boosting Unilever's profits, particularly with sales volumes largely flat.  ""All in all, the cost of living is proving profitable for this global giant, with full-year underlying sales growth expected to beat forecasts,"" she added.  A recent investigation into grocers' pricing by the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, said it had found no evidence of profiteering by supermarkets but said it was important to keep the market ""under review"" and would now look into the wider supply chain.  Overall, Unilever's total turnover rose by 2.7% to €30.4bn.  The number of goods - or volume - that Unilever sold fell by 2.5% in the six months to the end of June but its prices rose by 11.2%. Only its personal care, and beauty and wellbeing divisions - which includes luxury make-up brands such as Hourglass - saw volumes rise over the six months.  Food costs have been one of the biggest drivers behind high UK inflation, which measures the pace at which prices are rising. In the year to June, food and soft drink price inflation slowed to 17.4% but remains close to historically high levels. Overall UK inflation eased to 7.9% in June, said the Office for National Statistics.  Last week, Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling cakes and Oxo stock cubes, said it believed recent input cost inflation was ""past its peak"". It added that it would not raise prices for the rest of the year."
