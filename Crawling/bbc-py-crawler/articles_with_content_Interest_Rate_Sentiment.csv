Interest Rate Sentiment,Why this US jobs report matters and what to watch,2024-09-14,2024-09-05,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyne60ln20o,"If you care about where the US economy is headed, you might want to keep an eye on events on Friday. At 08:30 ET (13.30 BST), the US Labor Department will release the results of its monthly jobs surveys of employers and households. The report is one of the most important gauges of the state of the world's largest economy - and it is coming at a critical time. The US presidential campaign, in which voters have identified the economy as a top concern, is under way. And after several years focused on inflation worries, attention is starting to turn to the job market. Last month, the Labor Department reported the unemployment rate had hit 4.3% in July, up from 3.5% a year earlier, as jobs growth slowed. The news helped to fuel several days of stock market turmoil. If Friday's report shows further cracks forming in the job market that would be bad news for Democrats, undermining the story they have been telling of an economy that is healthy, if slowing, and returning to sustainable growth, after a post-pandemic boom.  How much we should worry is still up for debate.  Such an increase in unemployment often signals an economic recession - but forecasters say that prediction is less certain this time, noting factors like a surge in immigration that have complicated the picture.  Other data suggest the rise in unemployment rate has been driven by more people looking for work, rather than a sharp rise in job cuts.  Friday's report will help to flesh out that puzzle, offering a key piece of evidence as voters' impressions start to cement ahead of the November vote.  Republicans have been keen to point to any bad news – a stock market stumble, lower growth figures, slowing business investment and a dip in hiring – as evidence that a change of leadership in Washington is necessary. Part of what has kept Democrats on the defensive about the economy is the unusual mix of forces at play right now.  The US central bank raised borrowing costs sharply two years ago, responding to prices that were jumping at the fastest rate since the 1980s.  The Federal Reserve said the moves - which brought its key lending rate to a roughly two decade high of 5.3% - would help get inflation under control.  But the way they do that is by discouraging business expansions and other big spending and dampening the pressures pushing up prices.  Put more simply, the Fed is deliberately slowing the economy. That often doesn't end well.  Historically, a big jump in rates typically ends in a recession - and the stock market has been jittery over any signs that the economy is headed for a ""hard landing"". Donald Trump has fanned the fears, for months predicting an economic ""crash"" - especially if his opponent is elected. Polls suggest a majority of Americans have already spent much of the last few years believing the economy is in recession - a downbeat assessment at odds with the country's 2.5% growth last year. Many analysts blame the disconnect on inflation, as households balk at prices that have jumped nearly 20% over four years.  But the urgency of that issue has abated, as wages rise and inflation subsides, dropping to 2.9% in the most recent official reading - the slowest pace since March 2021. That has set the stage for the Fed to lower interest rates for the first time in four years, which could bring further financial relief, leading to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, credit cards and other forms of debt. Friday's job report will be key to confirming the timing and size of the cut - and if it is actually likely to end up boosting sentiment and helping Democrats, as expected.  For now, most analysts expect a cut of 0.25 percentage points, which would signal an ongoing, orderly slowdown.  If the figures fuel worries about the economy, however, a bigger cut might be in order - though a cut driven by a stuttering economy and Americans losing jobs would hardly prove a benefit to Democrats.  Conversely, booming jobs numbers might make the bank rethink whether the economy is still running too hot and a cut is necessary at all.  That has left the Harris campaign in a peculiar position - hoping for a good jobs report, but not a great one.  In a closely watched speech last month, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell left his options for how big a cut might be on the table.  Friday's jobs report may start closing some doors. "
Interest Rate Sentiment,Slowest US inflation since 2021 raises rate cut hope,2024-09-14,2024-08-14,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3wy522dyo,"Consumer prices in the US rose at the slowest pace in more than three years last month, bolstering the case for the central bank to start cutting interest rates. Overall, prices rose 2.9% over the 12 months to July, the smallest annual increase since March 2021 and down from 3% in June, the Labor Department said.  The monthly inflation report was being closely watched after signs of weaker-than-expected jobs growth in July sparked stock market turmoil and recession fears earlier this month.  Analysts said the figures should help convince the Federal Reserve that high borrowing costs are working to return inflation back to normal, despite upticks in housing and food costs. The Federal Reserve has held its key lending rate at 5.3% - a roughly two-decade high - since July 2023, a move that has hit the public in the form of higher rates for mortgages, credit cards and other loans.  By keeping rates high, the bank is hoping to discourage borrowing and cool the demand pressures that were helping drive up prices of homes, cars and other items. But the central bank is under pressure to cut rates as inflation, which tracks the pace of price increases, has started to move closer to its 2% target rate, helped by lower oil prices and resolution of Covid-era supply chain crunches.  The three major stock indexes in the US were little changed after the report, which came in roughly as expected. Julian Howard, chief multi-asset investment strategist at GAM Investments, said a rate cut in September now looked ""all but certain"". But he said he thought the Fed would remain cautious about signalling the path ahead, pointing to last month's uptick in inflation in the UK, where the Bank of England recently cut rates. ""While the UK's higher-than-2% figure, was to an extent expected, it is still slightly jarring when inflation comes in higher than the target after a recent rate cut,"" he said.  ""Whatever the Fed does in September, it will be very keen to convey ongoing data dependency from one meeting to the next, rather than setting out a trajectory that might fail to materialise."" Inflation in the US has already receded significantly since June 2022, when it hit 9.1%. Over the past year, prices for appliances and cars have fallen, along with prices for other items such as airline tickets and furniture.  Petrol prices - a key determinant of economic sentiment in the US - have dropped 2.2%. But rising prices for household staples such as groceries have kept political pressure on the White House during a presidential election year, weighing on Democrats. Housing has accounted for more than 70% of inflation over the past year, as rents jumped more than 5%. Grocery prices also rose 1.1%, while car insurance has soared more than 18%. In a statement, President Joe Biden said the report showed ""progress fighting inflation and lowering costs for American households"", while the Trump campaign focused on the 20% rise in prices since 2021, calling the phenomenon ""Kamalanonics"", after election rival vice-president Kamala Harris. On Wall Street, the figures left investors divided about how much the Fed should cut rates in September - whether by 0.25 percentage points or more. Wells Fargo analysts said they were betting on the Fed moving more aggressively to cut rates, despite the acceleration in rents in July. ""Through the see-saw ride of recent monthly prints, the moderation in core inflation has broadened beyond goods, with services inflation—most notably housing—also cooling over the past year,"" economists led by Sarah House wrote.  ""The continued steady slowdown in inflation, when paired with the rise in the unemployment rate and deterioration in other labor market indicators, leads us to believe the [Fed] will want to move quickly."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,UK economy continues recovery with 0.6% growth ,2024-09-14,2024-08-15,Dearbail Jordan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq82y55jg35o,"The UK's economy grew by 0.6% between April and June as it continued its recovery from the recession at the end of last year. The latest figure was in line with forecasts and follows a 0.7% increase in the first three months of this year. Growth was led by the services sector, in particular the IT industry, legal services and scientific research. Services are the biggest contributor to the UK's economy, far outstripping manufacturing and construction, both of which saw output fall between April and June. ""The UK economy has now grown strongly for two quarters, following the weakness we saw in the second half of last year,” said Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics, which released the figures. Last year, the UK economy fell into a shallow and short-lived recession. A recession is defined as economic activity shrinking for two three-month periods – or quarters – in a row. While gross domestic product (GDP) - a key measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments and people - expanded over the latest quarter, growth was flat in June. While the services sector helped economic expansion over the three months, it was a drag on the performance in June alone. Strike action by junior doctors affected growth. NHS England reported that 61,989 appointments were cancelled because of industrial action by junior doctors between 27 June and 2 July. Economists also warned that growth might slow in the second half of 2024. Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said businesses were reporting modest activity for the summer months ""no doubt affected by still high interest rates"". Earlier in August, the Bank of England trimmed interest rates to 5% in its first cut for four years.  “The challenge for government is to firmly lift the UK’s growth performance out of the doldrums,"" said Ms Leach. ""There’re no quick fixes here: we’ll need the government to follow-through on its manifesto commitments to set and stick with long-term infrastructure investment plans."" The economy was a key battleground in the general election which Labour won in a landslide after 14 years of a Conservative government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer pledged to take “take the brakes off Britain” and in the King’s Speech announced a number of plans, including changes to the planning system to make it easier to build houses and infrastructure. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""The new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited after more than a decade of low economic growth."" But shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt said that the GDP figures ""are yet further proof that Labour have inherited a growing and resilient economy"". Activity in the manufacturing sector was mixed in the three months to June. While  it was down overall during the quarter, there was growth in June.  Matthew Knight, commercial manager at RNA, a Birmingham-based firm which designs and make automation equipment, told the BBC: ""Business is very good, we’re very busy. We can sell into different countries, if one area or country isn’t doing well, we can sell into another."" He said that business is picking up. ""Interest rates falling might have something to do with it, because a lot of customers finance the equipment RNA makes, rather than purchasing it direct,"" he said. The ONS data also revealed that output from the construction sector dipped by 0.1% between April and June as new building declined, though repair and maintenance work grew. The ONS said that the pace of decline in the sector was easing, but a survey of businesses conducted by the Bank of England found that “any improving sentiment is not expected to translate to activity until later this year”. Construction could be boosted if the Bank cuts interest rates again this year. This week, new inflation data revealed that the rate had increased to 2.2% in the year to July. That is higher than the Bank of England's 2% inflation target. However, inflation in the services sector - which the Bank also looks at when deciding on interest rates - continued to ease.  Capital Economics said that although the services sector grew between April and June ""recent strength of activity won’t prevent further falls in services inflation"". It said it expects to the Bank to cut interest rates twice more this year to 4.5%. What is GDP and how does it affect me? What is a recession and how could it affect me? When will interest rates come down?"
Interest Rate Sentiment,Aberdeen Union Street occupancy improves to pre-Covid level,2024-09-14,2024-08-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5nn6le10eo,"Shop occupancy figures on what was once Aberdeen's flagship shopping street has improved back to pre-Covid levels, according to a new survey. Union Street was once Aberdeen's main retail hub, but since 2009 faced competition from the Union Square complex with shops, restaurants and a cinema.  Commercial property expert Richard Noble said from August the street level vacancy rate was down to 18%, back to where it was in February 2020.  He told BBC Scotland News this was a ""pleasant surprise"". Mr Noble is with FG Burnett, a property consultancy based in Aberdeen. “Since 2020 we have seen the percentage rise from 18% to 25%, peaking in November 2022,"" he said of the vacancy rate. ""Since that time the number of empty units has gradually been falling from a high of 48 to 34."" He cited factors including a ""gradual improvement in sentiment"" since the pandemic, and a more flexible approach from landlords in relation to rent, incentives and lease duration. Mr Noble described an empty shops grant scheme launched by the city council last year as ""crucial"".  It was revealed last month that 10 new businesses have been helped to open on Union Street in the first year of the project. The £195,000 fund covers up to 50% percent of the project costs. He said it was accepted that Union Street does not look as it did in its ""heyday"", changing from being the city’s main retail thoroughfare, and would continue to evolve. Mr Noble said he was feeling more “optimistic”. He explained: ""Given the success of the empty shops grant scheme, if a similar scheme could be introduced for upper floors that might encourage developers to show a bit more interest in these upper floors, then I think that would be money well spent. ""I think that would be an easy win."" He added: ""I would emphasise there’s still an awful long way to go. And I think the public realm still needs to improve quite dramatically. Whether that’s street furniture, planting or cleanliness of the street - there’s a lot to do on that front."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,"High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide",2024-09-14,2024-07-01,Nick Edser,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp081z9vre4o,"High mortgage rates mean affordability is still ""stretched"" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been ""broadly stable"" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now £266,064, the lender said. Prices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been ""broadly flat"" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are ""still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic"". ""For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. ""As a result, housing affordability is still stretched."" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south. Despite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is  5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. ""Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,"" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. ""Either way, we’re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism."" Last week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about £180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to £1.2bn in May, from £2.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.

Interest Rate Sentiment,Keeping a lid on the cost of coffee as prices rise,2024-09-14,2024-05-09,Felicity Evans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd8lnn4jqwo,"A painter and decorator turned cafe owner has said it is still a big challenge to keep prices affordable for customers. Lee Howard has run Forty Six Coffee Shop in Neath for about 10 years with his wife Guiliana, but a combination of rising prices and an increase in the minimum wage has seen their cost pressures rise. Although the rate of price rises has slowed a lot from the 40-year high in October 2022, prices are still increasing above the Bank of England’s target of 2%. On Thursday, the Bank of England announced that interest rates would remain at 5.25%, the highest level for 16 years. ""We had to give our staff [an extra] 10% in April this year,"" said Mr Howard. “That, on top of everything else, has been the most difficult thing to incorporate really.” The impact of last month's increase in the National Living Wage from £10.42 to £11.44 an hour is one of the things rate setters at the Bank of England will consider before making their announcement. Interest rates affect the cost of borrowing money and have a big impact on mortgages. They are currently at a 16-year high of 5.25%, pushing up costs for anyone who wants to get a mortgage or re-mortgage an existing deal. The bank raised interest rates to slow down inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, but increases in wages can lead to higher prices if employers pass on the additional costs to customers. While it may be hard on small businesses like his, Mr Howard acknowledges the wage increase does help his staff, most of whom are renting, which is ""extremely expensive"", or living with family. One of those is Oliver Altissimo, who is working at the coffee shop while studying computer game design at university. The 23-year-old is keeping his costs down by living with his grandfather but the cost of living still affects him. “I did notice a lot of stuff increasing in prices and it gets harder and harder,” he said. That is a sentiment echoed by many customers. Adriana lost her job as a language teacher when her department was closed down during the pandemic, though she said she feels “blessed” that her husband is still in work. Her friend Anne, a retired teacher, said she was “a lucky person” to have her pension but she has noticed things are “going up all the time”. “They don’t just go up by a penny or two pennies, they go up 10p or 20p or 50p,” she said. “It maybe slowing down a bit, but I don’t think it’s noticeable really.” Despite the financial pressures on customers, Mr Howard said his diverse clientele remained loyal, though some treat their coffee as ""more of a luxury"" than a daily staple. ""The retirees, they're OK,"" he said. ""But the youngsters who are struggling to get a mortgage or just trying to get on the ladder, you might see them now once a fortnight rather than week-to-week."" "
Interest Rate Sentiment,"Mortgage demand holding up for now, says Nationwide",2024-09-14,2023-06-30,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66063591,"The number of mortgage applications has not declined yet despite interest rates rising to the highest level in 15 years, Nationwide has said. However, the building society said the sharp increase in borrowing costs was likely to cause a ""significant drag"" on activity in the housing market. Nationwide's latest data revealed house prices dropped 3.5% in the year to June, the largest fall since 2009. The Bank of England has raised interest rates in an attempt to slow inflation. The Bank's base rate, which usually dictates the borrowing costs of lenders, is at 5%.  Rob Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, told the BBC's Today programme that mortgage repayments were now taking up almost 40% of people's average take home pay compared to 30% previously. However, although the cost of borrowing money over longer terms had risen, it had ""yet to have the same negative impact on sentiment"", Mr Gardner said in Nationwide's latest report. ""For example, the number of mortgage applications has not yet declined and indicators of consumer confidence have continued to improve, though they remain below long run averages."" Figures from the Bank of England showed that despite higher rates for mortgage deals, approvals increased from 49,000 in April to 50,500 in May. Approvals for remortgaging also saw a rise from 32,500 to 33,600 during the same period. The impact of higher interest rates on mortgage holders is more gradual compared to previous times, as the majority of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals. Only 15% of mortgage holders are on deals linked to variable rates - compared to 70% 20 years ago. Mr Gardner said 85% of the stock of outstanding mortgages were fixed, but warned 400,000 fixed-rate borrowers would be refinancing every three months.  With mortgage rates hitting 6% for a two-year deal, Mr Gardner said a typical monthly payment would rise by £385. ""Clearly this represents a significant increase, but those borrowers were stress-tested at interest rates above those now prevailing in the market to ensure they could cope with such an increase,"" he said. Mr Gardner said providing the jobs market and interest rates perform ""broadly as expected"", the UK was ""unlikely to see the waves of forced selling which would probably be required to result in a more disorderly adjustment to the housing market"".    However, Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said remortgagers ""face potentially disastrous rises in their monthly payments"". ""The new rules will mean people can make a temporary change to their mortgage to get them through the next six months, but there will be those who can't see any light at the end of the tunnel, and sell up,"" she said. But Ms Coles said there was ""still hope"" that inflation could ease and then mortgage rates would fall.   Nationwide said all regions, except from Northern Ireland, saw annual house prices fall. London saw a 4.3% year-on-year decline, while the North West saw prices down 4.1% year-on-year. Read more here"
Interest Rate Sentiment,Global shares fall as growth fears rattle investors,2024-09-14,2022-05-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61497817,"Fears about rising prices and slowing economies have spread to UK and European stock markets following sharp falls in the US and Asia. The FTSE 100 index of leading companies sank 1.8% on Thursday while the main stock markets in France and Germany also saw declines.       On Wednesday, US shares recorded their biggest one-day drop since the early days of the Covid pandemic in 2020.  Markets were spooked by gloomy forecasts from major US retailers. Countries are also grappling with steep rises in inflation - the UK's reached a 40-year high of 9% in April - and there are concerns that some economies are heading for a slowdown as interest rates are increased in an attempt to counter price rises. ""A red wall of worry has built up across financial markets with investors increasingly nervous that economies are set to career into recession,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The downbeat news from US retailers hit shares in UK companies reliant on consumer spending. The UK's biggest retailer, Tesco, fell 1.8%, while shares in consumer goods giant Unilever dropped nearly 1%. However, the biggest faller on the UK market was Royal Mail, which sank more than 12% after reporting disappointing results and warning it was facing ""significant headwinds"" from rising costs. The FTSE 100 closed 135 points lower at 7,302.7, while France's Cac-40 index and Germany's Dax dropped by 1.3% and 0.9% respectively. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei index closed down 1.9%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 2.5%. That came after the S&P 500 index in the US, which tracks shares of a wide swathe of America's biggest companies, plunged more than 4% on Wednesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4.7%. The falls added to weeks of declines on US financial markets.  The steep falls on US markets came after retail chain Target said unexpectedly high fuel and freight costs had cut into profits, which halved compared with a year ago.  It also said that as prices rise, shoppers are spending more on essentials and cutting back on discretionary items, such as television sets and clothing. Target's comments followed a similarly downbeat update from rival Walmart earlier in the week. ""What people are worried about after seeing Target is, will more earnings [estimates] have to be taken down?"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital in New York.  ""Consumer sentiment is at multi-year lows and tied at the hip with inflation. So people are looking for signs of inflation moderating, and Target did not give them any today."" Target's update sent its shares plunging 25% - the biggest decline in more than three decades. Official US government data recently showed retail sales rose a healthy 0.9% in April, but some analysts have warned the figures may be understating signs of slowdown - especially for lower-income families - since they are not adjusted for inflation. Earlier this year, Amazon reported a surprise drop in online sales in the first three months of the year."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Finland basic income 'did not help jobless',2024-09-14,2019-02-08,By Ashitha Nagesh,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47169549,"Giving jobless people in Finland a basic income for two years did not lead them to find work, researchers said. From January 2017 until December 2018, 2,000 unemployed Finns got a monthly flat payment of €560 (£490; $634). The aim was to see if a guaranteed safety net would help people find jobs, and support them if they had to take insecure gig economy work. While employment levels did not improve, participants said they felt happier and less stressed. When it launched the pilot scheme back in 2017, Finland became the first European country to test out the idea of an unconditional basic income. It was run by the Social Insurance Institution (Kela), a Finnish government agency, and involved 2,000 randomly-selected people on unemployment benefits. It immediately attracted international interest - but these results have now raised questions about the effectiveness of such schemes. Universal basic income, or UBI, means that everyone gets a set monthly income, regardless of means. The Finnish trial was a bit different, as it focused on people who were unemployed. Another popular variation is 'universal basic services' - where instead of getting an income, things like education, healthcare and transport are free for all. Although it's enjoying a resurgence in popularity, the idea isn't new. In fact, it was first described in Sir Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516 - a full 503 years ago.  Such schemes are being trialled all over the world. Adults in a village in western Kenya are being given $22 a month for 12 years, until 2028, while the Italian government is working on introducing a ""citizens' income"". The city of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, is also carrying out a basic income study called Weten Wat Werkt - ""Know What Works"" - until October. Supporters of basic income often believe an unconditional safety net can help people out of poverty, by giving them the time to apply for jobs or learn essential new skills. This is seen as increasingly important in the age of automation - that is, put very simply, as robots take people's jobs. Miska Simanainen, one of the Kela researchers behind the Finnish study, tells BBC News that this was what their government had wanted to test, in order ""to see if it would be a way of reforming the social security system"". That depends what you mean by 'work'. Did it help unemployed people in Finland find jobs, as the centre-right Finnish government had hoped? No, not really. Mr Simanainen says that while some individuals found work, they were no more likely to do so than a control group of people who weren't given the money. They are still trying to work out exactly why this is, for the final report that will be published in 2020. But for many people, the original goal of getting people into work was flawed to begin with. If instead the aim were to make people generally happier, the scheme would have been considered a triumph. One participant, former newspaper editor Tuomas, pretty much summed this up when he told BBC News about how the basic income had affected him.  ""I am still without a job,"" he explained. ""I can't say that the basic income has changed a lot in my life. OK, psychologically yes, but financially - not so much."" UBI is one of those rare issues that attracts equally strong support - and criticism - from all parts of the political spectrum. For a lot of people on the left, UBI focuses too heavily on individuals' personal wealth and buying power - or rather, their lack of it - without doing anything to stop companies wasting resources by producing far more stuff than people need, and over-working their employees in the process. Economics writer Grace Blakely makes this point in the New Socialist, adding that ""without fundamental structural reforms to our economic system, UBI will only be a sticking plaster papering over the cracks"". Others worry that basic income will be used to cut costs, by setting the rate too low and slashing other, means-tested benefits.  Meanwhile, many on the political right and centre worry about the exact opposite - that UBI would be too expensive to implement, and would encourage a ""something for nothing"" culture. Ulrich Spiesshofer, chief executive of ABB engineering company, echoed this sentiment in 2016 when he told the Financial Times that ""economic rewards [for people] should be based on actually creating economic value"". Researchers from Kela are now busy analysing all of their results, to figure out what else - if anything - they can tell us about basic income's uses and shortcomings. Mr Simanainen says that he doesn't like to think of the trial as having ""failed"". From his point of view, ""this is not a failure or success - it is a fact, and [gives us] new information that we did not have before this experiment""."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Indyref speculation 'nonsense' - Sturgeon,2024-09-14,2017-06-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40263711,"Scotland's first minister has branded speculation about the impact of the general election on her plans for an independence referendum as ""nonsense"". In a series of tweets, Nicola Sturgeon said she would set out the way forward ""in due course after talking to people across the SNP"". And she insisted she would take decisions in the best interests of Scotland, and not just her party.  She later faced calls at Holyrood later to abandon her plans for a referendum.  Opposition MSPs used a debate on the economy to argue that the continuing prospect of another referendum independence would cause damaging uncertainty for businesses - but their motions calling for it to be shelved were defeated in a vote.  Scottish government ministers, who did not discuss an independence referendum in their first cabinet meeting since the election, argued that the main threat to the economy is Brexit.  Ms Sturgeon attended a meeting on SNP MSPs in the Scottish Parliament ahead of the debate on Wednesday afternoon.  She has written a letter to the prime minister in which she argues that new Brexit proposals are ""urgently needed"" to end the ""confusion surrounding the UK's position"" with less than a week to go until talks with the EU are due to begin.  She repeats her calls for Scotland and the UK to remain in both the single market and the customs union, for the UK's devolved administrations to be involved in the Brexit negotiating team, and for the rights of EU citizens living in the UK to be guaranteed. She says that the Scottish government's Scotland's Place in Europe document, which was published in December, provides a blueprint for the way forward for the whole of the UK. Ms Sturgeon has previously said she will ""reflect carefully"" on her plans for an independence referendum after the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election, but has conceded that her call for a second vote on leaving the UK was a factor in the result. In March, she called for a referendum to be held either towards the end of next year or the spring of the following year, ""when the terms of Brexit are known"", but it was rejected by the UK government.  But there have been reports since the election that Ms Sturgeon was planning to ""rebrand"" the independence referendum as a vote on the finalised UK Brexit deal. SNP MEP Alyn Smith told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Wednesday morning that any future referendum ""would be on the terms of Brexit set against independence"". A short time later, the first minister tweeted that much of the media speculation about the implications of the election result for her referendum plans was ""nonsense"".  She added: ""I'll set out way forward in due course after talking to people across @theSNP. ""I'll take decisions in best interests, not just of @theSNP, but of Scotland...and not be dictated to by demands for quick headlines!"" She went on to say that her government would focus on trying to influence Brexit talks - and repeated her claim that a ""Tory led hard Brexit is simply not acceptable"" in the wake of the election result.  Ms Sturgeon later told BBC Scotland that she would not be ""rushed into knee-jerk decisions"" on a referendum, and that the immediate focus should be on the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  Will the SNP abandon independence? No. Will they abandon a referendum as the conduit through which independence is achieved? Absolutely not.  So what are they doing? Well, they may need to change the nature of the language.  I think they feel that they didn't get across sufficiently the point that the referendum they want on independence is at the end of the Brexit process. They kept saying: ""When the prime minister says there shouldn't be a referendum now, we agree"". So I think they will try and re-emphasise that. That will not be sufficient for their pro-Union opponents, who will say they don't care how it is rebranded or that it is being placed in contradistinction to Brexit - it is not wanted and it is not needed. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who saw the number of Scottish Tory MPs rise from one to 13, has claimed that the SNP's losses in the election meant that ""Indyref2 is dead"". Her party has accused Ms Sturgeon of having ""given up representing Scotland and is now focused solely on her discredited and unwanted plan to drag us back to a second referendum"" and of ""turning a tin ear to everyone outside the SNP who just want a break from her political games"". And Labour said that Scotland ""won't be fooled by Nicola Sturgeon's desperate plan to rebrand her divisive referendum"". In what was first formal chance for MSPs to debate the general election result, the Tories, Labour and Liberal Democrats  called on the SNP to shelve plans for another referendum.  The Holyrood debate on ""opportunities for growth"" followed publication of the State of the Economy report by the Scottish government's chief economist. The report confirmed growth overall in Scotland during 2016 of 0.4%, which was ""below trend and expectation"". The oil and gas sector downturn continued to affect the economy last year, though there are emerging signs of confidence returning to the industry, the report found. Meanwhile, Scotland's labour market has ""remained resilient"", with unemployment below the UK figure and falling over the past year. The report states: ""Brexit continues to present a significant risk to business and consumer sentiment in Scotland with investment sensitive to changing market signals. ""It also presents the greatest source of uncertainty for the outlook particularly beyond 2018. The range of independent forecasts for 2017 suggest growth of between 0.9% and 1.3% for Scotland."" Economy Secretary Keith Brown said there was no doubt that the dip in oil and gas prices in recent years has had ""a continuing effect on the Scottish economy"". The minister said uncertainty around Brexit was the main concern for business leaders, while the ""very rapid"" depreciation in the price of oil and gas has had a major effect. But Mr Brown said there were signs of returning confidence and development activity in the North Sea, and pointed out that Scotland now has a lower unemployment rate than the UK as a whole. He told the Good Morning Scotland programme: ""What we are now seeing with Brexit is the push up in inflation, the impact that is having on people's lives in terms of wages. ""So that's the challenge we have now - but we have kept many people in employment throughout the recession and subsequent Brexit uncertainty."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Businesses braced for cuts as energy prices soar,2024-09-14,2022-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-60310713,"One in five Scottish companies expect to reduce operations this year due to the increase in energy prices. A new report also reveals that only 7% of firms are expecting strong growth during the next 12 months. And inflationary pressures mean 80% of businesses anticipate the prices of their goods and services will increase in the year ahead. Other challenges include the ongoing impact of Covid and both attracting and retaining staff. Wholesale gas prices have been rising sharply over the last few months, which meant the regulator Ofgem was last week obliged to announce a rise in the cap that limits the amount companies can charge consumers. The higher cap means a typical household will pay £1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. Last Thursday the Bank of England increased interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% to try to dampen the pace of price rises over the longer term but it said inflation could still reach 7.25% in April. The results of the latest Addleshaw Goddard Scottish Business Monitor report found that all sectors reported positive net balances for the third consecutive quarter. It also found that all core business indicators, barring export activity, remained optimistic throughout 2021. But the report, produced in partnership with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute, said more than half of Scottish businesses were finding it difficult to source the goods and services they required. And more than 80% were struggling to recruit the staff they needed, while almost a quarter were also finding it difficult to retain their own people. Mairi Spowage, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said: ""These results show us that despite the reintroduction of some restrictions over the Christmas period, business optimism remained throughout the final quarter of 2021. ""However, inflationary pressures and rising energy prices are a concern for firms.  ""Growing uncertainty throughout global supply chains is also causing problems for businesses across all sectors, particularly those in industries such as manufacturing."" Ms Spowage also highlighted the recruitment difficulties experienced by firms in the current climate. But she added: ""It is positive to see the lasting effects that COP26 has had on business attitudes, with the majority continuing to signal their commitment to reaching their net-zero targets. ""Businesses continue to see the opportunities and rise to the challenges of incorporating more sustainable practices, with more firms now putting the onus on suppliers to meet sustainable requirements."" David Kirchin, head of Scotland at Addleshaw Goddard, said: ""As we gradually move away from the major restraints brought on by the pandemic, these latest results show that Scottish firms expect business volume to increase.  ""However, they also see challenges ahead, whether linked to rising energy prices, supply-chain challenges or the hiring and retention of people."" More than 400 businesses responded to the latest survey in December and January, from across the Scottish economy.  It examined business sentiment in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the outlook and expectations for the coming months."
Interest Rate Sentiment,How Covid has changed where we want to live,2024-09-14,2021-03-19,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56359865,"Wanted: a place by the sea to call home, with plenty of space, a garage and a garden. The coronavirus pandemic has changed the kind of property we want to buy or rent but, as lockdown restrictions ease, there are signs of a return to the old priorities. Cornwall has overtaken London this year as the most searched for location on Rightmove, according to analysis by the property portal for the BBC. Neighbouring Devon sits in third, and Dorset has risen from 20th to 10th. Many have turned a long-term plan to escape to the country into a short-term reality. Although the market slowed considerably during the height of the Covid outbreak, sales then lifted at a faster rate in rural areas, Rightmove says. The popularity of a rural or coastal life, confidence in improving broadband, and the attraction of indoor and outdoor space are linked directly to the lifestyle lockdowns have forced upon most people in the last year.  Consider too that the word ""garage"" was the most popular keyword on property searches on the portal in the last nine months, providing more evidence of the shifting sentiment. This appears to have been driven by owners wanting to convert a garage into a permanent office, to allow them to work from home, or into a gym or workshop. It may be old-fashioned, but some may actually want to park their car in it. Dreams of a more secluded lifestyle led to a huge rise in interest in areas such as the Isle of Skye, Braemar in the Cairngorms National Park, and coastal areas of Devon and East Sussex. But it is Cornwall that has led these seaside property searches, and specifically Truro and Looe. Among those looking, and then moving, during the pandemic months was Marshall Moore. The 50-year-old spent the last 15 years living in the mega-cities of Seoul and Hong Kong before moving to just outside Truro. ""It is such a relief. It is gorgeous and cultural and, in some ways, like San Francisco - but with more wind,"" says Mr Moore, an American academic who teaches creative writing. He was given the chance to move owing to his job, but is clear about the benefits of the location. ""There is openness, space, fresh air, it is calm and there's the mild weather,"" he says. ""We can also afford to live in an actual house rather than an apartment. I feel incredibly lucky."" He is now waiting for his husband to join him, and they have plans to buy. He is renting in the meantime but was shocked by the shortage of properties available. That is no surprise to Emma Ward, of Cornwall estate agents Goundrys. ""We've had our best year in a long time. There haven't been enough hours in the day,"" she says. ""This was even busier than the peak of the market in 2007."" She says older people are moving closer to family, younger buyers are looking for a good place to start a family, and undoubtedly people have been moving out of the big cities of London, Bristol, Birmingham and Manchester. ""There are lots of people coming here to buy, because they know they'll only need to go to London once or twice a month,"" she says. The homes she says are high in demand, but low in supply are four to five-bedroom detached houses, costing between £500,000 and £700,000. That is backed up by the Rightmove data, which reveals that five-bedroom detached homes have seen the biggest rise in sales in the last year. Stamp duty holidays may have helped financially, but socially the inspiration includes more room, space away from neighbours, and working from home. Rightmove's director of property data Tim Bannister says: ""More space has always been the most common reason for people moving home, but the evolution for many from balancing their laptop on the end of a bed last March to making an office a permanent addition to a home has led to a need for even bigger homes than before."" That has also been seen among tenants. Demand for rental properties has clearly shifted away from city-centre flats to two-bedroom houses, preferably with a garden. That has led to a double-digit fall in rent for central London flats, Rightmove says, but increases of between 15% and 20% outside of big cities - in towns such as Bury and Halifax.  Renters can be more nimble, often moving at shorter notice and with less upheaval than buyers.  With lockdown restrictions lifting, and businesses making plans to bring people back to workplaces, there are signs of tenants moving back into London, to take advantage of lower rents. Rightmove says renters are now searching for more in central zones one and two, compared with greater demand in zone three in August. Emma Ward, of Goundrys in Cornwall, expects a gradual return in demand for city dwelling among buyers too. ""This [boom] won't go on forever,"" she says. That may bring some relief to Bob McLaughlin, who had long-held plans to retire to the South West of England ""aboard my little yacht"". He did make the move a few months ago, renting a flat in Devon while still working. ""Prices have gone up noticeably,"" he says. ""They are on the edge of my affordability."" Part of the reason for rising prices, he says, are people buying second homes in the region. ""It may price me out of the market, but it makes housing unaffordable for a lot of people,"" he says. In the end, it may mean price trumps lifestyle among those considering where they want to live."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Are the rules which have stopped nuclear war broken?,2024-09-14,2019-03-14,By Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-47553876,"""We are moving in a minefield, and we don't know from where the explosion will come.""  A warning from former Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov delivered at this week's influential Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference in Washington DC.  Former US senator and long-time arms control activist Sam Nunn echoed the sentiment. ""If the US, Russia and China don't work together,"" he argued, ""it is going to be a nightmare for our children and grandchildren."" He urged the present leaders to emulate the approach taken by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev towards the end of the Cold War, and to rally around the premise that nuclear war cannot be won, and must therefore never be considered.  Mr Reagan dreamed of missile-proof ballistic missile defences, but also came close to negotiating a comprehensive nuclear disarmament deal with his Russian counterpart Mr Gorbachev. His endeavours led to the Start Treaty, which scaled back the two nuclear superpowers' cache of weapons. Today the future of that treaty's successor - the so-called ""New Start agreement"" - is in doubt. The intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty has collapsed, after the US and then Russia suspended participation. US President Donald Trump insists that Russia has broken the agreement for years, and has now deployed battalions of ground-launched cruise missiles that breach its terms.  Russian President Vladimir Putin denies this, but Nato colleagues have backed Washington. Nonetheless, many US allies are unhappy with Mr Trump's whole approach to international affairs, as was apparent at the conference. Germany's ambassador to the US, Emily Haber, pointed to the ""erosion of the system of rules"" which had previously regulated the international system.  She noted the extensive use of economic sanctions to punish a country's past behaviour rather than shape its future conduct, a reference perhaps to US sanctions against Russia in the wake of its 2015 seizure of Crimea.  This is a complex business.  Ms Haber did not simply condemn the Trump administration, despite obvious tensions between the US president and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  She also cited a variety of provocations from Mr Putin, which she said have eroded trust and diplomatic process.  Many conference speakers stressed that it was not simply that the old arms control edifice was crumbling; nor that wider tensions between the nuclear superpowers were growing.  It was not even just the challenges posed by a rising and more assertive China or growing rivalries between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. They fear something new and dangerous is looming.  Just as the old arms control order is collapsing, novel high-tech challenges are already here. Consider highly accurate conventional missiles flying at hypersonic speeds, cyber-weapons, the potential militarisation of space, the impact of artificial intelligence, and so on.  The whole warning system on which deterrence rests could be undermined.  As Mr Nunn put it: ""In this new era, we are much more likely to have war by blunder or miscalculation - by interference from third parties - than from a deliberate premeditated attack."" This was not a conference to raise the spirits. Its message was profoundly depressing.  Could the INF treaty be resurrected, perhaps in a wider context to bring in China? Forget it.  Andrea Thompson, US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, made it clear that China had indicated no interest in such a deal.  Can the New Start treaty - the cornerstone of US-Russia nuclear disarmament - be saved?  Time is short. It expires in early February 2021. And although presentations from senior US and Russian officials acknowledged its utility, there was little enthusiasm for any extension.  New Start should not be written off yet. But it may become a casualty of the wider hostile climate between Washington and Moscow.  Nor was there good news for the conference on another tenet of Mr Trump's diplomacy - the promised nuclear deal with North Korea. At the Hanoi summit, Mr Trump went for a grand bargain with Pyongyang.  But his North Korean counterpart was only prepared to sacrifice a small part of his country's nuclear programme, demanding in return, a full-scale lifting of economic sanctions. Mr Trump chose to walk away. Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for North Korea, was clear. The Trump administration's line has toughened - perhaps under the influence of National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.   But for all Mr Biegun's efforts to paint the president's gambit as coherent and credible, there is no consensus on where US policy towards North Korea is heading, nor when, where - or even if - this diplomatic odd couple might meet next.  Something worrying is afoot.  As Ms Thompson noted, the rate of technological progress is not being matched by the rate of policy formulation. ""How,"" she asked, can you elaborate ""rules of responsible behaviour"" in this climate? Many shared her concern.  If treaties limiting old-style weapons are unravelling, how much harder will it be to agree measures to control new ones? Is the era of traditional arms control over?  There was a broad sense - from Russians, Europeans and many Americans alike - that a dialogue on strategic stability between Washington and Moscow is urgently needed. That will not be easy given the ongoing Mueller probe into the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election, or Mr Putin's actions in Syria and Ukraine.  At the height of the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union threatened each other with mutual destruction.  That produced a system of treaties and understandings, but it seems that old rule book has now been thrown out.  Old enmities are back, and could be more dangerous than ever, given the apparent lack of any mechanism or willingness to manage these expanding tensions.  "
Interest Rate Sentiment,"Skinner on his idol, friend & team-mate",2024-09-14,2020-07-19,Callum Skinner,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/53456822,"Throughout July, BBC Scotland's Sporting Nation series is reflecting on some of the greatest feats and personalities from Scottish sporting history. Here we look at Chris Hoy, a six-time Olympic cycling champion. No Briton has won more Olympic gold medals than Chris Hoy Chris Hoy may not have been with us on the track in Rio when Team GB beat New Zealand to win Olympic gold in the 2016 team sprint, but he still played an important role in our success. The evening before our Games got under way, Chris came to the athletes village for dinner. Morale at that point was not high. We had finished sixth at the World Championships and one leading bookmaker had us at 22/1 to win gold. At that stage, I think we would have been delighted with bronze. ""You know what boys,"" Chris said to us, ""you're going to do it again, you're going to win and the rest of the world will be left scratching their heads wondering how the hell you've done it.""  The cynic in me thought ""the sport has moved on a bit mate, it's a nice sentiment, but I don't think so."" His words sparked something in us, though. He lit a flicker of hope in the team. The next day, in the first round of qualifying, we went out and straight off the bat we set a new Olympic record. And from then on we all believed what Chris had told us - we were in it to win it. Chris not only sparked my interest in cycling when I watched him on TV winning Olympic and Commonwealth medals for Great Britain and Scotland, he cemented it. I had a choice to make between cycling and rugby, and it was Chris' visits to see us at the old Meadowbank Velodrome that convinced me my future lay on the track. He was my hero, but he was accessible. My journey with Chris has gone from worshipping him from afar, to getting to know him, to becoming his friend and team-mate. The way he comes across in the media, you can tell he is just a genuinely nice guy, but when you get to know him in person - and he probably won't like me saying this - you find a deeper level to him and it's actually quite special to be let into that world.  We became a lot closer when I moved down to train alongside him in Manchester in 2008. He was coming off the back of his extraordinary performance at the Beijing Olympics, where he had won three golds.  I remember our coach saying to me at the time: ""Don't waste this opportunity, you're surrounded by the best athletes in the world."" And Chris takes it to a new level in terms of being a model athlete. Sleep, diet, preparation, training, recovery - everything he does has to be perfect.  On the few occasions I was given the opportunity to chase him in training it felt like a major event, it was really special for me. Hoy won three gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics He taught me that being an athlete is not just about being successful on the track. It's about what you can give back to the younger generation, how you can put your influence to the greatest use, what you can do to help towards facilities, funding and all the things that will help make it that little bit easier for the next wave coming through. Britain's top young cyclists now come into an elite performance environment, but that was not what Chris found when he was starting out. The advent of lottery funding undoubtedly helped, but it was the performances of the likes of Chris, Jason Queally and Craig MacLean that started the golden streak for British cycling that continues to this day. That may well be his greatest accomplishment. His greatest race? He may have his own view, but the one that stands out for me is the one that most people would automatically think of - the keirin final of London 2012.  The pressure going into that race was enormous. History was waiting for him if he could get the job done - a sixth Olympic gold that would make him Britain's most successful Olympian. It was by no means a textbook race from a tactical perspective, but I would rate it as one of the most impressive rides from a physical perspective I have ever seen.  You've got the German Maximilian Levy, one of the best riders the sport has ever seen, come onto his hip on the final lap. Knowing the sport and watching that race, I know that is probably the most dangerous position you could possibly be in.  If Levy had managed to pass Chris it would have been game over, he might not even have picked up a medal of any colour. I can't tell you how many times I've been in that position and lost. But Chris found something within himself to hold off this massive attack at the pivotal moment and power to the line. The guy just does not give up. The keirin is not a timed event so you can't point to it being a world record or an Olympic record, but to me that was a record-breaking performance.  When you're in a hole and things seem to be slipping away at the crucial moment, the marginal gains and all that other stuff we talk about goes out the window. It's about sheer grit, and only the truly special athletes can find that little bit extra when the stakes are at their absolute highest. It's illustrative of greatness.  Hoy won gold medals for Scotland at the 2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games There's a big attraction in sport towards those who go back and win again and again, whether it's Tiger Woods, Lewis Hamilton, the New England Patriots in the NFL. Those who have been written off for being too old, told they're past it, lost their form or struggled with injuries, but always come back and find a way to win. It merits so much respect.  Chris is up there as one of, if not the greatest sportsman Scotland and Britain has produced. With us both being Scottish, from the same part of Edinburgh, starting out at the same club, I had to live with the 'Next Chris Hoy' tag from a young age. But the truth is there can only ever be one Chris Hoy. Having replaced him on the team after his retirement, I was just delighted I was able to help continue the British golden streak of Olympic success he started when we claimed that gold in Rio. With a little help from the great man himself, of course.  Callum Skinner was speaking to BBC Scotland's Andy Burke. British Cycling Team Ineos International Cycling Union"
Interest Rate Sentiment,Bitcoin prices fall to lowest in months,2024-09-14,2022-01-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59907864,"Bitcoin prices have fallen to their lowest level in months following remarks from the US Federal Reserve. The crypto-currency dropped in value from $47,000 (£34,700) earlier this week to less than $42,000 (£31,000) per digital coin. It follows minutes from a meeting of the Federal Reserve, which suggested it may raise interest rates. Political events in Kazakhstan have also raised concerns about the network's capacity. Because of its global and decentralised nature, attributing a rise or fall in the price of Bitcoin to a single cause is difficult. But many commentators have pointed to the release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting notes as one factor. The minutes suggest that America's central bank might raise interest rates sooner than some had anticipated, and sell off some of its assets. That could have led to a knock-on effect of traditional investors who hold Bitcoin, as they pursue less risky assets instead.  At the same time, a huge amount of the world's Bitcoin mining - the process by which transactions are verified and new ""coins"" made - takes place in Kazakhstan.  The massive Central Asian country has been hit with political unrest this week, as citizens took to the streets to protest against rising fuel prices. Fatal violence followed as demonstrators - which the country's leaders paint as ""rioters"" - seized buildings in the largest city, Almaty. Kazakhstan is thought to process nearly a fifth of all Bitcoin ""mining"", as the process is called, due to its usually cheap electricity. And an internet shut-down earlier this week appeared to hit the processing power of the entire Bitcoin network. This is what happened: The dip means Bitcoin has hit its lowest price since September 2021, down from a November peak of more than $60,000. Other crypto-currencies have also seen price falls. Ethereum saw its value drop from approximately $3,800 on Wednesday to under $3,200 on Friday. Matthew Dibb from Singapore-based crypto-company Stack Funds told Reuters news agency: ""We are seeing broad risk-off sentiment across all markets currently, as inflationary concerns and rate hikes appear to be at the forefront of speculators' minds."" He also warned that ""there is risk of a retreat back to the mid-30s on the short term"". Crypto-currencies, and particularly Bitcoin, continue to face criticism. The Mozilla Foundation - the group which makes the Firefox web browser among other open-source software projects - announced it would no longer accept crypto-currency donations after pushback from users. The group has accepted crypto-currency donations for years, but a recent tweet reminding people of that fact led to an angry response, as the digital currency's energy use and unregulated nature continue to be controversial among many critics."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Wall Street higher but bank shares slip,2024-09-14,2017-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40605432,"US stock indexes closed higher on Friday despite declines in banking shares as investors reacted to the latest round of results in the sector. Shares of JP Morgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported a mixed bag of second quarter results, putting pressure on share prices. The sentiment spread to other bank stocks, leading to decreases at Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Gains elsewhere offset the losses, as investors shrugged off weak sales data.  The Dow Jones climbed 0.4% to 21,637.74 and the S&P 500 index rose 0.47% to 2,459.29. The Nasdaq gained 0.6% to 6,311.41. US retail sales fell 0.2% from May to June - the second month in a row they have declined, according to US Census data. However, May's decline was revised to a fall of 0.1% from the initial estimate of a 0.3% drop. The sales drop did not appear to hurt retail stocks. Walmart shares were among the market's biggest winners, rising 1.7%. Stocks were also boosted by weak inflation data, which could reduce the possibility of a third increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve this year. The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 1.6% in June from a year earlier, down from a rate of 1.9% in May. The core CPI measure - which ignores food and energy costs - was unchanged at 1.7%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones are up 9% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is ahead 16%."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,2024-09-14,2023-01-06,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64189106,"Recent months have delivered a steady drumbeat of announcements of job cuts at some of America's biggest and richest companies. Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, . Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards.  The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed.  Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said.  ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year.  But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises. Nearly every sector in the US economy added jobs last month, with bars and restaurants, health care firms and construction businesses helping to drive the gains.  Although job losses are rising - especially in sectors vulnerable to higher interest rates like housing, banking and tech - the figures overall remained near historic lows last year, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking such announcements since the 1990s.  ""We are seeing the labour market cooling,"" he says. ""It's a slowdown but I don't think I could say at this point whether or not it's a panic situation."" Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said he worries many of the layoff announcements reflect peer pressure, as executives feel compelled to copy other firms making cuts - even as they continue to churn out healthy profits.  If that sentiment spreads, as he expects, it risks turning the forecasts of economic hardship into reality.  ""Companies do what other companies do,"" he said. ""This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because if everybody lays somebody off, the unemployment rate will go up and we will in fact have a worse economy."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Soaring shares: A good or bad sign?,2024-09-14,2017-08-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40744544,"For weeks now, US stock markets have been hitting records, a rise claimed by President Donald Trump as proof of a healthy economy.  But Mr Trump's pride in the numbers is at odds with analysts and investors, who have expressed increasing discomfort over the market's climb. About 65% of investment managers surveyed by Northern Trust last quarter said they believed shares were over-valued, the highest ever in the firm's report.  Surveys by Bank of America Merrill Lynch have expressed alarm about the high prices, as have policymakers at the Federal Reserve. ""We are concerned about equity valuations right now,"" says Mike Morrill, chief operating officer at DF Dent, a Baltimore-based investment company. ""We've had nine years of a strong bull market and that's not going to last forever."" The sentiment is similar to statements Mr Trump himself made before his election, when he said the stock market was ""so bloated"" and warned people to ""be careful"". If investors believe prices are too high - and are buying anyway - that could be a sign of a bubble.  So is the stock market rally a reason to cheer, as Mr Trump suggests now? Or could a crash be around the corner? Stocks, which have been on a long-term upward trend, surged early in 2017, amid optimism over business-friendly policies endorsed by the Trump administration, such as tax reform.  Analysts say that without clear signs of progress on reform in Washington that effect has faded.  Now, it's strong corporate revenue and profit growth that are boosting share prices, with gains going to larger, multinational companies. The three major measures - the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq - have climbed between roughly 10% and 17% so far this year, compared with about 6% to 7% during the same period last year. The Nasdaq has hit a new high more than 40 times this year. Since 2012, the value of the S&P 500 index has almost doubled. ""The stock market hit the highest level it's ever been,"" Mr Trump boasted on Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average exceeded 22,000 points on Wednesday morning.  ""Our country is doing very well,"" he said. But that hasn't stopped the muttering that the stock market, at least, is due for a correction.  Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale University, says share gains reflect optimism about where the economy is heading, but it's an unreliable forecasting tool, and shifts quickly. ""The stock market is mostly psychology,"" he says. ""The fluctuations in it mean that we're in an optimistic mood but we could change and we could change suddenly."" Investors are trying to anticipate what might trigger a change - whether it be rising interest rates, weak consumer spending, developments overseas or something else entirely.  Mr Shiller says he thinks Mr Trump himself poses one of the biggest risks.   The firestorm in Washington in May after Mr Trump fired former FBI director James Comey prompted some of the biggest one-day share sell-offs this year.  ""Usually, presidents are not able to transform the economy unless he does something disastrous, which transforms it down,"" says Mr Shiller. ""I'm thinking that it's more likely he will create some kind of uncertainty, disruption and that might be a trigger for decline."" Many of the biggest gains come from a single sector - technology stocks - the same industry that some investors say is overvalued. The S&P 500 information technology index, which averages 68 companies, including heavyweights such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, last month passed the record set in March 2000.  The index rose about 22% in the first seven months of 2017, while the broader S&P 500 climbed about 10%.  Some say the gains in tech make sense, as investors target a part of the economy seeing rapid growth.  However, others worry that in some cases the rise in shares has little to do with the companies' actual prospects.  And in more recent weeks, tech stocks have come under pressure. If the sell-off spreads to other sectors, it could be a warning of bigger problems.  Jill Hall, a US equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, doesn't expect stock markets in general to rise much more this year, but she's not predicting a big sell-off either.  She thinks investors will shift their money from the high-growth tech industry into sectors such as energy, health care and finance. ""What we're expecting is more of a rotation out of growth and into value,"" she says. Some say they're worried Federal Reserve and central bankers elsewhere will move too aggressively to increase interest rates, causing havoc in bond and stock markets. About 27% of investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month identified a mistake by central bankers in the US and Europe as the biggest risk to their outlooks. Another 28% were worried about bonds. Mr Trump himself raised alarms on these lines at a presidential debate last year.  ""We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble,"" he said. ""The only thing that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down."" That's something that is not lost on the central bankers responsible for monetary policy.

Interest Rate Sentiment,Pawnbroker shuts shops as it seeks lifeline,2024-09-14,2019-09-13,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49690753,"Customers of a High Street pawnbroker are being left in the dark after branches were closed and calls unanswered. A&B Pawnbrokers (Albemarle & Bond) and Herbert Brown stores have closed their doors, while its website says ""this store"" has ceased trading. Owner Speedloan Finance told the BBC all its 116 stores had been closed because of ""significant losses"". The firm said it was ""exploring options available to it"". These included finding a buyer for some or all of the stores, it said. ""Speedloan is due to enter into a period of consultation with employees concerning its proposal and has in the meantime offered its employees voluntary redundancy,"" it added. The pawnbrokers' trade body hit out at the firm's unanswered helpline. ""Their decision to downscale UK operations is a strategic matter for the company but [we have] expressed concern that the communication of their actions to their customers falls below the standards expected of its members,"" the National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA) said.  ""In particular, we are most unhappy with the fact that customers cannot get through to the helpline. We have demanded that the management of the company resolve this as a matter of urgency.""   Katie Prescott, business reporter Industry insiders are shocked at the way Albemarle & Bond has handled its abrupt closure.  Many say that moving the pledges (the goods secured against the loan) to a central location is unfair, as most of their customers like to deal with things in their local branch.  One said that many of these clients don't have easy access to standard forms of credit, explaining that one option offered by A&B, to pay their loan online using a debit card, was often not appropriate, although they can also use cash in a NatWest branch.  The main concern now is what happens to those customers.   The BBC understands from a source close to one of the UK's biggest pawnbroker chains, Harvey & Thompson, that they are talking to A&B about the situation and are making every effort to offer their support and help for customers and staff. However, what that support looks like is yet unclear.  It's a sentiment echoed by the National Pawnbrokers Association.  Albemarle & Bond has a chequered history. Business boomed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, but it fell victim to a plunging gold price.  In 2013, it announced it was melting down gold in order to pay its debts. A few months later, it fell into administration.  It changed hands twice, to be bought in 2015 by the Japanese pawnbroking company Daikokuya Holdings. In 2016, it was given a £10m cash injection from the investment firm Gordon Brothers. Four years on and it is once again on the market. Its latest set of accounts show that it lost £3.3m last year - as against £1.6m the year before.  Pawnbrokers allow customers to offer something valuable as security for a loan, or buy items such as jewellery and antiques. They lend money quickly, but usually at a worse rate than banks. Stores also often offer other financial services such as currency exchange and buying gold. The company said that any items pawned in A&B stores will be transferred to a central store, and can be redeemed or sold through this operation. ""If your items are expired or due to expire, please note we will not take any action with your items until we speak to you,"" the website said. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to contact all customers prior to the closure date. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused."" Letters have been sent by Albemarle & Bond, which was established in 1840, to customers as stores closed. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said it was aware that companies operated by Speedloan had closed stores. ""We are engaging with the firm and asking them to ensure this process is carried out in an orderly manner and to minimise disruption to Speedloan's customers,"" the FCA said. Speedloan said it was keeping the FCA informed. The Financial Ombudsman Service said it had received calls from frustrated customers unable to get through to the company and were worried about their items. Customers can contact the company on 01865 798114, which is a dedicated hotline, or by email at info@albemarlebond.com.  If customers are not happy with the response from the company, they can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service to complain on 0800 023 4567, or the FCA customer helpline on 0800 111 6768.

Interest Rate Sentiment,Why tech is taking a hammering,2024-09-14,2018-11-23,By Amol Rajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46317205,"Technology stocks have had a very bad week. For the FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) which have led the charge in growth over the past decade, it was grim.  At their lowest point, all five were down more than 20 per cent from their peaks. This translates to hundreds of billions of dollars in value being wiped from them.  Apple was the first company to cross the $1trn mark this year. It fell to $840bn by close of play on Tuesday, and hasn't recovered since.  Amazon, which also briefly crossed over the $1trn threshold, dropped to $731bn. That's a quarter of a trillion dollars right there. I know your sympathy for Jeff Bezos may be limited, but these are big numbers. Facebook, meanwhile, is trading at around the value it had early last year - long before the scandals of this year took their toll.  But those scandals may be a distraction from the big pictures. Why are tech stocks taking a hammering, and what does it indicate about the wider macroeconomic picture?  When considering market fluctuations and, by extension, whether to invest, the key is to look at the fundamentals and over the long-term. Some context here is vital.     These companies are still exceptionally rich, staffed by many of the smartest innovators on earth, and good at planning. Moreover, they are registering whopping profits; indeed, record-breaking profits in Amazon's case, and forecast-beating profits for Apple and Facebook. And given the wider hit to stock markets from weaker global GDP growth, and with a looming potential trade war between America and China, it's inevitable that tech stocks should also be hit.  But a new world is emerging for these companies, in which three fundamental shifts point to a new era that will place limitations on their acceleration. That is not to say they will go into reverse; just that they might slow.  First, monetary policy is tightening around the world. Since the financial crash, we have lived in an extraordinary period of sustained low-interest rates. This has been good for borrowers.  When borrowing is cheap, investors are - relatively speaking - more relaxed about returns. When the cost of borrowing rises, so do investor demands for reliable returns. The shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening puts a discipline into the market. Rising interest rates make equities sweat. Tech stocks are feeling the effect.  The second big change, which is well documented, is the threat of national and supranational regulation. A feeling unites legislators from Washington to Brussels, Berlin and Delhi: smarter regulation of these companies is socially necessary and, probably, economically manageable.  Resurgent nationalism in many parts of the world has curtailed the freedom of many global companies, which tech giants almost by definition are. And the example of GDPR in Europe, which aims to shift control of data back to consumers from these companies, is being closely watched. If it is seen to work, it will be widely copied. The third big change is perhaps less documented, and most alarming for these companies. This is the possibility that they are maxing out on scale. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has co-authored an important new book called Blitzscaling. This riffs on the idea that it is the remorseless pursuit of scale that gives data-based companies their advantage. The first scaler, rather than the first mover, will emerge victorious in various markets. That, according to Hoffman, is why venture capitalists are happy to tolerate the lack of profits at a company like Uber. If this argument is right, what if companies like Facebook and Apple have already squeezed most of their advantage from blitzscaling their particular markets?  Apple's growth has long been powered by the iPhone - but its popularity with each new version is slowing, as rivals launch brilliant counter-attacks, and markets become saturated. In the key markets of US, Canada and Europe, Facebook hasn't grown at all in the past quarter. Think about what that does to the mentality of a company used to super-star growth, on its way to 2.6bn global users. What if, say, 3bn users is where Facebook will peak? That is why, by the way, the company is trying to make Instagram, which it owns and which is still growing fast, sweat, by putting more ads in that arena.  What if a back-lash against the misuse of data means consumers spend more time in the private arena of WhatsApp, where there are fewer ads, and it's much harder for Facebook (which also owns WhatsApp) to sell me a car in WhatsApp than on the Facebook News Feed? Of course it is true that the relentless drip, drip, drip of scandals engulfing some of these companies, especially Facebook, will weigh on investors too.  But go back to the bigger picture. For well over a decade, during which workers of the world dealt with a financial crash and just avoided a depression, these technology companies enjoyed astonishing freedom.  They were able - largely through their own ingenuity - to pursue growth remorselessly in a low-interest rate world, where they endured relatively little regulation.  New markets and vistas constantly opened up to them, and their tax affairs were tolerated in a world of globalist sentiment.  Now interest rates are going up, regulation is coming, those markets are nearing saturation, rivals are launching better attacks, nationalism is tempering globalism, and tax affairs are under new scrutiny.  Their valuations may yet rise further, and will almost certainly bounce back from this week. But for the tech sector, a new era brings harder times.

Interest Rate Sentiment,Global growth 'to hit seven-year high',2024-09-14,2018-04-17,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43789547,"The International Monetary Fund has forecast that 2018 will be the strongest year for global growth since 2011. In its new assessment of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF predicts growth this year and next of 3.9%.  However, it warned that performance could be curtailed by trade barriers. For the UK, the IMF has made a modest upgrade for growth this year to 1.6%. For next year, the forecast has been slightly reduced, to 1.5%. The IMF report warned that the current momentum was ""not assured"". It lists a number of risks that could lead to weaker performance than its main forecast, including what it calls policies that ""harm international trade"".  The report refers to ""waning support for global integration"". It says increased trade barriers - tariffs or other restrictions - could harm sentiment in financial markets, disrupt global supply chains and slow the spread of new technology.  Protectionism also affects consumers by making tradable goods more expensive.   WTO warns over tit-for-tat trade wars The complexity of UK/EU trade talks The increased tension in recent months over trade largely reflects President Trump's view that the deficit in US trade - the country imports more than it exports - is a result of poor agreements negotiated by his predecessors and other countries taking advantage of the US.  But IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld dismisses the idea that the steps taken by the US can reduce the deficit. He says the reason for the deficit is that total spending in the US exceeds income. He says that recent tax measures are actually likely to increase the deficit.  The general thrust of this report is relatively upbeat for the near-term future.  The forecasts for this year and next have been raised. The upgrade to global growth for this year to 3.9% potentially makes 2018 the strongest year since 2011, when the economy was rebounding from the financial crisis. Mr Obstfeld describes the upgrade from 3.7% as ""substantial"".  Compared with forecasts issued in October 2017, the predictions for this year for the euro-area, Japan and the US have all been raised by half a percentage point or slightly more.  For the UK, the report says that unemployment close to historic lows could add to inflationary pressures, by triggering faster wage growth.  Inflation is already above the government and Bank of England's target of 2%.  The IMF says further increases in interest rates are needed to bring price rises back towards that rate.  That said, Mr Obstfeld describes longer-term prospects as ""more sobering"".  In the developed economies, he says, ageing populations and low growth in productivity (the amount each worker produces) mean they are unlikely to achieve the per capita growth rates they managed before the crisis - and it is per capita growth that drives average living standards.  Among developing countries, he says those that depend on exporting commodities need to diversify their economies.  There are warnings about the risks ahead, lurking dangers that could lead to the global economy falling short of the IMF's forecasts, in addition to the concerns about trade.  Debt levels - private and government - are very high. That could lead to debtors getting into difficulty with repayments as interest rates rise from the post-financial crisis lows. "
Interest Rate Sentiment,Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,2024-09-14,2023-01-06,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64189106,"Recent months have delivered a steady drumbeat of announcements of job cuts at some of America's biggest and richest companies. Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, . Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards.  The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed.  Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said.  ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year.  But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises.

Interest Rate Sentiment,'I'm Australian - why do I need to prove my loyalty?',2024-09-14,2020-12-31,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-54595120,"Earlier this year, a junior adviser for the Australian government, Andrew Chen*, visited the nation's Department of Defence for a meeting. As he and a colleague stepped into the building in Canberra, they pulled out their government IDs. Mr Chen was stopped by a guard, who took him aside. ""They asked to take a photo of me - like a portrait - there in the lobby,"" he said.  ""And it was just me. The Caucasian colleague who was with me - he wasn't asked to do that,"" added Mr Chen, who is Chinese-Australian. Mr Chen felt ""awkward"" as they took the snap, but he didn't want to cause a scene. Later, he asked colleagues if they had ever had the same experience - no-one had. ""So it was just me, literally. It was clearly some sort of security procedure the guards were enforcing. They didn't offer any explanation."" The department told the BBC its security protocols were ""agnostic of background or ethnicity"". Mr Chen suspects that was not true in his case. He is among many Chinese-Australians who feel they are facing increasing scrutiny and suspicion - solely based on their heritage - as Australia hardens its views towards China. There are 1.2 million people who have Chinese ancestry in Australia - about 5% of the population.  In October, three of them - all Australian citizens - gave evidence to a Senate inquiry on problems facing migrant communities. But 20 minutes in, each was abruptly asked to ""condemn"" the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  When they objected to the question and its relevance, government Senator Eric Abetz pressed them repeatedly, asking ""why not?"". Each made clear they didn't support the CCP, but noted that such demands hadn't been issued to other witnesses at the inquiry. ""This felt less like a public inquiry and more like a public witch-hunt,"" one of the three, university researcher Yun Jiang, tweeted later. Another, Osmond Chiu, likened his experience to those forced to ""prove their loyalty"" during the McCarthy trials in the 1950s - an infamous purge by the US government against a perceived Communist threat. ""Never did I imagine I would be placed in a similar situation,"" Mr Chiu, a political researcher, wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald.  He told the BBC: ""It was like he [Mr Abetz] was trying to bully us. You kind of think that instead of wanting to hear evidence, he just wanted a political scalp."" Mr Abetz rejected calls by political opponents to apologise. Instead, he issued a statement headlined: ""Standing firm against ugly dictatorships is everyone's duty Mr Chiu."" China is Australia's dominant trading partner, a relationship which has hugely benefited both countries. But in recent years, China has increasingly been viewed by Australia as a security threat. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) - a spy agency - first warned in 2017 of an increase in China's alleged attempts to interfere in domestic affairs. That same year, a senator resigned over his connections with a Chinese political donor. In 2018, Australia passed laws aimed at curbing foreign interference. A few months later, citing security risks, it became the first Western nation to ban Chinese firm Huawei from building its 5G network. Australia has also been hit by a series of cyber attacks - often suspected to involve China - on federal parliament, political parties, universities and science agencies.  Negative sentiment towards China has also grown with Beijing's arrests of Australian citizens and its actions in Hong Kong, where it has imposed a draconian and controversial new security law, and Xinjiang, where at least  a million people are alleged to have been incarcerated in camps China describes as ""re-education"" centres. The animosity reached new levels at the end of November when a Chinese official posted a fake image of an Australian soldier murdering an Afghan child. Also in November, a prominent Chinese-Australian museum board director became the first person to be charged under the foreign interference laws. But experts say the security dangers are complex and should not be solely focused on Chinese-Australians. ""The greater risks to Australian sovereignty and independent decision-making come not from Chinese-Australian communities, but from people involved in or influencing politics, business and research,"" said Michael Shoebridge, a security expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Aspi). ""This is where Beijing is focusing attention to silence critics and cultivate advocates."" But Ms Jiang and others fear that Australia - especially its media - often wrongly conflate the ordinary Chinese-Australian community with alleged nefarious interference by China. ""The focus should be on actions… instead of guilt by association,"" she told the Senate inquiry. There are few places where this ""guilt by association"" is more keenly felt than in Australia's public service, where people work for the national interest, often on sensitive matters. Many Chinese-Australian bureaucrats say they have increasingly felt under suspicion. ""There are legitimate security concerns [about China],"" said one senior policy adviser of Chinese ethnicity, referring to examples such as the cyber attacks. ""But the way it has spilled over into a conversation about the Chinese diaspora and who deserves to be Australian and who is assessed and analysed [for further scrutiny] - it has become a really, really bad conversation."" Younger or less established public servants say they feel pressure to prove their patriotism or are wary when giving policy advice, to avoid unfair scrutiny. ""If I was a Caucasian-Australian, I'd be a lot more comfortable coming out and saying something different,"" Mr Chen told the BBC. ""But if you're from a Chinese background, people would just see you as being compromised. That's the sort of culture that we've got at the moment."" Several public servants who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity - fearing reprisals otherwise - say they have also been questioned by colleagues on past activities that might otherwise be considered an asset. Their examples included learning Chinese at Chinese government-run Confucius Institutes, participating in Chinese youth groups at university, and taking previous trips to China. They also suspect that security clearances across government are increasingly being delayed for Chinese-Australians, and argue that vetting processes aren't being consistently applied. ""A former colleague of mine joined the public service three years ago - he still hasn't been able to get the clearance,"" said the senior policy adviser, referring to one process that typically takes six months at most. Such delays, they argue, have stymied career progression and even prevented people from working for the Australian government. Two people told the BBC they were forced to give up assignments because they never received higher clearance to work on them. The Department of Defence did not respond to questions specifically about Chinese-Australians, but a spokesman said that security clearances depended on several factors including ""the ability to check the background of the clearance subject"".  ""If an applicant has resided overseas, the evidence provided may need to be corroborated through overseas institutions,"" he added. Mr Shoebridge said the process typically took longer if the public servant had visited ""places where it's difficult to get access or reliable information from"" - citing China, Russia and North Korea as examples. He added that the government took extra caution with Australians who have family, friends or other connections in China - because they're seen at risk of being more vulnerable to coercion. ""Chinese state agencies do have a record of using such things to exploit and manipulate people,"" he said. But, he added, there were also risks in not employing people with experience living in China. As one bureaucrat told the BBC: ""Say you're working in the China policy team. Ideally, you'd want some people from Chinese background in there... but if all the people with in-country knowledge can't get security clearances, then you're left with people that don't have any kind of actual expertise."" Jason Yat-Sen Li, a Chinese-Australian community leader, doesn't diminish the risk that people can be targeted and co-opted by China. But he said much could depend on how deeply Chinese-Australians felt part of Australian society - or conversely, if they felt treated like they didn't belong. The conflict presented a ""real test of our values and of our confidence in our institutions"", he said. Asio has long warned against isolating the Chinese community - identifying it as the most helpful group for building national intelligence on China. Commentators say that the Australian government's silence over comments such as Senator Abetz's did not help. ""We need to make sure that the language used by parliamentarians drives cohesion in our community, and doesn't score own goals by advancing the aims of the Chinese government,"" said Mr Shoebridge. The underlying issue is trust, said Mr Li. Do Australians trust their Chinese-Australian friends, colleagues, neighbours? And do Chinese-Australians trust in their society, that they will be afforded the same equality and rule of law as everyone else? ""Because if we cannot trust 5% of our population, that is so contrary to liberal democratic values, and that is doing more damage to our democracy than any foreign government,"" said Mr Li. *Andrew Chen is a pseudonym."

It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Consumer confidence is also soft, affected by the incomes squeeze which has seen earnings not rising as fast as inflation. There are two big points from today's Inflation Report, the Bank's three monthly health check on the UK economy. Growth is better. And the risk of interest rate rises has risen."

Mark Carney said recent data had given him ""greater confidence"" that weak first-quarter growth ""was largely due to the weather"".  He said household spending and sentiment had ""bounced back strongly"". England winning the World Cup would be an ""unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good"" for the economy, Mr Carney added. In a speech at the Northern Powerhouse Summit in Newcastle, Mr Carney said: ""Overall, recent domestic data suggest the economy is evolving largely in line with the May Inflation Report projections, which see demand growing at rates slightly above those of supply and domestic cost pressures building."" The pound edged up 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3254 following his remarks. Last month, three members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - including chief economist Andy Haldane - voted in favour of lifting the interest rate to 0.75%.  Mr Carney was among the six MPC members who voted to keep rates on hold at 0.5%.   He also warned that a global trade war could dampen economic growth. Mr Carney said ""protectionist rhetoric"" was rising and was now turning into action: ""There are some, tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity."" He cited evidence from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI), which suggested that global export orders and manufacturing output have fallen back from highs at the start of the year. On Friday, the US will implement a 25% import tariff on a list of hundreds of Chinese goods. On the same day, China will also impose 25% tariffs on a range of US goods, including pork products, fish and rice.  In a Q&A session after his speech, Mr Carney - who was wearing a Three Lions lapel badge - was asked about the economic impact of an England win. ""It would be an unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good. Everything would be good,"" he replied.

Interest Rate Sentiment,Pound hits new 37-year low as retail sales slide,2024-09-14,2022-09-16,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62923994,"The pound has fallen to a new 37-year low against the US dollar after figures showed UK retail sales fell sharply in August as the rise in the cost of living continued to hit households. The larger-than-expected drop in sales volumes of 1.6% prompted fresh concerns over the state of the economy. Sales across all retail sectors fell in August as households cut back in the face of rising prices. One analyst suggested the figures showed the UK is already in recession. Sterling fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.1351 at one point, its lowest since 1985, following the release of the retail sales figures. The pound recovered later to climb above $1.14.  The pound has been falling against the US currency for most of the year, partly due to the strength of the dollar. A weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far. This comes at a time when UK inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, is running at a near 40-year high, despite slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. The Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year and it is expected to keep increasing interest rates in a bid to curb inflation. Olivia Cross, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said August's retail sales figures backed up the consultancy's view that the UK economy is ""already in recession"". A recession is defined by the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods.  ""Retail sales will probably continue to struggle as the cost of living crisis hits harder in the coming months,"" Ms Cross said. ""But nonetheless the Bank of England will still have to raise interest rates aggressively."" Higher prices, along with upcoming energy bill rises in October, have led households to tighten their belts when it comes to spending. The government announced the Energy Price Guarantee last week to help people with energy bills. The support will see annual energy bill for a typical household capped at £2,500 for two years. Typical energy bills were set to rise to £3,549 a year and even higher in 2023, before the government intervened. Ms Cross, of Capital Economics, said that because of the intervention, any recession would be ""smaller and shorter"" than it had expected previously. Martyn Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the government support  ""should ease both the income squeeze and lift consumers' sentiment, suggesting the outlook for retailers isn't as gloomy as could have been the case"". ""However, real household incomes are still on course for a significant fall over the next 12 months or so,"" he added. The government is expected to set out the estimated cost of plans to cap energy prices in a ""mini-Budget"" next Friday, as well as tax cuts pledged by Prime Minister Liz Truss in a bid to boost the economy. Sterling's fall to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar today is not isolated. The pound also hit its weakest level against the euro for nearly a year and a half. So while the big picture movement is strength in the US dollar, there continues to be specific additional pressure on the pound sterling in international markets. This morning's trigger was far weaker than expected retail sales figures. But markets await next Friday and the extent of borrowing required for the government's energy plan and tax cuts. The eurozone too is heading for recession, but there is little comfort in such company. The risk is that a weaker currency, makes imports of essentials, from energy to food, more expensive, prolonging the period of high inflation. And if the UK's nearest trading partners are also in recession, exporters will not see significant benefit from a weaker pound. The fall in retail sales continues the slide since the summer of 2021, when all Covid restrictions were removed, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The drop seen in August was the largest month-on-month fall since December 2021. Sales of food, online, non-food and fuel all fell in the month, the ONS said. Supermarkets' sales volumes also fell by 0.9% in August, but alcohol and tobacco sales rose by 6.3%. ""Feedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns,"" the ONS said. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, said people were ""clearly thinking hard about what they spend their money on"". ""It's just not stretching as far as it used to, and essentials have to come first. But even essentials are costing more and with the spectre of unmanageable fuel bills looming large people did the only thing they could, cut back,"" she said. According to the ONS, department stores saw a large drop in sales in August - 2.7% - while sales in clothing shops fell by 0.6%. ""Big ticket purchases are being put off and that's unlikely to change in the coming months,"" said AJ Bell's Ms Hewson. On Thursday, John Lewis revealed that while its shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items. The department store and its supermarket chain Waitrose reported a loss of £99m for the first half of its trading year. Waitrose said it sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes shrinking by ""nearly a fifth"". Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the main factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills. Meanwhile, the proportion of retail sales online fell to 25.7% in August from 26.3% in July, but the figure remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels. "
Interest Rate Sentiment,How a US Mormon family ended up dead in Mexico,2024-09-14,2019-11-08,By Will Grant,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50339377,"Nine members of a Mormon community in northern Mexico died in an ambush by gunmen while travelling from their home on the La Mora ranch to a nearby settlement. But how did the victims, all US-Mexican citizens, come to be in the line of fire? The dirt road that runs through the Sierra Madre mountains is no place for children to die. Remote, rocky and cold, it is controlled by men financed by Mexico's illegal drug trade and armed by America's guns.  It's about as hostile a stretch of road as can be found in Mexico.    The raw grief of the extended LeBarón family is worsened by the upsetting details of how the infants met their deaths on that stony track - trapped in a burning, bullet-riddled car.  Eight-month-old twins, Titus and Tiana, died alongside their two siblings, Howard Jr, 12, and Krystal, 10, and their mother, 30-year-old Rhonita Miller.  Their grandfather filmed the aftermath of the cartel ambush with his mobile phone ""for the record"" as he put it, his voice cracking. The disturbing footage showed a blackened and still-smouldering vehicle, the charred human remains clearly visible inside.   Further up the road, two more cars, also full of mothers and young children, were attacked an hour later. In total, nine people were killed. Most were not yet teenagers, several were still toddlers. Dawna Ray Langford and her sons Trevor, 11, and Rogan, two, were killed in one car while Christina Langford Johnson, 31, was killed in another. Her seven-month-old baby, Faith Langford, survived the attack. She was found on the floor of the vehicle in her baby seat. Perhaps the only solace for this tight-knit Mormon community exists in the knowledge that the children who died were with their mothers - a family united to their untimely, violent end.     Yet the story of how the LeBarón clan came to live in such a dangerous corner of northern Mexico is not one born of unity but of division, stretching back decades. The Mormon fundamentalists started to move to Mexico from around 1890 when they split with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). Primarily, they parted ways over the question of polygamy, which the breakaway Mormon groups continued to practise while the mainstream church, based in Utah, prohibited to comply with US law.  Polygamy was illegal in Mexico too - but there was an understanding that the authorities would ""look the other way about their marriage practices"", explains Dr Cristina Rosetti, a scholar of Mormon fundamentalism based in Salt Lake City. ""The families who went there were not 'fringe families' or 'bad Mormons',"" she says. ""These were leaders of the church; they weren't peripheral people. Big names went down there.""  The LeBarón group's patriarch, Alma ""Dayer"" LeBarón, established Colonia LeBarón in Chihuahua in the 1920s.  In time, the Mormon community south of the border grew in number and wealth.  They purchased land in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua and set up ranches and other colonias. They thrived as pecan farmers, grew wheat, planted apple and pomegranate orchards and produced honey to sell at farmers' markets. Although many returned to the southern United States after the Mexican Revolution, by the 1950s the Mormon enclaves had populations in the high hundreds or low thousands. After Alma LeBarón died, the offshoot was led by his son Joel. In essence, it was the LeBarón Church, an independent fundamentalist Mormon denomination of which today there are several branches.  It was at this stage that the LeBarón family name took on its notoriety. Joel's brother, Ervil LeBarón, was the second-in-command until they fell out over the direction of the church. An unhinged and dangerous cult leader who had 13 wives and scores of children, Ervil then split and created a separate sect. In 1972, he ordered his brother's murder and it is believed Ervil's followers killed dozens of others on his command, including one of his wives and two of his children. He died in prison in 1981.  Yet the victims of the massacre in Sonora had nothing to do with Ervil's church. There is an important distinction to be drawn, explains Dr Rosetti, between surnames and religious affiliation.  ""Independent Mormons have been marrying LeBaróns, and vice versa, for generations,"" she clarified on Twitter. ""There are three distinct Churches that fall under 'LeBarónism'."" The majority of Mormons living in Mexico are members of the Church of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), but those in La Mora are mostly independent, Dr Rosetti said.  In recent years, they have lived a broadly peaceful existence, free from US or Mexican government interference. Of the US, but not entirely American; in Mexico, yet not fully Mexican either, the extremist Mormon group began to soften at the edges a little too.   Their adherence to polygamy has slowly been phased out, although some still practise it. Most have dual citizenship and travel back and forth to the US freely and frequently.  ""When you say Mormon, it is a very big umbrella term that covers lots of families,"" says Dr Cristina Rosetti. ""The fundamentalists are a big umbrella, and so are the LeBaróns."" Yet it seems violence has again been associated with the LeBarón name.  It isn't easy to remain shielded from the drug war when you live in cartel-controlled regions of Mexico. The drug-related violence began to worsen from late 2005, and subsequently grew in intensity and ferocity during the military deployment ordered by former-President Felipe Calderón.  His successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, oversaw the bloodiest term in office in modern memory as the cartels first expanded, then splintered and grew new tentacles.  In 2009, the Mormons in the northern states of Mexico were warned in the clearest possible terms that they inhabited ""tierra sin ley"", a lawless land. One of their number, Benjamin LeBarón - great-grandson of the group's founder, Alma - had spoken out about organised crime. He criticised the extortion and intimidation being exerted on local farmers and created a group called SOS Chihuahua urging towns to denounce the abuses to the authorities. In July of that year, Benjamin was dragged from his family home by gunmen with his brother-in-law, Luis Widmar, who had tried to intervene. The next day, their dead bodies appeared on the outskirts of town having been brutally beaten and with signs of torture.  The drug cartel's message to LeBarón family was clear: don't meddle with us; don't meddle with our business interests or the smooth operation of our drug routes north. Don't talk to the police or draw attention to things that are happening in these states. To defy such a warning will cost you your life.  It is a little over 10 years ago since those armed men killed Benjamin LeBarón. During that decade, it seems his relatives have established a sort of uneasy peace with the local cartel in Sonora, a group called Los Salazar, which is a faction of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel of the jailed drug lord, El Chapo Guzmán. ""It's not like they can uproot an entire community,"" says Anna  LeBarón, Ervil's daughter, who wrote a book about life in her father's sect called The Polygamist's Daughter. Anna says she has seen the calls for the Mormons to return to the US but points out that ""it isn't that simple."" The Mormon community pre-dates the drug cartels in Sonora and, even though they now live side-by-side to some very violent people, it isn't realistic to expect them to simply leave. They are ""very integrated"" into the local area, she says.  ""These kinds of events give people reason to consider their options. But it's an entire community. It's their livelihood.""   In fact, following the massacre, some Mormons have described how the drug gangs are simply an accepted part of daily life in Sonora. They would nod as they passed by cartel gunmen, might know their names, would stop at their checkpoints and show them they were only transporting agricultural produce in their pick-up trucks.  Almost from the moment that the news broke of the attacks, the Mexican government has claimed that the killings were a case of mistaken identity. An armed group called La Linea supposedly carried out the ambush and confused the SUVs of women and children with a convoy of Los Salazar, their Sonora-based rivals, the authorities say.  La Línea, meaning The Line, was originally made up of ex-municipal police officers from Ciudad Juarez, says Mexican security analyst, Carlos Rodriguez Ulloa. ""They marked out the line, that's to say, they enforced order"" for the Juárez Cartel, he explains. Eventually the Juarez Cartel limited its operations to running the drug routes or ""plazas"" in the city from which it takes its name. Its enforcers, La Linea, then filled the void they left in the state, he says. ""As a well-positioned actor, La Línea assumed the roles and responsibilities (of the Juárez Cartel), and now has control of the routes and 'plazas'. It grew to a point that it consumed most of the Juárez Cartel and has today become the principal trafficker in Chihuahua."" Were the murders of the Mormon women and children simply an accident in the wider story of La Línea versus Los Salazar? Certainly some representatives of the LeBarón family don't think so. They believe their loved ones were deliberately targeted: ""The question of whether there was confusion and crossfire is completely false,"" said Julian LeBarón from inside the Mormon settlement of La Mora, shortly before the funerals of his slain relatives. ""These criminals who have no shame opened fire on women and children with premeditation and with unimaginable brutality. I don't know what kind of animals these people are."" It is a murky picture still. Mr LeBarón says one of the mothers, Christina Langford, had left the car with her hands raised, pleading for the gunmen to stop yet they murdered her anyway. Evidence, perhaps, that La Línea were targeting the Mormons - either for having a relationship with their rivals, Los Salazar, or for having the audacity to speak out on guns.  Recently the family had become more vocal again in their opposition to the cartels, especially in calling for action on the illegal traffic in assault weapons and high-velocity arms from the United States. Whether their activism was enough to provoke such cold-blooded slaughter of their children is hard to say.    Meanwhile, the Mexican government argues the gunmen allowed some of the children to escape - evidence, they say, of the cartel's realisation that a mistake had been made. The Mexican government would doubtless prefer this to be the case.  As the victims were US citizens, the murders have an international dimension which has increased the pressure on President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Until now, he has tried to avoid becoming embroiled in an ever-escalating war with the drug cartels. ""Hugs, not guns"", he famously said on the campaign trail. An honourable sentiment, no doubt, yet many people in Mexico - and in Washington too - feel it is naïve and that his approach of non-violence isn't working any more effectively than the military-led strategy of his predecessors. In the end, perhaps the question of whether the attack on the Mormon community was an error or deliberate isn't the point. Much like the murder of Benjamin LeBarón 10 years ago, the perpetrators' desired effect was to sow fear, to terrorise people in the region.    As the tiny, hand-hewn, wooden coffins are lowered into the rocky ground, the killers certainly appear to have achieved that aim.  Additional reporting by Lauren Turner"

And savers at last will see returns improve. The economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today.  But not everything in the garden is rosy. It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Consumer confidence is also soft, affected by the incomes squeeze which has seen earnings not rising as fast as inflation. There are two big points from today's Inflation Report, the Bank's three monthly health check on the UK economy. Growth is better. And the risk of interest rate rises has risen."
Interest Rate Sentiment,China's empty tower blocks highlight economic woes,2024-09-14,2023-07-06,By Stephen McDonell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66125675,"The small eastern city of Zibo in Shandong province is experiencing an outdoor barbecue craze. People from all over China are coming here to taste its lamb skewers, which have become legendary via social media. It's quite a raucous experience and certainly not for the faint-hearted. The street is packed, you sit on little plastic chairs, drink beer and wrap chunks of meat with spring onion on the local flatbread while karaoke songs pump out in all directions. On the face of it, these crowds appear to show an economy rebounding strongly from the coronavirus emergency - but according to economists that's not the case. Rather, they say, this is an example of people choosing a cheap, tasty, option at a time of great pressure on household incomes. A man sitting with his shirt off tells us this is the perfect spot to enjoy a hot summer night with his family, and that this type of fun has a price tag to match the moment. ""This place is great for ordinary people,"" he says. ""Recently, it's been hard to make money but still easy to spend it. After three years of Covid, the economy is only slowly recovering."" University graduates are being hit especially hard by China's economic doldrums, with youth unemployment hovering at or above 20%. Some students are feeling nervous about their futures. ""Yes, I'm worried,"" says one woman who'll soon graduate. ""There's a lot of competition. It's hard to find a job. All my classmates feel the same pressure.""  For those who have jobs, a big reason for their reluctance to spend big is economic security. They're concerned about the potential to join the ranks of the unemployed, and their household's largest single investment is, in many cases, no longer worth what they thought it would be.  The real estate sector is under great stress in China. To see this first-hand, we drive a few hours east of Zibo to the outskirts of a much larger city, Qingdao. Here, a property explosion hasn't matched real demand from buyers or renters, and the result has been huge housing estates built with very few residents in them. A woman is selling cold noodles from a portable stand outside her housing complex where she has few neighbours. A few years ago, her husband bought a flat here after moving to Qingdao to give their child a better start because they heard the schools would be good. I ask her if she's worried about the value of her home collapsing. ""Of course I'm worried,"" she says. ""But what can I do?"" Nearby a couple who are street cleaners have stopped for lunch. They point to the huge estate behind them and say that nobody lives there. Across the road there is a small forest of concrete towers without paint, without windows and with window frames now looking the worse for wear, having been exposed to the elements. ""Construction just stopped there one day last year,"" the man says. According to his wife, the entire suburb is pretty dead. ""There's nothing here. There's no petrol station. You have to go a long way for fuel. It's really not convenient to live here,"" she says. There had been hope that this region would take off after the city hosted a major political meeting, the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Summit, and China's leader Xi Jinping gave it his personal stamp of approval as a place to invest and do business, potentially hosting international expos and the like. But the factories, start-ups and other companies that would supposedly employ those who bought property here have been few. According to a local real estate agent, sales volumes have halved in the area in recent years. ""Prices are down because the market is saturated,"" she says. ""Too many homes were built and it's hard to sell them."" We put up a drone to get a bird's eye view and it looks even worse than at ground level. Entire new housing estates where work has stopped can be found in all directions. Those that are finished don't have much sign of life in them. What's more, this supply and demand problem isn't unique to this area. It isn't even unique to this city. In province after province across China, evidence pointing to the danger of a property bubble is easy to find. One reason for rampant real estate speculation in this country has been a lack of other options for investment. But the boom in real estate drove house prices out of the reach of ordinary families in many big cities. The government response was to cap the number of flats any person could buy.  It was a genuine attempt at an egalitarian reform, but pressure is now coming to reverse this. In Qingdao, such measures have already been eased, in an attempt to stimulate its stalled real estate market. The challenge for Chinese policymakers is to find a way to wean this economy off such a heavy reliance on property sales to generate growth and business confidence. Economists like Harry Murphy Cruise, from Moody's Analytics, think China is facing significant problems. ""China's economy is in desperate need of rebalancing,"" he tells the BBC from Australia. ""It's had that massive period of growth over the last two or three decades from big infrastructure building, from a massive uptick in the property market that is actually not a sustainable growth driver going forward. ""Look around the world, developed economies need households as a key driver of economic growth, and that is just not what China has at the moment."" The Chinese government is considering ways to promote more spending by individuals and by businesses from interest rate cuts to cash handouts. But the problem is sentiment. People will feel more secure when there are more jobs. Businesses need to invest to create more jobs, but they are reluctant to do so while customers are so insecure. As Harry Murphy Cruise puts it: ""It's sort of like the chicken and the egg. You can't have that uptick in the economy unless you have business spending. They're not spending until they see that uptick. So, there's a stalemate that's really holding back a key portion of the economy."" Then there's the chance that all of this will bleed into global trade. China is big. What happens to the world's second largest economy turns ripples into waves. Reduced manufacturing here - off the back of weak international demand - has resulted in fewer exports, fewer Chinese-made goods available worldwide and less business activity in Asia's mega factory. Then the subsequent slower consumption in China means fewer imports of other countries' products. The headache for the Chinese government is that it may have to choose whether to go for a short-term stimulus fix, which would delay the rebalancing it will eventually need to face, or whether to absorb more immediate pain and bring on the long-term solution more quickly. Naturally, there are almost certainly those in Beijing's upper echelons of power considering some sort of middle path, starting with a milder boost to stabilise the economy, then considering the larger problems at hand. Because they know that, once negative sentiment sets in, it can be hard to turn around. Yet if you want to feel optimistic about Qingdao, and about life, you go to the beach. Tourism along its famous coastline does seem to be picking up. There's laughter, sandcastle construction and everyone - whether they're a captain of industry or a truck driver - is enjoying the great embrace of the ocean. Whether it matches reality or not, here you almost can't help but feel that, despite everything, the future still has good things in store."
Interest Rate Sentiment,August interest rate rise moves step closer,2024-09-14,2018-06-21,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44562162,"The Bank of England has held interest rates but signalled an August rate rise is more likely than previously thought.  In a decisive move, Andrew Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, joined two other Monetary Policy Committee members in voting to raise rates to 0.75%. The nine-member MPC was split 6-3, with Bank governor Mark Carney leading the group who voted to hold rates at 0.5%. The last time three people ""dissented"" from the overall view, in June 2017, rates rose the following November. But economists believe that if the economy does show signs of picking up, an August rise is in play. Government borrowing figures published on Thursday boosted hopes among some economists that the economy may be gaining momentum.  The pound jumped by about a cent against the dollar following the Bank's decision, climbing back above the $1.32 level, as the possibility of an August rate rise appeared to increase. The MPC said that the poor economic growth figures of the first three months of a year was likely to prove ""temporary"" and that the speed of growth would pick up. As economic momentum improves, fears over rising inflation grow and pressure increases for interest rates to rise. The level of interest rates is the Bank's main tool for controlling any increase in prices. ""A key assumption in the MPC's May projections was that the dip in output growth in the first quarter would prove temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter,"" the committee said. ""This judgement appears broadly on track. ""A number of indicators of household spending and sentiment have bounced back strongly from what appeared to be erratic weakness in Q1 [January to March], in part related to the adverse weather. ""Employment growth has remained solid."" The MPC said prospects for global growth also remained strong, despite some weakness across Europe. It is the first time Mr Haldane has ""dissented"" from the majority view on the MPC since he joined the Bank in 2014 and is significant given his role as the leading economic expert at the institution. Before today's decision the markets were split 50/50 on whether there would be a rate rise at the MPC's next meeting in August. After the news that Mr Haldane has joined those pressing for a rise - MPC members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - it is likely the market expectation for a rate rise will strengthen."
Interest Rate Sentiment,US jobs growth beats forecasts despite GM strike,2024-09-14,2019-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50263429,"US employment was more resilient than expected in October despite the impact of strike action at General Motors. Companies added 128,000 new jobs, ahead of a forecast 85,000 rise, during a month when thousands of workers walked out at the carmaker.  The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 3.6% from 3.5% in September, which had been the lowest rate since 1969. Analysts said the data supported the Federal Reserve's comments earlier this week that the economy is in good shape. President Trump immediately praised ""blowout"" jobs data, stating that adjusted employment figures showed growth of 303,000 roles. However, this includes upgrades to figures from previous months and other adjustments. The jobs data for August and September was revised upwards. In August, 51,000 more roles than originally thought were added to the US economy and 44,000 more jobs were created in September. The data from the Labor Department showed that the manufacturing sector shed 36,000 positions last month, the biggest fall for a decade. However, within manufacturing, employment in the motor vehicles and parts sector declined by 42,000 because of the strike at GM. Striking employees are treated as unemployed in the US statistics. The White House said that 60,000 jobs were affected by the GM strikes. And public sector payrolls fell in October because 20,000 temporary workers who had been preparing for the 2020 Census completed their work. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Asset Management, said employment data ""appears to back up the Fed's comments on Wednesday night about the economy being in decent shape and its shift in policy stance"".  On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve cut the country's key interest rate, but signalled that there would not be further reductions in the near term. By Andrew Walker, economics correspondent Does the US ""rock"", as President Trump says?  The labour market does seem pretty resilient, and the new figures do support that view. By international standards, the country's unemployment rate is very low. Not the lowest among the developed economies, but well towards the right end of the range. But in terms of the percentage of the adult population who do have jobs, the US is near the middle.  So why the apparent discrepancy between what the employment and unemployment figures tell us? It is because people who don't work are only counted as unemployed if they have actively tried to find work.  Some people don't for family reasons. Some are full-time students. Some are retired.  But some are discouraged by the lack of opportunity, which may be a factor in some areas in the US. And some don't seek work because of health problems. In the US, opioid drug misuse is sometimes cited as a factor that inhibits some people from seeking work.   There is no question that since the financial crisis the US has created a lot of jobs. But there are some troublesome features of the country's labour market.  The world's largest economy grew at an annual rate of 1.9% in the third quarter, which was the slowest rate this year but was above some analysts' expectations for expansion of 1.6%. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the number of new roles added over the last three months average at around 170,000. ""That said, forward-looking surveys continue to point to the trend in payroll growth slowing to only 50,000 or so by the turn of next year,"" he said. ""They might be wrong - shifts in sentiment don't always translate into shifts in action - but we aren't willing to assume that job gains will continue to trend at anything like 170,000."" "
Interest Rate Sentiment,Bank forecasts 'choppy recovery',2024-09-14,2010-08-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-10934302,"This video can not be played Mervyn King: ""It will take many years before fiscal positions return to anything like normal"" The UK economy faces a ""choppy recovery"" over the next two years, the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has warned. His comments came as the Bank lowered its economic growth forecast and said inflation would stay higher for longer than previously forecast. The Bank now expects the economy to grow by less than 3% in 2011, down from its previous forecast of nearer 3.5%. It added that a lack of bank lending would limit economic growth. ""It will take many years before bank balance sheets and fiscal positions return to anything like normal,"" said Mr King. ""In the meantime they will act as headwinds to the recovery."" Mr King also warned that following an ""unprecedented"" period the UK economy faced a difficult rebalancing ""away from private and public consumption and towards net exports"", and that this could also hit economic growth.  He added that there were some factors helping to keep the economy expanding, most notably the continuing economic stimulus measures and the fall in value of the pound. And although he said government spending plans were one of the reasons that the Bank had cut its growth forecast, he stressed that the chancellor's cost-cutting plans also reduce the risk of a new crisis for the economy. However, Mr King said it would be ""several years"" before the economy adjusts ""back to anything we can call remotely normal"". The Bank of England's Quarterly Inflation Report forecasts a range of different outcomes for GDP growth, which it publishes in a graph, with the darker central projection considered the most likely. The central projection in the latest graph shows that the Bank predicts growth somewhere between 2.5% and 3% next year, below its previous forecast, but above the Office for Budget Responsibility's current estimate of 2.3%. Hugh Pym, BBC chief economics correspondent, said the City considered that Mr King was being too confident about future economic growth. ""He is still quite optimistic for next year in the view of the City of London,"" said our correspondent. The Bank's report came after the latest official unemployment data showed a further fall in the jobless total. The number of people unemployed in the UK fell by 49,000 to 2.46 million in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics, the biggest drop for three years. The Bank said the main factor behind its prediction that inflation would remain higher than previously forecast was the government's decision to raise VAT to 20% from 17.5% at the start of next year. The most recent official figures showed that Consumer Prices Index inflation stood at 3.2% in June, above the Bank's target rate of 2%. Retail Prices Index inflation, which includes housing costs, was higher still, at 5%. Mr King stressed that inflation was likely to fall back below the Bank's 2% target in 2012, as next year's VAT rise drops out of the calculation. As a result, interest rates are likely to remain very low for some time to come. The Bank's warning that the UK faces a difficult economic recovery could increase fears of a double dip recession. However, while Business Secretary Vince Cable spoke at the weekend about his concerns of the UK falling back into recession, the Bank's own projections say this remains highly unlikely. Energy Secretary Chris Huhne also ruled out the likelihood of a double dip recession. ""The reality is that it's very unusual that there is a double-dip recession in economic history,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. ""And there are a lot of forces that are working to sustain the recovery. ""We've got good export growth. We've had a recent report on manufacturing. I'm delighted to say the government is really keen on manufacturing."" The Bank of England's report did little to improve investor sentiment, however, and the UK's main share index, the FTSE 100, extended early Wednesday losses caused by concerns about the state of the US economy. In line with other major markets, rattled by worries about the worsening outlook for the world's biggest economy, the FTSE 100 index closed down 131.20 points, or 2.4%, at 5,245.21.

Interest Rate Sentiment,Why businesses are pulling billions from China,2024-09-14,2023-11-14,By Annabelle Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67353177,"Foreign businesses have been pulling money out of China at a faster rate than they have been putting it in, official data shows.  The country's slowing economy, low interest rates and a geopolitical tussle with the US have sparked doubt about its economic potential.  All eyes will be on a crucial meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden this week.  But businesses appear to be already erring on the side of caution. ""Anxieties around geopolitical risk, domestic policy uncertainty and slower growth are pushing companies to think about alternative markets,"" says Nick Marro from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).   China recorded a deficit of $11.8bn (£9.6bn) in foreign investment in the three months to the end of September - the first time since records began in 1998.  This suggests that foreign companies are not reinvesting their profits in China, rather they are moving the money out of the country.  ""China is currently facing slower growth and needs to make some corrections,"" says a spokesperson for the Swiss industrial machinery manufacturer Oerlikon, which pulled 250m francs ($277m; £227m) from China last year. ""In 2022, we were one of the first companies to transparently communicate that we expect the economic slowdown in China to impact our business,"" the spokesperson adds. ""Consequently, we began early to implement actions and measures to mitigate these effects."" China remains a key market for the firm. It has close to 2,000 employees across the country, which accounts for more than a third of its sales. Oerlikon noted that the Chinese economy was still expected to post growth of around 5% in the next few years, ""which is among the highest in the world."" Since the onset of the pandemic, businesses like Oerlikon have contended with the challenges of operating in what is the world's biggest market. China had implemented one of the world's strictest pandemic lockdowns through its ""zero-Covid"" policy. This caused disruptions to the supply chains of many companies, such as technology giant Apple, which makes most of its iPhones in China. The firm has since diversified its supply chain by  moving some production to India. Mr Marro believes more companies have heeded calls for diversification this year, as tensions between China and the US rose with fresh export restrictions on raw materials and technology needed to make advanced chips. ""We aren't seeing many companies pulling out of China. Many of the big multinational firms have been in the market for decades, and they're not willing to give up market share that they've spent 20, 30 or 40 years cultivating. But in terms of new investment, in particular, we are seeing a reassessment."" Businesses are also considering the impact of interest rates. China bucked the trend as many countries around the world raised rates sharply last year. Many major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been hiking interest rates to tackle inflation. The higher cost of borrowing, which promises higher returns, also attracts foreign capital.  Meanwhile policymakers in China have cut the cost of borrowing to support its economy and struggling property industry. The yuan has depreciated by more than 5% against the dollar and euro this year. Rather than reinvesting China earnings back in the country, business are spending the money, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China says.  It adds: ""Those with excess cash and earnings in China have been increasingly transferring these funds overseas, where they will earn a higher investment return compared to investments in China."" Some firms had withdrawn earnings from China as ""part of their long-term cycles"" of taking profits ""once their projects reach a specific scale and profitability"", Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, observed.  ""The withdrawal of profits does not necessarily indicate that companies are unhappy with China, but rather that their investments here have matured."" Mr Hart says it's ""encouraging because it means companies are able to integrate their China operations into their global operations."" Canada-based aerospace electronics company Firan Technology Group invested up to C$10m ($7.2m; £5.9m) in China over the last decade, and withdrew C$2.2m from the country last year and in the first quarter of 2023. ""We are not exiting China at all. We are investing and growing our business there and taking out any excess cash to invest elsewhere in the world,"" says the firm's president and chief executive Brad Bourne. ""We had surplus cash in China and bringing it back to help fund our recent US acquisitions was just prudent cash management, and it meant that our borrowing was reduced,"" he adds. Analysts say there is much uncertainty about what lies ahead - both in terms of interest rates and China-US ties. China's central bank could move to lower interest rates further this year to support its economy, says Dan Wang, the chief economist of Hang Seng Bank China. Lowering interest rates could put more pressure on the already weakened yuan. ""There is very limited room for monetary easing right now because of the pressure of currency depreciation,"" she says. ""If economic sentiment improves next month, it's safe to say that China will lower interest rates. But if sentiment doesn't improve, the central bank will have a very difficult decision to make."" Businesses are cautiously optimistic about the upcoming meeting between Presidents Xi and Biden, says the EIU's Mr Marro. ""Direct meetings between the two presidents tend to exert a stabilising force on bilateral ties. We have also seen a flurry of US-China diplomatic engagement over the past couple of months, which has contributed to this feeling that both sides are aiming to put a floor under the relationship,"" he says.  ""That said, it doesn't take much for things to fall apart again. Until companies and investors feel like they can navigate with more certainty, this drag on foreign investment into China will continue."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Why cyclists enrage car drivers,2024-09-14,2013-02-12,Tom Stafford,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130212-why-you-really-hate-cyclists,"It’s not simply because they are annoying, argues Tom Stafford, it’s because they trigger a deep-seated rage within us by breaking the moral order of the road. Something about cyclists seems to provoke fury in other road users. If you doubt this, try a search for the word ""cyclist"" on Twitter. As I write this one of the latest tweets is this: ""Had enough of cyclists today! Just wanna ram them with my car."" This kind of sentiment would get people locked up if directed against an ethnic minority or religion, but it seems to be fair game, in many people's minds, when directed against cyclists. Why all the rage? I've got a theory, of course. It's not because cyclists are annoying. It isn't even because we have a selective memory for that one stand-out annoying cyclist over the hundreds of boring, non-annoying ones (although that probably is a factor). No, my theory is that motorists hate cyclists because they think they offend the moral order. Driving is a very moral activity – there are rules of the road, both legal and informal, and there are good and bad drivers. The whole intricate dance of the rush-hour junction only works because people know the rules and by-and-large follow them: keeping in lane; indicating properly; first her turn, now mine, now yours. Then along come cyclists, innocently following what they see are the rules of the road, but doing things that drivers aren't allowed to: overtaking queues of cars, moving at well below the speed limit or undertaking on the inside. You could argue that driving is like so much of social life, it’s a game of coordination where we have to rely on each other to do the right thing. And like all games, there's an incentive to cheat. If everyone else is taking their turn, you can jump the queue. If everyone else is paying their taxes you can dodge them, and you'll still get all the benefits of roads and police. In economics and evolution this is known as the ""free rider problem""; if you create a common benefit  – like taxes or orderly roads – what's to stop some people reaping the benefit without paying their dues? The free rider problem creates a paradox for those who study evolution, because in a world of selfish genes it appears to make cooperation unlikely. Even if a bunch of selfish individuals (or genes) recognise the benefit of coming together to co-operate with each other, once the collective good has been created it is rational, in a sense, for everyone to start trying to freeload off the collective. This makes any cooperation prone to collapse. In small societies you can rely on cooperating with your friends, or kin, but as a society grows the problem of free-riding looms larger and larger. Social collapse Humans seem to have evolved one way of enforcing order onto potentially chaotic social arrangements. This is known as ""altruistic punishment"", a term used by Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter in a landmark paper published in 2002. An altruistic punishment is a punishment that costs you as an individual, but doesn't bring any direct benefit. As an example, imagine I'm at a football match and I see someone climb in without buying a ticket. I could sit and enjoy the game (at no cost to myself), or I could try to find security to have the guy thrown out (at the cost of missing some of the game). That would be altruistic punishment. Altruistic punishment, Fehr and Gachter reasoned, might just be the spark that makes groups of unrelated strangers co-operate. To test this they created a co-operation game played by constantly shifting groups of volunteers, who never meet – they played the game from a computer in a private booth. The volunteers played for real money, which they knew they would take away at the end of the experiment. On each round of the game each player received 20 credits, and could choose to contribute up to this amount to a group project. After everyone had chipped in (or not), everybody (regardless of investment) got 40% of the collective pot. Under the rules of the game, the best collective outcome would be if everyone put in all their credits, and then each player would get back more than they put in. But the best outcome for each individual was to free ride – to keep their original 20 credits, and also get the 40% of what everybody else put in. Of course, if everybody did this then that would be 40% of nothing. In this scenario what happened looked like a textbook case of the kind of social collapse the free rider problem warns of. On each successive turn of the game, the average amount contributed by players went down and down. Everybody realised that they could get the benefit of the collective pot without the cost of contributing. Even those who started out contributing a large proportion of their credits soon found out that not everybody else was doing the same. And once you see this it's easy to stop chipping in yourself – nobody wants to be the sucker. Rage against the machine A simple addition to the rules reversed this collapse of co-operation, and that was the introduction of altruistic punishment. Fehr and Gachter allowed players to fine other players credits, at a cost to themselves. This is true altruistic punishment because the groups change after each round, and the players are anonymous. There may have been no direct benefit to fining other players, but players fined often and they fined hard – and, as you'd expect, they chose to fine other players who hadn't chipped in on that round. The effect on cooperation was electric. With altruistic punishment, the average amount each player contributed rose and rose, instead of declining. The fine system allowed cooperation between groups of strangers who wouldn't meet again, overcoming the challenge of the free rider problem. How does this relate to why motorists hate cyclists? The key is in a detail from that classic 2002 paper. Did the players in this game sit there calmly calculating the odds, running game theory scenarios in their heads and reasoning about cost/benefit ratios? No, that wasn't the immediate reason people fined players. They dished out fines because they were mad as hell. Fehr and Gachter, like the good behavioural experimenters they are, made sure to measure exactly how mad that was, by asking players to rate their anger on a scale of one to seven in reaction to various scenarios. When players were confronted with a free-rider, almost everyone put themselves at the upper end of the anger scale. Fehr and Gachter describe these emotions as a “proximate mechanism”. This means that evolution has built into the human mind a hatred of free-riders and cheaters, which activates anger when we confront people acting like this – and it is this anger which prompts altruistic punishment. In this way, the emotion is evolution's way of getting us to overcome our short-term self-interest and encourage collective social life. So now we can see why there is an evolutionary pressure pushing motorists towards hatred of cyclists. Deep within the human psyche, fostered there because it helps us co-ordinate with strangers and so build the global society that is a hallmark of our species, is an anger at people who break the rules, who take the benefits without contributing to the cost. And cyclists trigger this anger when they use the roads but don't follow the same rules as cars. Now, cyclists reading this might think ""but the rules aren't made for us – we're more vulnerable, discriminated against, we shouldn't have to follow the rules."" Perhaps true, but irrelevant when other road-users perceive you as breaking rules they have to keep. Maybe the solution is to educate drivers that cyclists are playing an important role in a wider game of reducing traffic and pollution. Or maybe we should just all take it out on a more important class of free-riders, the tax-dodgers. 13/02 UPDATE: We've changed a sentence in the third paragraph that readers said implied all cyclists break rules. This was not the intended implication of the original line, and we thank the readers who pointed this out. Do you agree with Tom?

Interest Rate Sentiment,The surprising upsides of bad moods,2024-09-14,2022-01-04,David Robson,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211214-the-surprising-upsides-of-foul-moods,"It's sometimes tempting to beat yourself up for not feeling sunnier – but there's good reason to embrace those grumps. Imagine that you've just experienced something unpleasant – your friend has forgotten your birthday, you've been rejected for a new job, or you've just woken up on 4 January and remembered you need to go to work. How would you typically respond to those feelings? You might try to tell yourself that it doesn't matter, and not to let it get to you. You might try to avoid thinking about the bad news, and when it does seep into your consciousness, you’ll question why you're so thin-skinned. This tendency to screen out and self-punish could be described as ""mood shame"": the belief that having bad feelings is a personal failing. Continually looking on the bright side of life might seem strong, even courageous. But if it's taken too far, we may beat ourselves up for perfectly reasonable responses to events. While it's natural that we might prefer to avoid uncomfortable feelings like disappointment, worry, anger, or sadness, recent psychological research supports the idea that they serve useful purposes in our lives. By learning to see that value and accept those feelings without judgement, we may enjoy better physical and mental health.  You may also like: To be clear, when I write about our need to accept negative emotions, I'm not talking about severe depression, anxiety – or any other chronic mood disorder that needs professional help. There is nothing to be gained from prolonged and unbearable suffering if you need and are able to seek medical treatment and mental health support. Instead, I'm referring to the temporary clouds that may gather over our lives for a few hours or days. Those transient emotions don't really pose a threat to our long-term wellbeing, but we often act as if they do – and it's tempting to try to avoid them. As the Italian philosopher Ilaria Gaspari notes in her recent book Vita Segreta Delle Emozioni (The Secret Life of Emotions), our attempts to suppress our emotions can simply add layers of ""shame"" and ""fear"" to what we are already feeling, alongside an envy of those who appear to be happier in their life. The resulting sentiment, she writes, is even ""stronger and more tenacious"" than the thing we were trying to avoid. ""It took me a long time to understand that being emotional does not mean being unstable or unbalanced, but being alive, open and vulnerable to the experience of the world,"" she writes.  Gaspari was writing from personal experience, but a series of scientific studies confirm that our ""mood shame"" can be detrimental to our wellbeing. To get an idea of that research, consider the following questions. On a scale of one (never/very rarely true) to seven (very often/always true), how would you rate these statements? Questioning 1,000 participants, Iris Mauss at the University of California Berkeley found that the higher people scored on this scale, the more likely they were to report symptoms of depression and anxiety. They also tended to have lower overall life satisfaction and psychological wellbeing. People who accepted their thoughts and feelings without characterising them as ""bad"" or ""inappropriate"", in contrast, tended to have better psychological health. Seeing the good and the bad My personal interest in the consequences of ""mood shame"" began as I researched my book The Expectation Effect. There's enormous evidence that we can create self-fulfilling prophecies in many areas of life. In medicine, for instance, we know that people's interpretations of physical symptoms like pain can alter the way they experience them, and this can even influence our physiological response. I wondered if the same was true of our emotions. Rather than changing the feelings themselves, we might be able to change the way we think about them – and this might improve the experience itself and the long-term effects on our health. Disappointment, for example, may feel unpleasant – but you could recognise that the emotion helps us to learn from our mistakes. And by assigning a more positive meaning to the feeling and acknowledging its potential uses – rather than feeling it is somehow ""unhealthy"" – you might change the brain and the body's responses to an upset. Searching the psychological literature, I soon came across a study from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany that attempted to show exactly that. The researchers asked their participants to rate various emotions, such as nervousness, anger or feeling downcast, on their unpleasantness. They also asked people about their appropriateness, their utility and their meaningfulness – three dimensions that together captured how much the participants ""valued"" each feeling. Overall, the participants who saw a positive value in their ""bad"" moods tended to fare much better on measures of mental and physical wellbeing, including their risk of illnesses, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, and even their muscle strength (which was considered a general indicator of fitness). Indeed, a capacity to see value in unpleasant emotions almost eliminated any link between a participant's health and the actual number of upsets the person reported experiencing over a three-week period. Fuel for growth I've since discovered a wealth of evidence demonstrating how a recognition of an emotion's potential benefits can powerfully influence its effects.  Consider anxiety. We may assume that anxious feelings wreck our concentration and reduce our performance on difficult tasks – that we can only succeed on an exam or in an interview if we learn to relax. Alternatively, we can see the feelings as a source of energy. The actor Robert Pattinson apparently uses this strategy to deal with his nerves on a film set – and recent scientific studies suggest that this kind of attitude can improve our performance on short-term challenges, such as difficult exams or public speaking. In the long-term, it even reduces the risk of burnout and exhaustion. A similar expectation effect applies to angry emotions. We may believe that frustration quickly depletes our self-control, but we can alternatively see it as a galvanising emotion that steels our resolve and empowers us to demand what we're due. Those mindsets will determine your performance in tasks such as negotiations. Scientists are still exploring the ways that our perceptions of emotions can influence physical health, as observed in the Max Planck study – but the growing body of research on the physiological effects of emotion appraisal already suggests some plausible mechanisms. When we face a stressor that feels personally threatening, we are more likely to experience exaggerated fluctuations of hormones such as cortisol, and inflammation. Such physiological changes could help to prepare the body for short-term danger, but if they are sustained over a long time they can lead to bodily wear and tear. If we have the view that each bad mood is inappropriate, shameful or potentially damaging to us, that will compound our sense of vulnerability and isolation, which can exacerbate and prolong the physiological effects. Reappraising our emotions – so that we recognise their inherent value – can remove those additional layers of stress. It could even give us a sense of empowerment and autonomy. This may moderate the physiological response as we come to terms with the feelings, and help us to recover more quickly, with overall less strain on our bodies. Our interpretations of our moods may have important long-term consequences, according to one intriguing longitudinal study of more than 28,000 people. The participants were asked to report their levels of mental tension and anxiety, and whether they thought that stress would harm their health. Those expectations appeared to shape their risk of death. People who suffered from high stress and believed that the stress would cause them damage had much higher mortality over the study period than those who felt stressed but lacked the negative expectations of its effects. The scientists had controlled for a host of other lifestyle factors, such as income, education, physical activity and smoking before coming to this conclusion. That cannot prove causality, of course, so the finding needs to be taken with some scepticism – but it certainly fits the same overall pattern as the shorter-term studies, which all suggest that our interpretations of emotions are as important as the feelings themselves. Shades of grey The start of the new year may be the perfect time for us to put this more nuanced understanding of emotion into practice. For those in the northern hemisphere, it's colder and wetter, and the return to work can be a painful jolt after a week of festivities. Some of us may find that we're caught in the January blues while simultaneously yearning for a better life – creating feelings of boredom, frustration and sadness. Rather than judging yourself harshly for those feelings, you might lean into that bad mood, and allow yourself the self-care you need to get through it. Without fighting the emotions themselves, you could start to question whether those feelings have value. Perhaps they'll help you to identify an important change you can make in your life, for instance. We will sometimes experience periods of despair with absolutely no silver lining – and we'll need all the support we can get to move through them. In general, however, our moods are neither black nor white, good nor bad, but instead come in many shades – and by paying attention to those nuances, we may find it a little easier to weather life's storms. * David Robson is a science writer and author based in London, UK.

Interest Rate Sentiment,The violent TV universe gripping the US,2024-09-14,2022-12-21,Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20221213-1923-and-the-rise-of-the-latest-divisive-tv-universe,"Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren star in the latest drama from Taylor Sheridan, the man behind mega-hit Yellowstone. What is it about his shows that attracts millions, asks Caryn James. The first scene of 1923 reminds us exactly who the Duttons are. Taylor Sheridan's latest prequel to his hit Paramount series Yellowstone, about a family that owns a monstrously big ranch in Montana, takes us back to the great-great-great aunt and uncle of Yellowstone's hero, John Dutton III (Kevin Costner). A bloodied Helen Mirren – as that era's matriarch, Cora – chases a man through the woods with a rifle and shoots him dead. Then and now, the Duttons are the killingest family this side of The Sopranos.   More like this: – 10 TV shows to watch this December – The 21 best TV shows of 2022 – How a metal-detecting show went global In another ideal bit of casting, Harrison Ford plays Cora's husband, Jacob, a no-nonsense rancher who also offers a key to the family's ethos. When a small ranch owner challenges him about having too much land and power, Jacob says in a voice of steel, ""I have what my family fought for"", a line that could have come straight out of his 2022 descendant's mouth. It's the Duttons v the world, as they fight to hold onto their ranch at all costs, bribing and murdering along the way. 1923, which premiered on Sunday in the US, is the latest addition to a television empire so enormous it has a name, the Taylor Sheridan universe – or more simply, the ""Taylorverse"". Once a struggling actor, Sheridan turned to writing films with acclaimed screenplays that merged action and complex characters in Sicario (2015) and Hell or High Water (2016), and later wrote and directed Wind River (2017). But the old-fashioned Yellowstone, which he co-created, was a popular success that changed everything for him. Sheridan has since created 1923 and an earlier Dutton origin series, 1883, as part of a reported $200 million contract with Paramount for multiple shows. They include the current Tulsa King, with Sylvester Stallone, and The Mayor of Kingstown with Jeremy Renner, and two upcoming series, the contemporary Yellowstone spinoff 6666 and the CIA drama Lioness with Zoe Saldana.   What are the Taylorverse's politics? The three Dutton family series are a phenomenon partly because of their singular, retro vision. Sheridan's shows embrace the heroic myth of the Old West and of American individualism, reinventing it for today's increasingly divided country. It is a paradoxical vision. The shows have always acknowledged that white settlers usurped the land, tragically robbing and mistreating the Native Americans. At the same time, the series' message seems to be: Hey, the Duttons own it now, and they're in no hurry to give it back. The Dutton heroes speak most directly to those conservatives who want to return to a glorified past, when patriarchs ruled and the government left them to their own devices. But the shows are elusive enough culturally, and entertaining enough as drama, to reach liberal viewers, too. Sheridan has said that his series are not, as they are often called, Republican ""red-state shows"" – yet while they do avoid overt political statements, his claim is disingenuous. With Yellowstone's emphatic idea that the country was better in the past, its politics quickly became a flashpoint, a central part of the cultural conversation about the show. John Dutton is constantly battling the Native Americans and big corporations that want to take over his ranch. He rails against the government, city dwellers and environmentalists. In the current season, the show's fifth, he has become Montana's governor, running on the promise, ""I am the opposite of progress. I am the wall it bashes against"". Governor Dutton's political party is never acknowledged one way or another, but if that message isn't conservative (with a small c), nothing is. As the sociologist and cultural critic Tressie McMillan Cottom said in a discussion with Vulture about the show, ""Yellowstone is a powerful cultural object in large part because it does not feel like a political object to millions of people"". And just last week, The New York Times bluntly called the show ""a mirror for American politics"". The article that followed was a focus group with what the paper calls ""superfans"" from across the political spectrum about the show's appeal. The feature itself is an indication of how central Yellowstone has become culturally, even though the results are disappointing, with bland answers that praise the series for ""authenticity"" and for the Dutton family's tight bond. The trajectory of Yellowstone's cultural traction is easier to chart. The show premiered in 2018, and was popular almost exclusively in the heartland, but by 2021 it was US television's highest-rated drama overall.   In the last year alone it has gone from what Vanity Fair called ""The Most-Watched Show Everyone Isn't Talking About"", to generating a flutter of articles wondering why it didn't get Emmy nominations. That question shouldn’t be a mystery. The show is conventional and sometimes not very good, its dialogue on-the-nose and ridiculous. When John Dutton's daughter, Beth (Kelly Reilly), warns a business competitor: ""You are the trailer park, I am the tornado"", the line does not land as ironic or campy. But the series continues to expand its reach. According to The Wall Street Journal, by season four, 28% of viewers were in small towns and 28% in major cities, where it barely registered at first. Part of the secret of the Sheridan universe's success is that the natural landscape is vast and pretty, and the family's loyalties, betrayals and infighting can be absorbing even when the plot turns are ludicrous. In 1883, the Duttons headed West and Jacob's brother, James, created the Yellowstone ranch on the site where his daughter, Elsa, was buried. In over-the-top Western fashion, she staggered around with a poisoned arrow through her abdomen and even rode a horse before the arrow killed her. Elsa's excruciatingly overwritten narration ran through the series: ""The river doesn't care if you can swim. The snake doesn't care if you love your children."" Unfortunately, her voiceover turns up again in 1923, but at least she offers useful information, telling us that Jacob and Cora arrived in 1894 and raised James' two orphaned sons. And she follows Cora's lethal first scene with a voiceover that goes to the heart of the Sheridan world. ""Violence has always haunted this family,"" she says. ""We hunt it down, we seek it.""   A promising new entry  So far, it is great fun to watch Ford and Mirren gamely roaming around the Old West. Mirren, with the accent of an Irish immigrant, totes a rifle and drives a buggy. Ford wears a Stetson, rides his horse into town amid cars on the dusty street, and figures out how to survive a drought. Paramount+ released only a single episode for review (that premiere drew a large audience of 7.4 million viewers), so there's no way to know how well the series will hold up or how political it might become, but it is obvious that Jacob and Cara will face interlopers and changing times. More tellingly, the new series expands the scope of the Dutton story, positioning them in the context of US history itself. Jacob and Cora's great-nephew, Spencer (Brandon Sklenar), is now a big game hunter in Nairobi, having nightmares about his experience fighting in World War One. A subplot shows Native American girls at a boarding school where they are forced to abandon their own language, and where an abusive nun (Jennifer Ehle) raps their hands with a stick, and a priest (Sebastian Roche) beats both the nun and a student.   Sheridan's attention to the injustices Native Americans have suffered is an important strand running through his career. Wind River is a taut, first-rate drama about an investigation into the suspicious death of an Indigenous woman. And in Yellowstone, Thomas Rainwater (Gil Birmingham), the Chairman of the Confederated Tribes of Broken Rock, is a mostly sympathetic character who wants the Duttons' land back for his people and says he will use the white man's conniving business tactics to get it. That one thread tilts the Sheridan universe a bit so that it can't be seen as purely conservative.   Hitting all the notes of a Sheridan Western, 1923 also includes a cattle drive. If you're not a fan of long scenes of cattle or sheep moving across the screen, the fast-forward button is your friend. And Cora explains to her other nephew's fiancee that the Dutton men will always put the ranch before women; just get used to it. Yellowstone set that pattern, mixing the Western with melodrama and political undercurrents. In the current season John's son Jamie (Wes Bentley) is now Montana's attorney general, plotting against the family. Kayce (Luke Grimes), his youngest son, is married to a Native American woman, Monica (Kelsey Asbille), and they seem to flit between Yellowstone and the reservation from one season to the next. Beth, once a corporate shark, is back at the ranch, smoking and drinking constantly, bent on helping her father and on destroying Jamie. At times Yellowstone resembles Bonanza if one of the sons on that classic Western had been a vindictive, out-of-control, Daddy's Girl. But violence and scorn for the government and the law are the traits that best define the Duttons and the culture of the Sheridan universe, as if even the 2022 descendants still lived in the Old West. The family has a taste for vigilantism, a tactic the shows don't always condone but never actually condemn. In previous seasons, Jamie has killed a snoopy reporter and his own biological father. Kayce has killed his wife's brother in a range battle over cattle, and murdered a sexual predator because he deserved it. John ordered the deaths of two men who had kidnapped his grandson. He is positioned as the sympathetic hero even when he justifies murder, saying “We don't kill sheep, we kill wolves”, a sentiment based on the premise that you can't trust the government to find justice.     And as governor, he spends a lot of time complaining about being governor. The show is so cynical about politics and government that Dutton admits to his children that he is only in office so his power will protect the ranch. In a recent episode he chooses to stay home branding cattle instead of meeting the US President, who is giving a speech on the reservation.   Yellowstone never lets us know if that President is meant to be Joe Biden or a fictional counterpart. But at the same event, Rainwater makes what is the only specific political reference in all of Yellowstone's seasons. Distrusting the value of any president showing up, he says, ""Obama visited Standing Rock two years before he tried to run a pipeline through it"".    Whether that comment remains an anomaly or not, the outsized fictions of the Sheridan series have always stood in for real-life issues. The hunting, gun culture of the West is a core value of the Duttons, and divisive in reality. Beth Dutton's underhanded financial manoeuvres and the show's depiction of the corporate world send a message that big business has long been evil and corrupt.   Although Sheridan's empire continues to grow, he may have built the ending of Yellowstone into the series from the start. In 1883, a Native American points James Dutton toward the land that would become the family ranch and says, ""In seven generations my people will rise up and take it back from you"". James answers, ""In seven generations you can have it.""   The seventh generation is Kayce and Monica's adolescent son, Tate (Brecken Merrill), the grandson John has frequently referred to as his heir. Tate has always been the potential figure of reconciliation, both a Dutton and Native American. He may be the future for a country that was built on the division between its Native people and the settlers. But given Sheridan's slippery, retro West, don't count on it.   1923 continues on Paramount+ in the US and UK, while Yellowstone series 5 continues on the Paramount Network in the US and Paramount+ in the UK Love film and TV?

Interest Rate Sentiment,Retailers 'relatively subdued' about 2024 prospects,2024-09-14,2023-12-11,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67662181,"Northern Ireland's private sector economy contracted for a fifth consecutive month in November, a regular Ulster Bank survey suggests. However, the rate of decline appears to be easing. The service sector, excluding retail, bucked the wider trend and posted an increase in activity. Every month the bank asks a representative sample of firms about issues such as new orders, employment and exports. The bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said there were signs that some companies were expecting the economy to pick up next year. ""Sentiment amongst services firms hit a 22-month high but, given the ongoing cost-of-living squeeze and rising mortgage costs, it is perhaps not surprising that retailers remain relatively subdued about prospects for the year ahead,"" he said. Northern Ireland's economy started 2023 relatively strongly but official data and business surveys suggest it has been slowing since the spring as rising interest rates and the cost of living squeeze hit demand. Later this week the latest official data will show what was happening to services and manufacturing output between July and September. Despite slowing activity, the labour market has remained relatively strong, with the most recent unemployment rate at an all time low. The Ulster Bank survey also suggests that firms were continuing to recruit in November."
Interest Rate Sentiment,US jobless rate falls to lowest level since July,2024-09-14,2023-12-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67662809,"Jobs growth in the US was stronger than expected last month, in part boosted as striking workers in Hollywood and the car industry returned to work. Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said.  That helped to push down the jobless rate to 3.7% - the lowest level since July. The monthly report is being closely watched as the US central bank tries to cool the economy to reduce inflation, the rate at which prices rise.  The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to the highest level in more than two decades in an attempt to slow price rises, and investors are increasingly betting that rates have peaked for now and may even start to fall next year. But the latest figures, while welcome news for jobseekers, may confound those hopes.  As well as stronger-than-expected job gains, the report showed average hourly pay ticking up 0.4% from October.  Average hourly earnings have climbed 4% from November 2022 - a rate that analysts said was too fast for the Fed to declare its job is done. The strength of the US economy over the past year has defied expectations and persistently glum economic sentiment.  In the most recent quarter, it expanded at an annual rate of 5.2% - well above the trend in pre-pandemic years.  A strong labour market has helped sustain consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - though some retailers have warned of weakening sales in recent weeks.  Last month's job gains were driven by hiring at health care and manufacturing firms, as well as the government. Payrolls at retail, warehousing and transportation firms fell, despite heading into the holiday season.  Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the drop could be a sign that ""retailers are already nervous"", but might also reflect quirks from the Labor Department's efforts to adjust for seasonal trends.  Overall, the US has added an average of 240,000 jobs per month over the past year, the Labor Department said.  ""While job growth is falling compared to last year, it is holding up remarkably well in the face of a tough economic picture and slowing growth globally,"" said Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot. When the Fed started raising interest rates, many analysts warned it could trigger an economic recession, if higher borrowing costs prompted firms and households to slow spending dramatically.  That forecast has been increasingly abandoned.  Mr Carter said: ""The full effects of the rate hikes have not yet been felt, so the picture could deteriorate from here, but for now the economic picture is looking strong in the US and that will leave the Fed heading into next year feeling just fine about the job it has done to date."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Five cautionary tales of leadership in 2023,2024-09-14,2023-12-22,Alex Christian,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231218-five-cautionary-tales-of-business-leadership-in-2023,"Corporate missteps have been on full display during a tumultuous, unprecedented year in business and work. It hasn't been a smooth year in the corporate world for top brass. In an uncharted post-pandemic workplace, uncertain economy and environment of rapidly-shifting shareholder and employee priorities, business leaders have had to take high-stakes decisions without precedent. ""We've seen some leaders struggle to move forward with their business models in a new age of higher interest rates and greater employee demands,"" says Christopher Kayes, professor of management at the George Washington University School of Business, in Washington, DC. ""Many are operating from the same playbook of the pre-pandemic era – when workers were more compliant and had less leverage.  Although there have been plenty of successes, many CEOs stumbled ­– in several cases, they've left their posts or been asked to step down by their boards in record numbers as a result. Among them, five missteps stood out as cautionary tales of modern management. Inflexible policies at Grindr Leaders and workers have been struggling over return-to-office policies for years; in 2023, many bosses chose to assert their power. While many employers and employees found middle ground on hybrid arrangements, in August, CEO of dating app Grindr George Arison announced a sudden, inflexible return-to-office ultimatum for workers: come into the office twice a week, or take severance in October. While this policy worked for some people who already lived close to Grindr's ""hub"" cities of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington DC, it also meant scores of workers hired remotely would need to scramble to relocate – or lose their jobs. Kayes says Grindr's leadership failed to acknowledge the profound change its mandate would have on its workforce. ""There's been a long-held, mistaken belief that being the boss simply means issuing edicts or demands, and that people will follow. That's certainly no longer the case: when you make a big policy change that affects employees' lives, you need to consult them first. Grindr failed to do that."" Larry Robertson, a Sydney-based leadership coach and author, agrees Grindr's leaders failed in their duty to communicate their rationale with employees. A lack of notice alongside a hard deadline also rushed employees into making major life choices on the backfoot. The result was that nearly half of all Grindr employees rejected the mandate – and the app faced a media backlash. ""The reality is if you haven't got your employees on-side, then you don't have a thriving business,"" says Robertson. ""With such a huge loss of talent and a tarnished public image, it's hard to see how it can be the same organisation moving forward."" Customer alienation at Reddit As the rocky economy drove companies to worry about profits, many businesses looked for alternative revenue sources to shore up balance sheets.  In April, as it prepared for IPO, Reddit said it would begin charging for access to its application programming interface (API), the framework that enables third-party apps to be built around first-party data. API access is critical for users to both participate in and moderate content on the community's subreddits. In a June post on Reddit, CEO Steve Huffman also announced the social media platform would enforce data-rate limits in July, leaving third-party app developers scrambling to implement changes to keep their software working with Reddit's first-party framework.  ""Reddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidise commercial entities that require large-scale data use,"" wrote Huffman. While this may have been a good idea for long-term profitability, it came at the cost of the consumer relationship. Popular apps subsequently closed, the Reddit community protested and subreddit moderators enforced blackouts.  Kayes says that while Huffman's decision made financial sense, it alienated some of its dedicated userbase, perhaps permanently. ""Free platforms like Reddit have to make bold business moves if they want to generate funds and appeal to investors. But they should still include the customer's voice in how they move forward – the problem here came in the implementation, and how it was communicated."" Robertson believes Huffman's explanation should have gone further. ""If you're making a major change to a customer offering, especially one that's very popular, you need to communicate how it'll benefit them in the longer term. So, it's not just defending yourself in making a bottom-line decision, it's explaining to the customer how they can receive an even better service in the future."" Underestimating worker solidarity at GM In 2023, collective organising was at its highest level since 2019, resulting in a slew of high-profile strikes. In October, Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, became the first of the ""Big Three"" automakers to negotiate an agreement with United Auto Workers (UAW), six weeks into their sweeping strike. By that time, however, the company had already experienced losses of more than $1bn (£795m). Striking the deal – widely seen as a huge win for workers ­– helped stop GM from haemorrhaging revenue, as employees went back to work. Despite the fact workers and management were able to end the labour stoppage, Robertson says Barra's initial failure to appreciate the demands and power of the union resulted in major revenue loss as the strike dragged on. This was compounded by the fact Barra had been at the company her entire career. ""Often at big corporations, CEOs are hired hands, paid large salaries to move between companies. But Barra actually grew up with the company – she should have understood the sense of loyalty, belonging and community among auto workers,"" he says. Instead, Robertson believes Barra misread the determination of the UAW.  ""They were underestimated: in reality, workers have more power now than in the past. A CEO in a major corporation that is unionised should be able to bring their leadership on-side early, listen to them and understand what fundamentally drives them. It's possible to find common ground, that you're all working together for the benefit of the organisation, helping to build relationships – rather than be adversarial.""  Dramatic cost-cutting at Warner Bros Discovery Sometimes CEOs are brought in to shake up a corporate status quo. When David Zaslav oversaw the 2022 merger of Warner Bros and his smaller cable company, Discovery, his tactics rattled many industry insiders. Tasked with turning a profit amid more than $55bn (£43.8bn) in debt, Zaslav began issuing studio-wide cuts, including cancellations of films that had already been made, and mass layoffs that lasted throughout 2023. In June, he announced Warner Bros Discovery would eliminate Turner Classic Movies, a channel hugely popular among cinephiles. The community was so shaken that legendary Hollywood filmmakers Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson held a summit meeting with Zaslav.  Kayes suggests Zaslav's business plan was naïve: to succeed, he would have to make cuts in an industry famed for superstar talent, blockbuster productions and emotionally engaged consumers and workforce. ""That approach may work in the cable industry where there may be less star power and influence, but Hollywood is very different,"" he says. ""Here, it appeared as though he was taking on everyone.""  Low public sentiment on Zaslav's leadership also may have helped galvanise the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild (Sag) strikes that shut down the industry for much of the year, says Kayes. ""In the end, Zaslav was even taking on movie directors, some of the most powerful, influential and popular people in the world. In turn, he was cast as the Hollywood villain."" A hostile takeover at X Since its deal-closing in November 2022, Elon Musk's Twitter takeover has been the subject of many questionable business decisions. Throughout 2023, the billionaire founder of Tesla and SpaceX rebranded the social media platform to ""X"", laid off around 80% of staff and lost an estimated $75m (£69.7m) in advertising revenue after he endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in late November. Robertson believes Musk's unconventional leadership has failed in a company that already had an established following and singular work culture. ""At SpaceX and Tesla, companies he founded, he could build from the ground up and grow a community of loyal followers as he took on space and eclectic vehicles,"" he says. ""But Twitter was an organisation that had its own ethos, with workers used to a very different style of leadership."" Kayes describes Musk's decision making as ""erratic"". This includes recently attacking brands that had paused advertising on X, and stripping headlines from news article links posted on the platform. ""People may not mind seeing unconventional behaviour from leaders when it makes them stand out as unique and visionary,"" says Kayes. ""But once it veers into unpredictable and emotional territory, completely untied to conventional business norms, it becomes unsettling."" He adds X still has many problems to solve going into 2024. ""There remains ambiguity over who its leaders actually are – its new CEO [Linda Yaccarino] was announced in June, yet it's Musk that still seems to be pulling the levers and making public statements. That's led to broader concerns, declining monthly active users and advertising revenues falling by more than half."" Taking lessons into 2024 As the business world evolves, so has the role of the leader. Once expected to merely serve the bottom line, executives now face greater demands from all types of stakeholders, while economic conditions and workplace culture both continue to change. ""It's harder to be a leader now,"" says John Clifton, CEO of global analytics and advice firm Gallup, based in Washington, DC. ""This period emerging from the pandemic has been harder in some ways than 2020 itself – from inflation spiralling out of control, issues around hybrid working and a workforce that feels lonelier than ever. It's an incredibly challenging time for executives, undoubtedly."" The corporate failings of 2023 may provide some guidance, though – even if it's simply what not to do. ""Leaders serve the organisation – and that includes employees,"" says Robertson. ""The world has changed so much, but many leadership tactics haven't. So much of it comes down to communication, listening and having purposeful conversations so people feel included, respected and heard. Otherwise, that's when resentment builds and trust breaks down."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Big US jobs rise in January surprises again,2024-09-14,2024-02-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68183421,"Job creation in the US surged in January, as the economy continued to defy predictions of a slowdown. Employers added 353,000 jobs and average hourly pay jumped, while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the Labor Department said.  The report extended a streak of job gains that has surprised economists, who have expected a jump in interest rates since 2022 to slow the economy. Analysts said the job market strength made an early rate cut less likely.  ""The US employment data provided a shock, beating expectations by miles, with earnings much higher than expected as well,"" said Neil Birrell from Premier Miton Investors. ""These numbers show the US economy to be strong and will sway anyone thinking a March rate cut was on the way to look further out. Any thoughts of recession are off the mark as well for now."" The US central bank started raising rates two years ago, responding to price inflation that was rising at the fastest pace in decades.  Higher borrowing costs aimed to cool economic activity and ease pressures pushing up prices.  Price inflation has come down from the high rates seen in 2022, and stood at 3.4% in December.  But strong household spending, initially buoyed by pandemic-era savings, has kept businesses humming, generating a kind of virtuous cycle, as the healthy jobs market in turn sustains consumer spending.  Friday's report showed hiring in December and November were stronger than had been previously estimated. Health care and retail firms, as well as business and professional services, helped drive the job gains in January.  Overall, the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.3% in the September to December period. The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, this week said officials were hopeful that inflation would continue to fall without a more serious downturn. But he warned the bank wanted ""greater confidence"" before it declared victory and started to lower borrowing costs again. He said a rate reduction in March, as some investors had been betting, was unlikely.  Some analysts said the strong pay gains reported on Friday - with average hourly earnings up 4.5% compared with January 2023 - should worry those hoping to see inflation continue to fall quickly. ""Wages growing at this rate, in a labour market this tight, is a problem for the Fed,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.  Others warned that a fall in overall hours worked each week would undercut pay gains and complicated the picture.  With the US presidential election due in November, the monthly report has become a political flashpoint.  While surveys show consumer sentiment has improved in recent months, the mood remains significantly more downbeat than before the pandemic. Analysts said that while wage gains have largely caught up recent price rises, people are still coming to terms with higher costs.  ""You remember when you were paying $1 for something and now you're paying $1.17,"" said professor Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll. ""Adjusting to the new normal for prices - that takes a long time."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,House prices see biggest drop in 14 years - Halifax,2024-09-14,2022-12-07,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63886983,"UK house prices saw their biggest drop in 14 years in November, falling 2.3%, reflecting ""volatility"" in the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax. November marks the third month in a row during which prices have fallen with potential buyers playing safe by delaying purchases. The average UK house price in November was £285,579. Higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty, and the rising cost of living are all affecting the market. The annual rate of growth in property prices has now dropped from 8.2% to 4.7%. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: ""While a market slowdown was expected given the known economic headwinds - and following such extensive house price inflation over the last few years, this month's fall reflects the worst of the market volatility over recent months. ""Some potential home moves have been paused as homebuyers feel increased pressure on affordability and industry data continues to suggest that many buyers and sellers are taking stock while the market continues to stabilise."" However, she said that the falls should be put into context, given the rapid increase in property prices in the last few years. Property prices were up more than £12,000 compared with this time last year, and £46,403 higher than in March 2020 when the Covid pandemic began. The Halifax said Wales and the South West of England had recorded particularly sharp slowdowns in annual house price growth.  Both had been at the forefront of house price inflation during the pandemic, when the so-called race for space among buyers boosted demand for rural or coastal properties. The Halifax survey, based on the lender's own data, comes shortly after the rival Nationwide Building Society said prices fell 1.4% from October to November - the largest month-on-month fall since June 2020. Mortgage rates are much higher than at any time during the last decade, although earlier this week, the average rate on a new, fixed-rate two or five-year deal fell below 6% for the first time for two months. Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, said: ""With another fall in property prices in November, buyers and sellers are clearly demonstrating more caution due to higher mortgage rates and the ever-rising cost of living.  ""As with any fall in pricing, buyer sentiment and confidence is key. But considering the macro-economic and seasonal factors affecting all consumers, along with the month-on-month increases seen over the past 18 months or so, the decline needs to be put into context as it is still minimal."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Does Germany’s economy need more than a cup of coffee?,2024-09-14,2024-02-04,By Jonathan Josephs  & Jessica Parker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68181799,"""I'm afraid that we will actually miss out on the future, because we're taking too little risks."" Verena Pausder is a successful German entrepreneur who is clear about where she thinks the economy is going wrong.  This week, it was confirmed that Europe's biggest economy shrank by 0.3% last year. Whilst the country avoided recession - thanks to a statistical quirk - most economists think Germany will be in that position when the numbers for the first part of this year are published.  Germany's growth is being held back by the twin shocks of the energy crisis, caused by the war in Ukraine, and higher interest rates. There are also long-term structural issues such as ageing infrastructure, a labour shortage and the cost of tackling climate change. At January's World Economic Forum in Davos, Germany's finance minister Christian Lindner denied these problems made Germany the ""sick man"" of Europe. ""After very successful periods since 2012 and these years of crisis, Germany is a tired man after a short night, and the low growth expectations are probably a wake up call,"" he said. ""And now, we have a good cup of coffee, which means structural reforms, and then we will be continuing to succeed economically."" For Mrs Pausder, who is chair of the German Start-up Association and founder of the kids app developer Fox & Sheep a ""change in mindset"" is what's needed.  ""I think we're really good at kind of listing all the negative stuff and what we're not good at. And I think what we're forgetting is what we actually get done."" She points out that despite the downturn there were still 2,489 start-ups founded last year and the country is making good progress in the switch to green energy. Younger generations are more willing to take risks, she says. But as things stand, Germany's pension funds - which are worth more than $700bn - ""are not allowed to invest into asset classes like venture capital and private equity"".  ""We're used to these big brands of the past, and we want to do everything to have them in the future. And sometimes we put too much energy into conserving what we have [rather] then to investing in the new things."" Those big brands have traditionally sold huge amounts of cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals abroad, driving economic growth and influencing government policy.  However, foreign demand ""has been declining for many, many months"", says Dr Klaus Deutsch, the chief economist at the German Federation of Industries (BDI). Exports to non-EU countries were down 9.2% in December compared to the same time a year earlier. Dr Deutsch explains that Germany's recovery depends on the world's two biggest economies, as well as domestic concerns. For exports, he says, ""The question of greatest importance is whether the US economy can avoid a recession"" as well as if China can overcome the many challenges its economy faces. Around 7.5m people, or 16% of the workforce, are employed in manufacturing, and nearly half of what they make is sold abroad.  That gloom in the manufacturing sector is, he says, driving the pessimism amongst German consumers which ""is a bit worse than in most parts of the world"".  December's figures showed an uptick in inflation to 3.7%, which is still lower than many other major European economies. The rate at which prices are rising means people are holding back their spending on everything from cars to furniture. It's a sentiment that's not hard to find amid the hustle and bustle of office workers and tourists on Berlin's shopping hub of Friedrichstrasse. On a cold, but sunny winter's day one man tells us that he notices higher prices everywhere from his rent to his energy bills, as well as when he goes to restaurants. ""Berlin used to be a cheap city. That's not the case anymore.""  A woman tells us that for her family of five the weekly supermarket shop used to come in well under 100 euros. ""Now I spend well over that,"" she says.  A lady who says she has a ""good job and a good wage"" is doing ""ok"". However, she adds: ""I think in general things are going to get worse."" Despite the shrinking economy, the number of people in work has increased steadily over the last two years. That points to lower productivity. According to Moritz Schularick, President of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, ""Unhappiness isn't mainly driven by the current economic situation. It is driven by a deeper cultural unease as well as uncertainty and fear. There's a lot of angst."" That sense of negativity about the outlook is reflected in the latest GfK survey of consumer sentiment, which says crises, war and inflation are all leading Germans to save rather than spend.  Mr Schularick thinks the move away from cheap Russian energy is less of a challenge that the long term issues and December's court ruling which has forced Olaf Scholz's government into budget cuts.  ""One of the lessons we've learned from the UK and the 1930s, is that in these situations you don't want to antagonise parts of the population even further by making painful budget cuts because that feeds the extremes and populists."" Economic discontent has helped the political rise of the far-right AfD who are seen as against immigration. Amid a labour shortage that is something which is worrying business leaders such as the CEO of software giant SAP, Christian Klein. ""We are completely against any kind of extremism now, because we need to have those talents coming to us to innovate, to boost the economy. And that's why it was time indeed, to speak up not only for myself, but for the German economy."" The AfD's deputy leader Peter Boehringer denies his party is bad for business and says companies biggest problem is high energy costs which have been caused by bad government policy.  If Germany's economy is to return to growth innovation will be crucial, says SAP's Christian Klein. Germany's most valuable company saw the amount of money it took in grow 6% last year to $33.7bn.  ""Many companies actually turn to SAP, especially in macroeconomic challenging times."" He explains his company is helping its customers tackle challenges ranging from supply chains to climate change and productivity challenges caused by high inflation.  ""In Germany, I don't see a decline in IT budgets. What I actually see is that business leaders want to invest because they see tech as an opportunity to overcome those challenges.""

Interest Rate Sentiment,Stocks surge to record high marking market rebound,2024-09-14,2024-01-20,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68035276,"Shares in the US rose to record highs on Friday, fuelled by tech stocks and rising hopes about the economy. The S&P 500 index, which tracks shares of America's biggest companies, ended the day up 1.2% to close at 4,839.8, topping the previous record set in January 2022.  The new high means it has recovered from the tumble it took two years ago. Then, markets were worried over inflation and how the economy would respond. Now, as inflation eases and threats of economic downturn recede, investors have piled back into stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks firms meant to be representative of the economy, rebounded to hit its own record late last year, as optimistic investors bought up shares.  It notched another new high on Friday, rising 1% on the day.  The Nasdaq, where many tech firms are listed, surged 1.7% but remains about 4% lower than its 2021 peak.  For Wall Street, the new S&P record definitively marks out the current period, as shares recovered 35% from the October 2022 low, as one of rising share prices known as a bull market.  Investors have been cheered by hopes that the US central bank, which raised interest rates sharply in 2022 to try to cool the economy and slow price increases, is close to declaring victory and potentially starting to reverse course later this year.  That would lower borrowing costs and lift a weight on the economy, helping companies. At the same time, rate cuts would push investors away from investments tied to interest rates and towards shares, in a further boost to prices.  Tech companies have also been lifted by hopes that advances in artificial intelligence will unleash  new growth.  The improvement in sentiment is also trickling out to the public, who have seen retirement and investment accounts recover, while gas prices come down and price increases in other items ease.  The University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumers, a closely tracked barometer of mood, on Friday reported that sentiment this month had risen to the highest level since 2021, up more than 21% from a year ago. ""Consumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,"" the survey said.  ""Over the last two months, sentiment has climbed a cumulative 29%, the largest two-month increase since 1991 as a recession ended."""

Interest Rate Sentiment,Crash diet,2024-09-14,2013-12-13,Andy Martin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25351493,"Ireland's bailout exit has boosted the mood in the country Although Ireland's exit from the bailout programme does not in any way reduce the eye-watering level of debt it took on in 2010, it is hugely important, both inside and outside the country. The sense of reliance on the troika of the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank has been lifted, and the country, to an extent, has regained its economic sovereignty. The view of Ireland held by other eurozone leaders is greatly improved.  The Irish enjoy their status as members of the common currency, and the excellent transport infrastructure across the country owes much to EU funding.  Ireland has atoned for the reckless lending of its banks. Its people have endured harsh new taxes, reductions in wages, jobs losses and heart-breaking levels of emigration, and they have done so without overt dissent or disorder on the streets. Its prime minister Enda Kenny has been praised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel for implementing brutal cuts in public spending, and Ireland has proved to be the poster boy of the austerity she insisted upon.  The benefits are of course practical, as well as psychological:  Angela Merkel insisted that Enda Kenny (right) impose austerity measures Ireland has kept up its interest payments on the £57.4bn it was forced to borrow The bailout has been rather like an endowment mortgage: the capital remains, but the government no longer needs to draw down cash from Europe  Ireland is funded for the year ahead, having already returned to the bond markets to borrow sufficient monies to run its services for 2014, but its status as an investment pariah has diminished Interest rates on government bonds are manageable; some even describe them as favourable During the bailout, unemployment reached 15%, but that figure has fallen month-on-month for almost a year-and-a-half.  Some small business owners feel the remarkable feature is that 85% of people managed to stay in work, given the crippling effects the bailout had on international trading. Small to medium enterprises have had to shed staff, improve quality and many have been forced to close.  Some, however, take that typically Irish approach and now feel able to reflect on the benefits of the bailout.  One CEO, whose company managed to weather the storm, says that because banks stopped lending, he could not afford to buy new machinery, and had to balance his income and outgoings. While it has streamlined his workflow, it meant losing some valued colleagues. Taoiseach Enda Kenny insists that exports are at an all-time high, due in no small part to the country's reliance on multi-national pharmaceutical companies.  A critical feature of Ireland's tentative recovery has been its low corporation tax rate, which is just over half that of the UK.  Ireland's low corporation tax rate has attracted international investment Foreign direct investment is strong, benefiting from a well-educated workforce, and, in turn, adding skills.  The tech sector, particularly, is booming; hundreds of young people have joined the IT and social network giants who have headquartered in Dublin and Cork. Many spend a few years there, and leave with their own start-up ideas.  While there are many reasons to be cheerful, all of this masks the fact that Ireland has 300,000 fewer people than it did four years ago.  Of those who emigrated, 40% were Irish nationals, victims of the search for work.  Critics of the government's austerity plan say this explains the fall in unemployment.  There is also a ticking bomb in internal lending: about 100,000 mortgages are in arrears, prompting the troika to express concern about the precarious position of Irish banks.  Thousands will be forced to enter into personal insolvency agreements, whereby half of their mortgage will be parked, while they pay off the remainder.  While unemployment has fallen, critics of austerity blame increased emigration Ireland has chosen not to avail of a precautionary credit line from Europe, which is a signal of its economic confidence.  While the troika will continue to visit and scrutinise its finances, the man in charge of the public purse, Michael Noonan, is considered a steady hand at home and in Brussels.  The minister for finance is understated and unexcitable, and while many in Ireland despise the hurt they have had to endure over the past three years, there is an acknowledgement that the peak may have been reached. When Ireland was bailed out in December 2010, few would have predicted an exit.  The talk then was that it would take generations to clear the debt. It still might, but the mood is different now.  There are solid signs of recovery. Empty office blocks are being bought up, and the tourism, retail and even construction sectors are beginning to re-employ people.  However, Ireland's debt mountain makes it particularly susceptible to shocks elsewhere in the eurozone. If the other bailout countries experience problems, faith in Ireland's recovery will waver.  Internal consumption is also a problem. New household outgoings include a property tax, and a hike in health insurance, which leaves some families struggling to find between 1,188 euros (£1,000) and 2,376 euros (£2,000) extra per annum, leaving less purchasing power across the country. Perhaps what Ireland has going for it most is the attitude of its people.  While the Ireland of the 1980s was an economically grim landscape of dole queues and wastelands across its main cities, these were later replaced by an insatiable appetite to develop every square foot of land and property.  One businessman who works in the vital agri-food sector says the future is bright, ""as long as we play to our strengths and stop playing village pump politics"".  He points out that Ireland has the longest grass-growing period in the world, and the supply of value added foods is as sustainable a business model as any.  Far Eastern economies may be struggling for proteins to feed their burgeoning populations. ""Why do you think the Chinese keep visiting Enda Kenny?"" he asks. There is hope also that some of the money the government haemorrhaged into its banks may eventually be returned.  The Irish have been quietly arguing that its government only shored up the institutions temporarily, and that the EU stepped in just as it was due to get that money back.  A bailout was effectively imposed by Europe. Had the banks been allowed to fail, the crisis across the eurozone would have been much worse. If such a write-off were to occur, it could halve Ireland's debt. Added to this is a growing sense in Ireland that the bailout better served faceless bondholders and investors than the Irish themselves.  The construction sector was badly hit in the downturn but it has begun to re-employ workers New research suggests that the bulk of the capital loaned by the Irish banks actually came from sources in the UK.  Increasingly the Irish are asking who was really bailed out in December 2010, and why have they been asked to pay for it? That is an argument that could go on for years.

Interest Rate Sentiment,UK economy shrinks for the first time since 2012,2024-09-14,2019-08-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49290926,"The chancellor has told the BBC that he does not expect the UK to slide into recession after data showed the economy shrank by 0.2% between April and June. Sajid Javid was speaking after the Office for National Statistics said the economy had contracted for the first time since 2012. The surprise decline came after Brexit stockpiles were unwound and the car industry implemented shutdowns. The pound sank after the data was released, raising fears of a recession. Against the dollar sterling fell to $1.2025. Against the euro, it dropped throughout the day to €1.0736, a level not seen since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said manufacturing output fell and the construction sector weakened. A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters. This is the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2012. Economists had not been forecasting a contraction in the economy in the second quarter, but had expected it to stagnate, with the consensus forecast for 0% growth. The economy had shown 0.5% growth in the first quarter after manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost output, when the manufacturing sector recorded its biggest quarter rise since the 1980s. The ONS said GDP had been ""particularly volatile"" so far this year because of the changes to activity sparked by the original Brexit date of 29 March.  The statistics body said its latest figures showed that those increased stockpiles had been partly run down in the second quarter and that a number of car manufacturers had brought forward their annual shutdowns to April as part of contingency planning, which also hit growth. Mr Kent-Smith said: ""Manufacturing output fell back after a strong start to the year, with production brought forward ahead of the UK's original departure date from the EU."" He added that ""the often-dominant service sector delivered virtually no growth at all"". Mr Javid told the BBC: ""I am not expecting a recession at all. And in fact, don't take my word for it. There's not a single leading forecaster out there that is expecting a recession, the independent Bank of England is not expecting a recession. And that's because they know that the fundamentals remain strong."" The Bank said earlier this month it expects the economy to grow by 1.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.5% in May. Asked about the impact of Brexit, he said: ""We saw some significant stockpiling by British businesses in anticipation of the Brexit that never was, and now they're using those stockpiles, they're coming down.  ""Of course, there are businesses out there that are taking Brexit into account when they're making decisions."" He said: ""No one will be surprised by today's figures."" The data comes at a time when there are signs other economies are slowing. For instance, data on Friday showed that French industrial output fell more than expected in June. Mr Javid said: ""This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries.  ""But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong - wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we're forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year."" But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the ""dismal economic figures are a direct result of Tory incompetence"". ""The Tories' Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy."" The Liberal Democrats were also concerned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. ""Pursuing a no-deal Brexit is a political choice without a mandate: these figures show people's jobs and livelihoods are being sacrificed at the altar of political extremism, "" said Chuka Umunna, the party's Treasury and business spokesperson. Mr Javid said the best way to deal with Brexit uncertainty was to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. ""We're seeing volatility in the figures and one of the best ways to actually end this volatility is to bring certainty around Brexit and make sure we leave on 31 October."" The employers' body, the CBI, said the contraction was ""concerning"". Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, said: ""Growth has been pushed down by an unwind of stockpiling and car manufacturers shifting their seasonal shutdowns. ""Nonetheless, it's clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty.  ""As a result, business sentiment is dire."" The Federation of Small Businesses - which is calling for an emergency Budget - said that if the Treasury delays action until after 31 October, the date for Brexit, its efforts are likely to prove too little, too late.    ""Time is of the essence. Unless the chancellor steps in imminently with radical action, we could be heading for a chaotic autumn - and a very long winter,"" said the FSB's policy and advocacy chairman, Martin McTague.  Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the data showed ""an economy in decline and skirting with recession  as headwinds from slower global growth are exacerbated by a Brexit-related paralysis"". Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management said that while the global picture was ""becoming more gloomy"", anyone looking for positive signs for the economy could look to ""robust private consumption, reflecting a healthy labour market"". Household spending rose 0.5% on the quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that household spending was still growing at a ""robust rate"" and said it was not time to panic. He said the stockpiling was dragging on the economy, which was ""sluggish and had not stalled"". The pound - which has been at two-year lows following Brexit uncertainty - fell after the data was released. The currency also falls if there are expectations that interest rates will be cut. Mr Tombs said the market now sees a 70% chance of an interest rate cut in January, when Mark Carney is due to leave as the Bank of England's governor."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Sunny weather sees people splash out on new clothes,2024-09-14,2023-06-23,Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65995685,"Shoppers have been splashing out on new outfits and other items for enjoying the summer weather, boosting sales overall, latest retail figures show. After the sun came out in the second half of May, sales volumes rose by a stronger than expected 0.3%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Online retailers and garden centres did particularly well, the ONS said. Fuel sales also rose compared to April, but people bought less food as prices continued to rise. ""Retail sales grew a little in May, with online shops doing particularly well selling outdoor goods and summer clothes, as the sun began to shine,"" Heather Bovill, senior statistician at the ONS said. ""Garden centres and DIY stores also saw growth, as the good weather encouraged people to start home and garden improvements."" Food sales fell 0.5% in May. As well as price pressures, that could be due to the extra bank holiday last month, the ONS said, as more people ordered takeaways or went to the pub. Overall consumers are still buying slightly less than they were before the pandemic. But because prices have risen, they are spending significantly more in total. Prices are still rising, although inflation - the rate at which they are going up - has eased from over 10% at the start of the year to 8.7% in May. On Thursday, the Bank of England put interest rates up by half a percentage point to 5% in an attempt to dampen demand and bring down prices. Interest rates have been rising since December 2021 but that does not yet seem to be having a big impact on consumer spending. ""Retail sales in the UK were stronger than expected which may partly justify the jumbo-sized interest rate increase from the Bank of England,"" said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors.  ""It's hard to believe that tighter policy won't start having a significant impact sooner rather than later, meaning the consumer will react accordingly."" The online and High Street chocolate chain, Hotel Chocolat, issued a profit warning on Friday saying it expected to make a loss this year and lower than expected profits in 2024. The firm blamed ""ongoing weakness in consumer sentiment and continuing inflationary pressures"" for the shift."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Why Everest base camp won’t be moving anytime soon,2024-09-14,2023-05-29,By Navin Singh Khadka,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65723447,"Last June, Nepal's tourism ministry announced plans to move Everest base camp lower down the famous mountain because global warming and human activity were making it unsafe.  The camp sits on the Khumbu glacier which is thinning rapidly, creating risks for the hundreds of climbers who pass through every year.  But following opposition from the Sherpa community and other mountaineering operators, the idea has been shelved.  Sherpa leaders told the BBC the move was impractical and that there was no viable alternative location.  As the backbone of the mountaineering industry, the Sherpa's voice is crucial. Opposition to the move is widespread - more than 95% of attendees rejected the idea at a recent consultation with the mountaineering industry, say tourism ministry officials and the Nepal Mountaineering Association.  Officials told the BBC it means the move has to be shelved, although they maintain a study is still going on. ""I have come across not even a single person in our community who supports the idea of moving the Everest base camp,"" said Mingma Sherpa, chair of Khumbu Pasanglhamu, a rural municipality which covers most of the Everest region, including base camp.  ""We see no reason for the base camp to be moved in the near future."" Ang Norbu Sherpa, president of Nepal National Mountain Guides Association, echoed that sentiment to the BBC. ""It has been there for the past 70 years, why should they move it now? And even if they wanted to, where is the study on a viable alternative?"" Nepal's recently appointed tourism minister, Sudan Kirati, said the issue was not an urgent one. ""I have seen no interest or concern from any quarter on the issue of moving the base camp,"" he said. When government officials last year spoke of the plan, they said the new base camp would be 200m to 400m (656ft to 1312ft) lower than the present one, which sits at an altitude of 5,364m (17,598ft). The idea was to move it to a place where there would be no glacier, to avoid risks associated with accelerating glacial meltdown due to rising temperatures. The Khumbu glacier, like many others in the Himalayas, is rapidly melting in the wake of global warming, scientists have found.  A 2018 study by researchers from Leeds University showed that the segment close to base camp was thinning at a rate of 1m per year.  Field studies have also shown that ponds and lakes on the world's highest glacier were joining up and expanding, increasing challenges for mountaineers. ""As the ice melts, beneath the rocky debris the surface becomes more variable, encouraging the formation of surface ponds that gradually coalesce to form large lakes,"" said Prof Bryn Hubbard of Aberystwyth University, who led a three-year project to check ice conditions in the glacier.  Mountaineers and officials say streams have now begun to flow right from the middle of the base camp and crevasses are widening dangerously and very quickly. Adrian Ballinger, founder of mountain guide company Alpenglow Expeditions, said the plan to move base camp made sense, because it would see more avalanches, ice, and rock falls in the future. The president of Nepal Mountaineering Association, Nima Nuru Sherpa said he was aware of the dangers in the wake of global warming. ""But there is no clarity on where we move the base camp to, and this is why we hardly hear any supportive voices,"" he said. Many climbers of the Sherpa community have argued that the present location of the base camp is the best one to start their climb early in the morning as it adjoins the Khumbu Icefall, which is one of the most challenging sections of the climb. The icefall, on the South Col route to the summit of Everest, rapidly falls down the mountain opening large crevasses with little warning and dislodging huge towers of ice, known as seracs. It is also regularly hit by avalanches and rockfalls from the mountain slopes overlooking it on both sides.  Sherpa climbers say they need to cross the Khumbu Icefall early in the morning because it becomes more dangerous later in the day when the sun warms the mountain, resulting in increased avalanches, rockfalls and seracs collapsing.  ""If we moved the camp to lower heights, it would mean nearly three hours of extra walk for climbers and that will delay their journey to the dangerous Khumbu Icefall,"" said Mr Mingma. Three Sherpa climbers died on Khumbu Icefall on 12 April when they were hit by an avalanche while ferrying climbing gear for their clients. Mr Mingma said even if the base camp was moved to a lower location, most expedition teams would end up using the previous location as an advanced camp to begin their early morning climb through the Khumbu Icefall.  Lukas Furtenbach, an international expedition operator from Austria who brings his clients to Everest almost every year, says moving base camp would make the first stage of the climb too long. ""Teams would make an intermediate camp right at the current base camp location,"" he said.  But almost everyone in the mountaineering industry agrees that base camp is getting too crowded. This season, Nepal issued a record 478 Everest climbing permits, which means there will be over 1,500 people on the mountain, including support staff.  The last record number of permits was 403 in 2021, according to tourism department officials. The government charges $11,000 (£8,900) per climber for Everest and expeditions are a major source of income for the Sherpa community and others dependent on mountain tourism.  ""The size of the base camp has doubled over the years, it's a massive operation,"" said Dambar Parajuli, president of Expedition Operators' Association Nepal.  He added that the growth of the camp is unregulated and poses a threat to the already fragile environment. ""You see deluxe type services like massage parlours or other entertainment services that need massive tents and other structures. ""This is not where you indulge in luxury, and we have strongly suggested the government make strict guidelines on what is allowed and what is not at the base camp."" Minister Kirati said he was aware of the issues. ""The base camp has become like a tourist market that we see here in Kathmandu. ""This is not acceptable - we are soon going there on an inspection and will stop all that. That is our priority now."" "
Interest Rate Sentiment,Day six of Russia's war in Ukraine explained,2024-09-14,2022-03-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60576450,"On day six of the Russian invasion, Ukrainians woke up to the wailing sound of air sirens and news of Russian troops progressing towards the capital Kyiv.  Satellite images showed a serpentine armoured convoy, stretching across 65km (40 miles), inching towards the city.  Our chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet started her day in a basement shelter, where she met Rustam, who like many 13-year-olds was scrolling through Tik-Tok videos.   ""Are they coming here too?"" he asked her.  Later in the day, five people died when Russia attacked a TV tower in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials say. The attack came soon after Russia warned it was preparing to hit targets in the Ukrainian capital. A missile reportedly struck the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Centre which is close by. It is built on Europe's largest mass grave, where Nazi death squads killed more than 33,000 Jewish people in 1941. You can see more maps showing what we know of the day's developments here: Day 6: Tracking Russia's invasion in maps Missiles also hit government offices in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, killing at least 10 people.  It prompted an accusation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinsky that Russia was committing war crimes, as there were no military targets in the area.  Residents have been fleeing the city and telling their stories.  One of our reporters in Ukraine, Joel Gunter, spoke to Alexandra, a hairdresser who left with her young son.  She said she hopes to return, echoing the sentiment of many Ukrainians by saying ""I have never felt so much love for my homeland and for my city"".  ""The Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the West to protect our sky. We are asking for a no-fly zone."" This was the impassioned request from a Ukrainian woman who confronted UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson at a news conference on Tuesday.  But despite Russian strikes hitting residential areas of Ukraine, and a mounting civilian death toll, there is little chance that the West will implement a no-fly zone.  Why a Ukraine no-fly zone is a no-go for the West One of Russia's richest men has said imposing sanctions on oligarchs would have no impact on Moscow's decision to launch a war in Ukraine. Ukraine-born billionaire banker Mikhail Fridman told a press conference in London the war was a tragedy for both sides. But he stopped short of direct criticism, saying personal remarks could be a risk not just to himself but also staff and colleagues.  By the BBC's John Simpson  Ukraine has fought back much harder during the first week than Vladimir Putin expected, or very probably than his generals promised him, it would. But these are still the early stages of what could be a very nasty war. Putin must have hoped that a few days after Russian forces invaded, Kyiv would have fallen. And he surely expected that Western countries, cowed and divided, would have accepted that he had reclaimed a territory that he says is historically part of Russia. None of this has happened. Ukraine has proved a hard nut to crack, and the reaction of Western countries, particularly Germany, has been far fiercer than he thought. Russia's economy has already been savagely hit. Putin's one big friend, China, now seems worried that this Western upsurge of anger might, one day, be turned against China itself - and that serious damage could be done to the Chinese economy. It has already distanced itself from the invasion. Now Putin will have to reach for new options. He has always refused to back down when he is rebuffed. He will hit back harder - and he has the weapons to do it. Read more from John Simpson here You may be reading this far from the war zone. But if you see the news each day and feeling increasingly worried, you are not alone.  After a two-year pandemic which already raised anxiety levels and stress for many people, news of a war is lot to absorb, and experts agree that feeling overwhelmed is normal. Here is their advice on how you can take care of yourself, your kids - and others."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Firms 'running out of patience' on Brexit,2024-09-14,2018-07-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44690124,"Firms are running out of patience over the lack of progress in the Brexit talks, a major business organisation has warned Theresa May. The British Chambers of Commerce has published a list of 23 ""real-world"" questions that it says urgently need answers as the UK's EU exit approaches.  The list covers subjects including VAT, tariffs, customs and regulations. The BCC said companies were no clearer on these critical issues than they were immediately after the referendum.  The questions include: The last 10 days have seen a number of high-profile businesses, including Airbus and BMW, warn that further investment in the UK was already under review and that leaving the EU without a deal could see production relocated.  Some cabinet ministers have dismissed these, but the director general of the BCC, Adam Marshall, defended the right of firms to speak out when practical questions affecting their business and the livelihoods of millions remained unanswered. ""Over the past two years, businesses have been patient,"" Mr Marshall said. ""Now, with the time running out ahead of the UK's exit from the EU, business patience is reaching breaking point. ""It's time for politicians to stop the squabbling and the Westminster point-scoring - and start putting the national economic interest first.  ""These are not 'siren voices' or special interests. They are the practical, real-world concerns of businesses of every size and sector, in every part of the UK."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""We're confident of getting a good deal with the EU to ensure trade remains as free and frictionless as possible. ""Ministers continue to work closely with business to understand their concerns, and by successfully negotiating the implementation period with the EU until December 2020, companies can carry on trading with confidence on the same terms as they do now. ""We have put forward workable proposals to the EU on a range of areas from the backstop to security - and the White Paper, which will be published shortly, will continue to drive this process forward."" Last month, the BCC cut its UK growth forecast for 2018 from 1.4% to 1.3%, warning that the economy faces its weakest year since the financial crisis. Uncertainties around Brexit, interest rate rises, threats of trade wars and rising oil prices were all hurting sentiment, the BCC said. In another development, the Professional and Business Services Council, which represents accountancy firms and legal services, has written to the prime minister expressing fears that its members' interests are not being taken into account in the Brexit negotiations. The PBSC said: ""We fear that both the interim and final deal with the EU will not fully include the fundamental requirements to avoid sustained harm to our sectors and our clients, and thereby the wider economy."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Rebooting the case for Scottish independence,2024-09-14,2018-05-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44252435,"Four years on from That Referendum on Scotland, and what's changed? Well, quite a lot, thanks to Brexit, three national elections, a new first minister, a new prime minister, the rise of Richard Leonard and Rees-Moggery, plus an oil and gas slump. But the polling figures on independence have barely shifted. ""Why?"" I was asked this week by a semi-detached Nationalist.  ""Because the arguments haven't moved,"" he answered himself. Neither side has reflected, in public at least, on where their arguments needed sharpening up, least of all on the economic questions. Until today - 25 May 2018. Remember the date. It just might turn out to be significant. The Sustainable Growth Commission will take some digesting. It's a weighty, meaty document. From what I've been told about its recommendations, it retains much of the sunny optimism that buoyed the Yes campaign in 2014, but to that has been added a big dollop of candour. As an economic prospectus for independence, it recognises that people were not sufficiently reassured in 2014, least of all about their pensions, savings and mortgages. They heard glib assurances back then that negotiations with Westminster would go swimmingly, because that would be in Westminster's interest. Downing Street would give Scotland what was asked for, including joint control of sterling. Transition costs were so low as to lack any serious costing. And a higher economic growth rate would flow from an enlightened administration taking all the right policy and fiscal decisions, without facing economic or political headwinds or any internal contradictions on lowered tax and higher spending. I recall one Yes supporter wryly comparing the sentiment of the movement back then to the Summer of Love in 1967. Everything good was possible, and all at once. Nothing bad need happen. It was groovy, man. Andrew Wilson is no hippie, though he draws deeply on the pipe of positivity and optimism. The commission he has led has applied candour to each of the weaker points in the 2014 economic prospectus, and conceded some ground to the critics of independence, in the interests of credibility. Take the currency for instance. The new plan does not seek shared control of the Bank of England.  It takes the word of the former governor, Lord (Mervyn) King, that Scotland could certainly be independent, and it could use sterling, but at one big cost: Holyrood would have to accept whatever monetary decisions are made in the City of London, and made in the interests of a London-dominated nation that no longer included Scotland. If Scotland's economy were out of sync with the cycle in the UK, that could be painful. That's how it was in the 1990s, and Alex Salmond railed against it. But in recent years, London has been the outlier, and Scotland has been at or near the UK average. So interest rate and financial policies set for the British middle ground, even without Scotland in Britain, might have suited Holyrood just fine. A central bank would be set up, without control over interest rates, and there would be a regulator, but with a light workload, as the banks would have shifted at least their brass plates south of the Border, to be regulated from London.  Any smaller financial institutions, still based in Scotland, would have low expectations of a bail-out - though since the crash, that's now the message to all lenders. Or take fiscal policy. The Wilson Commission gulps in full the harsh message from GERS - Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland.  A deficit, including oil and gas revenue, at nearly 10% of national output, or Gross Domestic Product, is not sustainable, it is conceded. So what to do? A lot of work has gone into the answer. It is not simply to grow the economy faster, as the name of the commission suggested it should. The days of the tiger economies, at least in Europe, have gone.  The best hope for boosting growth in the short term - productivity being a longer-term project - is seen as a boost to immigration, with a ""Come to Scotland"" campaign, and financial incentives thrown in.  That's easy for an economist to say: less so for a politician (I intend to return to the question of growth once I've had a chance to digest the recommendations). A key element of the Wilson answer to the fiscal question is discipline on spending. This looks like, politically, the most difficult factor to manage, in an excited environment where expectations can run away from reality. The constraint would not be a real terms cut, but instead a very small increase, at 1% below the cash terms increase in economic growth. For example, suppose 2% inflation and 1.5% real growth, which is not an unreasonable target, meaning 3.5% cash growth. Pare that back to a disciplined 2.5% increase in public spending, and you could guess that would make for uncomfortable discussions round the Cabinet table.  The aim, remember, is to be doing this over the years when immense pressure is expected to build on health and social care budgets. The Wilson report adds to that a cut in defence, including the nuclear deterrent budget, to 1.6% of national economic output (To be clear: Trident money would not be spent on other priorities. It would be put into deficit reduction). Then review tax collection and get it to the same level of efficiency as the best of smallish nations. There's a call for a rigorous review of all spending, to ensure that the government doesn't keep spending on the priorities of 10 or 20 years ago, just because it's aye been, and because those programmes are too difficult to cut. And oil and gas? No, that is taken out the equation, to be treated as a windfall, and put into a future generations fund for long-term projects. All this assumes a taxing and spending regime which doesn't depart much from what we have at the moment. In the early years, it does not encourage people to think that Scotland would shift either to a high-tax, high welfare Scandinavian model or low tax and low regulation. Nor does it battle through the thicket of possibilities around Brexit, and where Scotland might find itself over the next few years.  For five to 10 years of such a fiscal plan, it is reckoned that an independent Scotland would be running a deficit and building up debt. Modelling with what they say are conservative assumptions, the deficit would fall to 3% in the ninth year.  That's the level widely seen, as in euro currency rules, to be a safe and stable level of deficit. Only then could the government start to look at the five other tests being set for creating a Scottish currency - a small package of tick boxes designed to reassure voters and the markets with a canny nod to caution. So while leaving monetary policy to the Bank of England, and requiring tight discipline on spending, the rhetoric of independence or even ""taking back control"" begins to lose its shine. Critics of independence might well question if it would be worth all the effort, and £450m in estimated transition costs, only to find that a change in constitutional status hasn't moved the dials much.  But that's one of the many lessons we're in the early stages of learning from the Brexit process. ""Taking Back Control"" in an open, modern economy is something of a mirage. Even a sovereign parliament is constrained by international agreements and market orthodoxies.  And even at Whitehall's scale and depth, the capacity of government to negotiate and and to manage upheaval is itself a major constraint.  In turn, that places tight limitations on what else it can be expected to achieve in managing or reforming public services. Unpicking economic unions, whether 45 years in the making in Europe or 311 years in Britain, is much more complicated than it might look at first. Bigger and established players in negotiations tend to have most leverage.  When it's done, independence has to be combined with some dependence and a lot of inter-dependence, requiring compromise. And as the Swiss sometimes observe about their relations with Brussels, the negotiations never stop. In that sense, though in few others, the Brexit negotiations may be doing the Scottish constitutional debate a favour. Looking at London and Brussels, Scots can see and smell the rubber hitting the road.   Voters may be more likely, therefore, to seek and reward candour, rather than jumping on the bandwagon painted in the brightest red and sporting the most populist slogan. That's among the big challenges thrown down by the Wilson Commission. The report gives the independence movement something big and meaty to chew on, and to debate internally, perhaps then to move the dials in its direction on the Yes and No polling.  It throws down the gauntlet to opponents of Scottish independence to reflect at least as seriously on the campaign they ran in 2014. They got the majority. But at least some must surely be wary of complacency. Would the same campaign and arguments work again, in the wake of Brexit, and against the Andrew Wilson prospectus? And the report is also a challenge to all of us who take some part in the debate about Scotland's future.  From what we know about it so far, the report of the Sustainable Growth Commission sounds like a serious document for serious times.  It is a more mature approach than we've seen for a long time, and surely demands a mature response."
Interest Rate Sentiment,US jobs growth jumps in July despite slowdown fears,2024-09-14,2022-08-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62438987,"US employers added more than 500,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate dropped, defying fears that the labour market is heading for a slowdown. The jobless rate fell to 3.5% from 3.6% in June, as restaurants, bars and other firms continued to add workers. The report from the Labor Department was far stronger than expected, after recent data showed the US economy continuing to shrink. The US central bank is raising interest rates to rein in surging prices. Higher borrowing costs reduce spending and economic activity. But top economic officials in the US have said they hope the US labour market will remain strong enough to allow the Federal Reserve to raise rates without triggering a recession. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who previously led the bank, said last week that the economy was shifting from its booming post-pandemic recovery to a more solid and steady phase of growth. But fears of a sustained slowdown have mounted, as consumer confidence falls, the housing market slows and some firms announce job cuts or plans to slow hiring. ""The unexpected acceleration in non-farm payroll growth in July, together with the further decline in the unemployment rate and the renewed pick-up in wage pressure, make a mockery of claims that the economy is on the brink of recession,"" said Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics.  The US has now regained all 22 million jobs lost when the pandemic hit in 2020, the Labor Department said. The jobless rate has also returned to its pre-pandemic level,hovering at 50-year lows. For Hispanic and Latino workers, the 3.9% jobless rate in July was the lowest since record keeping began in 1973.  Product manager Ian Charles lost his job a few weeks ago when his financial technology company announced a wave of cuts, citing the shift in investor sentiment that was making it harder for start-ups to raise money. The 33-year-old was surprised - and initially, panicked, remembering how difficult his job search had been a few years earlier. But this time, he said, ""it's a totally different ballgame."" ""People have really been coming out in droves on LinkedIn - both people I actually know from grad school and former colleagues to just random recruiters,"" he said.  He said he felt confident he would have a new job lined up in a few weeks. ""I was panicking at the start ... but this time around I've seen in a month how much easier it's been to get traction,"" he said. ""Opportunities keep coming, which is really weird to me because everyone keeps talking about how we're headed for a recession and things could be slowing down, but I don't see it reflected on the ground."" Analysts said the robust hiring makes it likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates aggressively. The bank has already announced rate rises four times since March, responding to consumer prices that are increasing at their fastest pace since 1981. The inflation rate surged again in June to 9.1%. Wages are rising too - but not as fast. Friday's report showed average hourly pay up 5.2% compared with July 2021.  Economist Jason Furman, who advised former president Barack Obama and now teaches at Harvard, said that the jobs report was ""uncomfortably hot"". ""Nice to see this many jobs added but it is scary about what it means for the size of the adjustment we may have coming,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Recession is now less of a worry. Inflation is more of a worry. The Fed will likely need to do more."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Brexit 'to hit' housing market into 2019,2024-09-14,2018-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46538831,"Uncertainty and gloom about Brexit are likely to hit the UK housing market well into next year, surveyors believe. The latest report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) predicts that the number of homes being sold - and their prices - will fall over the next three months. Fewer people are interested in moving, and fewer want to sell. Each home is already taking an average of four months to sell, the longest period since records began in 2016. ""It is evident from the feedback to the latest RICS survey that the ongoing uncertainties surrounding how the Brexit process plays out is taking its toll on the housing market,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS' chief economist. ""Indeed, I can't recall a previous survey when a single issue has been highlighted by quite so many contributors."" Reacting to the report, experts at Capital Economics said they expected the number of house sales to continue falling next year. However they estimate that prices will still rise by 1% in 2019. RICS is also concerned that the rate of house-building itself could slow down, because of Brexit worries. ""The bigger risk is that this now spills over into development plans making it even harder to secure the uplift in the building pipeline to address the housing crisis,"" said Mr Rubinsohn. The RICS survey - carried out in November - suggests that most surveyors are considerably more pessimistic about the market than they were just a month before. The Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, said last month that house prices could fall by as much as 30% in the event of a ""disorderly"" Brexit - in other words a no-deal scenario. However there is some regional variation, with surveyors in the north of England and Northern Ireland less pessimistic. Surveyors in these two areas were the only ones who said they expected prices to rise over the next three months. David Nesbit, a surveyor from Portsmouth, has views typical of many of his colleagues in the south of England. ""Brexit, the Bank of England and Christmas - what more to depress sentiment! A very difficult period is ahead,"" he said. Chris Clubley, from Market Weighton in Yorkshire, said he believed the effects of Brexit uncertainty would last even longer. ""The market is currently being affected by the uncertainty of Brexit and potential interest rate rises. We expect the market to remain difficult for the next two years."" Mark Hunter, from Doncaster, said the outlook for the property market remained very uncertain. ""The Brexit negotiations are now becoming farcical and affecting confidence. The thought that anything could happen in the next few months is a very worrying prospect,"" he said."
Interest Rate Sentiment,US inflation hits 7.9% as fuel and food costs rise,2024-09-14,2022-03-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60696125,"Price increases in the US continued to surge last month, pushing the annual inflation rate up 7.9%. That is the biggest year-on-year leap since 1982 and up from the 7.5% rate reported in January. Rising costs for energy, food and shelter drove the gains, which are squeezing household incomes. President Joe Biden and central bank officials are under pressure to rein in the increases, which have proven more persistent than many expected. The Federal Reserve - the US central bank - is widely expected to raise interest rates at its meeting this month.  In the UK - where inflation hit 5.5% in January - the Bank of England has already increased rates, while the European Central Bank on Thursday said it would wind down some of its pandemic-era stimulus sooner than expected in response to the price pressures.  At a news conference, ECB president Christine Lagarde said: ""The risks to the economic outlook have increased substantially with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and are tilted to the downside"". The war will have ""a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence"", she warned. The US and other parts of the world have already been grappling with high inflation for months, as a surge in demand, fuelled in part by pandemic aid, ran into supply constraints, labour shortages and other issues. The war in Ukraine has added to the problems, driving a global surge in energy prices as the West and allies shun oil from Russia - typically responsible for about 7% of global supply. Energy prices in the US jumped 3.5% in February, driven by a 6.6% leap in gasoline prices, according to the Labor Department's monthly report on consumer prices.  Over the past 12 months, the energy index has soared more than 25%, with gasoline surging 38%.  Americans who own SUVs are now paying an average of $110 per month more than a year ago to operate their vehicle, according to research from Cox Automotive. Even drivers of hybrids have seen monthly costs jump about $40, the firm estimated. The surge in energy costs will push up prices far beyond the gas pump, said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler. ""We're focused on that headline crude number, but that crude is used as an input to produce all manner of products,"" he said. Grocery prices in the US jumped 1.4% last month, driven by rising costs for meat, fruits and vegetables. They are up 8.6% year-on-year - the largest annual leap since 1981.  Analysts expect the increased costs of energy and other commodities due to the war will push US inflation even higher in March, hitting 8% or more. As the rising costs outpace wage gains, they have hurt consumer sentiment, creating a political problem for President Joe Biden. He has been criticised by Republicans on the issue, which few economists expect to ease in the near-term. ""Inflation continues on at a blazing pace,"" Wells Fargo economist Sarah House said. ""Consumers and policymakers remain in a deeply uncomfortable state as a result."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Lib Dems eye blue wall seats after Tory turmoil,2024-09-14,2022-11-05,By Jonathan Blake,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63514048,"It can be hard for the Liberal Democrats to make themselves heard at the best of times, but recently the party has been particularly unlucky.  For two years running the Lib Dems have been unable to gather in person for their annual conference, while other parties' events went ahead - robbing them of a guaranteed moment in the media spotlight.  The aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 and the death of the Queen this year left them with little choice but to cancel the biggest event in their calendar.  This weekend, party leader Sir Ed Davey is touring Lib Dem target seats and will make a speech in London in an attempt to renew his offer to voters.  But languishing a distant third in opinion polls and with only 14 MPs, where does the party sit after months of political turmoil at Westminster? Party insiders point to a run of by-election wins and bold policy pitches as proof the Lib Dems are able to punch above their political weight.  A surprise victory in the Conservative seat of Chesham and Amersham in June 2021 was followed by wins in other Tory strongholds - North Shropshire later that year and Tiverton and Honiton in June.  The Liberal Democrats hope to replicate this across the so-called 'blue wall' of Conservative-held seats with more affluent and higher educated populations that voted largely to remain in the EU.  Top of the list is Wimbledon, where the party lost by just 628 votes in 2019. The Lib Dems report plenty of anti-Conservative sentiment on the doorstep in the leafy south London enclave which returned a Labour MP in 1997 but has been held by the Tories since 2005. One campaigner was told by a life-long Conservative voter they regretted supporting the party in 2019 and were ""ready for change"", summing up similar sentiment from others. But conscious of becoming pigeon-holed as a political refuge for liberal Conservative voters fed up with the direction under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak, the Lib Dems are keen to stress their electoral ambitions extend beyond the south of England.  In Greater Manchester, for example, the party is looking to build on second place finishes in 2019 in Cheadle and Hazel Grove, where it recently took control of Stockport Borough Council in this year's local elections.  Common among the party's target seats is a high proportion of home ownership, leaving voters in these areas exposed to the impact of recent interest rate rises.  Recent polling conducted on the party's behalf suggested a majority of Conservative voters blamed the government for rising mortgages, compounding the Lib Dems' message that the blue wall is being ""hit hardest"" by the knock-on effects of an increase in interest rates.  In the aftermath of the tax-cutting mini-budget delivered by Kwasi Kwarteng in September, a  poll found two thirds (68%) of people who had voted Conservatives in 2019 said the government would be to blame if mortgage bills subsequently increased.  That poll of 2,240 adults aged 18+ was conducted by Savanta ComRes between 30 September and 2 October. Sir Ed Davey is expected to make a call for homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage to be better protected in a speech to party activists in London on Sunday.  Lib Dems hope the move will influence the political debate around an issue facing millions of voters in a similar way to the party's calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and an energy price freeze this winter.  Similarly, the party hopes to capitalise on a sense of frustration among voters that key public services are ""broken"", as one senior party figure put it, with their call for guaranteed GP appointments within a week in England.  Eye-catching policies may gain the Lib Dems some attention and allow them to punch above their political weight, but their prospects at the next election may have as much if not more to do with the fortunes of their opponents as it does their own offering.  Senior Lib Dems considered the Conservatives to be vulnerable on the economy while Boris Johnson was prime minister and sought to ""hammer home"" the impact of the rising cost of living.  The turmoil that marked Liz Truss's time in No 10 may have fuelled their attacks on government incompetence, but will the same tactics work against the new man in charge? The Lib Dems claim not to be fazed by Rishi Sunak as prime minister, citing what they see as his slowness to act as chancellor on the cost of living crisis and controversy around Suella Braverman's re-appointment as home secretary as potential weak points.  Labour's lead in opinion polls has widened as popularity plummeted for the Conservatives, but the Lib Dems' standing has remained largely stagnant.  Some in the party argue that anti-Conservative sentiment can only be a good thing for the Lib Dems and increase the party's chances of unseating Tory MPs at the next election.  Furthermore, insiders claim Labour's apparent popularity among voters helps the party too, removing the 2019 ""fear factor"" of a Jeremy Corbyn government which may have prevented some Conservative voters switching to the Lib Dems in blue wall seats.  Sir John Curtice, president of the British Polling Council, said the Liberal Democrats would ""probably pick up Labour voters in places where they're second"". But he added that the economy was ""never ever their strong point"" and voters may struggle to identify the party's position on major issues.  ""I'm just not sure enough people know what the hell they stand for,"" Sir John said.  That may not worry the Lib Dems as much as it might.  At the 2019 general election the then party leader Jo Swinson touted herself as the UK's next prime minister and talked of winning ""hundreds of seats"".  Her successor is unlikely to make a similar pitch, instead seeking to make the most of hostility towards the Conservatives and argue that electing Liberal Democrat MPs in seats where Labour is unlikely to win is the only way to remove them from government.

Interest Rate Sentiment,UK rates held as economy shows signs of picking up,2024-09-14,2020-01-30,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51309256,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.75% amid early signs of a pick-up in the UK and global economies. In Mark Carney's final interest rate meeting as governor, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to keep rates unchanged. Recent weak economic data had led to speculation rates could be cut, but Mr Carney said ""the most recent signs are that global growth has stabilised"". But the MPC said it was poised to cut interest rates if necessary. Fewer companies in the UK are worried about Brexit, Mr Carney told a news conference following the rate decision. He added that survey data suggested UK growth will improve. But he said: ""To be clear these are still early days and it's less of a case of so far so good than so far good enough,"" he said, again referring to the UK economy. ""Although the global economy looks to be recovering, caution is warranted,"" he said. ""Evidence of a pick-up in growth is not yet widespread."" He said the coronavirus outbreak was a ""reminder of the need to be vigilant"" when it comes to bumps in economic growth around the world. The nine MPC members have been split on rates since November. Lower interest rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for savers because High Street banks use the Bank of England base rate as a reference point for many mortgages and savings accounts. In a closely-watched decision, policymakers said they would monitor whether a recent improvement in business sentiment would lead to stronger economic growth. The MPC said it stood ready to cut rates if there were signs that growth would remain subdued. ""Policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth, should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained,"" the MPC said. Two members, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, argued that past business surveys of economic growth had not been reliable. They continued to call for an immediate interest rate cut to 0.5%. The Bank's latest economic estimates suggest the economy did not grow at all in the final three months of last year. Weaker growth at the turn of the year is also expected to drag overall economic growth down to just 0.75% in 2020. This is down from a projection of 1.25% last November. The UK economy is expected to expand by 0.2% in the first three months of this year. The Bank said a trade deal between the US and China that lowers some tariffs would provide a boost to the global economy. An expected rise in spending by the government in the March Budget could provide a further boost to growth, policymakers said. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said she also expected stronger growth ahead. ""Admittedly, the MPC left the door open to a rate cut in the coming months, but with the economy turning a corner and a big fiscal stimulus approaching, we suspect the next move in interest rates will be up not down, albeit not until next year."" The Bank said Brexit-related uncertainty had ""weighed on investment"" over the past few years. Policymakers said companies' Brexit plans had diverted money towards preparing for the UK's departure from the EU that would otherwise be invested elsewhere. This has reduced the UK's long-term growth prospects by limiting the space in which the economy can grow without the risk of overheating. This would force the Bank to raise interest rates, which would in turn slow the UK economy. Policymakers now believe the UK's potential growth has been reduced to 1.1%. This is down from 2.9% before the financial crisis and 1.6% over most of the past decade."
Interest Rate Sentiment,ECB says no quick end to stimulus,2024-09-14,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has insisted there is still a long way to go before it can call a halt to its economic stimulus programme. ECB president Mario Draghi threw cold water on speculation that the bank might wind the programme down soon. The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: ""After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective.  ""The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it."" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'"" However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Fate of the UK economy in shoppers' hands,2024-09-14,2019-01-11,By Dharshini David,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46827785,"Like it or loathe it, the consumer is king - or even, queen - and no more so than over Christmas.  The spike in festive spending between November and January typically makes up  40% of a retailer's takings.  For many, the season's tidings weren't particularly cheerful (if not perhaps as bleak as some feared). The amount ringing through tills is crucial to their survival - and that of the High Street.   Yet it has a far wider significance.  Add in spending on services - from haircuts to day trips  - and households' outlays make up two-thirds of GDP, the driver of growth in recent years.  But strip out the seasonal noise - the turkey and present-buying frenzy, the browsing of the Boxing Day sales, be it online or in stores - and one thing is clear: the underlying trend is spending is slowing down, as the official number-crunchers at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have confirmed.     Back as the heady days of summer, when retailers were still designing their Christmas ranges, the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, warned that a slowing of consumer activity may be on the cards.   Just before heading off to hang up their stockings for Christmas, the members of the Bank's interest-rate setting panel confirmed it was seeing signs of a slowdown in retail sales, and claimed that ""Brexit-related uncertainty"" was weighing  on the economy.  Certainly, the prolonged anxiety appears to have dented sentiment, with the respected GFK survey reporting that consumer confidence is at its lowest level for five years.  Why so glum? The prolonged uncertainty about post-Brexit arrangements, coupled with the mounting warnings about the impact of a no-deal on everything from prices to jobs, may justify caution.  And these come against the backdrop of that lost decade for incomes. Strip out changes in the cost of living and wages are lower than prior to the financial crisis, on average. In other words, we're worse off than a decade ago.  Then there's slowing house price growth and a weaker housing market, both of which affect how well-off we feel.  But are sentiment surveys overdoing the gloom? While the sales reports from our biggest retailers didn't make for cheerful reading, they could have been worse.  There does appear to be some disconnect between sentiment and reality. Indeed, the squeeze on real incomes is now being eased - albeit gradually.  Earnings on average grew at their fastest rate in November for a decade, helping to recoup a bit of the lost ground.   Bear in mind that employment is at record levels, and that bodes well for a rebound in both sentiment and spending if and when there is greater certainty about the post-Brexit landscape: a household-funded deal dividend.  It's not just about what the arrangements are, but how consumers respond to those.  That would ease the pressure on a beleaguered sector. Retailers are facing not only intense cost pressures, from wages to business rates, but also changing shopping habits.  For the first time, more than a fifth of shopping in November was carried out online, according to the ONS.  It's sink or swim for retailers as they try to keep up. As the list of casualties grows, more than 60,000 jobs disappeared from the sector encompassing retail between June 2017 and September 2018.  In a month's time, we'll discover how the economy fared in 2018.  Add dismal investment and lower public spending to a more hesitant consumer and GDP is likely to have suffered its weakest year for growth since the crisis.  The same factors are likely to mean a sluggish start to 2019. What happens next depends as much on consumers as politicians: it's literally in our hands.  "
Interest Rate Sentiment,US firms add more jobs than expected in May,2024-09-14,2022-06-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61684059,"US employers added more new jobs than expected in May with payrolls rising by 390,000, according to new data. The figure from the US Labor Department beat economists' forecasts for a 325,000 rise in new roles though May's increase was the slowest for a year. The unemployment rate held at 3.6% for the third month in a row. The health of the labour market in the world's largest economy is being closely watched as fast-rising prices raise fears of future downturn. In recent weeks, some companies have shared plans to slow or freeze hiring. Retail giants including Walmart and Amazon have said they hired too aggressively earlier in the year and have seen their profits hit as rising prices proved more difficult to pass onto customers. Meanwhile, electric carmaker Tesla is reportedly calling a halt to hiring and has warned that 10% of its salaried workforce may need to be cut. In an email to staff, seen by the news wire Reuters, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said he had a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy. Sentiment for both consumers and the financial markets have slipped recently. Data shows that the annual rate of US inflation hit 8.3% in the year to April, which is a slight drop from the level recorded for March but is the highest rate since 1981. Analysts said the job growth in May remained solid, if slower, than over the last year. ""Part of the slowing in payrolls in recent months likely is a knee-jerk reaction to higher costs due to the surge in energy prices triggered by the war in Ukraine,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.  But we also wonder if employers have cut back hiring in anticipation of consumers' reining-in their spending?""  Though he said: ""So far, that hasn't happened."" Many economists have long warned that job growth was bound to slow after months of unusually strong gains. Employment in the US has now nearly recovered to where it was before the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, the Labor Department said. Last month, the leisure and hospitality sector - which is still catching up from deep cuts made during Covid restrictions - reported the biggest rise in new jobs, up 84,000.  Retail payrolls fell by 61,000, but the number of jobs stands higher than it did in pre-pandemic February 2020. US President Joe Biden said on Friday that the economy was moving to a ""new period of stable, steady growth"" after surging forward last year and Americans should ""expect to see more moderation"". ""We aren't likely to see the kind of blockbuster job reports month after month like we've had over this past year but that's a good thing,"" he said. ""That stability puts us in a strong position to tackle what is clearly a problem - inflation.""  Asked about the comments from Mr Musk - with whom the president has a frosty relationship - Mr Biden said other companies, such as Ford, were announcing plans to hire thousands more staff as they invest in electric vehicles.  ""Lots of luck on his trip to the moon, I guess,"" he said. As companies compete for workers, pay has been rising faster than it has in years. Last month, the average hourly wage in the US rose to $31.95 (£25.50) last month - up 5.2% compared to a year ago. However, pay growth is failing to keep up with the rising cost of living and slowed in May for a second month in a row. The US Federal Reserve, like other central banks around the world, is raising interest rates to try to curb inflation. Such moves typically slow economic growth by making borrowing more expensive and reducing demand. Sophia Koropeckyj, managing director at Moody's Analytics, said: ""Today's report will keep the Fed on track in its tightening program in order to steer the economy toward a soft landing (slowing the economy) without tipping it over the edge toward recession and to help prevent a wage-price spiral from forming. ""The probability of recession is inching higher, but we still expect better than even odds of avoiding a downturn."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,"Barca v Bayern, but not as you know it...",2024-09-14,2018-11-27,Andy West,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46348348,"It's Bayern v Barca - but not as you know it... Barcelona v Bayern Munich. Two of the biggest clubs in the world head to head in the Catalan capital in an important early season meeting, broadcast on live television in every continent. The hosts take an early lead and, although Bayern rally after the break, another powerful surge from Barca - with summer signing Jaka Blazic to the fore - allows them to seal the victory, sending their fans home happy. What's going on here? Have you missed something? Why didn't you hear anything about this game until now? And who is Jaka Blazic?  This is not a work of fiction. It was a real game, played on 18 October. The venue? Palau Blaugrana, the indoor arena next to FC Barcelona's Nou Camp. The occasion? Barca's first home game of the new season in EuroLeague, the continent's top basketball competition. You might now be wondering why a basketball game is introducing an article about football, but it is fundamental in understanding why elite clubs have seriously considered breaking away from Uefa to set up a European Super League.  The assertion, based on leaked documents, that Europe's top clubs have been plotting their own Super League, was dismissed by two of the continent's most influential football officials last week. But the fact remains that, privately, the most powerful European teams want a system that ensures one thing - the best regularly playing the best. And envious glances have been made towards basketball's EuroLeague, where big games are guaranteed. Take Barcelona v Bayern. In EuroLeague, the clubs know they will meet twice a year. In football, they have not played each other since 2015, and the date of their next fixture is entirely dependent on the luck of the draw. It's been 1,296 days since Bayern Munich faced Barcelona - Barca progressed 5-3 on aggregate from a two-legged Champions League semi-final Since their last meeting, Barca and Bayern have been kept apart while playing in the Champions League against teams such as BATE, Rostov and AEK Athens. To be blunt, that is not the kind of company they want to keep. They want to play against each other in the same manner as their basketball teams, even if it means creating a new competition to do so. That sentiment was expressed as long ago as 2009 by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, a regular attendee of his club's EuroLeague games, who said: ""We have to agree a new European Super League which guarantees that the best always play the best, something that does not happen in the Champions League."" Many key figures at top European clubs have felt that way for a long time, and their patience will run out - especially when they can already see their clubs doing exactly what they want in another sport. Barca and Bayern's basketball teams, along with Real Madrid, are among the 16 competing clubs in EuroLeague, which follows a home-and-away league format with 30 games over the course of six months, before the top eight advance into knockout play-offs. The competition is owned and organised by the clubs, who felt they needed to break away from their sport's governing body nearly 20 years ago in a similar manner to the creation of the Premier League in 1992. And there is one key reason why the EuroLeague structure appeals: money. Barcelona basketball player Kevin Seraphin with footballer Lionel Messi A guarantee of 30 games, rather than an absolute maximum of 13 in the current Champions League (and possibly as few as six), firstly means the opportunity to earn a lot more from ticket receipts and the lucrative matchday hospitality market. It also provides a major opportunity to significantly boost revenues from the two main financial drivers of modern sport - sponsors and broadcasters, who will lap up the opportunity to showcase their brands and fill their schedules with a weekly supply of premium quality games, featuring the world's most popular teams and most famous players. EuroLeague basketball, as club executives are well aware, has reported a growth in revenue of 103.3% in media rights and 49.9% in sponsorship since adopting the league format two years ago. Another big attraction for clubs is the opportunity to keep all this extra revenue for themselves rather than losing a large slice to Uefa, which takes about £600m annually from the Champions League to cover administrative costs, solidarity payments and general projects. Money, as always, is talking. And the clubs are hearing the message loud and clear.  Clubs, broadcasters and sponsors might love the idea of a Super League, but what about another crucial stakeholder in the game: fans?  The reaction of many supporters has been hostile, with a long list of complaints including the anti-sporting principles of a 'closed' competition lacking relegation or promotion, an excessive focus on money-making, the risk of damaging domestic leagues and an erosion of time-honoured rituals and traditions. Those negative views were summed up by Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) chair Malcolm Clarke, who said: ""Yet again there is a far-reaching proposal being drawn up by big clubs whose primary interest is making as much money as possible without any consultation with fans at club, national or European level."" Man City boss Pep Guardiola, pictured here in 2012, would watch his club's basketball teams during his time at Barcelona and Bayern Munich However, the reaction of British fans will not necessarily be shared by other supporters around Europe: an online poll by Spanish newspaper Marca, external last year saw 58% of the 93,000 respondents say they would be in favour of the creation of a Super League. There is also a key distinction between match-going fans and the 'new breed' of supporters - constituting a large majority of the overall fanbase - who live all over the world and follow their teams on television and increasingly through social media. Former AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi supposedly quipped that the most important role of fans actually inside the stadium is to make the product look better on television - and the bosses of La Liga seem to share that view, introducing a new regulation two years ago which obliges clubs to sell tickets in the stand directly facing the main television cameras. And it's worth bearing in mind that just because the traditionalists shout the loudest, that doesn't mean they represent the majority. Should all Manchester United fans be treated equally whether they live in Arizona or Altrincham? Or should the opinions of match-going supporters be given more weight than those who follow their teams - and perhaps even more so their favourite players - from afar? The answers to those questions might not be as clear-cut as traditionalists assume. The example of EuroLeague basketball suggests even match-going fans could end up appreciating the change in format: average attendances have increased by 17.4% - to an average of 8,864 - since the league structure was introduced two years ago.  The idea of a Super League has been floated for so long, without anything happening, it would be easy to dismiss the whole concept as pie in the sky. Creating a new league from scratch, especially in the face of fierce opposition and potential legal challenges, would certainly be a hugely risky venture for the elite clubs, however powerful they might be. And the whole thing, indeed, could just be one big bluff: rather than truly intending to breakaway, the clubs may just be attempting to force Uefa into remodelling the European calendar and system, something that has already been discussed. There's also a train of thought within English football that continental clubs are chiefly interested in bridging the huge financial gap between themselves and their Premier League counterparts. None of this, however, means the plans should be taken lightly.  Many key figures within top clubs are deadly serious in their ambition to create a new tournament which allows them to compete with their peers, and the example they've seen on basketball courts has given them an idea of how it could work.

Interest Rate Sentiment,ECB says no quick end to stimulus,2024-09-14,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has insisted there is still a long way to go before it can call a halt to its economic stimulus programme. ECB president Mario Draghi threw cold water on speculation that the bank might wind the programme down soon. The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: ""After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective.  ""The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it."" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'"" However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,US stocks suffer worst week in a decade,2024-09-14,2018-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46654064,"US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets. All three indexes closed lower, with the technology-focused Nasdaq down 20% since its peak, placing it in so-called ""bear market"" territory.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its biggest weekly drop in percentage terms since 2008. The S&P 500 fell 7% for the week. It is the biggest weekly percentage drop since August 2011 while the Nasdaq's 8.36% decline is the sharpest since November 2008. The Dow Jones fell 6.8% during the week. After years of gains, US investors are fleeing stocks, worried about a range of factors likely to hit corporate profits, including slowing economic growth domestically and abroad. Earlier this week, the US Federal Reserve lifted the interest rate and signalled that it would continue to rise next year, albeit at a slower pace. The Fed also cut its forecasts for economic growth in 2019 to 2.3%, down from the 2.5% predicted in September. Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets, said: ""China is cooling and the eurozone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the US have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019.""  Elliot Clarke, economist at Westpac, the banking group, added: ""Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty."" Markets were also unnerved by comments from President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro who told the Nikkei newspaper that it would be ""difficult"" for the US and China to reach a long lasting trade agreement that would end the tensions between the two. Share trading started Friday on an upswing, boosted by stronger-than-expected quarterly sales at sportswear giant Nike. Investors also appeared soothed after John Williams, president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the central bank would consider market turmoil as it weighs future interest rate decisions. However, selling set in by afternoon with some of the major technology firms - that led the market's rally earlier this year - experiencing some of the most bruising falls. Facebook and Twitter both tumbled more than 6%, Amazon dropped more than 5%, and Apple and Microsoft slipped more than 3%. For the day,  the Nasdaq index fell almost 3%, the S&P 500 tumbled more than 2%, and the Dow slid 1.8%. Some economists argue that the steep Wall Street sell-off does not reflect conditions in the wider economy, which grew at an annual pace of 3.4% in the most recent quarter. Consumer sentiment also remains strong, according to the most recent data. However, the fears on Wall Street could spread in the event of a prolonged downturn, analysts warned. ""If these expectations begin to shift, then we would expect to see more downward pressure on sentiment and spending patterns in early 2019,""  Oxford Economics said."
Interest Rate Sentiment,House prices fall for first time since Covid,2024-09-14,2023-08-10,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66456354,"Property experts are reporting the first fall in the price of buying a home in Scotland since the market was disrupted by Covid. Most chartered surveyors told their trade association that they had seen prices going down since April. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) last reported such a decline in June 2020. Last week Nationwide said UK house prices dropped at their fastest annual rate for 14 years in July. Higher interest rates have made mortgages more expensive in recent months, while rising prices have hit people's spending power. When RICS last reported a price decline three years ago, showings were not allowed due to the pandemic and there was widespread economic uncertainty about jobs and incomes. Over the three months to July, it said every other part of Britain had a more negative opinion about prices while there was a less negative response in Northern Ireland. The survey found a sharp deterioration in the price outlook for three months ahead, and in the number of transactions. As interest rates have risen steadily over the past 20 months, the number of prospective buyers coming into the Scottish homes market is down, according to a clear majority of RICS surveyors.  More were reporting a negative outlook than at any time since the middle of last decade. Although this way of measuring market sentiment shows how opinion is shifting, the figures do not show how much prices or the number of transactions has been falling, or are expected to fall. Comment from surveyors pointed to the increased cost of borrowing money for mortgages as the main cause of the market slowdown. Alan Kennedy, of Shepherd surveyors in Fraserburgh, said higher interest rates had ""stifled market activity, though demand still exceeds supply in some sectors"". If demand outstrips supply, that can sustain prices or even push them up, despite borrowing costs going up. Craig Henderson, of Graham & Sibbald in Ayrshire, said: ""The ongoing inflationary pressures are causing buyers to think long and hard over any purchase decision.  ""Prices are holding up, so far in this area, but where they go later in the year will depend on the costs of borrowing and ongoing inflation. Caution is at the forefront of most of the market.""  Greg Davidson, of the same company in Perth, added: ""There remains hesitancy in some sectors of the market due to increased costs, but the underlying market seems to be stable.  ""There continues to be a lack of supply in some key areas within the country house market and demand still outweighs supply.""  Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said pressure on buyers was extending to renters, who were also finding that supply was failing to match demand for property leases. He added: ""Demand shows no signs of letting up, supply remains constrained and that means rents are likely to continue rising sharply despite the cost-of-living crisis."" The most recent figures from Registers of Scotland for actual transactions in Scotland shows an increase in prices by 3.2% over the year to May, taking the average house price to £193,000. At the same time, UK house prices increased by 1.9%. But a different take on the market, published on Monday by Halifax, the biggest mortgage lender with its own House Price Index, showed Scottish prices down by 0.7% in the past year, while UK prices were down 2.4%. August last year was seen as the peak for the market, after annual inflation in prices had risen above 12%. So the fall in prices now do not cancel out the sharp increases that followed the pandemic.  Pent-up demand for homes after the market re-opened reflected a desire for more space following lockdown. And with more people working from home and no longer commuting regularly, there was demand for homes further from cities. In the new-build market, the major housebuilders have been reporting to investors on a softening market, with rising construction costs. Several are cutting back on plans for the number of homes they are building. Bellway said on Wednesday that completions are expected to fall, and the buyer reservation rate for new homes is down by 28% this year, to 156 per week. Meanwhile, Taylor Wimpey recently reported that it sold 5,120 flats and houses in the first half of this year, down by quarter on the same period last year, while profit margins were cut by nearly a third. The average price for its sales was up by nearly 7% on last year, to £320,000. Persimmon Homes reported new house completions across the UK in the first half of this year were down by more than a third on the same part of last year.  Pre-tax profit for that period were down nearly two-thirds. A spokesman for trade body Homes for Scotland said Scotland's market had held up well in ""clearly challenging"" conditions. He said: ""Our key concern relates to the shortfall of more than 114,000 new homes that has accumulated since 2008, in the wake of the financial crisis. ""With latest statistics showing the number of new starts on a worrying downward trend and a near 50% drop in the number of major residential planning applications compared to pre-Covid levels, Scotland's housing crisis looks set to worsen. ""We need urgent action on planning, a joined-up approach on the transition to net zero and support for both first-time buyers and small and medium-scale home builders."" While those wanting to get on the housing ladder will welcome a fall in prices, owners and property agents will be relieved to see mortgage rates falling, easing the downward pressure on prices. Even though there could be another rise in the Bank of England base rate, money markets are pricing in a fall over the term of fixed rate mortgages, which is being reflected in the longer-term rates at which lenders are funding their products.  On Wednesday, Halifax - the biggest mortgage lender, part of Lloyds Banking Group and supplier of mortgage products to Bank of Scotland - joined several other major lenders with a rate cut."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Firms 'running out of patience' on Brexit,2024-09-14,2018-07-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44690124,"Firms are running out of patience over the lack of progress in the Brexit talks, a major business organisation has warned Theresa May. The British Chambers of Commerce has published a list of 23 ""real-world"" questions that it says urgently need answers as the UK's EU exit approaches.  The list covers subjects including VAT, tariffs, customs and regulations. The BCC said companies were no clearer on these critical issues than they were immediately after the referendum.  The questions include: The last 10 days have seen a number of high-profile businesses, including Airbus and BMW, warn that further investment in the UK was already under review and that leaving the EU without a deal could see production relocated.  Some cabinet ministers have dismissed these, but the director general of the BCC, Adam Marshall, defended the right of firms to speak out when practical questions affecting their business and the livelihoods of millions remained unanswered. ""Over the past two years, businesses have been patient,"" Mr Marshall said. ""Now, with the time running out ahead of the UK's exit from the EU, business patience is reaching breaking point. ""It's time for politicians to stop the squabbling and the Westminster point-scoring - and start putting the national economic interest first.  ""These are not 'siren voices' or special interests. They are the practical, real-world concerns of businesses of every size and sector, in every part of the UK."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""We're confident of getting a good deal with the EU to ensure trade remains as free and frictionless as possible. ""Ministers continue to work closely with business to understand their concerns, and by successfully negotiating the implementation period with the EU until December 2020, companies can carry on trading with confidence on the same terms as they do now. ""We have put forward workable proposals to the EU on a range of areas from the backstop to security - and the White Paper, which will be published shortly, will continue to drive this process forward."" Last month, the BCC cut its UK growth forecast for 2018 from 1.4% to 1.3%, warning that the economy faces its weakest year since the financial crisis. Uncertainties around Brexit, interest rate rises, threats of trade wars and rising oil prices were all hurting sentiment, the BCC said. In another development, the Professional and Business Services Council, which represents accountancy firms and legal services, has written to the prime minister expressing fears that its members' interests are not being taken into account in the Brexit negotiations. The PBSC said: ""We fear that both the interim and final deal with the EU will not fully include the fundamental requirements to avoid sustained harm to our sectors and our clients, and thereby the wider economy."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Brexit 'to hit' housing market into 2019,2024-09-14,2018-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46538831,"Uncertainty and gloom about Brexit are likely to hit the UK housing market well into next year, surveyors believe. The latest report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) predicts that the number of homes being sold - and their prices - will fall over the next three months. Fewer people are interested in moving, and fewer want to sell. Each home is already taking an average of four months to sell, the longest period since records began in 2016. ""It is evident from the feedback to the latest RICS survey that the ongoing uncertainties surrounding how the Brexit process plays out is taking its toll on the housing market,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS' chief economist. ""Indeed, I can't recall a previous survey when a single issue has been highlighted by quite so many contributors."" Reacting to the report, experts at Capital Economics said they expected the number of house sales to continue falling next year. However they estimate that prices will still rise by 1% in 2019. RICS is also concerned that the rate of house-building itself could slow down, because of Brexit worries. ""The bigger risk is that this now spills over into development plans making it even harder to secure the uplift in the building pipeline to address the housing crisis,"" said Mr Rubinsohn. The RICS survey - carried out in November - suggests that most surveyors are considerably more pessimistic about the market than they were just a month before. The Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, said last month that house prices could fall by as much as 30% in the event of a ""disorderly"" Brexit - in other words a no-deal scenario. However there is some regional variation, with surveyors in the north of England and Northern Ireland less pessimistic. Surveyors in these two areas were the only ones who said they expected prices to rise over the next three months. David Nesbit, a surveyor from Portsmouth, has views typical of many of his colleagues in the south of England. ""Brexit, the Bank of England and Christmas - what more to depress sentiment! A very difficult period is ahead,"" he said. Chris Clubley, from Market Weighton in Yorkshire, said he believed the effects of Brexit uncertainty would last even longer. ""The market is currently being affected by the uncertainty of Brexit and potential interest rate rises. We expect the market to remain difficult for the next two years."" Mark Hunter, from Doncaster, said the outlook for the property market remained very uncertain. ""The Brexit negotiations are now becoming farcical and affecting confidence. The thought that anything could happen in the next few months is a very worrying prospect,"" he said."
Interest Rate Sentiment,US inflation hits 7.9% as fuel and food costs rise,2024-09-14,2022-03-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60696125,"Price increases in the US continued to surge last month, pushing the annual inflation rate up 7.9%. That is the biggest year-on-year leap since 1982 and up from the 7.5% rate reported in January. Rising costs for energy, food and shelter drove the gains, which are squeezing household incomes. President Joe Biden and central bank officials are under pressure to rein in the increases, which have proven more persistent than many expected. The Federal Reserve - the US central bank - is widely expected to raise interest rates at its meeting this month.  In the UK - where inflation hit 5.5% in January - the Bank of England has already increased rates, while the European Central Bank on Thursday said it would wind down some of its pandemic-era stimulus sooner than expected in response to the price pressures.  At a news conference, ECB president Christine Lagarde said: ""The risks to the economic outlook have increased substantially with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and are tilted to the downside"". The war will have ""a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence"", she warned. The US and other parts of the world have already been grappling with high inflation for months, as a surge in demand, fuelled in part by pandemic aid, ran into supply constraints, labour shortages and other issues. The war in Ukraine has added to the problems, driving a global surge in energy prices as the West and allies shun oil from Russia - typically responsible for about 7% of global supply. Energy prices in the US jumped 3.5% in February, driven by a 6.6% leap in gasoline prices, according to the Labor Department's monthly report on consumer prices.  Over the past 12 months, the energy index has soared more than 25%, with gasoline surging 38%.  Americans who own SUVs are now paying an average of $110 per month more than a year ago to operate their vehicle, according to research from Cox Automotive. Even drivers of hybrids have seen monthly costs jump about $40, the firm estimated. The surge in energy costs will push up prices far beyond the gas pump, said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler. ""We're focused on that headline crude number, but that crude is used as an input to produce all manner of products,"" he said. Grocery prices in the US jumped 1.4% last month, driven by rising costs for meat, fruits and vegetables. They are up 8.6% year-on-year - the largest annual leap since 1981.  Analysts expect the increased costs of energy and other commodities due to the war will push US inflation even higher in March, hitting 8% or more. As the rising costs outpace wage gains, they have hurt consumer sentiment, creating a political problem for President Joe Biden. He has been criticised by Republicans on the issue, which few economists expect to ease in the near-term. ""Inflation continues on at a blazing pace,"" Wells Fargo economist Sarah House said. ""Consumers and policymakers remain in a deeply uncomfortable state as a result."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,US jobs growth jumps in July despite slowdown fears,2024-09-14,2022-08-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62438987,"US employers added more than 500,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate dropped, defying fears that the labour market is heading for a slowdown. The jobless rate fell to 3.5% from 3.6% in June, as restaurants, bars and other firms continued to add workers. The report from the Labor Department was far stronger than expected, after recent data showed the US economy continuing to shrink. The US central bank is raising interest rates to rein in surging prices. Higher borrowing costs reduce spending and economic activity. But top economic officials in the US have said they hope the US labour market will remain strong enough to allow the Federal Reserve to raise rates without triggering a recession. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who previously led the bank, said last week that the economy was shifting from its booming post-pandemic recovery to a more solid and steady phase of growth. But fears of a sustained slowdown have mounted, as consumer confidence falls, the housing market slows and some firms announce job cuts or plans to slow hiring. ""The unexpected acceleration in non-farm payroll growth in July, together with the further decline in the unemployment rate and the renewed pick-up in wage pressure, make a mockery of claims that the economy is on the brink of recession,"" said Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics.  The US has now regained all 22 million jobs lost when the pandemic hit in 2020, the Labor Department said. The jobless rate has also returned to its pre-pandemic level,hovering at 50-year lows. For Hispanic and Latino workers, the 3.9% jobless rate in July was the lowest since record keeping began in 1973.  Product manager Ian Charles lost his job a few weeks ago when his financial technology company announced a wave of cuts, citing the shift in investor sentiment that was making it harder for start-ups to raise money. The 33-year-old was surprised - and initially, panicked, remembering how difficult his job search had been a few years earlier. But this time, he said, ""it's a totally different ballgame."" ""People have really been coming out in droves on LinkedIn - both people I actually know from grad school and former colleagues to just random recruiters,"" he said.  He said he felt confident he would have a new job lined up in a few weeks. ""I was panicking at the start ... but this time around I've seen in a month how much easier it's been to get traction,"" he said. ""Opportunities keep coming, which is really weird to me because everyone keeps talking about how we're headed for a recession and things could be slowing down, but I don't see it reflected on the ground."" Analysts said the robust hiring makes it likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates aggressively. The bank has already announced rate rises four times since March, responding to consumer prices that are increasing at their fastest pace since 1981. The inflation rate surged again in June to 9.1%. Wages are rising too - but not as fast. Friday's report showed average hourly pay up 5.2% compared with July 2021.  Economist Jason Furman, who advised former president Barack Obama and now teaches at Harvard, said that the jobs report was ""uncomfortably hot"". ""Nice to see this many jobs added but it is scary about what it means for the size of the adjustment we may have coming,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Recession is now less of a worry. Inflation is more of a worry. The Fed will likely need to do more."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Why out-of-favour Gilmour's 'next call is massive',2024-09-14,2023-03-21,Nick McPheat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64987116,"Scotland midfielder Billy Gilmour has started just four games in six months for Brighton since his summer move from Chelsea Scotland fans will watch with envy when Spanish starlets Pedri and Gavi swagger out on to the Hampden pitch next Tuesday. The Barcelona duo are the latest products to be lifted off Spain's midfield production line, which continues to churn out world-class talent at a terrific rate.  Most nations, including Scotland, would settle for one every generation. In Billy Gilmour, there was growing belief among the Tartan Army they finally had one of their own. That notion was cemented by a dazzling display in the Wembley rain against England at Euro 2020. Up against a much-vaunted English trio of Declan Rice, Mason Mount and Kalvin Phillips, Gilmour shone, sparking comparisons with then-Chelsea team-mate N'Golo Kante. Scotland great Graeme Souness called him ""the best player on the pitch"". Pick your Scotland XI to face Cyprus Almost two years on from that night - his first international start - the 21-year-old finds himself at another crossroads in his young career, just six months on from a Brighton move that was expected to open the door to much-needed regular game time. ""Everything looked right,"" former Chelsea and Scotland winger Pat Nevin tells BBC Scotland. ""It's been a real shame so far. But you have to deal with what you've got in football. If one thing isn't working, you have to move to something else.  ""That's what Billy did by moving on from Chelsea. Sadly, he might have to do it again. The next big call he makes is massive."" ""Staggeringly unlucky"" is how Nevin sums up Gilmour's past six months - but what is the source of that misfortune? The main one is the managerial situation at Brighton. Graham Potter was head coach at the Amex Stadium when Gilmour signed. Seven days later, Potter was poached by Chelsea, the club Gilmour left the previous week. Another root of frustration for the Scotland midfielder? ""Brighton are some team,"" Nevin adds. ""It would be hard for anyone to get a game there at the moment.""  That sentiment is echoed by Gilmour's current club boss, with Roberto de Zerbi's side currently seventh in the Premier League, vying for a European place, and in the FA Cup semi-finals. The Italian's first-choice midfield consists of Argentina World Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo, who also had a fine tournament in Qatar with Ecuador before Brighton batted away big-money bids from both Arsenal and Chelsea in January. ""When you have Mac Allister and Caicedo, it's very hard to find the space [in the team],"" De Zerbi said in January. ""But this is football. This is life."" Gilmour is certainly doing his utmost to seize whatever playing chances arise. His passing accuracy of 91.9% is better than any other Brighton player who has featured in at least 10 games this season. He places third for interceptions, passes and assists per 90 minutes too. Those statistics are encouraging. So what now for the Scot? His head coach has challenged him to ""wait for the right moment"" and ""be ready"" to grasp his opportunity when it comes, while the midfielder has admitted he needs ""to be patient"" and prove he is ""capable of playing the position"". And despite the reluctance to sell Caicedo in January, Brighton's hierarchy have shown recently they aren't shy in letting their top talents move on if the money is right.  Interest in the Ecuadorian and midfield partner Mac Allister is expected to be high this summer. That could ""find the space"" De Zerbi refers to. But that would mean Gilmour would have to bide his time. ""It might happen at Brighton,"" Nevin says. ""You don't want to waste too many years, you don't get them back. What I'd say is don't panic. It's not time to worry. Remember he's only 21 - but don't wait too long."" BBC Scotland News & Sport BBC Sport Scottish Football Scottish Football Association"
Interest Rate Sentiment,Rebooting the case for Scottish independence,2024-09-14,2018-05-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44252435,"Four years on from That Referendum on Scotland, and what's changed? Well, quite a lot, thanks to Brexit, three national elections, a new first minister, a new prime minister, the rise of Richard Leonard and Rees-Moggery, plus an oil and gas slump. But the polling figures on independence have barely shifted. ""Why?"" I was asked this week by a semi-detached Nationalist.  ""Because the arguments haven't moved,"" he answered himself. Neither side has reflected, in public at least, on where their arguments needed sharpening up, least of all on the economic questions. Until today - 25 May 2018. Remember the date. It just might turn out to be significant. The Sustainable Growth Commission will take some digesting. It's a weighty, meaty document. From what I've been told about its recommendations, it retains much of the sunny optimism that buoyed the Yes campaign in 2014, but to that has been added a big dollop of candour. As an economic prospectus for independence, it recognises that people were not sufficiently reassured in 2014, least of all about their pensions, savings and mortgages. They heard glib assurances back then that negotiations with Westminster would go swimmingly, because that would be in Westminster's interest. Downing Street would give Scotland what was asked for, including joint control of sterling. Transition costs were so low as to lack any serious costing. And a higher economic growth rate would flow from an enlightened administration taking all the right policy and fiscal decisions, without facing economic or political headwinds or any internal contradictions on lowered tax and higher spending. I recall one Yes supporter wryly comparing the sentiment of the movement back then to the Summer of Love in 1967. Everything good was possible, and all at once. Nothing bad need happen. It was groovy, man. Andrew Wilson is no hippie, though he draws deeply on the pipe of positivity and optimism. The commission he has led has applied candour to each of the weaker points in the 2014 economic prospectus, and conceded some ground to the critics of independence, in the interests of credibility. Take the currency for instance. The new plan does not seek shared control of the Bank of England.  It takes the word of the former governor, Lord (Mervyn) King, that Scotland could certainly be independent, and it could use sterling, but at one big cost: Holyrood would have to accept whatever monetary decisions are made in the City of London, and made in the interests of a London-dominated nation that no longer included Scotland. If Scotland's economy were out of sync with the cycle in the UK, that could be painful. That's how it was in the 1990s, and Alex Salmond railed against it. But in recent years, London has been the outlier, and Scotland has been at or near the UK average. So interest rate and financial policies set for the British middle ground, even without Scotland in Britain, might have suited Holyrood just fine. A central bank would be set up, without control over interest rates, and there would be a regulator, but with a light workload, as the banks would have shifted at least their brass plates south of the Border, to be regulated from London.  Any smaller financial institutions, still based in Scotland, would have low expectations of a bail-out - though since the crash, that's now the message to all lenders. Or take fiscal policy. The Wilson Commission gulps in full the harsh message from GERS - Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland.  A deficit, including oil and gas revenue, at nearly 10% of national output, or Gross Domestic Product, is not sustainable, it is conceded. So what to do? A lot of work has gone into the answer. It is not simply to grow the economy faster, as the name of the commission suggested it should. The days of the tiger economies, at least in Europe, have gone.  The best hope for boosting growth in the short term - productivity being a longer-term project - is seen as a boost to immigration, with a ""Come to Scotland"" campaign, and financial incentives thrown in.  That's easy for an economist to say: less so for a politician (I intend to return to the question of growth once I've had a chance to digest the recommendations). A key element of the Wilson answer to the fiscal question is discipline on spending. This looks like, politically, the most difficult factor to manage, in an excited environment where expectations can run away from reality. The constraint would not be a real terms cut, but instead a very small increase, at 1% below the cash terms increase in economic growth. For example, suppose 2% inflation and 1.5% real growth, which is not an unreasonable target, meaning 3.5% cash growth. Pare that back to a disciplined 2.5% increase in public spending, and you could guess that would make for uncomfortable discussions round the Cabinet table.  The aim, remember, is to be doing this over the years when immense pressure is expected to build on health and social care budgets. The Wilson report adds to that a cut in defence, including the nuclear deterrent budget, to 1.6% of national economic output (To be clear: Trident money would not be spent on other priorities. It would be put into deficit reduction). Then review tax collection and get it to the same level of efficiency as the best of smallish nations. There's a call for a rigorous review of all spending, to ensure that the government doesn't keep spending on the priorities of 10 or 20 years ago, just because it's aye been, and because those programmes are too difficult to cut. And oil and gas? No, that is taken out the equation, to be treated as a windfall, and put into a future generations fund for long-term projects. All this assumes a taxing and spending regime which doesn't depart much from what we have at the moment. In the early years, it does not encourage people to think that Scotland would shift either to a high-tax, high welfare Scandinavian model or low tax and low regulation. Nor does it battle through the thicket of possibilities around Brexit, and where Scotland might find itself over the next few years.  For five to 10 years of such a fiscal plan, it is reckoned that an independent Scotland would be running a deficit and building up debt. Modelling with what they say are conservative assumptions, the deficit would fall to 3% in the ninth year.  That's the level widely seen, as in euro currency rules, to be a safe and stable level of deficit. Only then could the government start to look at the five other tests being set for creating a Scottish currency - a small package of tick boxes designed to reassure voters and the markets with a canny nod to caution. So while leaving monetary policy to the Bank of England, and requiring tight discipline on spending, the rhetoric of independence or even ""taking back control"" begins to lose its shine. Critics of independence might well question if it would be worth all the effort, and £450m in estimated transition costs, only to find that a change in constitutional status hasn't moved the dials much.  But that's one of the many lessons we're in the early stages of learning from the Brexit process. ""Taking Back Control"" in an open, modern economy is something of a mirage. Even a sovereign parliament is constrained by international agreements and market orthodoxies.  And even at Whitehall's scale and depth, the capacity of government to negotiate and and to manage upheaval is itself a major constraint.  In turn, that places tight limitations on what else it can be expected to achieve in managing or reforming public services. Unpicking economic unions, whether 45 years in the making in Europe or 311 years in Britain, is much more complicated than it might look at first. Bigger and established players in negotiations tend to have most leverage.  When it's done, independence has to be combined with some dependence and a lot of inter-dependence, requiring compromise. And as the Swiss sometimes observe about their relations with Brussels, the negotiations never stop. In that sense, though in few others, the Brexit negotiations may be doing the Scottish constitutional debate a favour. Looking at London and Brussels, Scots can see and smell the rubber hitting the road.   Voters may be more likely, therefore, to seek and reward candour, rather than jumping on the bandwagon painted in the brightest red and sporting the most populist slogan. That's among the big challenges thrown down by the Wilson Commission. The report gives the independence movement something big and meaty to chew on, and to debate internally, perhaps then to move the dials in its direction on the Yes and No polling.  It throws down the gauntlet to opponents of Scottish independence to reflect at least as seriously on the campaign they ran in 2014. They got the majority. But at least some must surely be wary of complacency. Would the same campaign and arguments work again, in the wake of Brexit, and against the Andrew Wilson prospectus? And the report is also a challenge to all of us who take some part in the debate about Scotland's future.  From what we know about it so far, the report of the Sustainable Growth Commission sounds like a serious document for serious times.  It is a more mature approach than we've seen for a long time, and surely demands a mature response."
Interest Rate Sentiment,UK rates held as economy shows signs of picking up,2024-09-14,2020-01-30,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51309256,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.75% amid early signs of a pick-up in the UK and global economies. In Mark Carney's final interest rate meeting as governor, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to keep rates unchanged. Recent weak economic data had led to speculation rates could be cut, but Mr Carney said ""the most recent signs are that global growth has stabilised"". But the MPC said it was poised to cut interest rates if necessary. Fewer companies in the UK are worried about Brexit, Mr Carney told a news conference following the rate decision. He added that survey data suggested UK growth will improve. But he said: ""To be clear these are still early days and it's less of a case of so far so good than so far good enough,"" he said, again referring to the UK economy. ""Although the global economy looks to be recovering, caution is warranted,"" he said. ""Evidence of a pick-up in growth is not yet widespread."" He said the coronavirus outbreak was a ""reminder of the need to be vigilant"" when it comes to bumps in economic growth around the world. The nine MPC members have been split on rates since November. Lower interest rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for savers because High Street banks use the Bank of England base rate as a reference point for many mortgages and savings accounts. In a closely-watched decision, policymakers said they would monitor whether a recent improvement in business sentiment would lead to stronger economic growth. The MPC said it stood ready to cut rates if there were signs that growth would remain subdued. ""Policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth, should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained,"" the MPC said. Two members, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, argued that past business surveys of economic growth had not been reliable. They continued to call for an immediate interest rate cut to 0.5%. The Bank's latest economic estimates suggest the economy did not grow at all in the final three months of last year. Weaker growth at the turn of the year is also expected to drag overall economic growth down to just 0.75% in 2020. This is down from a projection of 1.25% last November. The UK economy is expected to expand by 0.2% in the first three months of this year. The Bank said a trade deal between the US and China that lowers some tariffs would provide a boost to the global economy. An expected rise in spending by the government in the March Budget could provide a further boost to growth, policymakers said. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said she also expected stronger growth ahead. ""Admittedly, the MPC left the door open to a rate cut in the coming months, but with the economy turning a corner and a big fiscal stimulus approaching, we suspect the next move in interest rates will be up not down, albeit not until next year."" The Bank said Brexit-related uncertainty had ""weighed on investment"" over the past few years. Policymakers said companies' Brexit plans had diverted money towards preparing for the UK's departure from the EU that would otherwise be invested elsewhere. This has reduced the UK's long-term growth prospects by limiting the space in which the economy can grow without the risk of overheating. This would force the Bank to raise interest rates, which would in turn slow the UK economy. Policymakers now believe the UK's potential growth has been reduced to 1.1%. This is down from 2.9% before the financial crisis and 1.6% over most of the past decade."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Price rises could hit highest rate in 30 years,2024-09-14,2021-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59062392,"The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned. Its latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%. The chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Rishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as ""strong"" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously. However, he acknowledged the inflation rate was ""likely to rise further"" from its 3.1% rate in September. He said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight."" The UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR said in its latest report. The OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses.  It previously said it had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and ""in response to a request from the chancellor"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer. But the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. The effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said. But it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021. In 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March. Growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. While the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months.  The OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices.   That higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years.  Strip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election. Higher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future. But Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much. Borrowing hit a record £319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough. It is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026.  Jane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a ""huge"" Covid bill to deal with, though. ""The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill.  ""The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed."" A risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down. Mr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to ""reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation"".  Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Day six of Russia's war in Ukraine explained,2024-09-14,2022-03-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60576450,"On day six of the Russian invasion, Ukrainians woke up to the wailing sound of air sirens and news of Russian troops progressing towards the capital Kyiv.  Satellite images showed a serpentine armoured convoy, stretching across 65km (40 miles), inching towards the city.  Our chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet started her day in a basement shelter, where she met Rustam, who like many 13-year-olds was scrolling through Tik-Tok videos.   ""Are they coming here too?"" he asked her.  Later in the day, five people died when Russia attacked a TV tower in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials say. The attack came soon after Russia warned it was preparing to hit targets in the Ukrainian capital. A missile reportedly struck the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Centre which is close by. It is built on Europe's largest mass grave, where Nazi death squads killed more than 33,000 Jewish people in 1941. You can see more maps showing what we know of the day's developments here: Day 6: Tracking Russia's invasion in maps Missiles also hit government offices in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, killing at least 10 people.  It prompted an accusation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinsky that Russia was committing war crimes, as there were no military targets in the area.  Residents have been fleeing the city and telling their stories.  One of our reporters in Ukraine, Joel Gunter, spoke to Alexandra, a hairdresser who left with her young son.  She said she hopes to return, echoing the sentiment of many Ukrainians by saying ""I have never felt so much love for my homeland and for my city"".  ""The Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the West to protect our sky. We are asking for a no-fly zone."" This was the impassioned request from a Ukrainian woman who confronted UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson at a news conference on Tuesday.  But despite Russian strikes hitting residential areas of Ukraine, and a mounting civilian death toll, there is little chance that the West will implement a no-fly zone.  Why a Ukraine no-fly zone is a no-go for the West One of Russia's richest men has said imposing sanctions on oligarchs would have no impact on Moscow's decision to launch a war in Ukraine. Ukraine-born billionaire banker Mikhail Fridman told a press conference in London the war was a tragedy for both sides. But he stopped short of direct criticism, saying personal remarks could be a risk not just to himself but also staff and colleagues.  By the BBC's John Simpson  Ukraine has fought back much harder during the first week than Vladimir Putin expected, or very probably than his generals promised him, it would. But these are still the early stages of what could be a very nasty war. Putin must have hoped that a few days after Russian forces invaded, Kyiv would have fallen. And he surely expected that Western countries, cowed and divided, would have accepted that he had reclaimed a territory that he says is historically part of Russia. None of this has happened. Ukraine has proved a hard nut to crack, and the reaction of Western countries, particularly Germany, has been far fiercer than he thought. Russia's economy has already been savagely hit. Putin's one big friend, China, now seems worried that this Western upsurge of anger might, one day, be turned against China itself - and that serious damage could be done to the Chinese economy. It has already distanced itself from the invasion. Now Putin will have to reach for new options. He has always refused to back down when he is rebuffed. He will hit back harder - and he has the weapons to do it. Read more from John Simpson here You may be reading this far from the war zone. But if you see the news each day and feeling increasingly worried, you are not alone.  After a two-year pandemic which already raised anxiety levels and stress for many people, news of a war is lot to absorb, and experts agree that feeling overwhelmed is normal. Here is their advice on how you can take care of yourself, your kids - and others."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Inside the mind of the Bank of England,2024-09-14,2017-11-01,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41815712,"It's decision time. On Thursday, Bank of England policymakers will reveal their move on interest rates. How the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) vote will affect households and businesses across the UK. That's because the Bank of England base rate is used as a reference point for millions of mortgages and savings accounts. Higher rates would hit borrowers - but benefit savers. Interest rates are at a record low of 0.25% and there has not been a rise in interest rates in more than a decade. The Bank's job is to try to keep inflation at about 2%. The fall in the value of the pound pushed up the Consumer Prices Index to 3% in September - a rate not seen since 2012 - and recent sluggish growth has led to fears of a prolonged slowdown. The Bank has a supplementary goal of supporting economic growth, which means it has faced a tricky trade-off over the past year. While there are eight MPC meetings a year, Bank policymakers meet several times before casting their votes. This includes a designated pre-MPC meeting, where Bank of England economists provide committee members with a whistle-stop tour of the economy a week before the interest rate decision. During this session, policymakers are shown dozens of charts on all aspects of the economy.  Martin Weale, who served on the committee between 2010 and 2016, says these meetings sometimes influenced his vote. The King's College London economics professor says: ""I remember when I joined the MPC in July 2010, I wondered how long it would be before I thought I was voting differently through going to the meetings from the way I would have voted had I been looking on from the outside. ""And the answer was that in January 2011, I voted for an interest rate rise because I saw the short-term inflation forecast that the Bank was producing. ""Bank staff suggested that inflation was likely to rise to 5%, which was what it did. Based on historical experience I thought that, as a result, wage growth would pick up and high inflation would become entrenched."" As well as economic data, the MPC is provided with reports from its regional agents, which are described by the Bank as its ""eyes, ears and voice"" across the UK. David Miles, an economics professor at Imperial College London who served on the MPC between 2009 and 2015, says these reports were invaluable - especially during the financial crisis. ""In early 2009, everybody knew there had been a major financial event in the UK, the banks had got into terrible trouble in October [when HBOS and RBS were rescued by the taxpayer], but it wasn't yet clear from backward-looking growth data what the impact would be. ""But we were hearing from the agents that sentiment of companies was spectacularly dire.  ""And that was why not only were interest rates cut to 0.5% in March 2009, but shortly after, we embarked on asset purchases [quantitative easing],which was bigger than anybody thought."" Following the pre-MPC meeting, policymakers meet for three days to thrash out their arguments. Both former MPC members describe the committee's debates as ""candid, open, lively and active"", but Professor Weale insists that meetings were ""always cordial - and never heated"". The discussions are chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, while chief economist Andy Haldane circulates talking points agreed by the MPC earlier in the week. The first day, usually a week before the vote, is used to thrash out initial arguments. Policymakers also agree on economic forecasts if an Inflation Report - or quarterly economic evaluation - is due to be published. Officials usually hold their first policy meeting on the Monday before the vote. This is transcribed and published with an eight-year lag. The first transcripts will be made public in 2023. Day three, normally on the Wednesday, is voting day. Mr Carney puts forward a proposal on interest rates and quantitative easing he believes will command a majority. Anyone who disagrees declares what level of interest rates he or she would prefer. The result of the vote is published on a Thursday, along with the minutes of the meeting."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Salmond 'fights back' and 'suspicious' Egypt deaths,2024-09-14,2018-08-24,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-45303939,"The Daily Mail's front page headline is ""Plastic bag tax in every shop"", as it reports the government is planning to extend the levy on single-use plastic bags in England to all businesses.  Currently, those with fewer than 250 staff are exempt.  The Mail says Prime Minister Theresa May is also considering increasing the tax from 5p to 10p.  The Daily Telegraph says Mrs May is acting on ""changing political sentiment"", which it says has turned against single-use plastic bags since the effect of litter on ocean wildlife was highlighted in the BBC's Blue Planet 2.  The Sun isn't so sure.  ""Why double the charge?"" it asks in its editorial, pointing out the 5p rate has already successfully brought about ""a massive decline"" in plastic bag usage.  With a tax on disposable coffee cups also mooted, the paper says ""enough is enough"", warning the Tories ""must end this fetish for piling new taxes on consumers"". Many of the papers set the scene for the Pope's arrival in the Republic of Ireland today.  The Daily Mirror's correspondent Rachael Bletchley describes there being pop-up Pope chairs, lollipopes and even a waving waxwork of the Holy Father for selfies.  The Financial Times reports that police leave has been cancelled, large hospitals are discharging patients in case of an emergency, and temporary morgue facilities have been set up.  But all the papers note even this huge level of interest is nothing compared to the last papal visit in 1979.  That's partly because Pope Francis's trip is taking place against a backdrop of what the Guardian calls the ""dark shadow of sexual abuse by priests"".  The Irish Times points out it also reflects the changing nature of Irish society, where more than 40% of people now go on to higher education.  This weekend, the country will listen to what the Pope has to say - its editorial suggests - but with a ""healthier sense of perspective than it showed three decades ago."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning London's murder police have begun investigating their 100th case of the year, the Daily Mail reports - an attack on a 73-year-old woman in her home in the south-west of the city.  It is, the Times has calculated, the fastest rate of stabbings, shootings and other brutal attacks in a decade. If the rate of murders continues, the Times says, more than 150 people could be killed in London by the end of the year.  The president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Prof Lesley Regan, writes in the Daily Express that allowing women in England to take abortion medication at home is a ""major step forward"".  Prof Regan says allowing women to avoid the potential pain and distress of a journey home from a clinic or hospital is the compassionate approach to take. Finally, under the headline ""Cornish nasty"", the Sun reports on the ""outrage"" that's been sparked by a baker who is preparing Cornish pasties with the pastry crimped on the top, rather than on the side, as tradition dictates.  However, bakery owner Mikaela Parry is defiant, insisting her family have been top crimpers for decades. She has dismissed those who question her ways as ""pasty fascists"".  One Facebook user has come up with what seems like the ultimate insult, however, suggesting her pasties look like like ""a Devon imitation"". "
Interest Rate Sentiment,World growth 'slowest since financial crisis',2024-09-14,2019-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50047929,"The global economy is growing at its slowest pace since the financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. The fund said world growth would hit just 3% this year - down from its July forecast of 3.2% and a sharp slowdown from just two years ago. The IMF blamed the slowdown on trade fights, Brexit uncertainty and other geopolitical crises. It added there is an ""urgent"" need for leaders to de-escalate the tensions. ""The global outlook remains precarious,"" the international lending body said in its annual report. ""At 3% growth, there is no room for policy mistakes."" The IMF, which downgraded its forecasts for most of the world, predicted that growth in advanced economies would slow from 2.3% in 2018 to 1.7% this year. In the US, where an economic boost from a 2017 tax cut has faded, the fund expects growth to pull back from 2.9% last year to 2.4% in 2019. In the UK, where Brexit-related worries have hurt investment, growth is forecast at 1.2% for 2019, down from 1.4% last year. In Germany, which is reeling from a downturn in car production, growth is predicted at 0.5%, down from 1.5% in 2018. China's economic growth is expected to slow from 6.6% to 6.1%. It has been hit by efforts to rein in risky debt and the trade war with the US, which led the IMF to shave almost a percentage point off global growth.  Thus far, the IMF said central banks have managed to blunt the impact of the slowdown with tools such as low interest rates. Without those stimulus policies, it estimates that the growth rate would have been 0.5 percentage points lower this year. ""With central banks having to spend limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes, they may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot,"" the fund said.   The World Trade Organization also recently downgraded its economic outlook, citing trade wars, Brexit and other factors. The IMF said the global economy could grow faster in 2020, at 3.4%. However, it warned that risks are ""skewed to the downside"", noting that the pickup depends on improvements in India, as well as several economies currently under severe strain, such as Argentina, Turkey and Iran.  ""Policy missteps at this juncture, such as a no-deal Brexit or a further deepening of trade disputes, could severely undermine sentiment, growth, and job creation,"" it said. ""The foremost priority, in many cases, is to remove policy-induced uncertainty or threats to growth."" By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent What can policymakers do to tackle the global economic slowdown? The commentary from the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, has something to say about three major policy tools. Trade policy is the obvious one. The IMF blames much of the weakening outlook on trade tensions so you would expect a call to reverse the tariff increases imposed by several countries, notably the US.  That does indeed top Ms Gopinath's list. Central banks have already taken steps - interest rate cuts and other measures. She describes these moves as spending limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes.  She warns that central banks may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot. It's a worry that has been bubbling for several years before the recent escalation of trade tensions as central banks reached for new ideas in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.  Ms Gopinath argues this cannot be the ""only game in town"". Governments that can afford it - she mentions Germany, in particular - should cut taxes or increase spending. And she says if things get worse, an internationally co-ordinated response along these lines might be required. "
Interest Rate Sentiment,Asia markets join global stock plunge,2024-09-14,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42956234,"Asian markets plunged on Tuesday as investors dumped stocks following the biggest US market fall for six years At one point Japan's Nikkei 225 index was down 7%, but recovered some of those losses to close 4.7% lower. London, Frankfurt and Paris all fell sharply when they opened on Tuesday with new losses of up to 3%. In the US overnight the Dow lost 4.6%. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow was up 25%, helped by a resurgent economy. Strong profits and low interest rates also underpinned the positive investment climate. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the economy's strength was such the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected.  The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing. As monetary policy begins its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money.  Fingers are hovering over the ""sell"" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to ""chase the dip"". Read more from Kamal here: Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, told the BBC the falls did not appear to herald a serious change of sentiment: ""It is always a bit too early to tell, but I think these recent market falls are in the nature of a correction.  ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added that bear markets tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""This isn't a collapse of the economy.  ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate."" One country whose immediate economic outlook remains stagnant is Japan. The authorities there said there was little chance of interest rates being increased. The Bank of Japan's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future. He said it was ""inappropriate"" to do so with inflation still about half its 2% target. But markets in Asia typically follow the lead from the US.  Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 1,649.8 points - or 5.12% - at 30,595.42 and South Korea's Kospi index gave up 2.6%. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 lost 3.2%.  On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75.  The decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US.  The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%.  The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said.  ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" However, he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. Asian markets, on the other hand, have benefitted from record low US interest rates in the last decade because money has flowed into Asia in search of stronger returns. Analysts say the expected rate rises could impact Asia over the longer term."

In recent weeks, some companies have shared plans to slow or freeze hiring. Retail giants including Walmart and Amazon have said they hired too aggressively earlier in the year and have seen their profits hit as rising prices proved more difficult to pass onto customers. Meanwhile, electric carmaker Tesla is reportedly calling a halt to hiring and has warned that 10% of its salaried workforce may need to be cut. In an email to staff, seen by the news wire Reuters, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said he had a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy. Sentiment for both consumers and the financial markets have slipped recently. Data shows that the annual rate of US inflation hit 8.3% in the year to April, which is a slight drop from the level recorded for March but is the highest rate since 1981. Analysts said the job growth in May remained solid, if slower, than over the last year. ""Part of the slowing in payrolls in recent months likely is a knee-jerk reaction to higher costs due to the surge in energy prices triggered by the war in Ukraine,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.  But we also wonder if employers have cut back hiring in anticipation of consumers' reining-in their spending?""  Though he said: ""So far, that hasn't happened."" Many economists have long warned that job growth was bound to slow after months of unusually strong gains. Employment in the US has now nearly recovered to where it was before the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, the Labor Department said. Last month, the leisure and hospitality sector - which is still catching up from deep cuts made during Covid restrictions - reported the biggest rise in new jobs, up 84,000.  Retail payrolls fell by 61,000, but the number of jobs stands higher than it did in pre-pandemic February 2020. US President Joe Biden said on Friday that the economy was moving to a ""new period of stable, steady growth"" after surging forward last year and Americans should ""expect to see more moderation"". ""We aren't likely to see the kind of blockbuster job reports month after month like we've had over this past year but that's a good thing,"" he said. ""That stability puts us in a strong position to tackle what is clearly a problem - inflation.""  Asked about the comments from Mr Musk - with whom the president has a frosty relationship - Mr Biden said other companies, such as Ford, were announcing plans to hire thousands more staff as they invest in electric vehicles.  ""Lots of luck on his trip to the moon, I guess,"" he said. As companies compete for workers, pay has been rising faster than it has in years. Last month, the average hourly wage in the US rose to $31.95 (£25.50) last month - up 5.2% compared to a year ago. However, pay growth is failing to keep up with the rising cost of living and slowed in May for a second month in a row. The US Federal Reserve, like other central banks around the world, is raising interest rates to try to curb inflation. Such moves typically slow economic growth by making borrowing more expensive and reducing demand. Sophia Koropeckyj, managing director at Moody's Analytics, said: ""Today's report will keep the Fed on track in its tightening program in order to steer the economy toward a soft landing (slowing the economy) without tipping it over the edge toward recession and to help prevent a wage-price spiral from forming. ""The probability of recession is inching higher, but we still expect better than even odds of avoiding a downturn."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,"Bogus reports, accidental finds - the Oxford vaccine story",2024-09-14,2020-12-14,By Fergus Walsh,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55308216,"In the early hours of Saturday 11 January, Prof Teresa Lambe was woken up by the ping of her email. The information she had been waiting for had just arrived in her inbox: the genetic code for a new coronavirus, shared worldwide by scientists in China.  She got to work straight away, still in her pyjamas, and was glued to her laptop for the next 48 hours. ""My family didn't see me very much that weekend, but I think that set the tone for the rest of the year,"" she says.   By Monday morning, she had it: the template for a new experimental coronavirus vaccine. The first death from the new virus was reported around the same time, but it was still a month before the disease it causes was named Covid-19. Lambe's team at Oxford University's Jenner Institute, led by Prof Sarah Gilbert, was always on the lookout for Disease X - the name given to the unknown infectious agent that could trigger the next pandemic. They had already used their experimental vaccine system against malaria and flu and, crucially, against another type of coronavirus, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (Mers). So they were confident it could work again.  That weekend was the first step on a journey to create a vaccine at lightning speed, for a disease that would, in a matter of months, claim more than 1.5 million lives. I have been following the efforts of the Oxford scientists since the start. There have been dramas along the way, including: In the middle of January Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, which runs clinical trials, shared a taxi with a modeller who worked for the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. During the journey, the scientist told him data suggested there was going to be a pandemic not unlike the 1918 flu.  ""I went from someone who was aware of a small outbreak in China, which was of academic interest, to realising that it was going to change our lives. It was a chilling moment,"" Pollard says.  Pollard got in touch with Gilbert and found her team at the Jenner Institute was already working on a vaccine. They agreed to collaborate on a clinical trial. By February the virus had spread to more than two dozen countries, including the UK and the US. There had been more than 1,000 deaths in China.  But getting funding for trials was still a struggle. It was all Gilbert thought about, getting up at 04:00 to ""write the grant application trying to persuade somebody that money I'd been awarded for a different project would actually be better spent on this project,"" she says.  It was another month before the UK was put into lockdown, and the government announced funding to support clinical trials and manufacturing. This meant the vaccine could go into production.  The first doses were made at the university's own bio-manufacturing facility after Prof Catherine Green had created a cell culture from which it could be grown, using Lambe's blueprint.  The science behind the vaccine is fascinating. It is created from a modified virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees, which has had a tiny bit of genetic material removed so that it can't trigger infection in humans. Into this gap is inserted a fragment of the genetic code for coronavirus. This forms the vaccine. The technical term is a viral vector vaccine.   Such vaccines are grown in human cell culture which has a gene added to allow the viral particles to multiply at an enormous rate. Billions and billions are grown in bioreactors, and then purified. One of the team said it was like the recipe for Coke - once you knew the secret, and followed a formula, it could be done anywhere. Having seen the procedure, with all the technicians, working on different parts of the recipe, I prefer to think of it as a bit like a Vaccine MasterChef.  But lockdown brought significant challenges. Getting hold of PPE was a logistical nightmare, and Green was reduced to making hand sanitiser in the lab. Her team worked round the clock, doing double shifts, seven days a week. ""We didn't wait for the results of one stage before we went on to the next stage,"" she says. ""So we took a risk... We still did the checks and if the checks had come back as a fail, we'd have had to throw away all the things we'd done."" The checks did not fail, and after seven weeks they had enough doses of the vaccine to start the first trial. By this stage 10,000 volunteers had been recruited - all of them signing up within a matter of hours. Elisa Granato, a microbiologist, and Edward O'Neill, a cancer researcher, were the first two to receive Oxford's trial jab in April.  For Lambe, the vaccination of the first individuals was a monumental step. ""I remember walking home from the lab and almost breaking down because we had a vaccine and got it into somebody's arm,"" she says.  The team waited 48 hours to check Granato and O'Neill had had no serious adverse reactions. With both doing well, they immunised a further six volunteers, and then gradually ramped up the numbers. But only a few days later there were shocking reports on social media that the first volunteer, Granato, had died.  It wasn't true. I spoke to her that day, and she told me she had never felt better. I posted a bit of the interview online. It helped quash the story, but not completely. Bizarrely, there were suggestions the interview might be fake and she really needed to hold up that day's newspaper to the camera as ""proof of life"". ""It was very upsetting,"" says Gilbert. ""A lot of work had to be done, for her sake as well as for the trial's sake, to make it clear that this was just fake news."" Disinformation spreads fast and has the potential to undo months of hard work. Green found it very stressful. ""Oh God it's awful! To think how malicious that can be, how people are really spreading nasty things… that doesn't feel fair because my team were all doing their best,"" she says.   As the trial grew, it was clear that Oxford's small manufacturing facility would not be able to keep up with demand. The team decided to outsource some of the manufacturing to Italy. But when the first batch was ready, there was a snag - the Europe-wide lockdown meant there were no flights to airlift it from Rome.  ""Eventually we chartered a plane to bring 500 doses of vaccine because it was the only way we could get it here in time,"" says Green. This is a really important part of the story which ended up being highly significant months later. The Italian manufacturers used a different technique to Oxford to check the concentration of the vaccine - effectively how many viral particles are floating in each dose. When the Oxford scientists used their method, it appeared that the Italian vaccine was double strength.  What to do? Calls were made to the medical regulators. It was agreed that volunteers should be given a half measure of the vaccine, on the basis that it was likely to equate to something more like a regular dose. This was partly a safety issue - they preferred to give them too little rather than too much. But after a week, the scientists became aware that something unusual was going on. The volunteers were getting none of the usual side-effects - such as sore arms or fever. About 1,300 volunteers had only received a half-dose of the vaccine, rather than a full one. The independent regulators said the trial should continue and that the half-dose group could remain in the study.  The Oxford team bristle at any suggestion that there was a mistake, error, call it what you will. Perhaps the most accurate characterisation is that the volunteers were inadvertently given a lower dose. In months to come, they would be the stellar group in terms of vaccine efficacy.  From the start, the team at Oxford had had the goal of creating a vaccine that could help the world. To do that they would need billions of doses - something only industry could provide.  Sir Mene Pangalos, of the Cambridge-based pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, suggested the company could help. But there was a potential hitch - Oxford insisted the vaccine should be affordable, which meant no profit for the pharmaceutical company. ""Not usually the way big pharma works,"" says Pollard.   After intense negotiations, they reached a deal at the end of April. The vaccine would be provided on a not-for-profit basis worldwide, for the duration of the pandemic, and always at cost to low- and middle-income countries.  Most importantly of all, AstraZeneca agreed to take on the financial risk, even if the vaccine turned out not to work.  In May, in a huge vote of confidence, the UK government agreed to buy 100 million doses and provided nearly £90m in support. By then there were nearly a dozen coronavirus vaccines in human trials around the world. At the start of summer, levels of coronavirus infection were falling in the UK. While this was good news for society, it made life more difficult for the trial, which relied on volunteers being exposed to coronavirus in order to figure out if the vaccine would protect them.  ""There was a real risk that we wouldn't be able to get the answers that we'd hoped for really quickly,"" says Pollard.  They decided to expand to 19 sites around the UK.  For a vaccine that was intended for global use, it was important to test it in other countries too, to see how it worked in different populations. Trials began in South Africa and Brazil - which would soon have the second-highest death toll after the United States.  On 20 July, the initial results were released, showing whether the vaccine had stimulated the immune systems of the first 1,000 volunteers. The team was feeling the pressure. ""I've worked in vaccines for long enough to know that most vaccines actually don't work. And it's the worst feeling in the world to have such high expectations and then to see nothing,"" says Prof Katie Ewer, who leads the team studying T-cell response.  It was good news, though. The vaccine appeared to be safe, and had triggered the two-pronged immune response they were hoping for - producing antibodies which neutralise the virus, and T cells which can kill cells which have become infected. But the data also led to a change of strategy. Until then, the Oxford team had hoped to produce a vaccine that could be delivered in a single dose, so there was more vaccine to go round.  However, 10 participants who were given two doses showed a much stronger immune response, so all volunteers were invited back for a booster, to maximise the chances of protection.  Although these early results were promising, at this stage there was still no evidence to show whether the vaccine would actually protect against Covid-19. What's more, up until this point it had only been tested on adults under the age of 55. Now older volunteers could be enrolled. Unlike other vaccines being trialled, the Oxford team had been taking weekly swabs from all volunteers to check whether they were infected but showing no symptoms. If the vaccine could prevent silent transmission it could stop them from unwittingly passing on the virus. ""That's a big deal. Because that means the virus could be stopped in its tracks,"" says Pollard. Intriguingly, when the trial results came out, there were indications it may partly suppress transmission of the virus. But more evidence is needed.   By the end of the summer, trials of the vaccine were running in six countries including the UK, Brazil, South Africa and the United States. Nearly 20,000 volunteers had been recruited. But on 6 September suddenly everything stopped.  A participant had developed a rare neurological condition.  ""In a clinical trial of tens of thousands of people, stuff happens,"" says Pollard. ""People develop illnesses, there will be people who develop cancers and who develop neurological conditions - the difficulty... is to work out whether it's associated with the… vaccine.  An independent safety review did not find any reason to suspect the illness had been caused by the vaccine. But they couldn't rule it out either.  The volunteer is still part of the trial and is recovering. Safety regulators in the UK, Brazil and South Africa gave the green light for the trials to resume within days, but it was six weeks before they were allowed to resume in the US.  All this came amidst a climate of anti-vaccine sentiment - not just online, but with demonstrations taking place around the world. Transparency and openness about the vaccination process is one way of overcoming such mistrust. This is partly why the extremely busy team of scientists has given the BBC access to their labs over the past year.  In November, two other vaccine trials published their results. They were astonishing. First Pfizer-BioNTech, then a week later Moderna, announced its vaccines were about 95% effective. The team in Oxford were encouraged. Until then there was uncertainty that any vaccine could work on Covid-19, says Lambe. ""There are so many infectious diseases out there that we can't impact.""  Finally, on 21 November, the independent data safety committee was ready to reveal the Oxford-AstraZeneca findings. But the results were surprising - and more complex than expected.  Whereas Pfizer and Moderna had one efficacy figure from one big trial each, the Oxford jab ended up with three numbers: 70% overall, with the two full doses giving 62% protection while the smaller group, who were given that initial half dose had the highest protection, had 90%. It was a result no-one had expected.  Crucially, no-one who got the vaccine was hospitalised or got seriously ill due to Covid. Whereas in the control group there were 10 serious cases and one death. The fact that those who had unwittingly been given the initial half dose from Italy showed stronger protection is intriguing. It may be caused by the immune system being primed more gradually, but the scientists can't yet explain it. Also, all the volunteers in this group were under 55. Within days, concern was voiced. AstraZeneca accepts that the US regulator, the FDA is likely to hold off approval for now - the company is half-way through recruiting 30,000 volunteers for an American trial. ""We will take them through the data set but my assumption is that they will want to see the US data as well,"" says Mene Pangalos. Here, the data is with the UK regulator - everyone is waiting for its decision.  Even at the lowest level of efficacy, the Oxford vaccine passes the effectiveness test with flying colours. The overall effectiveness of 70% is better than most flu vaccines.  Perhaps the main area of debate will be over older adults. There isn't much efficacy data yet from older age groups, since seniors were recruited later. This information will come. There is clear evidence however that the immune response to the vaccine does not decline with age, as it does against other vaccines like flu. This suggests, but doesn't prove, that the jab will offer protection in the elderly. ""Look, I think there is no doubt that we would've run the study a little bit differently if we'd been doing it from scratch, but ultimately we've done as good a job as we possibly can to translate that in to the data set that we can provide to the regulators around the world for approval,"" says Pangalos. ""The processes we've gone through are the same and just as rigorous as in normal times."" Last week, the Oxford team published an analysis of their trial data in a medical journal - the Lancet. This transparency has reassured experts. While the Pfizer vaccine is already being rolled out, the Oxford-AstraZeneca one has a crucial advantage - its vials can be stored and transported at normal fridge temperature.  This is game-changing, says Sir Jeremy Farrar, the head of Wellcome Trust. ""If you have to store vaccines on dry ice that brings additional challenges of how to get it into villages in the UK, let alone villages in sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil."" The UK has preordered millions of vaccine doses which, together, will be more than enough to give every adult in the UK two doses next year. Four million doses of the Oxford vaccine are ready to be handed over to the NHS. The government hopes by Easter most over-65s and vulnerable groups will be protected. A chance for life to finally return to normal. How does it feel to have got this far in a little under 12 months? ""It's a relief at this stage, says Gilbert, ""that all of the work that people have done during the year and all of the money that's been spent on manufacturing large amounts of this vaccine, is not going to go to waste."" On the day the results were made public, Green came home to find a colleague had left a magnum of English sparkling wine on her doorstep. But she hasn't had a chance to get together with enough people to drink it yet. ""It's a bit overwhelming to feel that the sacrifices we've made paid off and we did something big. It was worth it, because we worked really hard, I think we all had a little cry,"" says Green.  Pangalos hopes the vaccine means he will be able to visit his mother in Greece - they haven't seen each other since last Christmas. The other members of the team haven't seen much of their families either, even when living in the same house. ""My son said something the other day that really impacted me,"" says Lambe. ""I was apologising for being late home from work again and he said, 'It's OK mummy, you're doing it for everybody. It's not just me you need to look after.' And that did bring a tear to my eye."" Over the course of the year it's been an emotional journey for everyone working on the vaccine,  But in the end it was the cold, hard science that really made the difference. ""I think science has been the exit strategy for this pandemic and vaccines are at the heart of that scientific endeavour,"" says Farrar. ""It's been remarkable, there's never been a year of progress scientifically like this in my lifetime.""

Interest Rate Sentiment,'There is help out there if you ask for it',2024-09-14,2020-04-19,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52323926,"Natalie Raeside has been a painter and decorator for 20 years, following in her father's footsteps. The 36-year-old, a former British Young Decorator of the Year, was self-employed and doing well enough to tick along. She never expected herself to be on the breadline. But then her 15-year-old daughter, a first-rate figure skater, fell in training and fractured her hip.  Natalie, a single mother from Ayrshire, took time off to look after her, only to find her return to work had been curtailed by the coronavirus outbreak. A steady income that paid the bills went down to nothing. ""There are many people in the same position as me, working successfully and never thinking we would be in this situation,"" she says. ""I had enough to get us through March, but getting into April looked hard."" She made an application for universal credit, just like 1.4 million other people in the UK in the space of a month. The first benefits payment takes five weeks to come through, unless you take an advance. She took to the phone to organise payment holidays, most significantly for her mortgage. Financial support promised by the government for the self-employed will not reach her until June. Then, on a Facebook group, she learned about the Coronavirus Grant Fund from Turn2Us, a charity that helps people in financial hardship to gain access to welfare benefits, grants and support. The grants of £500, which are funded by donations, do not need to be paid back. People in sudden hardship, with less than £1,000 in savings as an individual, or £2,000 as a couple, can apply. Natalie was one of the very first to benefit. ""It has allowed me to pay some bills and, most importantly, for food,"" she says. ""My message is that there is help out there if you ask for it."" That help is being provided by organisations across the charity sector, but also through support from businesses less affected by the lockdown, banks, and credit unions. Many are drawing on the generosity of spirit displayed in neighbourhoods as they clap their support for NHS and care workers, and are translating that into financial generosity. The Turn2Us appeal has raised £1.6m in just three weeks, all of which will go to people in hardship in the form of £500 grants and increasing the opening hours of its free helpline. The money is paid within three days or less of an online application, which must include evidence of an applicant's difficulties, such as bank statements. ""It is always £500 - enough for food and bills for a couple of weeks until benefits come in,"" says Thomas Lawson, the charity's chief executive. He says that while government support is generous, it will not reach some people fast enough, if at all. That was when grant organisations such as his, as well as the welfare system, needed to step in. We should remember, he argues, that those working in job centres are also on the front line of this crisis. The charity's research suggests the self-employed, single mums and 18 to 25-year-olds who already had insecure jobs, such as working on zero-hours contracts, were particularly at risk from the economic effects of the pandemic. Overall, it estimates that 3.5 million people could make new claims for universal credit. Some 31% of those seeking help from the organisation did not have enough money to pay for food right now. ""People on the lowest incomes are often the best at managing budgets. They want the dignity of working, but there is financial fragility for a vast number of people,"" Mr Lawson says. That fragility is also leading to greater demand for borrowing small amounts of money from credit unions to pay for food, rent and bills. ""If they do not come to us, they could be going to loan sharks,"" says Jonathan Moore, chief executive of Stockport Credit Union. Its operation is much smaller than that of national charity Turn2Us, but the sentiment is much the same. In an open letter to the local community, Mr Moore asked residents and business owners to invest £1,000 of their savings in the local credit union. This is not a donation, but an alternative savings account, which is fully protected. The aim is to get 1,000 people to put money in, allowing the credit union to lend £1m at manageable interest rates to local people in need. People can join the ""Friends Of"" scheme online. ""It is the ideal opportunity for people who want to help their community if they have some money saved for a rainy day,"" says Mr Moore. For those who have seen their income fall, and face the extra costs of children at home, a small credit union loan could make a big difference, he says. People and businesses are already making investments and donations to help those in need. One of those includes corporate finance company Oakley Advisory, which has donated to Turn2Us. ""Sadly it wasn't a surprise when we heard the sheer volume of additional calls they are getting and the increasing demand on their services across the board - from their digital services, to the thousands of people turning to them for crisis grants,"" said its managing partner Chris Godsmark. ""Charities like this are crucial in combating the secondary impact of coronavirus, which is on peoples' incomes and lives more broadly."" For those on the receiving end, there is gratitude. ""I just want to say a massive thank you,"" says Natalie Raeside, who now has the money to tide her over until government financial support arrives. ""I am so grateful, but I know there are so many other people in this position."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,Energy and food drive US inflation to 40-year high,2024-09-14,2022-06-10,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61762131,"Prices in the US rose faster than expected last month, as rising energy and food costs pushed inflation to the highest rate since 1981. The annual inflation rate rose to 8.6% in May, the Labor Department said, after easing in April. The rising cost of living has been squeezing households and putting pressure on policymakers to bring the issue under control. The US central bank has been raising interest rates since March. Analysts had hoped that the moves were starting to work to cool economic activity, easing the price pressures. But the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has driven up the price of oil and commodities like wheat as it disrupts exports from the two countries, has made tackling the problem more difficult. Food prices were up more than 10% last month compared to May 2021, while energy surged more than 34%. But Friday's report showed the increases continue to spread throughout the economy, pushing the cost of everything from airline tickets and clothing to medical services higher. ""So much for the idea that inflation has peaked. Consumer prices blew past expectations - and not in a good way with the 8.6% annual increase the fastest in more than 40 years,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.  ""Worse the increases were nearly ubiquitous. Just no place to hide."" The US has been grappling with rising prices since last year, when an unexpectedly strong economic rebound from the shock of the pandemic - driven by large doses of US government spending, including direct cheques to households - overwhelmed supplies, prompting companies to raise prices. Now the war in Ukraine has spread the problem around the world, with Covid-related shutdowns in China this spring contributing. As the rising costs hit household purchasing power and prompt a pullback in spending, officials are warning that growth in many countries is at risk of a sharp downturn. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" World Bank President David Malpass said this week. US stock markets fell in the wake of the inflation reports, with all three major indexes dropping more than 2%. The falls added to weeks of declines in US shares, as investors become nervous about the path for the economy. ""Even if inflation peaks soon, it's unlikely to decelerate quickly."" said Richard Flynn, managing director of Charles Schwab UK. ""High prices may put pressure on consumer spending into the medium term.  ""Add ongoing supply-chain problems and the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the threat of inflation, and it's easy to see why fears of a downturn have risen swiftly.""  For now, the US labour market has continued to add jobs, a sign that growth is continuing. But wages have not kept pace as prices climb. The rising cost of living has especially hit lower income households, for whom basics like food and energy make up large portions of spending. Polls show a majority of Americans see inflation as the top problem facing the country. Consumer sentiment has plunged and US President Joe Biden's approval ratings have sunk as Republicans criticise him over the issue. Over the month, prices gained 1%, driven by the rising cost of petrol, which has hit new records in the US, approaching an average of nearly $5 a gallon. In hearings in Washington this week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said bringing down prices was the ""number one priority"". In a statement, Mr Biden said ""we must do more - and quickly - to get prices down here in the United States"". ""I'm doing everything in my power to blunt Putin's price hike, and bring down the cost of oil and food,"" the president later pledged at a speech at the Port of Los Angeles in California. Roberto Perli, head of global policy research at Piper Sandler investment bank, said he expected prices to come under control as America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, increases interest rates. But he warned that raising borrowing costs will hurt economic growth. ""For now, the US economy is very healthy and you see it reflected in the fact that there is such a strong demand for pretty much everything, goods and services. But the Fed has to take care of the problem,"" he said.  ""The result will be not now but in the quarters ahead a significant slowdown in the US economy, induced in large part by the Fed."""
Interest Rate Sentiment,'GB are like a sleeping giant',2024-09-14,2020-02-25,Sir Chris Hoy,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/51531941,"UCI Track Cycling World Championships Venue: Berlin Velodrome, Germany Dates: 26 February-1 March Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC Red Button, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app These are the most important and exciting World Championships in the four-year Olympic cycle. There is so much more riding on them than just rainbow jerseys because we're really getting towards the sharp end. The World Championships are a stepping stone to the Olympics, but it's super exciting because this is the final selection event for all the teams. It's getting really tight in certain events, and this is the last chance for riders to show what they have got leading into Tokyo. The Great Britain team are the healthiest they have been in the past four years. In some ways it has worked really well in that they are the underdogs going into certain events, but in almost every single event we have a medal chance. They won't be at their very best but they're definitely going to be the best we have seen since Rio 2016. And I think the rest of the world will be nervous looking at GB even though they haven't dominated over the past three or four years. They're like a sleeping giant. Are the GB team suddenly going to get back to where everybody expects them to be? Are we going to see some huge performances from some of the established stars? Will that shake the confidence of the guys from other nations who have been dominant? BBC live coverage: Times and platforms Great Britain's squad for Berlin HSBC to end British Cycling sponsorship Ed Clancy is a three-time Olympic gold medallist and six-time world champion The GB men's endurance squad are looking good but the world has moved on and the standard has been raised. Traditionally, it's been seen as an Australia-GB head to head in the team pursuit, but now you've got maybe five or six different nations who are fighting it out for the gold medal. For the riders, it's extremely tough, but the GB boys just need to focus on themselves and prove they are worthy of wearing that Olympic jersey. I really hope three-time Olympic champion Ed Clancy makes the Tokyo team, and this is his last chance to cement his place. I would say he is the greatest team pursuit rider of all time. I think they need him, but they will only pick him if he is absolutely on top form. There is no room for sentiment and he won't be selected on his reputation. It would be fantastic if Ed could produce a really good performance in Berlin. His experience and ability to shoulder pressure could be crucial in Tokyo. Matt Walls has been exceptional over the past couple of years. He's really earned his place in the squad, as has Ethan Hayter - they're two exceptional riders. Mark Stewart has performed incredibly well in the bunch races at the highest level. His ride at the Commonwealth Games to win gold in the points race was one of the best in the past four years of any British rider on the track. It was so gutsy. When he's on form, he's a match for anybody. I think there will be two or three medals from the men's endurance squad - but we'll have to wait and see whether they get a gold. Focus is on Tokyo 2020, not Worlds - Clancy Laura Kenny broke her shoulder in January and while she will race in Berlin you can't underestimate how much a crash or an injury like that can affect your confidence and your preparation. It will be a big setback, but I have no doubt that she can still physically get herself back to where she needs to be in time for Tokyo. However, she will have really wanted to lay down some big markers in Berlin to prove she is still the rider to beat. It's been an interesting progression between her and Katie Archibald over the past few years. Laura was the queen bee of the women's endurance squad, but Katie has produced some incredible performances - so the big question is who does get that omnium place in Tokyo? Laura Kenny opted against surgery after breaking her shoulder in Milton, Canada You've got Elinor Barker in the mix too, an incredibly successful world champion in her own right, so I think Laura will be frustrated. It is just really unfortunate but that is the nature of the sport. Looking at the past three Olympic cycles, the women's endurance squad have been your bankers for gold medals, but it's getting tougher and other nations are raising their bar. But it seems that GB have always got a little bit extra to give, no matter whether it's the Americans, the Kiwis, the Aussies or whoever coming at them. They will be the team to beat, and everybody who is in the squad and in the running will be trying to prove they are the ones to be picked for Tokyo. Jason Kenny needs just one gold medal in Tokyo to become GB's most successful Olympian, a title I share with him at the moment. But he won't be feeling the pressure because I don't think he's motivated by these accolades. He's motivated by medals, he wants to be the best he can and get the best results. Jason is really starting to show some interesting form in the keirin - at the World Cup in Glasgow he was taking the race on from the front with confidence; he was making the big moves. I think he could be an outside chance to win a medal and he might surprise quite a few people. We've always been on the back foot in the team sprint going into the past three or four Olympics, but traditionally we've been able to perform when it counts. However, this time it is the biggest challenge the GB team have faced in recent times because the Dutch have been so strong. Jason has previously said that Jack Carlin is the benchmark, external for the squad, and I would agree. Jack has shown that he can make world-level finals, and his silver medals in 2018 - at the World Championships and the Commonwealth Games - saw the rest of the world really start to take him seriously. This is a guy who can beat anybody on his day. I think he was disappointed with his season last year. We were hoping to see his progression continue and it plateaued a little bit, but he has the potential. I'd love to see him get back to his very best and beyond. Katy Marchant won keirin gold by a slender margin at Track Cycling World Cup in Glasgow It's really interesting because since the team sprint ship has sailed in terms of qualification for Tokyo, it has really unleashed Katy Marchant. Training for the team sprint wasn't helping her in the individual sprint and the keirin, but now she can train in bigger gears and really focus on the strategies for being the best she can be in the individual events. The confidence with which she performed in Glasgow made it one of the rides of the year. It was fantastic to see her take on that keirin final and win it. That really gave her confidence and the belief that she can be a genuine medal contender in Tokyo. It will be interesting for the younger riders in the team sprint - Lauren Bate and Sophie Capewell - to get the chance to shine and establish themselves without any real pressure of qualification concerns. GB at recent World Championships Year Gold Silver Bronze Total Medal table Pruszkow 2019 1 2 1 4 6th Apeldoorn 2018 2 3 1 6 3rd= Hong Kong 2017 2 2 1 5 4th= London 2016 5 1 3 9 1st Paris 2015 0 3 0 3 10th Cali 2014 2 1 2 5 4th Minsk 2013 5 2 2 9 1st Melbourne 2012 6 4 3 13 2nd It's the first time in recent history where the medal chances are spread evenly across many nations - you just won't get one country winning six or seven gold medals. For the neutral observers, that's a really good thing. It's lovely when your home nation is dominating but to keep interest across the board and around the globe, it's important that the smaller nations have a chance to win and can show you don't have to have a massive set-up in order to be successful. One of the stars of the championships could well be Lee Wai-sze of Hong Kong. She's already a superstar but I think this will be a significant moment for her if she can continue her progression in Berlin and leading into Tokyo. After the accident in which Kristina Vogel - the superstar of women's sprinting - was paralysed, there was a massive void in world sprinting but Lee has filled that and really established herself as the person to beat. It's sad that we'll never see that competition between her and Vogel but I think Lee is a new star and she's definitely one to watch. Sir Chris Hoy was speaking to BBC Sport's Katie Falkingham.

Interest Rate Sentiment,Shares fall on concerns of further China lockdowns,2024-09-14,2022-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61239151,"Shares in the US and Asia have fallen on fears about the impact of lockdowns in China on global economic growth. On Tuesday, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index closed at its lowest level since late 2020. Tesla was a big faller, with more than $125bn (£99.3bn) wiped off its market value as boss Elon Musk moves ahead with his takeover of Twitter. Concerns about earnings reports from some of the world's biggest technology firms also weighed on markets. At the same time, news that Russia will cut gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria also added to the negative sentiment. Investors were already worried about the prospects for aggressive interest rate hikes in the US and around the world to combat rising global inflation and the war in Ukraine. Authorities in Beijing are trying to stamp out a Covid-19 outbreak and avoid a repeat of the city-wide restrictions that have kept Shanghai in lockdown for a month. That has raised concerns about the prospects for growth in the world's second largest economy and the potential knock-on effect globally. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 1.2% lower, while South Korea's Kospi index fell by 1.1%. That followed stock market falls in New York, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 2.4% lower and the Nasdaq losing almost 4% on Tuesday. Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told the BBC that there were concerns over a possible lockdown of Beijing. ""The extended lockdown in Shanghai and other parts of the country has seriously damaged economic activity and consumer sentiment,"" Mr Tan said. ""Beijing alone contributes about 3.5% of China's GDP, while Shanghai contributes around 4%. So it would be a massive blow to the overall economy if these two cities were to be locked down at the same time,"" he added. However, shares in mainland China rose after losses earlier in the week. On Wednesday, the Shanghai Composite added 2.5% and the CSI 300 gained 2.9%. Meanwhile, Tesla shares lost more than 12% as its chief executive moved ahead with his takeover of Twitter. ""The only thing we know for sure is that Musk considers himself a free speech absolutist, so that will be what the platform will primarily focus on from now,"" said Dexter Thillien, lead analyst for technology and telecoms at Economist Intelligence Unit. After US markets closed, Google's parent company Alphabet said the war in Ukraine hurt YouTube advertising sales, which helped send its shares lower in after-hours trade."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Why US 'YOLO' spending baffles economists,2024-09-14,2023-12-01,Megan Carnegie and Leah Carroll,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231130-why-americans-yolo-spending-attitude-baffles-economists,"Despite past trends, US consumers are spending at record levels. Economists are mystified – and struggling to forecast an end point. Throughout a period of sky-high interest rates, depleted savings and grinding inflation, Americans have spent with abandon. On Black Friday, sales at brick-and-mortar stores were up 1.1% from last year; online alone, US shoppers spent a record $9.8bn (£7.72bn) online alone. Consumers spent another $12.4bn (£9.77bn) on Cyber Monday – an eye-popping 9.6% increase over last year. This holiday splurge follows a pattern of US consumer spending, which has buoyed the American economy in the past year, making up nearly 70% of the real GDP's 4.9% Q3 growth.  While some of this spending reflects the rising cost of necessities, Americans are also still buying big-ticket items and laying out tons of cash for experiences. This ""YOLO"" attitude towards money bucks the spending trends of past economic downturns – and some economists have been left scratching their heads, especially as consumer sentiment on the economy remains overwhelmingly pessimistic. ""If 18 months ago, you'd have said the Federal Reserve Bank could raise interest rates by 500 basis points, and the consumer would chug on, relatively unfazed, I would have been extremely surprised,"" says Ellie Henderson, an economist at UK-based, global bank Investec. ""I'd have said, 'that's just not how economics works'."" Typically, after a major crisis or job-market downshift, the economy generally experiences a small bump in both consumer savings and spending. However, the San Francisco Reserve Bank (SFRB) reported in May that the post-pandemic rise in fiscal spending this year has soared beyond the growth of any other post-1970s recessions.  Much of that growth, wrote SFRB experts, is due to an ""unprecedented"" increase of accumulated savings in US households, driven by the US Federal Government's swift fiscal response to the pandemic. Stimulus packages that directly introduced $5tn (£3.9tn) into the US economy, combined with other indirect policies, including eviction moratoriums and the suspension of student loan payments, saved Americans about $2.3tn (£1.8tn)  in 2020 and 2021. Although this year, people have drawn down their savings, many consumers still have money in their reserves – some for the first time ever – and they're willing to spend it now, even as they don't have faith in a full economic rebound. This sustained period of ""you-only-live-once""-esque spending amid rising debt and dwindling savings has confounded many economists. Leading the charge on this YOLO spending, reports Boston Consulting Group, are the younger, upper-middle class segments of the US population. While these individuals are not necessarily affluent, they are earning enough money to meet their needs, and are still able to spend on pleasure trips and luxury goods. Many of them are also leaning into using buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) platforms, which are experiencing major growth in the US, including during November's Black Friday shopping spree.  ""The strength of consumer spending, even after the dark days of the pandemic, has taken me by surprise,"" says Wendy Edelberg, senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution, and director of The Hamilton Project.  Even if the pattern doesn't follow economic precedent, however, some experts argue it makes sense intuitively. ""When you don't really know what the future holds – or even if there's a long enough future for you – people are focusing on the present and the short-term horizon,"" says Chiraag Mittal, an assistant professor of marketing at the McIntire School of Commerce, University of Virginia. And, he says, amid shifting attitudes around work and life, ""people are choosing to prioritise their happiness and fun"". Malcolm Harris, author of Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World, argues intangible factors like these often get lost in the qualitative analyses that seek to explain macroeconomic trends. ""Working life can change in qualitative ways that the metrics are bad at picking up,” he says. Even though many people are still employed and earning pay cheques, he argues, they're not necessarily happy – wages still are not keeping up with the pace of inflation, for instance, and people are still reeling from the physical and psychological trauma of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Although job satisfaction numbers seem strong, life happiness metrics are in the dumps,"" says Harris. ""Given how much of our life is related to work, how can analysts square that circle?"" However inexplicable the phenomenon feels, several economists agree these YOLO spending patterns can't continue forever, and that the economic landscape is on the brink of change.  Henderson says there are major headwinds coming that could affect this, such as the October expiration of childcare grants, and the return of student loan payments. ""How could that not hit consumption going forward?"" she says. Additionally, US credit card debt has surpassed $1tn (£788bn) for the first time, and economists predict it's unlikely the cost of basic goods will drop soon, even as inflation slows. (Plus, those BNPL bills will come due, too.) Henderson predicts it's only a matter of time before some Americans are forced to tighten their belts and restrain their splurging. After such an exceptional fiscal year, however, Edelberg is less certain. ""I really don't know when it will go down – it depends on which part of my brain you ask,"" she says. If she were to hedge, she says the behaviour change would come by the end of the year. Yet, she says, ""honestly, I would not be surprised if I were surprised""."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Isolating: What Sweden can teach us,2024-09-14,2020-03-28,Maddy Savage,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200328-how-to-self-isolate-what-we-can-learn-from-sweden,"Swedes are used to living alone, following rules and championing innovation. How much will these social norms help during the coronavirus crisis? While people around the world are climbing the walls due to coronavirus lockdowns and social distancing, 21-year-old Swede Cajsa Wiking is unfazed by the prospect of spending time alone in her one-bedroom apartment in Uppsala.   “We are pretty good at staying home and aren't very social compared to other cultures...so that makes it easier for us,” she says. “I’m doing things like organising my closet, working out at home and I’m also reading more.” More than half of all Swedish homes are, like Wiking’s, made up of one resident, the highest proportion in Europe, according to Eurostat figures. The most common age to move out from your parents’ place is between 18 and 19, compared to an EU average of 26.   Some experts believe that these living patterns might help stem the spread of coronavirus; in current hotspots for infections including Italy and Spain, it is – by contrast – much more common for large families to congregate under one roof. “If you have a household with several generations, of course you are going to have a quick spread,” says Björn Olsen, a professor of infectious diseases at Uppsala University. “We have a lot of single people living in Stockholm, in the big cities in Sweden, and that could sort of slow the pace a little bit.”   Other commentators have pointed out the way many Swedes already behave when they’re outside in public spaces: it’s the norm to avoid sitting close to others on public transport and unusual to strike up small talk with strangers in shops or cafes. “As for social distancing, Swedes already have that down and naturally gave each other tons of physical space way before the coronavirus pandemic hit,” says Lola Akinmade Åkerström, an author on Swedish culture.   Swedes are also used to “staying at home at the slightest inkling of a headache”, she adds, a sign that those with mild coronavirus symptoms are perhaps more likely to hunker down.  This is partly because employers tend to encourage staff to take time off if they have coughs or colds to avoid sickness spreading within companies, while Sweden offers generous sick pay compared to many countries. Collective responsibility Sweden’s more formal efforts to tackle the coronavirus are controversial. Unlike in neighbouring European countries (including Denmark, which currently has a similar number of fatalities), public authorities are avoiding stricter measures and following a strategy of trying to slow down the spread of the virus in a calm and controlled way, while focusing on the protection of vulnerable groups. This means schools for pupils under 16 remain open as well as most shops. Pubs and restaurants are still in business offering both table service and takeaway, although they’ve been asked to stop serving people at counters, and all events for over 50 people have been banned. The government has asked people to follow authorities’ advice and take voluntary collective responsibility for slowing the spread of coronavirus. This includes working from home where possible, especially in the capital, self-isolating if you’re sick or over 70, and avoiding all non-essential travel. “We who are adults need to be exactly that: adults. Not spread panic or rumours,” Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said recently in his first televised address to the nation since the start of the crisis. “No one is alone in this crisis, but each person has a heavy responsibility.” The public’s response so far is largely indicative of the nation’s long-standing confidence in the state. A majority of Swedes watched and approved of his speech and believe the country can tackle the crisis well, according to a nationwide survey for Novus, a major polling company. Stockholm’s public transport company SL says it saw passenger numbers fall by 50% on subway and commuter trains last week. Polls suggest three-quarters of Swedes are keeping at least a metre away from others at least some of the time. At least a third of Stockholmers are remote working, while Stockholm Business Region, funded by the city council, estimates that levels are well above 90% in the capital’s largest companies. Swedes also haven’t been panic buying as much as in other countries, although Lola Akinmade Åkerström remarks that “for one of the world’s top producers of toilet paper, it was surprising to witness the initial mad rush to stockpile toilet roll”. But not all Swedes are taking the virus seriously. “I've still seen a lot of people [on social media] still hosting birthday parties with maybe 50 guests and going out clubbing, thinking nothing is the matter with that,” says Cajsa Wiking. “So I think definitely it is still a problem here, although it's different from other countries.” “People are really keen to try and meet up, maybe because of the lack of social interaction you normally get through work,” adds Christoffer Carringer, a 29-year-old TV producer in Stockholm who says most people he knows are now working from home. He says his friends are “trying to be responsible” by going to the pub in groups of two or three and avoiding the most crowded places. One mathematician has accused authorities of “playing Russian roulette” with the population by not introducing stricter rules, while several virologists including Professor Björn Olsen have called for Swedish authorities to follow other countries and “shut down everything that’s possible to shut down” as quickly as possible. Olsen disagrees with the Swedish Public Health Authority’s predictions that the population will quickly build up immunity, arguing this could take more than a year and is sceptical that the infection rate will level off during warmer summer months. Akinmade Åkerström has also been critical of the current approach “considering the rise of infection cases and deaths around the world”. But she argues that strong support for authorities will help, should the country follow others into lockdown. “Most Swedes trust that the government has the best interest of society at heart and they will respond to stricter rules,” she says. A connected population History will be the judge of whether Sweden’s scientific and political policies hold up. But when it comes to day-to-day efforts to keep businesses and society functioning, Swedes’ working practices and passion for technology are two norms that are already playing out well during the corona crisis. The Nordic nation has one of the most advanced digital economies in the EU and a strong background of innovation. More than two thirds of Swedes already work online from home at least some of the time, with around a third doing this on a daily or weekly basis, according to The Swedish Internet Foundation. Fast and widespread broadband works in tandem with social and company policies which champion flexible and remote working as part of a more balanced and gender-equal lifestyle. Nobody bats an eyelid if a parent clocks off in the early afternoon to collect a child from nursery; they’re trusted to catch up with their workload later. This, according to Staffan Ingvarsson, CEO of Stockholm Business Region, has enabled a smooth transition to increased remote working. “Every company that has the possibility to do this, they are doing it, and it works,” he says. Although keen to stress that coronavirus is still “dealing a really hard blow” to the economy, with bigger levels of layoffs than during the financial crisis, he also points to high levels of cross-industry collaboration that are helping Sweden to face new challenges brought by the crisis.   After thousands of staff from Scandinavian airline SAS were laid off, they were offered additional nursing training so they could support hospitals, thanks to funding from a private research foundation. Workers from truck-maker Scania are supporting a medical company to produce more respirators, and supermarkets have been actively targeting hotel and conference venue staff who’ve lost their jobs.   “It really warms my heart, all this innovation that is going on digitally,” says Ingvarsson, adding that he’s proud of how the Stockholm business community has been able to make so many big decisions together in the absence of physical meetings.   “Sweden is built on a history of collaboration and that shines through in times like this,” agrees Erik Engellau-Nilsson, CEO of Norrsken, a co-working space and investment fund that supports socially-minded entrepreneurs. The foundation recently set up an online platform where start-ups focused on solving problems connected to the coronavirus crisis can apply for funding. Engellau-Nilsson says he’s been “overwhelmed by the response and support from volunteers, initiatives, companies and partners”; initiatives already being profiled by the site include an e-learning company, an app offering free food deliveries for pensioners and a volunteering network.   The future?   What happens next will, of course, depend on how much the virus spreads. The Swedish Public Health Agency has warned that the worst is yet to come for the Nordic nation.   There are long-running concerns about whether hospitals are ready to cope with the potential demand for beds and intensive care equipment, while more recent debates have focused on how well authorities are communicating information. Some experts are calling for more specific instructions about how people should be living their lives. The Swedish Medical Association has expressed concerns that not enough has been done to inform residents who don’t speak Swedish, following a high proportion of deaths and infections in Stockholm’s Somali community, who are more at risk of sharing overcrowded housing.   And while some lone-living Swedes like Cajsa Wiking are confident they can keep their mood up by staying connected to friends and family via Facetime, others are worried about increased levels of loneliness should they end up housebound due to a lockdown.   “This could really affect how Swedes feel,” says Christoffer Carringer, who has recently started living alone for the first time. “Everyone is always screaming for sun and social interaction and attention this time each year after the long winter, so to be denied that, I think could have some sad side effects.” Akinmade Åkerström echoes this sentiment, saying: “For a society that thrives on being outdoors and in nature, that would be the most difficult part for Swedes to mentally deal with if a full lockdown goes into effect.”   Against this background, Sweden’s trust, technology and teamwork may well continue to be valuable assets for the country as things develop, but in times of crisis like this, nothing is certain."
Interest Rate Sentiment,Where young people are getting richer,2024-09-14,2018-07-10,Maddy Savage,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180709-unlike-most-millennials-norways-are-rich,"Young Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income, bucking a downward trend in other strong economies. Will this golden age last? Young people across the western world are on track to become the first generation to grow up poorer than their parents. So how are millennials in just one country bucking this trend? It’s old news that university debts and rocketing housing costs are common concerns for people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, living in the US, the UK and many other countries. Multiple studies suggest this group will be the first in recorded history to end up poorer than those which came before. But perhaps this doesn’t have to be a foregone conclusion. In Europe’s northernmost country, things are decidedly different. Best known for its Viking history, snow sports and jaw-dropping fjords, Norway is making a new name for itself as the only major economy in Europe where young people are getting markedly richer. People in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kroner (around $56,200). Young Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income in real terms compared to Generation X (those born between 1966 and 1980) when they were the same age. These startling figures come from the largest comparative wealth data set in the world, the Luxembourg Income Database, and were analysed in a recent report on generational incomes for the UK Think Tank The Resolution Foundation. Compare this with young people in other strong economies: US millennials have experienced a 5% dip, in Germany it’s a 9% drop. For those living in southern Europe (the southern Eurozone suffered the brunt of the global economic crisis in 2008), disposable incomes have plunged by as much as 30%. Norway’s youth unemployment rate (among 15- to 29-year-olds) is also relatively low at 9.4% compared to an OECD average of 13.9%. ‘A lucky situation’ On a rare scorching day in the Norwegian capital Oslo, it’s not difficult to find young locals who embody the country’s good fortunes. “I don’t really think about how I spend my money,” says Aleksander Aarnes, a 25-year-old graduate. “I go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema once a month. I can go out and eat and drink with friends... I go on vacation (holiday).” Aarnes is pursuing a career writing for musical theatre, but is yet to earn anything for his efforts, so he funds his lifestyle by working just one or two shifts a week in a supermarket in Korsvoll, a sleepy suburb dotted with large detached pastel-coloured wooden houses. He shares an apartment with a friend in another suburb about a 20-minute bus ride from the city centre. “I’m really aware of the lucky situation I am in... I don’t have to sacrifice too much to pursue the career I want,” he says. Aarnes’ hourly pay starts at 164 Norwegian kroner (around $20), increasing for weekend and evening shifts. After taxes (which are comparatively high in Scandinavia) he’s left with around 14,000 kroner ($1700) a month, of which he sets aside half for rent, travel and bills and uses the rest for “whatever else” he likes. Further down the road in Korsvoll, a 31-year-old business analyst called Øystein is packing his BMW with supplies for a barbecue. He doesn’t want to share his full name, arguing that “even though Norway is rich, people don’t really want to talk about how rich they are personally.” But he admits he earnt enough to buy a two-bedroom apartment on the waterfront when he was 27 and regularly goes on holiday to the US and Asia.   What’s Norway doing differently? A huge part of young Norwegians’ fantastic lifestyle is down to the country’s rapid economic growth. After seeing the biggest increase in average earnings of any large high-income economy between 1980 and 2013, it now leads multiple global rankings for wealth and wellbeing. It weathered the global recession well. Last year it came top of the 2017 Legatum Prosperity Index, which analyses 110 countries around the world. Norway’s huge oil and gas sector is the clear driving factor behind the nation’s economic boom over the last three decades, following major discoveries in the North Sea (although falling energy prices in recent years have had an impact). But as Hilde Bjørnland, an economics professor based at BI Norwegian Business school in Oslo explains, it is not just how much money Norway makes that’s significant, but what it does with it. “It has managed the oil [money] well in that it is saving, and using a portion of that to put back into society,” she says. “So rather than a few getting a lot, many people have access to this wealth.” Norway has done this by storing its money in the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. In simple terms, this is a giant savings pot which makes money by investing in more than 9000 companies. It is currently worth around $1 trillion. In spite of this savings pot, taxes are kept high and the country has a compressed wage structure, which means minimum salaries are negotiated by unions. “Young people and people in lower-paid industries have [experienced] the growth rates in their wages each year... and the differences between those who earn a little and those who earn a lot are not so large as in other countries,” says Bjørnland. The Resolution Foundation’s report on generational income concludes that rising inequality has been a core factor in driving down disposable incomes for millennials in other strong economies such as the US, UK and Germany. In these countries, where there are wider wage bands, young people bear the brunt of a lack of pay growth and job mobility. By contrast, Bjørnland argues that an egalitarian approach – distributing wealth between generations – has contributed to strong life satisfaction and a lack of social unrest in Norway. High welfare payments and heavily subsidised health care also help when it comes to pitting Norwegian millennials' prospects against those elsewhere in Europe. Unemployment benefits are generous: allowing many people to claim around 60% of their previous salary for two years, while they are looking for new work. As in all the Nordic countries, low childcare costs and a general parental leave system also ensure a high participation of women in the workforce. Free education at most schools and public universities and easy access to loans (which borrowers don’t pay interest on while they are studying) alongside high employment rates for students are also part of the jigsaw. “It’s a significant factor that while young people are studying, they’re able to have a job on the side,” says Bjørnland, who adds that this kind of casual work can often bring in a higher income for young people in Norway than those in other western countries. Her sentiment is shared by many of the throngs of students cooling off in the Åkerselva river just a few metres from the shiny glass buildings that dominate the business school’s campus. “It’s not that difficult to find a job here and they’re always really well-paid. So it helps a lot, to cover your leisure life and your studies,” says Gabriella Sanzana, a 27-year-old from Chile, who’s doing a master’s in human rights while working part-time as a waitress. “I have to pay a lot of taxes, but I don’t really care, because I know that [the state] gives you so many things at the same time.” A secure future? Despite Norway’s glowing CV, there are concerns about sustaining its success. High youth employment is declining, according to Investing in Youth: Norway, a recent OECD report, which states that the number of job opportunities for 15 to 29-year-olds doesn’t match up with the amount needed for a swelling youth population, which rose by 18% between 2007 and 2016. Immigration accounted for over four-fifths of this increase and unemployment among Norway’s foreign-born population is currently around 10%. Kristian Heggebø, a senior researcher at the Centre for Labour and Welfare Research at Oslo Metropolitan University, argues that while well-educated international students and labour migrants from elsewhere in Europe “tend to do well on the jobs market,” there are persistently high levels of “labour market discrimination against ethnic minorities.” “To some extent it could be [because of] a lack of qualifications, but there is no doubt in my mind that the issue is on the demand side and not the supply side,” he says. Heggebø argues that there is “firm empirical evidence” which demonstrates that despite rising immigration over the past two decades, many Norwegian employers are still “sceptical towards hiring someone with a non-Norwegian background.” Even second generation immigrants born and educated in a Nordic country can end up struggling to gain access to the labour market, he says, suggesting that anonymous CVs in the first stages of recruitment could be a crucial part of the solution. Fragmented society Preparing to catch the train home after a day in the sweltering city centre, Ove George, who’s from Nigeria and is currently unemployed, says he believes networking is often the key to getting work in Norway, something that can be tricky for foreigners without Norwegian connections. “The last job I got was through a Norwegian friend I had, and after that I haven’t really got a good job,” he explains. Also at the station is 19-year-old Djibouti-born Kayad Mahammed, who currently works for a media company. He says he’s “not struggling” and personally found it “easy” to get a job. But he adds that he believes “it’s hard to get rich” for many immigrants, who can wind up clinging onto entry-level jobs for fear of ending up unemployed again. Meanwhile, despite the Scandinavian country’s pride over its egalitarianism, there are signs inequality is rising within the wider population, too. OECD figures suggest that the share of Norwegians earning less than half the national average income was 8.1% in 2015, up from 6.9% in 2004, with young people more at risk than any other group. (Although, put this into context, this is still low by global standards – the proportion in the US is 16.8% and 10.9% in the UK.) Those who end up outside of employment, training or education altogether can often feel more vulnerable in Norway than they might in other countries, argues Sebastian Königs, one of the authors of the OECD’s Investing in Youth: Norway report. “For the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder,” he says. “Because generally speaking everyone is doing so well in society, this becomes a stigma.” This cohort is six times more likely to feel depressed than other young Norwegians, nine times as likely to suffer from poor health and more at risk of remaining outside the labour market for the long term, according to OECD figures. The price of success According to Bjørnland, even the wealthiest Norwegians should be wary of its fragility moving forward. “You’re used to having a good time, you’re used to taking long weekends... if you’ve had it like this for a long time you take it for granted,” she says. “But things which have happened in the past might not happen again.” She argues that Norway needs to work harder to diversify its industries in order to remain competitive in future. This might include expanding its technology, raw material and renewable energy sectors, all alongside an emerging start-up scene. It has grown quickly in recent years but still lags behind its Nordic neighbours. Employers will also have to be more open to attracting international talent to fill the jobs created outside its oil and gas sector, she suggests. On the other hand, young Norwegians “used to being able to work wherever they like” may need to become increasingly “focused on where the skills are needed” in order to maintain the same standard of living as millennials entering the workforce today. Solutions? Despite Norway’s current challenges, many experts believe that there is still a huge amount that other nations can learn. At the OECD, Sebastian Königs cites much closer links between education, employment and social services than in most other countries as an effective way of supporting young people in the early stages of their careers. Every Norwegian school leaver gets a personal follow-up phone call to discuss their options if they don’t enter the employment market or pursue further studies, for example. He argues that while Norway’s population is just 5.1 million, larger nations could still replicate these policies if they wanted to. “This isn’t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources you’re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be.” Meanwhile, Kristian Heggebø says he believes that even if oil is taken “totally out of the equation” and Norway is forced to reshape its economy in the future, it will continue to prosper as a result of its egalitarian approach and safety net for young people. “If we keep these components in place then I’m willing to bet everything that I own that we will still be performing at a very, very high level compared to other European countries, simply because we have a way [to deal with] difficulties that is more humane.”"
Interest Rate Sentiment,Why every expat needs an exit plan,2024-09-14,2016-08-11,Mark Johanson,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160810-why-every-expat-needs-an-exit-plan,"Your overseas assignment was fantastic until the failed coup and the food shortages kicked in. How do you know when it's time to go versus sticking with it? In mid-July, American Terry Henson Kaymak found herself stuck in the middle of a failed coup when a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces attempted to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The attempted coup “happened right over my head”, says the 51-year-old lawyer, who has lived and worked in the Turkish capital of Ankara for more than six years in a building that’s close to the army headquarters and even closer to parliament. On 20 July, Turkey declared a three-month state of emergency and Kaymak says she’s on high alert and no longer speaks English on the streets because she feels “anti-American sentiment is growing”. “I’m not a person who scares easily, but I’m barely going out of my house right now,” she says. The latest unrest was the culmination of a rough year for Kaymak, who lives within earshot of the bombs that went off this February and March during separate terrorist attacks that killed a combined 67 people. The Philadelphia native plans to move back to the US in September. Some foreigners are now going through a process of reassessing their lives in Turkey thanks to a string of terrorist attacks over the past year and increasing political instability. The economic outlook, once rosy, is also souring amid the turmoil. Economists cut their growth forecasts for Turkey in 2016 and the lira slumped to a near-record low on July 20 of 3.07 against the US dollar. This instability is leading many expats to leave. Expats in Turkey aren’t alone. A growing number of foreign workers in places like China and the United Arab Emirates have returned home in recent months due to sluggish economic growth, but for expats in places like Turkey, Brazil or Venezuela, political instability adds yet another layer of insecurity. In Brazil, there was a 62% decrease in foreign worker permits granted in the first trimester of 2016, compared with the same period in 2014, due to a lack of foreign interest and fewer available jobs. Many find themselves asking whether it’s time to move out of the country or if they should stick it out through the troubles. Knowing the difference isn’t easy and is complicated by family ties, jobs, school terms and more. So, how does an expat decide the time has come to pack their bags? ‘No foreseeable solution’ No clear way forward is one “go” red flag. For instance, foreign workers in Venezuela might want to prepare an exit plan, according to Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America programme at the non-partisan Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “The Venezuelan economy has not hit rock bottom and will continue to deteriorate, and that has a great potential for sparking ongoing violence, food riots and the kind of things that are already taking place,” Arnson explains. “There is no foreseeable solution on the horizon and the economy has really sharply deteriorated.” The International Monetary Fund estimates that the economy will shrink by 10% this year after contracting 6.2% in 2015, making Venezuela the world’s worst performing economy. Venezuela relies on oil revenue for most of its financial health, but government-controlled oil production is way down, while per barrel oil prices are near record lows after years of high process. In turn, supplies (including medicine) are scarce, and the army has taken charge of food distribution in some places. Now, most foreign and native oil executives have relocated over the last decade to Colombia, Houston in the US or Calgary in Canada, according to Antonio Sanchez of global headhunting firm Boyden. Their absence has exacerbated industry productivity problems, while low oil prices strain the economy overall. Why expats stay in hard places Caracas ranked as the world’s most dangerous city in 2015 with 120 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, according to Mexican NGO, Citizen's Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice (CCSPJP). CCSPJP put the nationwide murder rate at 80 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, though the government has refuted those figures. Even so, John Kvarnback, a Swedish biologist who lives in the affluent Los Palos Grandes neighbourhood, says he doesn’t feel that Caracas is that much more unsafe than when he moved to the city in 2001. There are more roadblocks around the city and the 43-year-old doesn’t leave the house with his iPhone or a full wallet, for fear of having them stolen. “I haven’t had any guns pointed to my head like I did [here] many years ago,” he says. Because Kvarnback earns his income in foreign currency he can afford to purchase goods at higher prices than Venezuelans earning a living in bolívars. Consequently, he’s less affected by the food shortages and other daily hardships. Still, his primary work as a nature guide has all but dried up amid a lack of tourists, and he estimates that about 80% of his friends have left the country over the past two years. In the end, however, Kvarnback might follow the lead of his ex-wife and son and move to Brazil where there is similar fauna and more tourism. He knows Brazil’s economy is suffering at the moment, and that many foreign workers are trying to leave, but for him, it could actually be a move up the wobbly scale of economic uncertainty.

Interest Rate Sentiment,US inflation picks up more than expected,2024-09-14,2024-01-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67940747,"Consumer prices in the US rose again in December, driven by higher costs for housing, dining out and car insurance. Inflation - which measures the rate at which prices are increasing - hit 3.4% over the year, the Labor Department said. It was up from 3.1% in November, accelerating more over the month than many analysts had expected.  The figure is likely to keep the US central bank cautious about declaring victory in its fight against inflation. The US Federal Reserve has an inflation target of 2% and, until last summer, had been raising interest rates to cool price rises. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the latest inflation figures are ""not bad numbers, but they do show that disinflation progress is still slow and unlikely to be a straight line down"". Inflation in the world's largest economy has dropped sharply since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, when the war in Ukraine sent energy costs soaring.  Despite the uptick in December, many analysts said they expected inflation to improve in the coming months. ""This is another [Consumer Price Index] report that shows inflation has moderated and will likely continue to decelerate,"" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.  But while price increases for goods have cooled, as supply bottlenecks from the pandemic clear, the report suggests that progress in other areas is proving more difficult, said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. Prices for car insurance were up 20% compared with December 2022 while rents climbed 6.5%, according to the US Labor Department. It said that grocery prices gained a modest 1.3%, which compares to a 5.2% rise in prices for people choosing to dine out. The cost of some food to eat at home soared, with steak up 11% over the year.  Mr Coulton said the report suggested that hopes that the Federal Reserve will move quickly to begin cutting interest rates could prove premature.  ""This will give the Fed grounds for caution and they are unlikely to cut rates as quickly as the markets currently expect,"" Mr Coulton said.   For now, the improvement in the situation has largely failed to persuade the American public, which continues to report glum economic sentiment.  Last year, high petrol prices prompted 28-year-old Harish Kunchala to halt his regular car journeys to see his brother. Mr Kunchala, who is pursuing a graduate degree in computer science in California, said he has since resumed visits to his sibling but still felt budgetary stress in other areas. , He and his roommates keep lists in their apartment trying to keep track of where to find the best prices for meat and other items.  ""If it's not one thing, it's the other,"" he said."
Interest Rate Sentiment,US economy sees surprisingly strong growth,2024-09-14,2024-01-25,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68096633,"The US economy grew faster than expected in the final months of last year, driven by robust household and government spending.  The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% over the three months to December, the Commerce Department said.  That was down from 4.9% in the prior quarter, but much faster than the 2% many analysts had expected. For 2023, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, up from 1.9% in 2022. The figures cap a year that has been characterised by unexpected economic resilience, even as the US central bank raised borrowing costs sharply and inflation cooled.  ""Whichever way you slice it, this report caps a year of stellar economic growth performance,"" said Olu Sonola, head of US regional economics at Fitch Ratings. ""The momentum of economic growth going into 2024 is looking very good.""  The figures are a boon for US President Joe Biden, who has struggled to convince the public that the economy remains healthy, as it downshifts from the boom after the pandemic shock. In a speech in Wisconsin on Thursday, he argued that White House policies, including investments in green energy, roads and other infrastructure, have contributed to the resilience.  ""Experts, from the time I got elected, were insisting that the recession was just around the corner,"" he said. ""Well, we've got really strong growth.... We obviously have more work to do but we're making real progress."" Mr Biden said he believed the message was starting to get through. In recent months, surveys have shown consumer sentiment improving. The stock market is up, petrol prices are down and unemployment remains low.  While the jump in prices since 2019 remains a sticking point for voters, the inflation rate has also eased, falling to 3.4% in December, after soaring to more than 9% in 2022.  California resident Ha Le said she was conscious of no longer being on a constant lookout for the lowest cost petrol.  But the 44-year-old, a corporate worker in the retail industry and a Democrat, said it was still difficult to accept the big jump in grocery and child care prices of the last few years.  ""My general thoughts on the economy are that it's not the worst, right? We've recovered somewhat from the pandemic terror, but it's not great,"" she said. Many economists had expected households to cut back spending as prices eroded their budgets and for business activity to cool in the face of more expensive borrowing costs, warning of the risks of a downturn, or recession.  But that scenario has not materialised, as high savings left over from the pandemic, an uptick in wage growth, and other government spending provided a cushion. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, the US economy grew 3.1%. On Wall Street, the improving picture has led to speculation that the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates sharply to fight inflation, might start to reverse course. But analysts said the strength of the economy portrayed in the report on gross domestic product (GDP) will relieve pressure on the bank to act quickly. ""Those hunting for clues that the Federal Reserve is ready to take an axe to interest rates will be sorely disappointed,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown."
Interest Rate Sentiment,House price rises highest for a year in January,2024-09-14,2024-02-07,By Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68225189,"House price rises in January were the highest for a year as mortgage rates continued to ease, the Halifax has said. A slowdown in inflation and a buoyant jobs market also helped push property prices up, it added. The UK's biggest mortgage lender said a typical home now costs £291,029 on average, a 2.5% jump from January 2023. The figures come as major housebuilder Barratt announced it would buy rival Redrow in a deal worth £2.5bn. Housebuilders have struggled over the past couple of years as higher interest rates dented demand and construction costs rose. But expectations of rates being cut this year, with inflation - the pace of price rises - slowing down, has led to ""increased confidence"" in the housing market, Halifax said. However, it warned that while house prices had risen, interest rates still remained high compared with the historic lows seen in recent years, making it more expensive for prospective buyers to borrow. The lender said first-time buyers faced average deposits of £53,414. ""It's not surprising that almost two thirds of new buyers getting a foot on the ladder are now buying in joint names,"" said Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages. Ms Kinnaird said ""affordability challenges are likely to remain"" in the coming months and said further falls in house prices ""should not be ruled out, against a backdrop of broader uncertainty in the economic environment"". Halifax's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. First-time buyers and homeowners looking to remortgage properties have faced higher borrowing costs in recent times. The Bank of England has held interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25% since August 2023, in a bid to try to slow down the rapid pace of general price rises. Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, said with inflation expected to slow down in the coming months, the Bank could cut interest rate as soon as the summer. ""The improving outlook has resulted in better mortgage rates and affordability levels for first-time buyers and those looking to refinance,"" she said. A typical two-year fixed mortgage rate would charge 5.57% interest on Tuesday, while a five year deal would charge 5.22%, according to data from Moneyfacts. This is down from a peak of 6.86% for a two-year deal in July last year, it said. David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt said despite the ""challenging"" economic environment, demand for the company's homes was ""strong"". His comments came after Britain's biggest homebuilder Barratt announced it would buy Redrow, which is headquartered in Flintshire, Wales,  in an all stock deal. The new combination, to be renamed ""Barratt Redrow"", will aim to build more than 22,000 homes each year in the medium term. ""Since the start of January, we have seen early signs of improvement in both reservation rates and buyer sentiment, helped by expectations of lower interest rates and the introduction of more competitive mortgage rates,"" Mr Thomas added. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the decision behind the merger was due to both companies believing they would be ""stronger together"", adding that they would have ""much bigger clout"" to take advantage on the need for more housing in the UK.

Interest Rate Sentiment,50 ‘grand challenges’ for the world,2024-09-14,2017-04-01,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170331-50-grand-challenges-for-the-21st-century,"We asked experts from the world of science and technology to describe the societal challenges that they think matter in 2017 and beyond. Read the full list of responses below. Over the past month, Future Now has been covering the “grand challenges” we face as a society in a series of articles, videos and graphics. We polled a panel of people from various fields about the vital issues they believe deserve more attention – you can browse 50 of those responses below, which we’ll continue to draw on throughout this year. There’s a lot to digest in one sitting – so dip in, reflect, come back... You can also catch up on the stories inspired by these responses that we’ve published to date here: The Grand Challenges. * * * danah boyd, Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Data-driven technologies are increasingly being integrated into many different parts of society, from judicial decision-making processes to automated vehicles to the dissemination of news. Each of these implementations raises serious questions about what values are being implemented and to whom these implementations are accountable. There is increasing desire by regulators, civil society, and social theorists to see these technologies be “fair” and “ethical,” but these concepts are fuzzy at best. Meanwhile, there are significant trade-offs and local decisions that technical actors face on a day-to-day basis that shape the very structure of these systems. Developing responsible sociotechnical systems will require bridging the social-technical gap that can easily emerge as social actors and technical actors speak past one another. Missy Cummings, Professor, Humans and Autonomy Lab, Duke University I think one of the most important challenges faced by robotic systems of the future, which include driverless cars, drones, surgical and manufacturing robots, is how will we be able to certify these systems as safe, particularly those that embed artificial intelligence? By their very nature, artificial intelligence algorithms reason probabilistically and as uncertainty increases in the world, uncertainty increases in an algorithm’s ability to successfully and safely come to a solution. Presently we have no commonly-accepted approaches and without an industry standard for testing such stochastic systems, it is difficult for these technologies to be widely implemented. Kate Darling, Research Specialist at MIT Media Lab. Fellow at the Harvard Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society Companies are going to follow their market incentives. That’s not a bad thing, but we can’t rely on them just to be ethical for the sake of it, for the most part. It helps to have regulation in place. We’ve seen this in privacy, or whenever we have a new technology, and we figure out how to deal with it. Ezekiel Emanuel, Vice Provost for Global Initiatives and chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania I think one of the big issues is going to be unemployment: automation, artificial intelligence, virtual reality. It seems pretty inevitable it’s going to create displacement of workers, ie unemployment. If you look at what gives people meaning in their lives, it’s three things: meaningful relationships, passionate interests, and meaningful work. Meaningful work is a very important element of someone’s identity. Viktor Mayer Schonberger, Professor of Internet Governance and Regulation, Oxford Internet Institute My #1 issue is not the future of democracy (or related issues such as fake news, Trump, social networking bubbles, or even cybersecurity), but the future of humanity. As we are developing more and more ways to let computers take over reasoning through adaptive learning, we are faced with an existential question: what is it – long term – that makes us human? It used to be doing calculus, playing Chess (or Go), flying airplanes, driving cars, having a conversation, playing Jeopardy, or cooking (to name a few). What if data-driven, learning algorithms can do all that? What’s the essence of being human – is it radical creativity, irrational originality, craziness and illogicality? And if so, are we then shaping our learning institutions to help humans develop and nurture exactly these skills (our competitive advantages). In short, for me 2017 marks the year, when intra-human problems slowly begin to pale when compared to this more fundamental and existential one. Peter Norvig, Director of Research, Google Artificial intelligence has proven to be quite effective at practical tasks – from labeling photos, to understanding speech and written natural language, to helping identify diseases. The challenge now is to make sure everyone benefits from this technology. It's important that machine learning be researched openly, and spread via open publications and open source code, so we can all share in the rewards. Richard Alan Peters, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, Vanderbilt University In my opinion, the most important breakthrough in robotics and AI to come is the learning of concepts by learning sensory-motor coordination. An intelligent agent (animal or robot) that can manipulate the physical world while sensing the results of said manipulation forms one half of a complex dynamical system. The other half is the world. Complex dynamical systems form patterns in nature. In the case of an animal (including humans) that pattern occurs in the brain and spinal cord system. It relates sensing to action and vice-versa. In a robot, I like to call this “natural intelligence” to distinguish it from artificial intelligence which is usually acquired by a disembodied computer. Among other things this approach solves the symbol grounding problem (how an agent’s internal symbols relate to the physical world. This has been puzzled over since Aristotle.) And it solves the “frame problem” by providing a physical context for deliberative thought. AI, although very useful, will never approach human intelligence until it is embodied. That is, of course, a hypothesis, a conjecture that has yet to be proven. But I believe we are close. These ideas were first set down by Rodney Brooks at MIT in the 1980’s. Brooks hypothesis is Intelligence is an emergent phenomenon that is the result of embodiment, situatedness, development and interaction. Bruce Schneier, international security technologist The Internet of Things is giving computers the ability to affect the world in a direct physical manner. As this happens to more and more things, the particular ways in which computers fail will become the way everything fails. This means more catastrophic failures, as bugs and vulnerabilities affect every instance of a piece of software. This will completely change how we think about the risks of computerised cars, computerised appliances, computerised everything. Tomotaka Takahashi, founder of Kyoto University’s Robo Garage In 2017, cloud funding and hardware start ups are going to collapse. Because of the fake demo videos, people’s expectations to technology is getting too high, and no product can satisfy them. Only a few strong companies and products, such as Amazon Echo, can survive. I believe people are going to demand Echo with more humanity and portability, and social robots like RoBoHoN will find its market in five years. Jonathan Zittrain, Professor of International Law at Harvard Law School and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Director of the Harvard Law School Library, and Faculty Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society I'm concerned about the reduction of human autonomy as our systems -- aided by technology -- become more complex and tightly coupled. Artificial intelligence is making some real progress right now, and our work is less to worry about a science fiction robot takeover, and more to see how technology can be used to help with human reflection and decisionmaking rather than to entirely substitute for it. If we ""set it and forget it,"" we may rue how a system evolves, and that there is no clear place for an ethical dimension to be considered. Mary Barra, CEO, General Motors The auto industry stands at an inflection point where rapidly advancing technology and evolving customer needs offer a unique opportunity to transform our relationship with customers, communities and the environment. Thanks to connectivity, electrification, autonomous vehicles and car- and ridesharing, the way customers interact with our vehicles is going to change in a way that hasn't happened since the industry was born more than 100 years ago. Some view this as a disruption – we believe it represents a tremendous opportunity to make people’s lives safer, simpler and better. Realising these changes demands the ability to recruit from a talented pool of diverse candidates with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) expertise. Today, there is more demand for some STEM areas than there is available new talent and the demand continues to grow. It’s one of the reasons we are committed to doing all we can to encourage young people to pursue careers in STEM, particularly in Technology and Engineering. Nootan Bharani, Lead Design Manager, Place Lab – ‎Place Lab, University of Chicago A pivot from just climate change to segregation. Specifically, the widening gap between wealthy and impoverished people, worldwide. Climate change is a causal factor in the increased(ing) disparity. So too are racism and classism. Climate change exacerbates the challenges thrust upon impoverished people. The use and habitation of spaces demonstrates this clearly – the quantity, quality, and increasingly, the ability of one’s space to protect from harsher and unexpected elements. Solutions should be structural as well as grass roots. Sound policy as well as micro-local community-based. Intentional systems got us into this pickle, and intentional systems will need to be part of the process to reach toward common vision and goals. Scratching the surface are programmes offered by governments and utilities, to assist homeowners to weatherise their structures. Impoverished communities still lack the resource/capacity to capture full use of technologies – methods are already known and commonplace in sustainable new construction. The most robust and innovative energy efficiency programs are yet to benefit those that would feel the greatest impact from the captured savings. Culture is intersectional, is an arbiter. Culture is part of the solution to finding common ground between wealthy and impoverished (and all in-between). Vernacular architectures are expressions of the people and culture in a particular locale, in particular climates. My “dream” of seeing more vernacular architecture overlapped with contemporary design is a desire to see cultural identities expressed as much as it is a desire to see climate adaptive solutions for space. Larry Burns, former corporate vice president of Research and Development for General Motors According to the World Health Organisation, over 1.2 million people a year die from crashes on the world’s roadways. This is epidemic in scale. Traffic safety experts predict that over 90% of roadway fatalities can be eliminated when driverless vehicle technology reaches its full potential. Regulators, police organisations and liability experts responsibly caution that we cannot let driverless technology get in front of safety. However, like with all epidemics, we also have a responsibility to realise the full potential of cures as soon as possible. While we must be prudent, we also must not let those with vested interests in human driven cars slow progress. We must work together to safely accelerate the realisation of driverless vehicles. Reaching this imperative one-day sooner could save over 3,000 lives! Vishaan Chakrabarti, Associate Professor of Practice at Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation The major new challenge for the fields of architecture and urbanism will be to build what I call the ""Public Metropolis,"" which means cities that are more ecologically sound, more equitable, more humane in their deployment of technology, more intense in their creation of new infrastructure, and more fervent in their roles as beacons for a free, diverse and open global society in a time when nativism and fascism are on the rise. The debate of whether to build dense, transit-based cities as the most environmentally sound growth model in a world in which billions are reaching the middle class is largely settled: the question that remains is not whether to build better cities, but how. Great civic architecture for both public and private projects will be pivotal to this question by enabling the creation of new cultural buildings, commercial projects, and infrastructures that read and write with the specifics of a place, so that we maintain local identities in a global world. Lucy Jones, Science Advisor for Risk Reduction for the United States Geological Survey We do a great job as a society of funding and supporting innovative research – we really admire that aspect of it. What we do a very bad job at is making the interface between that esoteric research and how people can actually use the information. People want predictions (for earthquakes). But people have to understand the scientific process. That’s problem number one: The communication phase. People on the outside turn to us (researchers) for answers, and we are so caught up in the scientific process that we know no answer that we’re talking about is final. There’s this gap that we’re not helping people understand, and it’s actively discouraged – if you have a young scientist who’s brilliant on TV explaining earthquakes, they may say no, I’m not going to do this because it’s going to hurt my career. Rochelle Kopp, founder and Managing Principal of Japan Intercultural Counseling I would say that one of the biggest challenges for the 21st Century as relates to Japan and Asia, and indeed the rest of the world, is related to questions of immigration (which includes refugee issues). These have of course received a lot of attention in the media, but the discussions are often stuck at a basic level, and governmental policies and programs are often not sufficiently addressing the issues. Specifically as for Asia: Japan, as well as Korea and China, are rapidly ageing and thus there will be increasing demand for labor in those countries, whereas many surrounding countries have surplus amounts of labour. Already we see Japan is very dependent on foreign labor in sectors like agriculture and construction, although not through formal immigration but rather through exploitative “trainee” programs. Part of the debate around immigration and acceptance of refugees, both in Japan and other countries, relates to how to integrate people from another culture into a society. This is my field, of cross-cultural communication and understanding. There is a lot of room for further application of the lessons of the cross-cultural field in areas outside of business (where they are most often being utilised today), to help countries address issues related to immigrants and refugees. Chris Leinberger, Nonresident Senior Fellow – Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings Institute The real political and societal changes I’m seeing are taking place at the micro-local level: the biggest sociopolitical movement has been the organisation at the “place” level of the neighbourhood level, at least in this country. It’s under the radar screen – we are fundamentally inserting a new level of governance in society, and it’s taking the form of neighbourhood associations at the super local level, taking the form of improvement districts, special assessment districts, like in Midtown Manhattan. All of these places are becoming organised. Every neighbourhood in this country has a neighbourhood organisation – 30 years ago this didn’t exist. Today, virtually every neighbourhood is organised. Business improvement districts in particular are making leaps and bounds in the management of our society and they are recognising and working with technology firms to far better understand how these places work. The next big technological jump is a software jump: we now have the hardware. The issue is coming up with software that will create the mega database that will understand every part of the built environment at the place level, and eventually, the metropolitan level. Right now, nobody knows what’s in Midtown [Manhattan]. We don’t know what percentage of that is office; what percentage of that is retail. We didn’t have those data sets 15 years ago, and we didn’t have the software, and we certainly didn’t have the computing capability. So when a city or when a business improvement district makes a major capital investment in the future, you could foresee the time that we’ll be able to say, ‘okay, let’s build the Second Avenue subway. It’ll cost us $5bn and this is the expected economic and tax revenues we will get from that based on this data set, and we will then decide what to do – and we will look at secondary consequences like gentrification and see how we’re going to address that based upon those future projects we make.’ We will learn much better how to plan, build, and pay for these places; invest in the right thing. Right now conclusions are based on guestimations, like ridership. We’re getting closer to saying this is going to be the economic and fiscal benefit of doing that, and here are the unintended consequences we need to be concerned about: congestion, gentrification, displacement, whatever. All those tools will help place managements. This is a new field of place management. Edward Paice, Director, Africa Research Institute In Africa, very rapid urban growth – spatial and demographic – is occurring without adequate planning (or, in many locations, any planning at all). Even where master plans have been drawn up, these tend to be either ‘fantasy designs’ drawing on wholly inappropriate models such as Dubai or Singapore; or they mimic equally inappropriate plans drawn up for cities in Europe or the US. Urbanisation in Africa is occurring in its own distinctive fashion and there are significant variations within and between countries. But one common feature is that the economies of nearly all towns and cities are predominantly informal. The creation of long-term, decent jobs by the state and private enterprise is woefully inadequate; industrialisation remains for the most part absent. For African urbanisation to become a positive economic and social development, as opposed to a ticking time-bomb, urban planning needs to incorporate total populations, not simply the rich and middle classes; this is the only way that the economic potential of the majority can be harnessed for the national good. How can this be done? Firstly, citizens have to be involved. Community participation in slum redevelopment initiatives has proven to be a far more productive and cheaper way of going about things than imposing ill-conceived, expensive schemes from above. Secondly, the technology exists to facilitate the rapid planning required – for example, data collection with mobile phones and satellite imagery have already been beneficial. Thirdly, urban-dwellers everywhere – voters – can mobilise even more effectively to ensure that their elected representatives deliver more. We are seeing this occurring in more and more towns and cities and it is a very positive development for cities, for infrastructure development and for democracy. Even in autocracies there is always room for citizens to organise and thereby secure services or rights that they have been denied. The final, essential, component is political will. This has been conspicuously lacking, but more determined and competent mayors and city leaders are emerging and the power of example is considerable. The majority of Africans will live in towns and cities by 2050. Management consultancies and international financiers routinely claim that rapid urbanisation is one of the great pluses in the investment case for Africa. As things stand, this is hyperbolic nonsense. For towns and cities to drive economic growth and livelihood improvement, more imaginative and effective urban planning and management are imperative; and the provision of public goods must replace a narrow focus on the wellbeing of elites. Nick Reed, Academy Director at the Transport Research Laboratory Safety of travel – by that I mean not just the 1.3m that die on the roads each year (clearly unacceptable) but also the broader implications (effects on mental health and respiratory illness through poor air quality; need to move sustainable travel – walking and cycling to tackle obesity, diabetes etc) Automation – as we move towards automated, electric vehicles, need to consider the effect on employment and wider implications of how we access mobility. Travelling on busy roads at peak hours could become the preserve of those who can afford to pay – how does that affect commuting etc; how will this change urban planning etc. AI – automated vehicles are one application of AI but what are the wider implications for employment (need for universal basic income?), privacy and security Shin-pei Tsay, ‎Executive Director, Gehl Institute Within urban areas, a significant constraint today and into the future will be how people move around the city. Many extoll the potential of technology to overcome that problem. Whatever technology may accomplish, we will still need to think about how space is used: automated and ride-sharing vehicles take up as much room as regular cars, whether they're on the road or parked off the street. Going into the future, urban space still needs to be designed to maximize places for people to congregate, which are key to building social connections, fostering a sense of belonging, and encouraging community efficacy. Space for human connection is often not considered at all against technological solutions in cities. Without the design of places to support a social dimension, cities will not thrive regardless of how much technology we attempt to integrate, design for, and adopt. Public health outcomes increase when isolation diminishes and people connect. We save billions in environmental costs if we plan for places that encourage people to spend time outside. We even reduce economic limitations in labor markets when we plan for places that allow people to shorten their commute distances and have access to stores, schools, and other daily services. It's always fun to consider panaceas that can theoretically solve age-old problems (in this case, growing populations with increasing travel needs). However, not nearly enough attention is given to the social impacts of these new solutions. We must carefully consider how they may change the physical shape and design of our cities in the future. Most importantly, we must be aware of how they might isolate us. After all, by limiting our ability to socialize, technology may only generate new problems to replace the ones it ""solved."" Nicholas Agar, professor of ethics at the Victoria University of Wellington Recent advances in gene editing suggest a future in which we can radically upgrade human genomes. We might use tools including CRISPR to rewrite genes that influence traits such as intelligence and lifespan. We should bear in mind when we contemplate this enhanced future that the obvious answers aren’t always the right ones. The human genome isn’t something we should seek to build a wall around, protecting it from all change. But a rush to enhance ourselves may erase aspects of our humanity that proper reflection reveals as valuable. More IQ points aren’t better than fewer in the straightforward way that more money is better than less. We risk oversimplifying what’s involved in enhancement. Proper reflection on what about us we might want to preserve takes time – it should draw on a wide range of perspectives about what it means to be human. It’s difficult to set aside this time for ethical reflection when new technological possibilities seem to be coming thick and fast. Luke Alphey, visiting professor, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford Agricultural pest insects, and mosquitoes transmitting diseases, are long-standing problems for which we still have no satisfactory solution, indeed the problems are becoming more pressing. Modern genetics can potentially provide powerful new means for controlling these ancient enemies with greater effectiveness and precision – for example minimal off-target effects on the environment – than currently-used methods. Gene drives are just one aspect of this, but perhaps encapsulate some of the issues. One gene drive system, involving inserting into mosquito cells a large amount of foreign (to the mosquito) DNA in the form of an intracellular bacterium (Wolbachia), has entered field trials in several countries. This specific system has avoided the “genetic” or “GMO” label and regulatory system by adroit marketing and some technicalities and perhaps illustrates what could be done if the field were not caught up in the baggage and polarised politics of the GM crops “debate”. Potential applications of genetic methods in public health and conservation biology, for example, have very little in common with GM crops; lumping them together risks poor debate, poor policy and – in my view – potential delay or loss of huge human and environmental benefits. Elizabeth Bradley, Professor of Grand Strategy, Head of Branford College, Professor of Public Health and Faculty Director of the Yale Global Health Leadership Institute The tremendous impact that social, environmental and behavior factors have on our health overall. Recent research has shown that a country’s ratio of health to social service spending is predictive of some key health outcomes, like life expectancy, infant mortality, and maternal mortality. Genetics and health care play a role, but social, environmental, and behavioral factors have far greater impact on the whole health of a population. Some examples of social service investments include job training, supportive housing, and nutritional support – all of which have traditionally had an underestimated focus of attention. Health and social services should be better integrated toward the achievement of common metrics, like lower rates of smoking, obesity, and depression. More research is needed, to measure the health care cost savings of early childhood education or income support programs, and to identify the most sustainable integrated models. Meaningful change in our world’s health may come less from investing in medical care than in addressing the social determinants of health. Chelsea Clinton, Vice Chair, Clinton Foundation Read Clinton’s extended response about the US opioid epidemic. Jennifer Doudna, Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology and Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, co-inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 technology As ​a​ co-inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology, I am delighted to see that this groundbreaking ability to “cut and paste” genes so efficiently is being harnessed ​as ​a strategy to create new food, therapeutics, materials and ​methods for controlling the spread of diease​.​ A challenge moving forward is how to best engage the public with this fundamental science that really can positively impact human life and the world we live in. I believe that we must continue to discuss and consider the profound societal and ethical impact​s​ of CRISPR​ technology​ and ensure that ​it is not abused.c Joel Garreau, author, journalist, Professor of Law, Culture and Values, Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law, Arizona State University The major challenge consuming me is that the wheels are coming off the Enlightenment right now, on our watch, and it’s our own damn fault. The GRIN technologies – the genetics, robotics, information and nano revolutions – are advancing on a curve. Meanwhile, we humans are trying to process this exponential change with our good old v. 1.0 brains. With precious little help at all from those creating this upheaval. Folk are not stupid. They can clearly detect the ground moving beneath their feet, and that of their children and jobs and futures. When the ground moves beneath her feet, any sane primate looks for something apparently solid to hold onto. Anybody with apparently simple stories about what’s going on, forcefully told, *will* get attention. You’ve doubtless seen the data about how the most common job in the vast majority of states is truck driver. So what are we doing? We’re obsoleting these jobs as fast as we can, with a hand wave about how, “Oh, they’ll find better jobs.” While, meanwhile, the rate of suicide and drug addiction and protest voting among the solid middle-aged former middle-class soars. These guys are not stupid. They know they’ve been had. And we’re going to pay for it. And don’t tell me the solution is to have the robots just give them a guaranteed income. Humans require meaning as surely as food. The days when scientists could not [care] about the impact of their work on cultural, values and society are over. If they ever existed, which they didn’t, but that’s water over the dam. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve talked to guys working on, oh, something like massively increasing the number and power of mitochondria in human cells. And I’m like, you know that if you massively increase the amount of energy creation in cells, you’re talking about changing what it means to be human, right? Are you intentionally trying to create supermen? And the answer every time is “Wow, what a fascinating question, I never thought of that.” It’s not that these scientists are stupid, obviously. It’s that they’re tunnel-vision. They don’t wake up thinking about how they can change the human race. They wake up thinking about how they’re going to wire the goddamn monkey. That’s just the way these guys are. Fix it. Get out of your silo. If you can’t figure out the societal and cultural implications of what you’re doing, start seeking out people who might, and start systematically having lunch with them. And then invite the most interesting ones into your lab with the goal of them becoming partners. One example of this was the scientist who was spending her life finding the biomarkers for a disease for which there was no cure. Mercifully, her lab was among the first to start systematically bringing in partners from entirely outside. One of them asked, “What’s the point of creating despair? Might it be possible for you to find it interesting to search for a biomarker for a disease to which there is a cure?” To which she replied, of course, “Wow, what a fascinating question, I never thought of that.” But once it was pointed out to her, she happily did find another interesting biomarker problem that was culturally useful. Culture moves slower than does innovation. That’s just what humans are like. Deal with it, or watch the collapse of the Enlightenment as they ever increasingly come at you with torches and pitchforks – and correctly so. Mary Shelley knew her humans. My wife and I used to raise border collies. Border collies make terrible pets. You can not give an intelligent species nothing to do. If you don’t give them sheep, or something comparably interesting, they will come up with something to occupy their great minds. And you may not like it. Laurie Garrett, Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations 1. Greatest frustration: It is deeply annoying and vexing that CRISPR-cas9 and other gene editing techniques are being applied to treatment of rare diseases and a host of pharmacology development, but little investment is directed toward application of state-of-the-art gene editing or metagenomic sequencing and detection for point-of-care diagnostics creation. There are many exciting developments at the lab bench level that could translate into ""Star Trek""-like abilities to wade into epidemic hysteria and swiftly identify who is infected, and with what organism. There are even innovations that allow identification on-the-spot of infections with previously unknown microbes, based on conserved genetic regions found in classes of viruses or bacteria. But nobody seems interested in bankrolling such game-changing innovations for production on a mass scale. It's a market failure issue – a where's-the-profits problem. If Ebola broke out somewhere tomorrow we are better off today in that some methods for quickly identifying the virus in blood samples exist, but even now they remain noncommercial, require a laboratory and have no relevance to real-world conditions. 2. In 2009-10 some in the national security community were obsessed with concern about gain-of-function research, mainly on flu viruses. Researchers were deliberately creating forms of H5N1 and H7N9 and H1N1 that could be passed mammal-2-mammal, probably human-to-human. The goal on researchers' parts was to understand what genetic switches had to occur to turn a bird flu into a potentially catastrophic human airborne transmissible pandemic strain. But of course the work was very dangerous – especially if it got into the wrong hands. That was then, this is now: The technology of gene modification is far more advanced, and application of cutting edge gene excision and incision techniques makes gain-of-function work potentially far easier, and more dangerous. The two governments that were taking the lead on dual-use research of concern issues (UK and US) are both preoccupied now with very different problems and new leadership. And the WHO was the lead global agency – it is facing a major leadership change. So we have no guidance regarding how governments are likely to view these issues. Tim Jinks, Head of Drug Resistant Infections at Wellcome Trust Modern medicine depends on doctors having effective drugs to treat infections. But many common infections are becoming more difficult to treat because bacteria are becoming resistant to the drugs available. Drug-resistant infection – or antimicrobial resistance – is a very serious health threat to us all. Already it results in around 700,000 deaths a year globally. Within a generation it could be 10 million; it could mean we can no longer safely carry out not only complex, lifesaving treatments such as chemotherapy and organ transplants but also more routine operations like caesareans and hip replacements. More needs to be done to improve our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent drug resistant infections and to speed up development of new antibiotics to replace those no longer effective in protecting us against deadly infections. Anit Mukherjee, policy fellow at the Center for Global Development Technological innovation is progressing rapidly not only in the digital sphere but also in areas such as health, education, nutrition, food safety and life-saving/enhancing drugs. However, the gains of these new technologies are being captured by a minority of the population both domestically and internationally. While the digital divide has received more attention (and being bridged significantly), inequality is manifesting in other sectors that ultimately affect peoples’ well being. One outcome is human migration which is not only political but also economic and social. The other is the more frequent outbreaks of diseases, epidemics and pandemics such as ebola, MARS and Zika. In a world where there is a sentiment against movement of goods and people, how can developing societies adapt to increasing inequalities and build systems of governance to ensure human security? Pardis Sabeti, Associate Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard University The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics exposed our global vulnerabilities to deadly microbial threats and highlighted the need for proactive measures in advance of outbreaks and swift action during them. At the same time it shows our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat deadly infectious diseases through new technologies. It is a time of great potential for devastation or advancement for one of the greatest challenges of our lifetimes. Robert Sparrow, adjunct professor, Centre for Human Bioethics, Monash University What does justice require of wealthy Northern states when confronted by mass migration from increasingly impoverished Southern countries as a result of accelerating climate change? How should we respond, both ethically and emotionally, to the knowledge that we are living through one of history’s fastest periods of extinction and that this catastrophe is the result of humankind’s activities? As technological developments increasingly drive social change, how can democratic societies empower ordinary people to have a say in the decisions that shape the technological trajectories that will in turn determine what the future looks like? How can the public have meaningful input into the character of the algorithms that will increasingly determine both the nature of their relationships with other people on social media and their access to various important social goods? How can we prevent an underwater arms race involving autonomous submersibles over the coming decades? Should we use “gene drives” to try to eliminate disease vectors in nature? How can we ensure that questions about meaning and values, and not just calculations of risks and benefits, are addressed in decisions about human genome editing? Eric Topol, Scripps Transatlantic Science Institute Our major challenge is related to our new capability of digitizing human beings. That is, via biosensors, DNA sequencing and imaging, we can define each individual’s medical essence. But the problem is that this generates many terabytes of data, which includes real-time streaming of key metrics like blood pressure. Aggregating and processing the data, derived from many sources, with algorithms and artificial intelligence (particularly deep learning) is a daunting task. Once we can do this, we’ll be on our way to a virtual medical coach – your smartphone providing instantaneous feedback on all your health and medical metrics to help prevent you from getting sick. Mike Turner, Head of Infection and Immunobiology at Wellcome Trust Infectious disease outbreaks are a growing threat to health and prosperity in our modern world. Vast amounts of international travel, increasing urbanisation and a changing climates means that viruses can cross borders and spread around the globe faster than ever before. Recent outbreaks like Sars, Ebola and Zika have all shown how unprepared the world is to deal with epidemics. To stand any chance of tackling this threat, we need new vaccines, stronger healthcare systems and a better coordinated global response. At Wellcome, we’re working to address this threat in a variety of ways; we are a founding partner of the Coalition for Epidemics Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) that will develop new vaccine candidates against infections we know could cause a serious epidemic. The WHO also needs to be much better funded and have the mandate to respond swiftly and effectively when diseases do begin to spread. Only by investing, coordinating and working together can we expect to prepare the world for the next inevitable epidemic. Watch our animation with words by Bill Gates on Cepi’s vaccine plans. Gavin Yamey, professor of the practice of global health, Duke University Global Health Institute I believe one of the most urgent global issues that we face in 2017 and beyond, and one that we are woefully ill-prepared for, is the threat of epidemics and pandemics. We have three enormous gaps in the global system of preparedness. First, many countries have weak national systems for detecting and responding to outbreaks. Second, we have too few vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics for emerging infectious diseases with outbreak potential. Third, at the international level, we simply don’t yet have a robust, joined-up approach to providing the essential components of a preparedness and response system – like surge capacity in producing vaccines in a crisis, an inter-connected global surveillance system, or a global reserve corps of emergency responders. Closing these three gaps is one of the most urgent global priorities if we are to avert a potential world catastrophe. For example, if we suffer another flu pandemic similar to the 1918 “Spanish flu,” the World Bank estimates that there could be 71 million deaths and a global recession costing over $3 trillion. Homi Kharas, senior fellow and deputy director of Brookings Institute’s Global Program The battle for sustainable development will be won or lost in cities. 150 million people are moving to cities each year. By 2050, over 7 billion people will live in cities (80% of the world), and cities will be responsible for 75% of global carbon emissions. Cities are places where infrastructure gets locked in for decades, if not centuries, but city planners must make investments now in a world where technology is changing rapidly where people live, work and play, and how they access buildings, transport, energy and waste management. The fastest growth is happening in thousands of secondary cities where mayors and city managers are not well schooled in technical urban planning. Often, these secondary cities must collaborate with each other to deliver services effectively across boundaries within larger metropolitan areas. Carey King, assistant director, University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute We need a discussion as to what political leaders, business leaders, and citizens think is an appropriate distribution of wealth across the entire population. This focuses on the real question (how many people have what, independent of the size of the economy, though the two are linked) instead of discussing how to shape policies and taxes to achieve an unspecified growth target independent of wealth distribution. Trump, Brexit, and Le Pen are representations that people understand growth only for the elite in the West is no longer tenable. An issue that has not received enough attention in the media and popular understanding is that the Earth is finite and this fact will have real world physical, economic, social, and political implications. Neoclassical economics ignores this obvious fact, yet it is used to guide most policy (eg, economic projections and scenarios), including that for climate change mitigation. Thus, we are using an economic theory that is simply incapable and inapplicable for informing an unprecedented transformation of the economy. Vijay Padmanabhan, Asian Development Bank, Technical Advisor (Urban) The one major challenge we will face due to urbanisation will be 'water security'. We are already grappling with this problem across our developing member countries and with deteriorating river or surface water quality, lack of sufficient ground water sources and increasing dependence on sea water as a supply source, we have to bring in innovations in water management. Treatment technology, water aquifer mapping, recycling and reuse of wastewater, etc. are areas of R&D investment. ADB is working with a large number of utilities to address these issues and as we engage on a long term basis with many cities and utilities, we will be actively exploring opportunities to bring in value for money propositions so that the utility benefits in the long term. We are also connecting with industry leaders to understand market trends so that we can bring the best to our developing member countries. William Ryerson, founder and president, the Population Institute and Population Media Center Perhaps a summary is that the human enterprise has outgrown the long-ability of the planet’s renewable resources to support us at our current numbers and our current rates of consumption and waste generation. Climate change is just one piece of evidence of this fact. Technological improvements, while potentially important in reducing per capita impact, are not sufficient to make us sustainable unless we also stop growth in human numbers and reduce average consumption, while simultaneously lessening the gap between the richest and the poorest people on the planet. Sustainability is a term that is not well understood and is misused, but the reality is that any activity that is not sustainable will stop. So far, non-renewable resources are what are primarily driving our economic engine. But by definition, non-renewables are being depleted and for the most part will stop being economically available in this century. So we must plan rapidly for the day when humanity can live using just renewable resources, while maintaining the biodiversity that makes the planet habitable. In truth, sustainability is the ultimate environmental issue, the ultimate health issue, and the ultimate human rights issue. Strategies that help to bring about changes in societal behaviour, including reproductive behavior, are critically important in achieving sustainability. Use of entertainment media is a key component of such strategies, since a large share of humanity consume entertainment mass media during free time. For that reason, Population Media Center utilises long-running serialised dramas in various countries to create characters that gradually evolve into positive role models for the audience to bring about changes in social norms on a broad array of critical issues. Attached are three documents that describe this work and its effects. Jim Watson, Director of the UK Energy Research Centre We need to think about how the system will fit together as our energy systems change. Globally speaking there is still a lot of people – 1.5 billion or so – who do not have access to modern energy services. There is going to be a lot of rising demand from regions like Africa. One of the big challenges of deploying new energy technologies, particularly these intermittent renewables like wind and solar, is the impact they have on the system. It used to be that in the summer it was a really quiet time for the grid operator compared to the winter, but now they are having this peak in generation in summer due to solar energy when demand is low. They are having to juggle this as we cannot store electricity in large quantities yet. This is a new way of operating for them. With the sort of changes we are seeing in energy systems around the world, cheaper and better storage is going to be a big part of the solution. When it comes to heating for somewhere like the UK, you might need storage that lasts several months. You get a lot of energy generated in the summer and you might need it in the winter to heat homes. This is an area that is really ripe for innovation and we are really only at the start of deploying and trailing those. It is a critical part of this new system we are trying to create. Peter Barron, VP Communications, EMEA, Google Google was built on providing people with high-quality and authoritative results for their search queries. We strive to give users a breadth of diverse content from variety of sources and we’re committed to the principle of a free and open web. Judging which pages on the web best answer a query is a challenging problem and we don’t always get it right. When non-authoritative information ranks too high in our search results, we develop scalable, automated approaches to fix the problems, rather than manually removing these one-by-one. We recently made improvements to our algorithm that will help surface more high quality, credible content on the web. We’ll continue to change our algorithms over time in order to tackle these challenges. Rohit Chandra, VP Engineering, Yahoo Search providers face a confluence of human and technology challenges. While we provide the portal for users to find information, we depend on content creators and distributors to apply journalistic discipline to what they are creating. The scale of popular social networks has democratized publishing, which effectively lets anyone – regardless of their intentions or qualifications – produce content that can appear journalistic. Another challenge is that technology-driven online engines like ours learn through click-feedback or “crowd-sourcing.” That runs the risk of perpetuating a “herd-mentality” – in which if lots of users start chasing a particular news source (maybe based on shock value rather than credibility), our AI-systems could accidentally “learn” and treat that source as highly valued or credible. I do see a need in the market to develop standards, perhaps from an organization like Nielsen. Facebook and others are working on this, too. The answer has to be a combination of technology and editorial; we can’t fact-check every story, but there must be enough human eyes on the content that we know the quality bar stays high. Eddie Copeland, director of government Innovation at Nesta, a UK charity that has looked at the future of democracy in the digital world Rather than waiting for politicians to make decisions and then we all argue over whether what they say reflects reality, we could have tools that engage people much earlier in the process so they can be involved in formulating ideas and drafting legislation, following the course of how ideas go from concept to becoming laws and how effective they are in reality. It might just give you a fighting chance of making people feel part of a system rather than observing it from the outside. Nonny de la Pena, virtual reality journalist and CEO of Emblematic Group Call me idealistic, but I really believe if you have an informed global citizenry, then people are going to make better decisions. We are going through the pain of, how do we convey information that’s accurate? People may not be looking at traditional media for their solutions. I think for audiences, VR is a totally different type of story. There is nothing in print or radio or broadcast that can let you walk around in actual space. That kind of effort, of making those kinds of pieces, is going to get easier and easier. You’ll be walking around the scene, not looking at flat screen or video. When you walk around, it’s a whole other level. Now your body can engage. Now when I go to the movies, I find the frames so artificial – I can see the box. I see the square. When I put on a headset, I see the world. The fact that audiences are going to be engaged with this kind of storytelling make sit a very important opportunity for journalism to embrace. Ben Fletcher, senior software engineer at IBM Watson Research who worked on a project to build an AI fact checker We got a lot of feedback that people did not want to be told what was true or not. At the heart of what they want, was actually the ability to see all sides and make the decision for themselves. A major issue most people face, without knowing it, is the bubble they live in. If they were shown views outside that bubble they would be much more open to talking about them. Kevin Kelly, founding executive editor of Wired Magazine The major new challenge in reporting news is the new shape of truth. Truth is no longer dictated by authorities, but is networked by peers. For every fact there is a counterfact. All those counterfacts and facts look identical online, which is confusing to most people. The only way a fact becomes accepted as true is to be networked with other facts consider to be true. Like in Science, all truth is provisional, although some is more provisional than others. The Truth is really a network of truths, and each of these true facts is probabilistic. The probability of a fact being true is increased by the degree it is networked with other true facts and the reliability of truthfulness by its source. So the challenge before us is to begin to construct a truth signaling layer into the fabric of facts, particularly online. This will be a multi-generational effort that will resemble the construction of wikipedia, but goes far beyond it. Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychologist at University of Bristol who studies persistence of misinformation in society Having a large number of people in a society who are mis-informed and have their own set of facts is absolutely devastating and extremely difficult to cope with. There are solutions available – using the technology that has given rise to this problem. Turning it upside down by changing the algorithms in Facebook or on Google to nudge people into sharing or consuming news that are slightly outside their normal comfort zone. What is happening now is that the cookies you gather as you browse the web will tell the website what it is you like. The way to get out of this polarisation is for these algorithms to suggest something that I might not like or agree with but is not so offensive to me that I wouldn’t look at it. That way you can keep people from self-radicalising in these ecological bubbles. That sort of technological solution is one good way forward. I think we have to work on that. Alexios Mantzarlis, chair of the International Fact Checking Network I see a challenge in the flood of reasonable-looking information out there making it harder to distinguish between sources of information. Search algorithms are as flawed as the people who develop them. We should think about adding layers of credibility to sources. We need to tag and structure quality content in effective ways. Will Moy, director of Full Fact, an independent fact checking organisation based in the UK Even if we have structures that impose constraints on people in power and we put pressure on powerful people to be honest with us, in a sense, all of that is being circumvented by social media. On Facebook, political bodies can put something out, pay for advertising, put it in front of millions of people, yet it is hard for those not being targeting to know they have done that. They can target those people based on how old they are, where they live, what skin colour they have, what gender they are. These messages are so common and so targeted, they are capable of having a massive influence on public decisions. We have never had a time when it has been so easy to advertise to millions of people and not have the other millions of us notice. You can’t take out an advert in a newspaper and not have the people you are not targeting not notice. that is a really profound change. We shouldn’t think of social media as just peer to peer communication – it is also the most powerful advertising platform there has ever been. We need a more equipped environment - we need watchdogs that will go around and say hang on, this doesn’t stack up and ask them to correct the record. There is a role for watchdogs and there is also a role for all of us. Paul Resnick, professor of information at the University of Michigan who developed a tool for identifying rumours on social media called RumourLens The fundamental challenge we now face is how to handle a setting where anybody can get their views disseminated without intermediaries to prevent the distribution. Somehow there still has to be some process of collectively coming to some agreement of what we are going to believe and what we think are consensual facts. A lot of what I have seen in terms of approaches to deal with that are trying to do things that are focused on assessing the content of factual claims to try to verify whether they are true or not. I don’t think that at its heart will be the mechanism. I think that it is going to be not figuring what to believe but who to believe. Most individuals can’t personally verify most factual claims that we hear. If you think about some of the things you personally believe that are fact, there are many that you have not personally verified. It would be tremendously inefficient for all of us to try to personally verify all of these things. We have to have a setting where we trust other people. Victoria Rubin, director of the language and information technology research lab at Western University, Ontario, Canada If there are people who are willing to blatantly refuse to believe that something is a lie, no matter how hard you try, they won't listen. I'm not sure what amount of evidence is needed in this new paradigm of journalism to get newsreaders out of their new bubbles. Human psychology is the main obstacle, unwillingness to bend one's mind around facts that don't agree with one's own viewpoint. We're studying how news framing affects attribution of blame for events described in the news, and whether there is mitigating effect of partisan beliefs. The second newer misleading type of fakes that's gaining traction is native ads (specifically, in news), or sponsored content that's disguised as editorials, or what's formerly known as advertorials. Such misleading practice constitutes an internal threat to the profession of journalism and may further deteriorate mainstream media trust. If information users are unaware of the Native Ads original promotional nature, they may find themselves insufficiently informed or misled by its content.

Interest Rate Sentiment,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2012-10-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19787768,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Unemployment in the eurozone hit a fresh high of 18.2 million in August, the EU statistics agency has said. The number of people out of work rose by 34,000, but revised data for July meant the unemployment rate remained stable at a record high of 11.4%. The highest unemployment rate was recorded in Spain, where 25.1% of the workforce is out of a job, and the lowest of 4.5% was recorded in Austria. The board of mining group Xstrata has recommended that shareholders back the merger terms offered by commodities trader Glencore. Shareholders will now vote on whether to accept the offer of 3.05 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share. Glencore had raised its offer after its first bid was opposed by key Xstrata shareholders, including Qatar Holding, the Gulf state's sovereign wealth fund. A merger would form one of the world's biggest metals and commodities firms. The bosses of BAE Systems and EADS have issued a joint appeal for support for their proposed $45bn (£28bn) merger. The statement by Ian King and Tom Enders, published in UK, French and German newspapers, come as the defence and aerospace firms seek a tie-up. They also need political support for the deal as France and Germany are keen to maintain their interests in EADS. The deal faced another setback on Monday when Lagardere, a key EADS shareholder, expressed reservations and called for a review of the deal. Lagardere owns 7.5% of EADS, but has an agreement dating back to EADS' foundation 2000 to represent the French government in its 22% share. The downturn in the manufacturing sector in the eurozone eased slightly in September, according to a closely-watched survey. The Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the region was 46.1 in the month, up from 45.1 in August. Any score below 50 indicates contraction. This video can not be played Biz Heads Despite the slight upturn, manufacturing in the eurozone has now contracted for 14 consecutive months. Earlier, data showed that manufacturing in China shrank for the second month. China's PMI rose to 49.8 in September from 49.2 in August, government data showed. Japanese businesses sentiment worsened in the three months to September, a survey has indicated, underlining the weakness in the country's economy. The Bank of Japan's Tankan Survey measures pessimism and optimism among large manufacturers. The index showed the mood deteriorating to minus 3, compared with minus 1 in the June survey. It has been negative for four straight quarters. Analysts said demand had been hit by a weak global economic picture. Iran's currency, the rial, fell almost 10% on Monday to a record low against the dollar, leaving it with a loss of 25% in one week. The rial was trading at 32,250 against the dollar at 12:00BST on Monday. On Sunday, it was worth about 29,720, according to the Iranian currency-tracking website Mazanex. The fall suggests economic sanctions imposed over its disputed nuclear programme are hitting economic activity ever harder. The latest Business Daily podcast from the BBC World Service considers whether almost zero interest rates actually get an economy growing again. The programme hears from Japan's businesses - which have had 20 years of low interest rates. Also in the programme, one of the architects of the euro, Otmar Issing, says more integration is not the answer for Europe. Market data"
