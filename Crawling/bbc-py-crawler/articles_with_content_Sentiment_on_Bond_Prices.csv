Sentiment on Bond Prices,Argentina's Milei defends radical austerity plan,2024-09-14,2024-05-06,By Ione Wells,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-68935255,"Argentina's President Javier Milei has denied that it is ordinary Argentines who are paying for his radical austerity measures. In a BBC interview, Mr Milei, who campaigned with a chainsaw to symbolise his desire to slash public spending, insisted that the political class were paying for his huge cuts, not the people.   The right-wing economist was voted in after years of high government spending and high debt. Inflation is now starting to fall after it initially soared when he took office in December, but it remains the highest in the world annually. The president's critics argue millions of Argentines are paying the price for his austerity programme.  In the five months since he was sworn in, he has slashed public sector jobs, energy and transport subsidies, and the value of the currency so people's money is worth less than it was. Meeting him for the interview in his presidential office, there were clues to his unconventional political background as a celebrity TV economics pundit: a photo of the Rolling Stones (he was in a tribute band), a bust of himself on the desk, a toy model with a chainsaw, and a water bottle with a photo of himself on it.   Gifts from his fans, his team said.  His face lit up with glee when he told me his favourite Rolling Stones song is Rip This Joint, which he said was off an album with ""libertarian components"".  Since he became president, he has maintained his radical rhetoric about the economy, but has toned it down on other issues.  He refused to repeat his past criticism of China, one of Argentina's biggest trading partners, a nation which he labelled an ""assassin"" during his presidential campaign. As far as economics is concerned, he has made cutting inflation, which stands at 287% annually, his clear priority, arguing that ""the most regressive tax that most afflicts people is inflation"". But many of his policies have caused prices to rise in the short term, at a time when salaries and pensions are not keeping up with inflation.  Julia is one of those who can no longer make ends meet on her monthly pension of about US$190 (£150).   The 72-year-old retired chef travels two hours every day to supplement her meagre pension by singing in Buenos Aires.  It is the common people who are suffering, she told me, in tears.  Confronted with her statement, President Milei said this was ""false"".  He insisted that the brunt of the burden was being borne by what he called the political corporation, claiming that 90% of the cuts were falling on the political class and only 10% were achieved through cutting government spending on pensions. Independent analysts say spending on pensions has been cut by 30-40% in real terms - with some saying this makes it one of the biggest government spending cuts. In his interview with the BBC, President Milei celebrated the fact that his administration had managed to lower spending to a level below tax income for the first time since 2008. When repeatedly asked what he would say to pensioners like Julia who are struggling, he said: ""You can't make a macroeconomic evaluation based on the situation of an individual.""  He argued people were being influenced by information spread by the ""rotten"" mass media and journalists, whom he described as ""serial liars"".  When it was put to him that the information that people had access to were prices on shelves, such as the price of milk, which has doubled since he took office, he said: ""You don't do economics based on the price of an individual asset.""  He defended his policies to the BBC, saying that ""there is no magic, real life needs time"".  ""What would have been the alternative? To continue to print money like the previous administration that generates inflation and ends up affecting the most vulnerable?""  Mr Milei insisted his economic programme was helping the most vulnerable - for example, by increasing some welfare benefits such as support for unemployed people with children to buy food.   He said economic indicators were ""improving"" and that ""in the last month, salaries beat inflation"". But many Argentines say they are not convinced by his argument.  Vanessa López, who works at a soup kitchen in a poor neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, said demand for their service had increased. ""It's not only people who are homeless, there are entire families that come looking for a plate of food."" Some of the president's fans are willing to give him time. Nicolás Vargas said he and his partner Ornella struggled to make enough to cover the basics. But he said Argentina's economic crisis was something that ""has been going on for a long time, even decades, and it cannot be fixed in two, three, four months, even a year"". ""I have that faith. I estimate it will take two years. In other words, this year is the year of recovery."" This sentiment is shared by President Milei, who insisted in the interview that he did not care how many people criticised him, because of his ""conviction"" that ""a better future is getting closer"".  The full interview is available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds or you can listen to Ione Wells discuss her interview with President Milei on The Global Story podcast. "

Sentiment on Bond Prices,Soaring shares: A good or bad sign?,2024-09-14,2017-08-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40744544,"For weeks now, US stock markets have been hitting records, a rise claimed by President Donald Trump as proof of a healthy economy.  But Mr Trump's pride in the numbers is at odds with analysts and investors, who have expressed increasing discomfort over the market's climb. About 65% of investment managers surveyed by Northern Trust last quarter said they believed shares were over-valued, the highest ever in the firm's report.  Surveys by Bank of America Merrill Lynch have expressed alarm about the high prices, as have policymakers at the Federal Reserve. ""We are concerned about equity valuations right now,"" says Mike Morrill, chief operating officer at DF Dent, a Baltimore-based investment company. ""We've had nine years of a strong bull market and that's not going to last forever."" The sentiment is similar to statements Mr Trump himself made before his election, when he said the stock market was ""so bloated"" and warned people to ""be careful"". If investors believe prices are too high - and are buying anyway - that could be a sign of a bubble.  So is the stock market rally a reason to cheer, as Mr Trump suggests now? Or could a crash be around the corner? Stocks, which have been on a long-term upward trend, surged early in 2017, amid optimism over business-friendly policies endorsed by the Trump administration, such as tax reform.  Analysts say that without clear signs of progress on reform in Washington that effect has faded.  Now, it's strong corporate revenue and profit growth that are boosting share prices, with gains going to larger, multinational companies. The three major measures - the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq - have climbed between roughly 10% and 17% so far this year, compared with about 6% to 7% during the same period last year. The Nasdaq has hit a new high more than 40 times this year. Since 2012, the value of the S&P 500 index has almost doubled. ""The stock market hit the highest level it's ever been,"" Mr Trump boasted on Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average exceeded 22,000 points on Wednesday morning.  ""Our country is doing very well,"" he said. But that hasn't stopped the muttering that the stock market, at least, is due for a correction.  Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale University, says share gains reflect optimism about where the economy is heading, but it's an unreliable forecasting tool, and shifts quickly. ""The stock market is mostly psychology,"" he says. ""The fluctuations in it mean that we're in an optimistic mood but we could change and we could change suddenly."" Investors are trying to anticipate what might trigger a change - whether it be rising interest rates, weak consumer spending, developments overseas or something else entirely.  Mr Shiller says he thinks Mr Trump himself poses one of the biggest risks.   The firestorm in Washington in May after Mr Trump fired former FBI director James Comey prompted some of the biggest one-day share sell-offs this year.  ""Usually, presidents are not able to transform the economy unless he does something disastrous, which transforms it down,"" says Mr Shiller. ""I'm thinking that it's more likely he will create some kind of uncertainty, disruption and that might be a trigger for decline."" Many of the biggest gains come from a single sector - technology stocks - the same industry that some investors say is overvalued. The S&P 500 information technology index, which averages 68 companies, including heavyweights such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, last month passed the record set in March 2000.  The index rose about 22% in the first seven months of 2017, while the broader S&P 500 climbed about 10%.  Some say the gains in tech make sense, as investors target a part of the economy seeing rapid growth.  However, others worry that in some cases the rise in shares has little to do with the companies' actual prospects.  And in more recent weeks, tech stocks have come under pressure. If the sell-off spreads to other sectors, it could be a warning of bigger problems.  Jill Hall, a US equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, doesn't expect stock markets in general to rise much more this year, but she's not predicting a big sell-off either.  She thinks investors will shift their money from the high-growth tech industry into sectors such as energy, health care and finance. ""What we're expecting is more of a rotation out of growth and into value,"" she says. Some say they're worried Federal Reserve and central bankers elsewhere will move too aggressively to increase interest rates, causing havoc in bond and stock markets. About 27% of investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month identified a mistake by central bankers in the US and Europe as the biggest risk to their outlooks. Another 28% were worried about bonds. Mr Trump himself raised alarms on these lines at a presidential debate last year.  ""We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble,"" he said. ""The only thing that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down."" That's something that is not lost on the central bankers responsible for monetary policy. Last month Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen told a US congressional committee: ""We want to make sure that we manage this in a way that is not disruptive to financial markets.""  And that's a sentiment financial markets would no doubt endorse. "
Sentiment on Bond Prices,Is the US trying to kill crypto?,2024-09-14,2023-06-14,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65861096,"Is the US out to kill crypto? Maybe. Three years ago, the majority of the firms in the sector that Andrew Durgee's company invested in were based in the US. This year, he estimates that just one out of every 10 will be - a reflection of his firm's judgement that the country has been growing increasingly hostile to digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens. ""The administration really has a target on the industry,"" says Mr Durgee, managing director of the crypto division for tech firm Republic. ""The regulatory uncertainty makes the investments in the US higher risk."" The sector was already under pressure, after prices of virtual currencies collapsed last year. Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called ""Crypto King"" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting ""one of the biggest financial frauds"" in US history. Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors. The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud. Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a ""security"" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC. The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance.  The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: ""Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court."" Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (£2.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance. ""It's very much back on the fringe of finance,"" he says. ""Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse."" In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the ""cloud of uncertainty"" surrounding the tokens. Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile ""regulation by enforcement"" aimed at boosting his own political profile.  They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks. ""It's been a very frustrating experience,"" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. ""There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on."" Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: ""The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore."" Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question. Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow. Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry. ""If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,"" she says.  But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two ""crypto winters"" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU. He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen.  Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing. ""We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,"" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector. Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago. ""It would be a mistake to think that the US… could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,"" she says. Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal. However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies. ""We are at a real inflection point,"" she says. ""The showdown is here."""
Sentiment on Bond Prices,China's empty tower blocks highlight economic woes,2024-09-14,2023-07-06,By Stephen McDonell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66125675,"The small eastern city of Zibo in Shandong province is experiencing an outdoor barbecue craze. People from all over China are coming here to taste its lamb skewers, which have become legendary via social media. It's quite a raucous experience and certainly not for the faint-hearted. The street is packed, you sit on little plastic chairs, drink beer and wrap chunks of meat with spring onion on the local flatbread while karaoke songs pump out in all directions. On the face of it, these crowds appear to show an economy rebounding strongly from the coronavirus emergency - but according to economists that's not the case. Rather, they say, this is an example of people choosing a cheap, tasty, option at a time of great pressure on household incomes. A man sitting with his shirt off tells us this is the perfect spot to enjoy a hot summer night with his family, and that this type of fun has a price tag to match the moment. ""This place is great for ordinary people,"" he says. ""Recently, it's been hard to make money but still easy to spend it. After three years of Covid, the economy is only slowly recovering."" University graduates are being hit especially hard by China's economic doldrums, with youth unemployment hovering at or above 20%. Some students are feeling nervous about their futures. ""Yes, I'm worried,"" says one woman who'll soon graduate. ""There's a lot of competition. It's hard to find a job. All my classmates feel the same pressure.""  For those who have jobs, a big reason for their reluctance to spend big is economic security. They're concerned about the potential to join the ranks of the unemployed, and their household's largest single investment is, in many cases, no longer worth what they thought it would be.  The real estate sector is under great stress in China. To see this first-hand, we drive a few hours east of Zibo to the outskirts of a much larger city, Qingdao. Here, a property explosion hasn't matched real demand from buyers or renters, and the result has been huge housing estates built with very few residents in them. A woman is selling cold noodles from a portable stand outside her housing complex where she has few neighbours. A few years ago, her husband bought a flat here after moving to Qingdao to give their child a better start because they heard the schools would be good. I ask her if she's worried about the value of her home collapsing. ""Of course I'm worried,"" she says. ""But what can I do?"" Nearby a couple who are street cleaners have stopped for lunch. They point to the huge estate behind them and say that nobody lives there. Across the road there is a small forest of concrete towers without paint, without windows and with window frames now looking the worse for wear, having been exposed to the elements. ""Construction just stopped there one day last year,"" the man says. According to his wife, the entire suburb is pretty dead. ""There's nothing here. There's no petrol station. You have to go a long way for fuel. It's really not convenient to live here,"" she says. There had been hope that this region would take off after the city hosted a major political meeting, the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Summit, and China's leader Xi Jinping gave it his personal stamp of approval as a place to invest and do business, potentially hosting international expos and the like. But the factories, start-ups and other companies that would supposedly employ those who bought property here have been few. According to a local real estate agent, sales volumes have halved in the area in recent years. ""Prices are down because the market is saturated,"" she says. ""Too many homes were built and it's hard to sell them."" We put up a drone to get a bird's eye view and it looks even worse than at ground level. Entire new housing estates where work has stopped can be found in all directions. Those that are finished don't have much sign of life in them. What's more, this supply and demand problem isn't unique to this area. It isn't even unique to this city. In province after province across China, evidence pointing to the danger of a property bubble is easy to find. One reason for rampant real estate speculation in this country has been a lack of other options for investment. But the boom in real estate drove house prices out of the reach of ordinary families in many big cities. The government response was to cap the number of flats any person could buy.  It was a genuine attempt at an egalitarian reform, but pressure is now coming to reverse this. In Qingdao, such measures have already been eased, in an attempt to stimulate its stalled real estate market. The challenge for Chinese policymakers is to find a way to wean this economy off such a heavy reliance on property sales to generate growth and business confidence. Economists like Harry Murphy Cruise, from Moody's Analytics, think China is facing significant problems. ""China's economy is in desperate need of rebalancing,"" he tells the BBC from Australia. ""It's had that massive period of growth over the last two or three decades from big infrastructure building, from a massive uptick in the property market that is actually not a sustainable growth driver going forward. ""Look around the world, developed economies need households as a key driver of economic growth, and that is just not what China has at the moment."" The Chinese government is considering ways to promote more spending by individuals and by businesses from interest rate cuts to cash handouts. But the problem is sentiment. People will feel more secure when there are more jobs. Businesses need to invest to create more jobs, but they are reluctant to do so while customers are so insecure. As Harry Murphy Cruise puts it: ""It's sort of like the chicken and the egg. You can't have that uptick in the economy unless you have business spending. They're not spending until they see that uptick. So, there's a stalemate that's really holding back a key portion of the economy."" Then there's the chance that all of this will bleed into global trade. China is big. What happens to the world's second largest economy turns ripples into waves. Reduced manufacturing here - off the back of weak international demand - has resulted in fewer exports, fewer Chinese-made goods available worldwide and less business activity in Asia's mega factory. Then the subsequent slower consumption in China means fewer imports of other countries' products. The headache for the Chinese government is that it may have to choose whether to go for a short-term stimulus fix, which would delay the rebalancing it will eventually need to face, or whether to absorb more immediate pain and bring on the long-term solution more quickly. Naturally, there are almost certainly those in Beijing's upper echelons of power considering some sort of middle path, starting with a milder boost to stabilise the economy, then considering the larger problems at hand. Because they know that, once negative sentiment sets in, it can be hard to turn around. Yet if you want to feel optimistic about Qingdao, and about life, you go to the beach. Tourism along its famous coastline does seem to be picking up. There's laughter, sandcastle construction and everyone - whether they're a captain of industry or a truck driver - is enjoying the great embrace of the ocean. Whether it matches reality or not, here you almost can't help but feel that, despite everything, the future still has good things in store."
Sentiment on Bond Prices,Should we be hopeful about the climate?,2024-09-14,2020-01-10,Diego Arguedas Ortiz,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200109-is-it-wrong-to-be-hopeful-about-climate-change,"Real hope for the future of the climate can’t come from admiring the inspirational deeds of others – it has to be earned, writes Diego Arguedas Ortiz. In 2018, a 30-minute documentary was premiered in San José, Costa Rica’s capital and my hometown. The film followed the early efforts of a handful of marine biologists who are fighting coral bleaching. They grow tiny bits of coral in underwater nurseries and once they’re big enough move them back to the reef, hoping to restore it. Their pace is slow, possibly too slow to keep up with bleaching due to climate change. Warming waters swipe entire reefs in a matter of weeks. The biologists need months to nurture enough corals to restore a couple of square meters. Reef restoration seems like an impossible task, but they are relentless. It must be done to give corals a chance, so they are doing it. It’s the same principle guiding young climate activists, atmospheric scientists and climate essayists. As author Rebecca Solnit wrote in 2016: “We don’t know what is going to happen, or how, or when, and that very uncertainty is the space of hope.” You might also like: In the dark movie theatre, I felt a new bond with the scientists carrying baby corals and the filmmakers chasing after them. We are, indeed, losing this battle. They understand that, I believe, but in a tropical gulf thousands of miles away from where diplomats and politicians decide our carbon policies and international accords, a group of stubborn biologists and documentarists were refusing to give up. They were earning their own hope, one coral at a time. I think of these dogged coral reef scientists whenever I’m asked, “What gives you hope?” in the context of climate change. It’s a question full of nuance. Weighing it up, you have to consider the slew of recent record-breaking heatwaves, but also the indomitable force of schoolchildren protesting for their futures. It acknowledges our dire situation, yet suggests there might be a way forward. As climate change awareness goes mainstream – along with the feelings of anxiousness, pain and grief that come with it – this question has quickly become code for: “Where can I find hope?” The answer, coming from both the climate movement and psychology, is clear: within yourself. Several months ago, teenage activist Greta Thunberg scolded European MPs for failing to understand this. “You can’t just sit around waiting for hope to come,” she said last February in Brussels. “Then you are acting like spoiled irresponsible children. You don’t seem to understand that hope is something that you have to earn.” That was a new concept for me: earning hope. Years of environmental campaigns trained me to believe hope existed somewhere out there, and I only had to look for it. For instance, Al Gore’s Climate Reality tells us that 2018 gave us teenagers striking, new advances in solar panel technology and entire nations announcing divestment from fossil fuels. Meanwhile the Green New Deal is gaining traction in the US. But Thunberg was suggesting that these developments are not cause for hope. Nothing we’ll read about online should make us hopeful, because scrolling for hope by browsing through social media from your sofa won’t cut it. I think that’s even selfish. Those achievements are the result of exhausted youths, overworked scientists and grieving activists. For each green bill presented in a legislative body, there’s an anxious, underslept staffer who needs backup. Can one hope from the sidelines? “A lot of times, when I hear people say ‘Yeah, I'm hopeful or I'm optimistic’, they're basing their hope and their optimism on someone else's back, someone else's actions,” says climate justice essayist Mary Annaïse Heglar. Real, good, useful hope has nothing to do with positive news. Instead, it is profoundly linked with action: both ours and that of others alongside us. It’s a sentiment that resonates with me. There’s only one way to earn hope, and that’s rolling up our sleeves. Hope, not optimism In her book Hope in the Dark, Rebecca Solnit argues that hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. It’s something restless, alive. “It is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency,” she writes. This matches the mainstream psychological understanding of hope. Psychologists believe it emerges out of two elements: personallydetermined goals and pathways to reach them. It can be a driving force, but it has to come from within. That’s one of the differences between hope and optimism, says Matthew Gallagher, the psychologist who literally edited the handbook on hope.  “Optimism is a more general expectation that good things are going to happen,” he says, “even if you don’t know how they’ll happen.” Hope, meanwhile, has positive expectations about the future but is driven by our capacity to identify goals and set strategies to achieve them, he says. There’s little reason to be optimistic about climate change. We are set to overshoot our self-imposed temperature targets and carbon emissions started creeping up again in 2018. The transformation we must undergo is unlike anything we’ve seen before. The case for climate pessimism, and why it’s useful, is actually stronger. And for the people in the frontlines – the Arctic communities, the small-town fishermen in the Tropics and the displaced people of colour in coastal America – hope is not even on the horizon. When survival is your number one priority, the future you need to solve is today. Hope is a luxury. But we want to know everything will be OK. Ours is a techno-optimistic society where electric cars are touted as a solution. That addiction to optimism has made the climate movement increasingly distrustful of hope. “I don’t think hope is a super motivating emotion,” says Heglar, who feels environmentalism has over-relied on it. “I think anger drives you to action, but hope puts you back to sleep.” This is something I can relate to. If I believe falling solar panel prices and new international agreements will carry the day on their own, why should I bother to cut my own carbon footprint? Heglar and others are warning against this unfounded, passive hope. “We need courage, not hope,” writes Nasa scientist Dr Kate Marvel. Grounding hope Despite this, the search for hope still has an extraordinary pull. Because we often use hope and optimism interchangeably, scholars have come up with another distinction that is perhaps easier for dinner-table conversations. “There are different kinds of hope, because hope is a very complicated emotion,” says Jennifer Marlon, a climate researcher at Yale. Her team surveyed hundreds of Americans about climate change and came up with a two-type taxonomy: false and constructive hope. People who rely on false hope believe God or nature will make this problem go away, and that humanity need not take the lead. People who adopted a mindset of constructive hope, in contrast, believe that transformation must emerge from us. But on climate change, automatically expecting a better world because society acts in a certain way isn’t enough. We defeated Nazism, eradicated polio and reversed the hole in the ozone layer, right? Why not climate change? Because it’s not that simple, writes Norwegian psychologist Per Espen Stoknes. Overestimating society’s powers can be as dangerous as false hope, because we start telling Disney-like stories in the midst of a global crisis. “[We expect] Star Wars’ sixth movie, where the little bears [ewoks] show up and together we defeat the evil empire,” he says. His antidote is healthy skepticism. Stoknes argues we should settle our hope in our values – in what we believe is right and needed. Our actions can’t be based on the expectations of a happy ending. That outcome is outside of our control. If emissions keep rising, we risk deflation and action can dry up. Our values, however, persist. This view of grounded hope embraces the unknowns and accepts uncertainty as the natural habitat of hope. “You’re no longer dependent or addicted to optimism,” says Stoknes. “You can be pessimistic and yet full of hope.” Hoping together In her 2004 essay The Art of Good Hope, Princeton philosopher Victoria McGeer brushes away both wishful thinking and wilful stubborn determination. She warns that wishful hopers depend on external forces, while wilful hopers overestimate their own powers. One pathway she suggests is to balance these extremes through communities. Our earliest lessons of hope and agency were provided by our parents, our very first clan. With them we learned that we can walk, read, ride a bicycle or swim ten feet. But learning to hope as adults in our increasingly individualistic societies requires new scaffolding, argues McGeer. It involves empowering ourselves in part through empowering others with the energy of a responsive hope. In this way, hope is a deeply social phenomenon.  “If you’re feeling hopeless about climate change, get involved with people who are actively involved in doing things,” says McGeer. One of the most visible groups at the moment are school strikers. Even adults are rallying around them in search of hope. Atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe was asked what gave her hope so frequently that she decided to start polling the audience at her talks with the same question. Six months and 500 responses later, the top answer was young people. In some cases, the drive to praise youth activism might be a case of “scrolling for hope”, which comes with the risk of falling back into passivity. But Hayhoe believes those already engaged see youths as fellow comrades, not as others to lay the burden onto. “When you see a new voice enter the arena you don’t put down your sword. “You say: ‘Oh, my goodness, there’s a little bit of help’,” says Hayhoe. Those already engaged are not leaving the burden to the kids, they're “redoubling their efforts because of the children.” Personally, I would not call myself hopeful. “There’s so much science and so little will,” read my final dispatch from my first climate conference, six years ago. Not much has improved since 2013. Writing about the climate crisis often seems futile. I’m guessing the same goes for forest firefighters, flood planners at coastal cities and progressive lawmakers. But after reading and talking about hope for months, I have a different view. Hope hurts, and feels at times pointless, yet we have to keep doing it. It’s the only way. “Hope is meaning-focused coping,” says Maria Ojala, senior lecturer in psychology at Örebro University in Sweden who did her PhD in how hope and doubt permeate kids’ environmentalism. She believes positive and negative emotions about climate change are not mutually exclusive. “It’s ‘and’ instead of ‘or’,” says Ojala. No individual will bend the emissions curve alone. No writer, modelling team, no forest firefighter, no environmental lawyer will carry the day. But if you’re looking for hope, there might be a space in constructing something together – in responsive hope. No single coral restoration programme will heal the wounds inflicted on reefs around the world, but perhaps networks offer a way forward. That collective goal, and the space of uncertainty in that “perhaps”, is our hope.    -- Climate Emotions Climate change is harming the planet, and it may be harming our mental health too.

Sentiment on Bond Prices,Theatre critics say Sarah Jessica Parker is a revelation,2024-09-14,2024-01-29,By Steven McIntosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68126714,"Theatre critics have largely praised Sarah Jessica Parker's performance in a new West End production, although some were less keen on the play itself. The Sex and the City Star is starring opposite her husband Matthew Broderick in Neil Simon's 1968 play Plaza Suite. The Telegraph said Parker supplied ""terrific entertainment value"" in its four-star review. Speaking backstage, Parker said the themes of the three-act play about relationships are ""universal"". Parker and Broderick play three different sets of couples, linked only by the fact that they all stay in suite 719 in New York's Plaza Hotel. The first act examines a marriage in trouble, the second sees two childhood sweethearts reunite two decades after they separated, and the third sees two parents dealing with a daughter who has locked herself in the bathroom on her wedding day. Asked why the play had endured for more than five decades, Parker told BBC News: ""I think it's the portraits of these relationships which are not necessarily going to have to be familiar,  ""There are these illustrations of affection, disappointment, whimsy, chaos, absurdity, that are just kind of universal. Even if it's not your generation or culturally what you connect to, I think Neil Simon is such a master, such a skilled writer that you don't have to know it to enjoy it."" Broderick added: ""In a sentimental age, for most American stage actors, to get to work in the West End is a ball, it's very exciting for us."" There were many more stars in attendance on Sunday, with Bill Nighy, Hannah Waddingham, Ralph Fiennes, Sheridan Smith, Martin Freeman, David Tennant and James McAvoy all seen in the audience. Much of the press coverage has focused on the ticket prices for the show, which is playing at the Savoy, with seats selling for up to £300 and packages including champagne and other extras for £395. ""While it might be a stretch to say she's worth every penny of the full price, she's terrific entertainment value,"" said the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. ""Parker offers immaculate room service as she delivers polished rounds of rueful wisecracks."" The casting of the real-life married couple, Cavendish said, meant that ""what the duo bring to the table as acting pros is augmented, in teasing theory, by a marital bond that goes back to 1997"". All three of the vignettes ""have a deeply jaundiced view of male and particularly female behaviour beneath their smooth surfaces"", noted Sarah Crompton of WhatsOnStage in a three-star review. ""Yet Parker's honesty, her vigour, and her pure gift for comedy both physical and verbal, disguise some of their obvious shortcomings. She's a revelation."" The Times' Clive Davis awarded the production four stars, writing: ""Are the VIPs any good? The audience at the performance I saw had already made up its mind on that score, breaking into prolonged applause, Broadway-style, when they made their entrances in the first instalment."" He continued: ""It's good to see Simon's name back in lights in the West End. Plaza Suite, which consists of three miniatures set in the same room of the landmark hotel, doesn't rank among his best work, but it still bears the stamp of a craftsman who knew all about the underrated art of making people laugh."" However, the Guardian's Arifa Akbar was less enthusiastic, describing the production as a ""celebrity circus"". ""Even costume changes get audience oohs and aahs,"" she noted. ""It seems oddly disproportionate because, as exciting as it may be to see Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw on stage, the production is flat and forgettable, not testing either actor's seasoned skills on the boards (though this is Parker's debut in the West End). ""Under the direction of John Benjamin Hickey, it feels strangely like Parker and Broderick are saying lines rather than assuming roles... The production seems effectively to coast on the fame of its two stars.  She concluded: ""What a low, lazy bar to set at such a high price (some premium ""package"" seats have reportedly sold for £395). Times are tough for the arts but commercial theatre can surely be braver than this."" There was a middling review from the Financial Times' Sarah Hemming, who said the main draw of the play was the ""evident bond between Parker and Broderick as they play out multiple variations of marital misery"". ""Parker, in particular, is a joy, bringing zest, precise detail and sharp comic timing to her characters,"" she said in her three-star review. ""But it's not quite enough to blow the dust off the play and its creakily dated depiction of the sexes.  ""More than 50 years on, the comedy has aged; each act, though short, feels overextended, while the scenes never really explore the loneliness and pain that can lurk beneath the comedy."" Time Out's Andrzej Lukowski described it as ""a dated production of a dated play"" which ""would almost certainly never have been revived were it not for the attachment of the two leads"". ""Parker may not be the actress to find depth in this script, but she has an effervescent lightness of touch that leavens the stodginess of the writing - she is always watchable and winsome,"" he said. In a four-star review, the Evening Standard Nick Curtis said: ""John Benjamin Hickey's Broadway production is like a vintage Rolls Royce: stately, old-fashioned, expensive. But it's carrying two stars who can actually act. ""Plaza Suite is pretty much sold out because people will pay for sensational event theatre and the chance to see a star in the flesh, especially one this consistently fascinating. If you can afford it, Sarah Jessica Parker - with Broderick as Ken to her Barbie - is worth it."" Adam Bloodworth of City AM expressed a similar sentiment, commenting: ""You don't need a more intelligent reason to go to the theatre than to see your favourite celeb, and thank goodness these two explode with chemistry."" He described the show as ""a joyous night at the theatre"" in which ""Sarah Jessica Parker reveals a talent for slapstick comedy that she kept quiet on Sex and the City"". In another interview with BBC Radio 4's Front Row, the two actors said they were pleased to have received similarly warm responses from theatregoers in London.  Broderick said: ""They've been really demonstrative, something has happened to Great Britain, [audiences] are no longer as reserved."" ""I think we were prepared for them to be really good listeners, which they've proven to be,"" added Parker. ""But they are equally affectionate, I think that's really buoyed us.  She continued: ""I was really nervous because we'd had this experience in New York and you have a volume in your head, and you can adjust, and we were prepared to do so. But they've been such a good companion and partner for us."" Parker and Broderick are ""certainly competent, with all the accomplished comic timing and cunningly deployed, tongue-in-cheek charm that their screen work promises,"" according to Sam Marlowe of the Stage. ""But there's a grating, over-deliberate quality here, every gag, tic, cocked eyebrow and wry intonation arriving bang on cue without the faintest scintilla of spontaneity. It's nowhere near enough to lend substance to Simon's overstretched writing."" Her two-star review concluded: ""Everything unravels pretty much as you would expect, with tawdry infidelities, saucy indiscretions and artful zingers: it's a theatrical museum piece, barely in working order, dusty and decidedly creaky. Still, no one's really here for the play."" Fiona Mountford of iNews also awarded it just two stars, writing: ""Unfortunately, an inert production manages to make both marriage and comedy appear a relentlessly joy-free trudge, despite the sparkling star wattage of real-life married couple Sarah Jessica Parker, making her West End debut, and Matthew Broderick.  ""I could not wait to check out of Plaza Suite."" Plaza Suite runs at London's Savoy Theatre until 13 April. Listen to Parker and Broderick on Front Row on BBC Sounds."
Sentiment on Bond Prices,Arsenal: Why the hearts of Dial Square FC fans still sing for the club across town,2024-09-14,2023-02-17,Daniel Gallan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64641090,"Fans of Dial Square have broken away from Arsenal, but ties remain It's the most important league match the Emirates Stadium has ever staged but Stuart Morgan, an Arsenal season ticket holder, is 24 miles away in the town of Chertsey. He's sipping a lager beneath the low ceiling of a modest clubhouse. The TV broadcasting Arsenal's game against Manchester City produces a tinny sound. He's living every kick of the ball, nodding his head as if he was on the end of a Gabriel Martinelli cross. But he's a long way from the action. He's gifted his usual seat, to the right of the goal at the Clock End, to a mate. It's a staggering situation. Cut this man open and he'll bleed every shade of red the Arsenal have ever worn and yet he has willingly passed on the opportunity to watch Mikel Arteta's side take on Erling Haaland, Kevin de Bruyne and the rest under lights. Why? ""I wanted to make sure I told the full story of Dial Square FC,"" he says, around half an hour before kick-off.  ""It's important we tell the story properly."" The start of this tale is debatable. Some believe it begins with the formation of Dial Square Football Club in 2020 after a group of Arsenal fans, led by Morgan, became disaffected with the way the north London club was run. Others argue the story's first lines were written in 2018 when the American billionaire Stan Kroenke became the outright owner of Arsenal.  Perhaps we need to go back further to 2006 and the demolition of Highbury, or to the banning of standing terraces in 1994, or whenever half-and-half scarves were first spotted outside football grounds.   Stuart Morgan led a fans' breakaway from Arsenal in 2020 ""Something has happened in the modern elite game that just doesn't sit right with a lot of fans,"" Morgan says. ""There's this feeling in your gut, it's deep inside you, that you know isn't right. ""It's the money. It's the greed. It's the way fans are treated as customers. We're made to feel that the only reason we exist is to spend more money.  ""A lot has changed and it's not all for the good. The club badge, the stadium, ticket prices, there seems to be a new kit every other week. It's not the Arsenal I fell in love with.  ""So, rather than just mope about it, I decided to do something."" Morgan, who works in the construction industry, has experience in non-league football administration. He held a director's role at Camberley Town in 2016 and helped steer the club to the semi-final of the FA Vase that year.  That gave him the confidence to branch out on his own. So too did the fortunes of AFC Wimbledon and FC United of Manchester, two clubs that sprung from the disenchantment of fans eager for a greater voice in how their teams were run. Dial Square was the original name of Arsenal Football club, coined by munitions factory workers in Woolwich, south-east London in 1886.  A month later they rebranded as Royal Arsenal and did so again in 1893 when they became Woolwich Arsenal. The club crossed the river to north London in 1913. Morgan's long-term plan is to find a permanent home for Dial Square as close to the founding factory in Woolwich as possible. For now they are tenants at Alwyns Lane, the home of Chertsey Football Club.  Dial Square, in red, are in the 12th tier, 11 below Arsenal Four days before Arsenal's game against Manchester City, Dial Square are hosting Lightwater United Football Club under grey Surrey skies. The players wear deep burgundy shirts with matching socks and white shorts. The club's badge is predominantly occupied by a sundial signifying a 'new dawn'. A banner below contains the Latin word renascitur, meaning reborn. On either side are two acorns, both a symbol of a new beginning as well as a nod to the Royal Oak pub where Morgan's idea first took root. Dial Square dominate the game. Morgan is a whir of activity. He's constantly on his phone as he updates chat forums and the club's social media channels. They now have over 4,000 followers on Twitter with fans in Norway, New Zealand, Germany and the United States. There are about 50 people in attendance at Alwyns Lane. It's a sizeable number for a match in Division One of the Surrey County Intermediate League (Western) - the 12th tier of English football. Almost all of them share the same split allegiance - they are also fans of Arsenal. ""I'll always be an Arsenal fan,"" says Dave Nathan, whose great-grandfather was a groundsman at Highbury in the 1920s. His grandmother washed the Arsenal players' kit on an iron washboard behind the North Bank stand, previously known as the Laundry End.  ""I wonder if that's because of my nan,"" Nathan says, just as Dial Square's towering centre-back Adam Sewell sweeps home the game's opener. ""I could have been born in Timbuktu and I'd still have been given a red and white scarf for Christmas. Arsenal is in my DNA."" Nathan says that going to football ""used to be a feeling"". He speaks of an idyllic setting where ""it didn't matter how much money you had in the bank, all that mattered was you became part of the Arsenal. ""Now I feel that too many people in the Emirates see their ticket as a status symbol. And I'm not going to criticise anyone for going. But personally I feel that it's changed too much. The atmosphere is so quiet. It's missing that magic, that sense of community that I had before.  ""I wondered if I'd ever get that back. I travelled around the country and did the 92, which for me meant I went to every ground that had a turnstile and charged you a fee for a ticket for a game of football. ""And as I went down the pyramid there's a stronger connection between the club and the fans. They appreciate every penny you give them."" But no other club could scratch that itch. So Nathan returned to the Emirates. ""It was the game where Andy Carroll out-jumped Manuel Almunia, external [in 2010 when Newcastle won 1-0],"" Nathan says. ""I'd tried to get my partner's son to the game but there were no tickets, which was a shame. So I went myself. ""But when I was there I saw so many empty seats. Members who just decided they didn't fancy it. Or corporate types who were not interested. World War Three could have started on the pitch and these boys in suits in the stands, on their phones, chat chatting to each other, wouldn't have noticed.  ""Then they left 20 minutes before the game was over. I was fuming. My step-son could have been there. ""My dad, who was ex-military, raised me to do things 'the Arsenal way', as he'd say. I thought, 'This isn't the Arsenal way. They've lost the Arsenal way'. I've been looking for something like [Dial Square] ever since. What we've got here is special."" Dial Square have a corner and, after a few scrappy touches from both teams, Sewell nods in his second. At the other end, behind Dial Square goalkeeper Aaron Bufton, hang two large banners. One reads 'Created by the poor. Stolen by the Rich'. Another displays the hashtag #KeepGreedOutOfFootball. ""It's really that simple,"" explains Andreas Charalambous, a lecturer at the University Campus of Football Business located at Wembley Stadium.  ""People might think we have a hidden agenda. We're doing things right. I came here to feel like a comrade, not a customer."" Charalambous also serves as the chairman of Dial Square FC Enterprise (DSFCE), which owns 15% of the club. The remaining 85% is currently owned by Morgan, though his aim is to loosen his hold over time and give full control to DSFCE. DSFCE is comprised of members, not shareholders, who each spend £90 a year to join as a 'full fan owner'. They have equal voting rights and every member is encouraged to voice their opinion concerning the day-to-day running of the club. Dave Nathan's family connections to Arsenal go back generations ""All anyone wants is to feel like they have a say, that what they say matters,"" Morgan adds. ""When you come here you feel empowered. You actually matter. You can't underestimate how significant that is for football fans."" When asked how he feels about Arsenal today, Morgan takes a beat. Usually he's a torrent of words as his lips move faster than Bukayo Saka's feet. You can see that this is a question he's still grappling with. ""To be honest, it's love-hate,"" he says. ""When I go to the ground, I try to put these things to the back of my mind.  ""Do I feel guilty at all? Maybe a little. But I go to watch my football club. The football club I've always watched and loved. The owners will come and go. Kroenke will one day sell the club for a profit. I'll still be there. ""And we encourage people to continue to support Arsenal. It's never been an either-or thing. We're not black and white. We'd never tell anyone that they have to choose. We have Dial Square fans come down wearing Arsenal shirts and that's great. You can't turn off the tap. Supporting Arsenal, it's in the body, it's in your blood."" For Marc Brewer, who first attended a game at Highbury back in the 1970s as an eight-year-old, this is especially true.  His left forearm is inked with Arsenal's name in the classic gothic font. His right is a canvas for the old crest - the one with the white markings like tiny Christmas trees and the more realistic looking cannon. Brewer's devotion is more than skin deep. His oldest son is named James Charles Paul Merson Brewer. His second son is named Mathew Joseph Ian Wright Brewer. When his daughter was born he kept the tradition going and called her Hollie-Ann Manu Petit Louise Brewer. ""They're mouthfuls,"" he says of his kids' names, ""but it shows how much I love Arsenal."" Brewer, Dial Square's secretary who also sits on DSFCE's board of directors, has been to the Emirates twice, but felt hollow on both occasions. He can't recall who Arsenal were playing. ""It didn't leave an impression,"" he says. If Brewer is jaded, it's easy to understand why. A week after he inked the club's crest on his arm it changed to its current iteration. Softer lines, brighter colours, more in keeping with modern aesthetics.  ""What was the point?"" Brewer asks. ""It's like change for change's sake. It's weird. I can't relate to it any more. ""It's painful. It really is. It feels like I've lost something. I can't stop watching though. I'll always want Arsenal to win, but that feeling of connection is gone.  ""So I joined Dial Square. And starting at this low level, to be on the journey from the start, that's something that is really appealing to me."" That sentiment is echoed by both fans and players. The club captain, 34-year-old Eddie McKinlay, knows that his hopes of playing at a higher level are over. But he recognises that he has the chance to establish a legacy at a club with great ambitions. ""This current group has a chance to do something genuinely amazing,"" he says after his team completes a 4-1 win. ""In 10 or 20 years we can look back and say: 'We were there at the start. We helped make this happen.' Not every club can offer that."" Morgan is steadfast in where this start leads. His aim is to oversee Dial Square's entry into the Football League within 10 years. ""When we started we set ourselves the target of getting to step six [tier 10] by the end of our fifth season,"" he says. ""If we get promoted this year, which we will, and get promoted again next year, we'd have got there with a year to spare."" At the moment, the project is funded by members' contributions, Morgan's pocket - he estimates he puts in £3,000 a year - a loan from a director and a sponsorship deal with a wealth management company. The online club shop has brought in £8,000, with products that trade on Arsenal's past and Dial Square's present. Beanies are especially popular. The yellow away strip that mirrors Arsenal's 1971 Double-winning team sold out in no time. ""As we climb the ladder we'll attract more interest,"" says Morgan. ""We'll attract more fans that will show support for our project by purchasing our shirts. We'll get more sponsors and sell more shirts and more players will want to join. The only way is up."" Dial Square's win over Lightwater lifts them to second in the league. Four days on, just as Arsenal's players are going through their warm-up on the clubhouse screen, news filters through of Dial Square's own title race. They have been awarded a further three points for a previously cancelled game. Now they're two points off the league leaders, Laleham and Kempton FC, with a game in hand. Some of Dial Square fans watched Arsenal's defeat to Manchester City from their new club's home It doesn't go as well for Arsenal. De Bruyne's superb opener is cancelled out by a Saka penalty, but it's one-way traffic in the second half. City's better-stocked bench makes the difference as Jack Grealish and then Haaland score to secure a 3-1 win. Morgan, Nathan, Brewer and the rest inside Chertsey's clubhouse are crestfallen at the final whistle. They soon dust themselves off, but for a few fleeting moments, they're just as emotionally invested as they were when this bond was first forged in childhood. Those old threads still hold strong.  Even after the commercial tie-ups and cash-ins, after the Super League splits and Wenger Out rifts, after the metamorphosis from a local club to a global conglomerate, their heart strings still sing for the club across town. ""That will never change,"" Morgan says. ""Hopefully one day people will feel the same way about Dial Square"".

Sentiment on Bond Prices,ECB says no quick end to stimulus,2024-09-14,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has insisted there is still a long way to go before it can call a halt to its economic stimulus programme. ECB president Mario Draghi threw cold water on speculation that the bank might wind the programme down soon. The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: ""After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective.  ""The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it."" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'"" However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""

However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""
Sentiment on Bond Prices,The album that shook the world,2024-09-14,2021-09-23,Arwa Haider,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210922-nevermind-at-30-how-the-nirvana-album-shook-the-world,"Nirvana's Nevermind – which was released 30 years ago – offered a subversive outlet for a global audience, writes Arwa Haider, who discovers its impact on people from countries including Brazil, Poland and Japan. Thirty years after its release, Seattle rock trio Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind retains an evocative power. When I hear its opening notes, I'm rocketed back to a teenage house party in suburban London; in that darkened parlour, I could feel guitars and machines fighting for my soul. I was thrilled by Nevermind's sounds, but as a young music obsessive (who also happened to be a Muslim female Iraqi Brit), I felt sidelined by the press coverage around the record, and Seattle's burgeoning ""grunge"" scene; mainstream perspectives seemed overwhelmingly blokey, homogenously white and insular – at odds with Nirvana themselves, particularly their culturally inquisitive, masculine/feminine frontman Kurt Cobain. As Nevermind hits its 30th anniversary, I was curious to discover how the album personally affected fans and musicians around the world. These varied global exchanges (much aided by modern tech) reinforced Nevermind's classic album status; like all great pop culture, it fires shots across distance and time. More like this:  - An anthem that stuns each new generation  - Our most misunderstood love song?  - The music that won't be silenced While I discovered Nevermind in early-'90s London, Mahdis Keshavarz was a 15-year-old Iranian-American riot grrrl living in Seattle. Keshavarz is now a NYC-based media strategist, human rights activist and founder of media firm The Make Agency, but back then, she was booking indie gigs at the Old Fire House Teen Centre in Redmond, near Seattle: a pioneering city initiative where youth were enabled to reclaim and run community space. She was already familiar with Nirvana; some time before, a schoolfriend had handed her a tape by his cousin Kurt, who'd been crashing in his basement (""It was a black cassette tape with the title 'Bleach' [Nirvana's first album] in white-out [pen]. I listened, and it was just bonkers and really cool,"" she smiles). Keshavarz describes the transformative atmosphere of the Old Fire House (""We got to use that space as young people wanted, so invariably it became a political space, a music space, a gathering space""); it was also frequented by varied musicians, including members of Dinosaur Jr, riot grrrl pioneers Bikini Kill, Chris Cornell, and Cobain. ""We were so righteous in our punk rock-ness; the music was special, but it was also a philosophy: wanting to be radical feminists, carving out a space for ourselves in a time that was so predominantly male, also teaching men how to be feminists and allies. Kurt was one of them,"" says Keshavarz. ""For me, being a woman of colour and a Muslim woman was both profoundly alienating and also a path to finding a space. At high school, there was no space to be subversive. Punk rock was where I felt most at home."" When Nirvana released Nevermind in September 1991 (on major label Geffen, following the band's emergence on Seattle indie SubPop), the album's explosive success followed a European tour and proved a shock to the mainstream system (Geffen president Ed Rosenblatt described it as ""one of those 'get out of the way and duck' records""). Back on the Seattle DIY scene, the mood was less celebratory: ""My memory of Nevermind is that it felt like a betrayal,"" says Keshavarz. ""People were protective because Nirvana were representative of a community and so many ideas. In retrospect, I have great sympathy for the band, because I think they legitimately made beautiful music that touched people's hearts. In fact, I remember visiting Iran soon after Nevermind came out, and smuggling in tapes to play to friends and relatives; you'd see their faces, like: 'What is this? It's kinda cool… can I get a copy?' ""But within Seattle at the time, people were super-upset; it was that DIY ethic that believed you couldn't achieve liberation through a major label. We knew rents and ticket prices would go up, and we were really protective of our spaces. Kurt would often turn up at the Old Fire House and just be quiet in a corner; he was a gentle soul, and everybody loved him – yet sometimes, he wouldn't be welcome, depending on who was playing, because the anger levels were high. That must have been hurtful."" Global reverberations Nevermind has reportedly sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the biggest albums in music history. It also arguably forged a kind of globalised youth culture, fuelled by the increasing reach of MTV (which had its videos, including Smells Like Teen Spirit, on heavy rotation). Brazilian cultural studies academic Moyses Pinto, now a professor at Lutheran University in Porto Alegre, was struck by Nevermind's initial release when he was 11. ""I thought: 'this is perfect'; it sounded like a bright synthesis of noise and pop music,"" he says. Neto points out that Brazil's military dictatorship (1964-1985) inspired many rebellious musicians, including pysch-rockers Os Mutantes (one of Cobain's favourite bands). The end of the dictatorship extended the range of rock, punk and post-punk sounds in Brazil, though Neto describes a ""time lag"" between international influences, before the age of Nevermind: ""We had punks in Brazil, but almost a decade after their peak in the UK and US – and there was '80s pop culture and mainstream arena bands,"" says Neto. ""But the impact of Nirvana and MTV made it synchronised; a new youth – including me – began to hear the same music, and wear the same styles; there was a cultural homogeneity probably never experienced before. Grunge culture became dominant very quickly; all that had been 'cool' suddenly became ugly and exaggerated, and Kurt was the symbol of transgression."" Another Porto Alegre kid in '91, Rogerio Maia Garcia, was intrigued by Nevermind's ""swimming baby"" vinyl artwork (the album arguably heralded an era of visual iconography, as well as musical influence), right before the music captivated him: ""We were all listening to rock and metal, but Nevermind sounded totally different – like 'normal kids' playing at home: raw, and really loud,"" says Garcia. ""It certainly opened our ears to the grunge scene; after Nevermind, bands like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam became well known in Brazil, and many kids started learning to play; in early '90s Porto Alegre, live music had been losing out to dance music, but suddenly there were local band gigs every night."" He adds that established Brazilian bands such as Titas also incorporated the influence, working with Seattle producer Jack Endino for their own album Titanomaquia (1993).   Garcia grew up to be a criminal lawyer rather than a full-time musician, but he remains an ardent Nirvana fan: ""In my mind, Nevermind's legacy can't be separated from Kurt Cobain's last years of life [Cobain was just 27 when he took his own life in 1994],"" says Garcia. ""I later realised that his voice expressed a sad violence and emptiness over life experiences; songs like Lithium took a new perspective. I think Nevermind expressed the feelings and fears that any teen goes through, from my generation in Brazil to now."" A blend of political revolution and personal revelation also brought young music student Grzegorz Kwiatkowski (now vocalist and guitarist for acclaimed Gdansk indie rockers Trupa Trupa) to Nevermind: ""We're talking about Poland in 1991, only a few moments after defeating the communist system, and the beginning of the democratic system, which brought not only cynical capitalistic stuff from the West but super high-quality stuff – like Nirvana and Nevermind,"" says Kwiatkowski. ""For Polish teenagers, MTV was a signal that we are part of international youth."" Kwiatkowski grew up listening to everything from Schubert to The Beatles, and saw Nevermind as a natural progression: ""Very beautiful, very simple songs; the perfect combination of killer sound and great singer-songwriting"". His own band would sign a worldwide deal with Seattle institution Sub Pop in 2019; Trupa Trupa continue to create original, expansive music while crediting their early inspirations. ""In my opinion, Nirvana and Nevermind are still the symbols of freedom and normality,"" says Kwiatkoswki. ""Not unreal superstardom, but something 'regular', and at the same time, great."" English remains the lingua franca of pop culture (for now), and Nevermind has inspired countless international covers. Jamaican reggae artist Little Roy released an album of reggae-fied Nirvana covers (Battle for Seattle, 2011); Brazilian tropicalia star Caetano Veloso would rework Come as You Are; Indian hard rockers Pentagram (fronted by film music composer Vishal Dadlani) would add Nirvana covers to their live sets. Japanese music journalist Hiroko Shintani was immersed in international alt-music scenes in 1991, and already knew Nirvana's Bleach album – but couldn't initially believe Nevermind was by the same band: ""My first reaction was: 'What's happened to them?!' – in a positive sense,"" says Shintani. ""I was more shocked by the fact Nevermind went on to become such a cultural landmark, and sell that many copies. But what I admired was the innate pop sensibility that cuts through the musical style and the irony of these songs about Kurt Cobain's discomfort; his alienation from the mainstream ended up being shared by millions of people, thanks to that sensibility. ""I remember the thrill of hearing such a raw and vulnerable male voice on mainstream radio and MTV. Kurt sang: 'Never met a wise man/ If so, it's a woman' [on the album track Territorial Pissings]. That in itself was phenomenal."" Shintani notes that while Japan produced numerous home-grown rock bands in the late-'80s/early-'90s, that era's mainstream artists weren't necessarily driven by angst or social rebellion. ""Remember, Japan was enjoying 'bubble economy' until the early '90s, and our 'Generation X' grew up in a relatively prosperous time,"" she says. ""But obviously, Nevermind's legacy lived on, and I think it had much larger influence among bands that came out during 2000-2010."" Indeed, 2012 saw the release of a compilation album, Nevermind Tribute, where a new generation of Japanese bands covered Nevermind's track-listing, in sequence.   Another artist who discovered Nevermind after its original release is Istanbul-based singer-songwriter and visual artist Gaye Su Akyol. She's widely praised for her fearless, politically-charged expressions (including latest album, Istikarli Hayal Hakikattir), and she cites Nevermind as a formative inspiration – it was 1995, she was at primary school, and she found her brother's cassette album in their mother's car. ""I remember hearing Nevermind for the first time; it was groundbreaking!"" says Akyol, adding that she badgered her brother with questions about Nirvana, learning how Kurt had died. ""Probably to protect me from admiring that, my brother told me: 'He had everything: fame, money, love, but he chose to die'. I was confused and unsatisfied; I was looking at the cover art, the band's photos inside. ""I felt lucky to discover a treasure, and also remember feeling: 'this is exactly what I need!' I always had a rebellious and disobedient spirit. I was looking for a different way to express my feelings, and Nevermind caught me instantly; it opened the doors of rock'n'roll to me."" Akyol still describes Nevermind as a ""homecoming"" album; she has held onto the original cassette, though is now equally likely to listen to it on vinyl or digitally: ""The intimate relationship I had with it is always alive, and it's a 'safe space' where I can breathe."" Nevermind made ""outsider"" spirit feel like a unifying experience, on a massive scale. This also struck a chord with Mpumi Mcata, co-founder of brilliantly sharp Johannesburg rockers BLK JKS; in the early '90s, Mcata had left high school to pursue his band dreams, and first heard Nevermind while working in a music shop. ""As a black boy growing up in post-apartheid South Africa, it's safe to say that what Nirvana were proposing was not what you'd expect to hear anywhere near me – but it cut through: the raw energy, the honesty,"" says Mcata. ""Nirvana's general 'Come as You Are' ethos definitely resonated with me; it came across as simply doing what they wanted to do, or just what they could... and they still gave everyone, from limo-crashing hair metal rockers to Michael Jackson, a run for their money. This, and Kurt's politics. In my band, BLK JKS, we see more value in disrupting than in fitting in, but it's not always easy; having beacons like Nirvana is a blessing."" In 2009, Nirvana's former drummer, Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl told Rolling Stone magazine that BLK JKS's debut album After Robots was one of his favourite records that year; in 2014, Grohl invited BLK JKS to open for Foo Fighters on their South African tour. Mcata recalls watching Foo Fighters' sets from backstage, and feeling fired up for BLK JKS's second album (Abantu/Before Humans, released this year): ""I thought about brother Dave Grohl's career after Nirvana… how incredible it was to watch them in that stadium! Then I listened back to Nevermind; it was a kick in the backside – get back in the studio, and do it for the love of music!"" Back in the US, Keshavarz (who had also helped to put on Foo Fighters' first gig in '95) now credits former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic for helping to preserve Seattle's all-ages music scene – and she listens to Nevermind with her seven-year-old son. ""There's something about that music and moment that really speaks to the frustration and anger that you feel as young people,"" says Keshavarz. ""I also think that now that frustration with government and 'The Man' is so much more prevalent in our lives, that the message of Nevermind is maybe stronger. More people listen to its sentiment, and realise that Nirvana were using the music industry as a vehicle to push back.""

Sentiment on Bond Prices,Asia markets drop sharply after US falls,2024-09-14,2018-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42998819,"Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street. In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.3%, while China's Shanghai Composite slumped by 4.1%.  Earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week. Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.8% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.9%. Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors.  On Thursday, the Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%. European exchanges also headed south on Thursday.  China was the worst performer in Asia on Friday as losses deepened from declines seen earlier this week.  Chinese stock markets tend to be volatile and are dominated by retail investors, rather than big institutions like many other major markets.  But falls in China can spark nervousness around the world over sentiment in the world's second largest economy.  As well as the broader sell-off, analysts said stocks in China were weighed down by people selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is a common trend as the need for cash grows during this period - a time when Chinese companies typically pay bonuses and people also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted the pull-back from stocks.  On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates are on the up. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was a government budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. And more turbulence could be on the way.  ""The return of volatility after two relatively calm days supports the idea there are further losses to come in the days and weeks ahead,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy.  The chaotic week on global markets also comes as several markets around the world sit on, or near record highs.  Analysts have said for months that financial markets were due a correction, after a long period of rising prices. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Fidelity International's chief investment officer for Japan, Takashi Maruyama, said the ""massive volatility"" was a reaction to the rapid rise on the Japanese market since last year.  He added the sell-off presented a opportunity to buy shares at more ""reasonable"" prices. "
Sentiment on Bond Prices,The young Singaporeans leaving the nest,2024-09-14,2022-06-24,Samantha HuiQi Yow,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220622-the-young-singaporeans-striking-out-on-their-own,"Most young, single Singaporeans live with their parents. But some are moving into their own places as social norms evolve. When Alan, a civil servant, decided to move out of his family home in Singapore, it still took the 27-year-old another month to broach the topic with his parents. He feared they would not understand or, worse, get upset.  After all, Alan’s home was a pleasant place. The family’s three-bedroom condominium, where his younger brother also lived, wasn’t far from the city-state’s central business district (CBD), where many of his favourite haunts were. There was homemade dinner on the table each night, and his laundry was always done for him. “There wasn’t a push factor, just pull factors,” he says. “I’d lived with my parents my whole life, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like being by myself, you know?”  In the West, leaving home is just another milestone in adulthood. Yet in most Asian societies it is not as culturally accepted; moving out is sometimes perceived as showing disrespect to your parents. In Singapore, living at home until marriage is common practice; an estimated 97% of unmarried individuals between the ages of 15 and 34 lived with their parents in 2013.  While the trend is in part driven by ingrained ideas of filial piety, it’s also linked to government policies on accommodation for young people. Most Singaporeans – more than 80% as of 2022  – live in public housing units, apartments subsidised by the state that are known as HDBs (after the Housing Development Board). About 90% of those who live in HDBs own their home. But crucially, only married heterosexual couples – Singapore does not recognise same-sex marriages – and single individuals older than 35 can buy these public housing units.  Those who can’t buy HDBs can rent (or indeed buy) via the private property market – but costs are much higher. Calculations by research firm ValueChampion show the average price per square foot of a private-sector condominium is more than triple that of an HDB unit. These cost constraints, says Dr Chua Beng Huat, a professor of sociology at National University of Singapore (NUS), “effectively keep most young, unmarried people living at home with their parents”.  Yet Alan, who now rents a flat in Hougang, a neighbourhood in north-east Singapore away from the CBD, with two friends from junior college, is among a growing number of millennial and Gen Z Singaporeans bucking the long-time cultural norm. Some young people, for various reasons, are deciding that the price of independence is worth it – and striking out on their own.  ‘Literal space to grow into an adult’  In recent years, Singapore’s renting culture, previously mostly limited to expatriates, has taken root among locals. Despite climbing rental prices, the number of single Singaporean residents under 35 living alone or away from their parents more than doubled from 2015 to 2020.  Many more may be thinking about moving. One 2021 survey by local real estate portal PropertyGuru showed seven in 10 respondents between the ages of 22 and 39 were considering moving out. “Once you pass a certain age, it can become uncomfortable [to live with your parents] because the freedom of what you can do at home is restricted,” says Chua. Coupled with a lack of privacy, it’s a “difficult position” for an adult to be in. Family Tree This story is part of BBC's Family Tree series, which examines the issues and opportunities parents, children and families face today – and how they'll shape the world tomorrow. Find more on BBC Future. Like Alan, Brenda Tan didn’t feel a push factor when she moved out of her family home at 22 – but she certainly wanted more independence. She’d spent time in shared university dormitories and lived with housemates during a semester abroad in New York, but felt that the next step should be a solo space. “[Living with your parents can feel like] everything is on autopilot and done for you,” the content creator said in a video that chronicled her move into a studio apartment. “You’re not fully taking control of your space, or your diet sometimes… you just eat what’s on the table.”  Being on her own has allowed Tan, now 26, to take ownership of every aspect of her life, from choosing her preferred brands of household items to being able to work more creatively. “Moving out has made me grow up in a way that I truly enjoy. I feel like I’ve blossomed into myself. I have the literal space to grow into an adult.”  Of course, challenges linked to living with parents have always existed, as have young people’s aspirations for independence. But Chua believes the fact that the youngest generations are, on average, better educated, and thus higher earners, than previous generations plays a significant role. Census data from 2020 shows that 57% of residents between 25 and 34 were university graduates, up from 46.5% a decade ago, which already nearly doubled from 24.4% in 2000. Improved earning power, and perhaps changing spending priorities, have made it easier for young Singaporeans to move out and pay rent.  Another factor is that Singaporeans are getting married later in life. “Previously, many, if not most, of this age group would’ve been married,” says Chua, meaning that they would have qualified to buy an HDB. This is increasingly not the case, yet single young adults are also less willing to wait until marriage for a taste of independence.  This doesn’t mean filial piety is eroding, argues Chua. If anything, it’s the way of showing it that’s changing. Fellow NUS sociologist Dr Tan Ern Ser agrees, saying that while young people “have their own preferred lifestyle, which involves moving out of their parental home to live on their own or some other arrangements”, it doesn’t mean they care less about their parents. In fact, “living away from parents could be experienced as less stifling, and may paradoxically strengthen the parent-adult child bond”.  For some, push factors  While many of the nest-fleers will be independence-seekers like Alan and Brenda Tan, William Tan, an estate agent, has seen a rise in renting among one particular group: the LGBTQ community. Tan says that while the majority of potential tenants in the past were expatriates, he’s observed a shift. A Facebook group he set up for LGBTQ-friendly listings is seeing more requests from young Singaporeans. It’s hardly surprising; since housing policies greatly restrict options for the community, renting is more or less the only choice for under-35s seeking their own place. While Singapore’s society has made strides in destigmatising homosexuality, conservative values held by many still make it hard for some to be out. A 2018 survey found that six in 10 respondents believe gay marriage is always, or almost always, wrong. Another survey found that Singapore’s youth were less accepting of family members being in a same-sex relationship than friends or colleagues.  Tan believes that Covid-19 likely accelerated the desire to move out for many LGBTQ young people. “There possibly was a lot of conflict happening [in homes] because of the last two years working remotely,” he says. In his experience, “a lot of them [in the community] are trying to move out for their mental health, because maybe they come from a very toxic or unfriendly home environment”.  Push factors like a poor home environment are of course not limited to young people in the LGBTQ community. For those living in smaller-sized houses, or needing to share a bedroom, home can feel like a pressure cooker.  Jia lives in a two-bedroom HDB flat with her parents and older sister. After graduating from university amid the pandemic, she quickly found a trainee job. But working remotely was a “nightmare”. Her sister was doing the same and their online meetings sometimes clashed, resulting in a distracting environment. Her parents, she admits, are not on the best of terms – and being stuck indoors for long periods during lockdown meant verbal arguments grew frequent. “I can’t escape the noise because it’s a small space,” she says. “Sometimes I’d be speaking on a call and my parents would be shouting in the background.”  Jia mulled over moving out countless times. The thought of a quieter work and living space was tempting, but in the end practicality won out. For now, she’s decided that she’d rather save the bulk of her salary than spend it on rent. There was also another reason holding her back: “I think I would’ve felt super guilty leaving my parents behind.”  This doesn’t mean she rules the possibility out, especially since converting her traineeship into a full-time role now earns her about 50% more. But, ultimately, the deciding factor is still her parents. “Now that we’re all out of the house more, everyone’s in a better mood, it’s bearable,” she says. “But if things [between them] get really bad again like two years ago, I think I’m going to put myself first this time.” ‘Best money I’ve ever spent’  Singapore has built a successful housing model – one that’s widely and frequently praised. But, as recent subtle shifts show, the needs and aspirations of some young people may be changing.  Tweaking the public housing rules to make more low-cost accommodation available to young people could provide relief for many, especially marginalised groups. NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser suggests the public housing board could consider renting out unsold flats or building specially designed rental flats “to cater to young people who are assessed to need their own space”, arguing that current policies should “consider accommodating emerging patterns of preferred living arrangements among young Singaporeans… and seek to accommodate even those who fall outside the rules”.  Until then, if current trends continue, young Singaporeans leaving the nest to rent will become less taboo and more mainstream, driven by a prioritisation of their independence and wellbeing, and enabled by rising disposable incomes. Changing attitudes around what it means to be filial will also help young adults to leave their family homes.  Brenda Tan certainly doesn’t regret her decision – in fact, she feels surer about it than ever. Looking back, the pros she has experienced aren’t rooted just in a sense of freedom, but a sense of responsibility. “It’s the best money I’ve ever spent,” she says. “Living alone lets me recalibrate my emotions. That has been invaluable for me.”  Alan echoes the sentiment, even though his parents weren’t happy with his decision. “I think they took it personally, as if I was saying I hated living with them,” he recalls. They tried to dissuade him – but gave up when Alan’s resolve was clear.  Since moving out, his costs have risen significantly. He still gives his parents a monthly “allowance” of $287 (S$400, £237), something he’s done since earning his first full-time paycheck. He also pays more bills than before – such as groceries, utilities and his insurance payments which were all previously covered by his parents – as well as paying rent on his own shared place. But he considers the additional expenses a worthy trade-off for the independence he’s gained.  “I’m so much more in control of my life now,” he says. “You can’t put a price on that.”  Alan and Jia are using one name only for privacy reasons"
