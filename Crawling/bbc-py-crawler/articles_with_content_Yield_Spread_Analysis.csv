Yield Spread Analysis,Parasites and old clothes in North Korea trash balloons ,2024-09-14,2024-06-24,Tom McArthur,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj777rvym8eo,"Parasites from human waste and defaced Hello Kitty clothing have been found in bags of rubbish carried by North Korean balloons into South Korea, officials say. More than 1,500 waste-carrying balloons have been released by Pyongyang across the border since May, in retaliation for a leaflet campaign sent northwards by opponents of North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. Analysis of some of the balloon packages detected “roundworms, whipworms and threadworms"" in the soil.  The chance of infection from the parasites in the packages is low, South Korea’s ministry of unification assured people. Other items carried by the balloons included slashed “western” clothes that had been donated from the South - including items featuring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Hello Kitty characters, according to Reuters news agency. There were also socks, clothes and heavily patched-up children’s clothes.  The waste sent by North Korea also revealed the country's woeful economic state, and highlighted “the adversarial stance against South Korea"", a ministry official said. The soil was probably infected with the parasites because human faeces was used instead of chemical fertilisers in the North, the ministry added. North Korea says the balloons are retaliation for a propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and South Korean activists who regularly send balloons the other way, carrying food, medicine, cash and leaflets criticising the North’s regime.  The two Koreas have recently stepped up their cross-border tit-for-tat propaganda war. As the north sent trash floating southward, the south has also been blasting pop songs and news items over the border from powerful loudspeakers.  Monday saw another set of balloons sent across the border, with South Korean officials warning people to beware of falling objects. An activist in the South told the AFP news agency that he had this week floated more balloons carrying propaganda leaflets towards the north. South Korea's military recently cautioned the public against touching the white balloons and the plastic bags attached to them because they contain ""filthy waste and trash"". The recent raft of balloons began in May, when at least 260 balloons carrying rubbish dropped in South Korea, prompting authorities to warn its residents to stay indoors. In addition to anti-Pyongyang propaganda, activists in South Korea have previously launched balloons carrying items including cash, banned media content, and even Choco Pies - a South Korean snack banned in the North. In May, a South Korea-based activist group claimed it had sent 20 balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets and USB sticks containing Korean pop music and music videos across the border."
Yield Spread Analysis,Who should I vote for and what are the parties promising?,2024-09-14,2024-06-20,By the Visual Journalism team,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxeez8271nvo,"Polls open in the UK general election on Thursday - have you decided which party will get your vote? If not, this guide offers a summary of where the main parties stand on the issues most important to voters, based on the promises they have made during the campaign. Click on the drop-down list to select the nation, political parties and issues that interest you. A manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box. We have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"". ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster.

Yield Spread Analysis,Daniel Dennett: 'Civilisation is fragile',2024-09-14,2024-04-22,Tom Chatfield,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240422-philosopher-daniel-dennett-artificial-intelligence-consciousness-counterfeit-people,"Before his recent death, the influential philosopher Daniel Dennett spoke to the BBC about his lifelong quest to understand human experience – and why he saw new dangers from AI. The philosopher Daniel Dennett, who died at the age of 82 on 19 April, was among the sharpest and most prophetic minds of the last half-century. Throughout his life, he dared to tackle some of the biggest questions about the human mind and consciousness. His career saw him publish over a dozen books, make major contributions to fields ranging from cognitive science and philosophy of mind to evolutionary theory, and become an ardent advocate for rationality and scepticism. In December 2023, I spoke to him for several hours about his recent memoir, I've Been Thinking, as well as his life and work. He was still passionately engaged with the questions of truth, cognition and technological possibility that first fascinated him as a doctoral student at Oxford in the 1960s – and still willing to pick a fight in the service of rigorous thought. In particular, our conversation focused on the grave risks posed by artificial intelligence. His warning was not of a takeover by some superintelligence, but of a threat he believed that nonetheless could be existential for civilisation, rooted in the vulnerabilities of human nature. ""If we turn this wonderful technology we have for knowledge into a weapon for disinformation,"" he told me, ""we are in deep trouble."" Why? ""Because we won't know what we know, and we won't know who to trust, and we won't know whether we're informed or misinformed. We may become either paranoid and hyper-sceptical, or just apathetic and unmoved. Both of those are very dangerous avenues. And they're upon us."" Science fiction philosophy To understand Dennett's argument about AI – and what made him such a deep and original thinker – it's worth looking back to one his most unusual academic papers. In 1978, he published Where Am I?, which took the form of a science fiction short story featuring his own brain in a vat. ""Several years ago,"" the story begins, ""I was approached by Pentagon officials who asked me to volunteer for a highly dangerous and secret mission."" Thanks to an accident during a classified research project, a drilling device bearing an atomic warhead had got stuck a mile underground, beneath Tulsa, Oklahoma. They needed him to help retrieve it. More precisely, they needed his body. In order to avoid the neuron-damaging radiation being emitted by the device (plausibility isn't a necessary feature of philosophical science fiction), his brain would be surgically removed and hooked up by radio transceivers to his body. He could then remotely control it without risking exposure. The question behind Dennett's delightful fantasy was this: assuming the procedure succeeded, and his brain continued to control his body and receive inputs via its sensory organs, where would Daniel Dennett be? In the story, he imagines his body walking into the room where his brain floats within a reinforced vat, then sitting down and looking at it. The scene was recreated for television in a 1988 documentary by Dutch director Piet Hoenderdos – in which Dennett played himself (with gusto). It's surely one of the only cases of an academic paper receiving such an adaptation. ""Well, here I am sitting on a folding chair, staring through a piece of plate glass at my own brain,"" the flabbergasted Dennett declares. ""But wait… shouldn't I have thought, 'Here I am, suspended in a bubbling fluid, being stared at by my own eyes'?"" The second of these thoughts proves even harder to maintain than the first. And the thought that follows from this is that it's impossible ever to be certain where ""I"" am – or even what the word ""here"" means – purely on the basis of personal experience. ""How did I know where I meant by 'here' when I thought 'here'?"" he continues. ""Could I think I meant one place when in fact I meant another?"" No matter what he may believe about his own location or mental state, such beliefs offer no special guarantee of their own accuracy. The external view of events, not the internal, is the one that matters: the facts on the ground, not how this ground appears to the person standing upon it (or floating in a vat, as the case may be). Contrary to centuries of philosophical tradition, he proposed, we have no special knowledge about the working of our own minds – while the sense that our ""self"" is a unified, coherent entity is merely a marvellous, evolved illusion. As he put it in I've Been Thinking, ""there is little I can know for sure from single-handedly introspecting my own mind."" But there is much to be learned by ""studying the minds of others scientifically"" – so long as this entails a rigorous scepticism about even the most plausible of intuitions. The truth won't free you from cognitive constraint, because no such thing is possible. But it may, if you're careful, teach you about the kinds of freedom worth wanting. This brings us back to a technology uncannily capable of inverting the scenario at the heart of ""Where Am I?"": generative AI. It has the capacity to conjure convincing human simulacra from trillions of bytes of data; and, by doing so, to upend centuries of assumptions around truth, identity and our shared experiences of reality. Given just 30 seconds of moderate quality video, for example, freely available AI services can now create an artificial version of any speaker – or a wholly fictional person – and have them say anything whatsoever. Leaders like the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have already used AI tools to create versions of themselves speaking fluently in regional languages, the better to win votes, with similar approaches being deployed in Indonesia and Pakistan. In July 2023, crude deepfake videos of female opposition leaders in Bangladesh, purporting to show them in bikinis and swimming pools, were rapidly debunked but still shared widely. And much more is coming our way. With 2024 set to be the biggest year for elections in history (no less than half the world's population will be visiting various polls), it has never been easier for the information influencing human decision-making to be manipulated – or for our everyday intuitions and inclinations to be subverted. Indeed, there's every reason to think that, with enough data, it might soon be possible to create a convincing facsimile of a person: an entity who could conceivably pass for a politician – or you or me – not only in a pre-recorded performance but also in everyday conversation.   Presciently, Dennett imagined this scenario decades ago. In the science fiction story in Hoenderdos's documentary, scientists create an extra Dennett: alongside the original brain in a vat, his mind is duplicated as a ""digital twin"". They compete to gain control of his body. In this scenario, the question of whether someone actually is somewhere – or has said or done something, or even exists – becomes even more fraught. To see how close reality has already come to fiction, consider the case of the Luciano Floridi Bot, an AI-driven imitation of another leading philosopher of technology, ""designed to answer questions and write texts emulating Floridi's ways of thinking and his style of writing"". It's both a fascinating pedagogical tool and a case study of how, in an age of AI, our ideas and our identities can literally start to take on lives of their own. For Dennett, there was something troubling about the very fact of our obsession with human-seeming AI. While complete facsimiles of the human mind may not be imminent, the way we're using AI to impersonate human beings has, he told me, already put us on a dangerous trajectory. He called such AIs ""counterfeit people"", and told me that rolling out such entities en masse constituted ""mischief of the worst sort"": a form of ""social vandalism"" that should be addressed by law. Why? Because, if convincing digital representations of humans can be created at whim, the entire business of collectively assessing other people's claims, experiences and actions is put at risk – not to mention essential social infrastructure such as contracts, obligations and consequences. Hence the need for legal prohibitions, a case he made at length in a May 2023 article for The Atlantic. ""It won't be perfect,"" he told me, ""but it will help if we can make it against the law to make counterfeit people. We can have stiff penalties for counterfeiting people, same as we do for counterfeit money… we should make it a mark of shame, not pride, when you make your AI more human."" There's an irony, here, in the fact that Dennett spent decades arguing against those trying to carve out some elusive category of ""humanness"" that only our minds can possess. A thoroughgoing materialist, he repeatedly made the case that, as he put it in his 1995 exploration of evolutionary theory, Darwin's Dangerous Idea,""all the achievements of human culture – language, art, religion, ethics, science itself – are themselves artifacts… of the same fundamental process that developed the bacteria, the mammals, and Homo sapiens. There is no Special Creation of language, and neither art nor religion has a literally divine inspiration."" More like this: Humanity's emergence from unthinking matter is marvellous, he argued, but not miraculous. Even minds as remarkable as ours are ultimately the products of an assortment of uncomprehending modules, themselves composed of cruder components, connected in unbroken sequence to the first forms of life. It follows from this that, in principle, there is nothing preventing the algorithms of artificial intelligence from approaching or exceeding our own capacities; or from humans augmenting and re-engineering their minds through artificial means. Indeed, some of Dennett's most important early work entailed defending computation's power and potentials against those who, like the philosopher John Searle, claimed that mere calculation could never give rise to phenomena like consciousness. For Dennett, there was nothing ""mere"" about calculation or algorithmic processes: it was only ever a question of scale and complexity. In this sense, the achievements of modern AIs – from their linguistic prowess and mastery of games like chess and Go to their ability to pass legal and medical examinations – are an ongoing vindication of Dennett's insistence that human-level competence can arise from wholly uncomprehending processes (not to mention that, in our case, it did). During our conversation, however, he was also at pains to highlight the gulf between current computational architectures and humans' analogue complexities. It's dangerous to obsess over whether AI will achieve ""general intelligence"", with all the cognitive flexibility of a human being, let alone something greater. Long before anything like this happens, he noted, we will need to deal with the emergence of ""extremely manipulative"" autonomous agents – and these will pose a far greater threat than hypothetical superintelligences (""forget about that!""). Why? Because, much as social media has proved an evolutionary hothouse for content able to exploit human vulnerabilities, the same dynamics favour both AI-generated content and AIs able to deploy an enticing combination of persuasion, seduction, shock and flattery. From flawlessly glamorous artificial influencers to deepfake pornography, from endlessly empathetic companions to romantic scams, human loves and longings are a fertile field for the refinement of manipulation. We may not (yet) be brains in vats. But what we see, believe, belong to and do is increasingly interwoven with countless information systems; and many of these are more adept at delivering persuasion and plausibility than truth. None of this is to deny the power and potentials of technologies like AIs, or the countless ways in which they may enhance humanity's scope and self-knowledge. But it is to make the case that, as Dennett put it, AIs are likely to ""evolve to get themselves reproduced. And the ones that reproduce the best will be the ones that are the cleverest manipulators of us human interlocutors. The boring ones we will cast aside, and the ones that hold our attention we will spread. All this will happen without any intention at all. It will be natural selection of software."" Neither a human nor a machine-made masterplan is required for harmful scenarios to unfold. As Dennett's 2017 book From Bacteria to Bach argued, ""once the infrastructure for culture has been designed and installed [i.e. evolved in human minds]… the possibility of parasitical memes exploiting that infrastructure is more or less guaranteed."" In evolutionary terms, our minds aren't devices fine-tuned for differentiating truth from lies. We are partial, passionate, tribal creatures: social animals linked by bonds of love and loyalty that both define our humanity and make us painfully vulnerable. What is to be done? Thankfully, another defining feature of human thought is our capacity for reflecting upon precisely these limitations: for redressing, collectively and incrementally, the blind spots of personal perception. ""What you want,"" Dennett told me, ""is your thinking to be determined by the truth about what's out there. You want to be compelled by the good evidence there is out there for how the world is. But you also want to have the elbow room to reconsider, and reconsider, and reconsider further: your prospects, your projects, your goals. You want to be a higher order, intentional system that reflects upon means and ends and goals."" This is the scientific method in microcosm, with a flavour of humanist freethinking. The ""freedom"" to act on the basis of manipulatively inaccurate information is no freedom at all. By contrast, actions determined by ""the good evidence that is out there"" are emancipatory: open to the complexities of actuality rather than snared by untruths. To extend the thought experiment of ""Where Am I?"", imagine what would happen if your brain were placed in a vat and then – without your knowledge or permission – hooked up to a simulated version of reality. Within that virtual realm, you might still possess certain freedoms. In the context of the external world, however, you would be both trapped and deceived: cut off from every meaningful form of understanding and action. (Read more: The philosopher rethinking the definition of reality.) Although it may seem purely a matter for speculative fiction, a version of this scenario plays out every time someone takes a false claim to be the literal truth – or an artificial entity to be a human. From conspiracy theories to totalitarian propaganda, from fabricated evidence to ersatz humans, reality-rejection is a booming business. And there's nothing inevitable about the endurance of tolerance, scepticism or reasoned debate in a world suffused with such things. Civilisation, Dennett told me, ""is more fragile than we realised"" – and all the more precious for this. Despite its conflicts, injustices and hatreds, we inhabit an era where it is possible for a large proportion of humanity to ""trust each other, have long-term projects, travel freely, raise families, live with very little fear. That's just wonderful. And we should preserve that. That social structure, really, at all costs."" This is the great danger of AI large language models and counterfeit people alike: ""that they will destroy the trust that we have engendered over thousands of years"".

Despite all this – and his reputation for unyielding reasonableness – Dennett made it clear to me that he had no interest in transcending the limitations of human nature. Love and loyalty weren't, for him, biological baggage we would be better off moving beyond. Rather, they were motivating forces of the most profound kind: wellsprings of purpose and goodness, so long as they could be unshackled from egotism and hatred. ""Looking out for number one is a perfectly good agent rule. But number one can be understood very broadly. Number one can include your children, an idea, guitar playing, the Chicago Bears. Number one can be whatever you want it to be. That's what you care about the most. That's what you're going to protect. And this is obvious. If somebody wants to extort you, they don't have to threaten you. They just have to threaten what you love."" Biology is where it all begins and ends: the evolved, astonishing pattern of our emergence alongside every other form of life; the limitless complexities we are capable of conceiving via culture, language and computation; our common existence as creatures of flesh and blood. ""My children are both adopted,"" Dennett told me at the very end of our conversation. ""But I love them with the intensity of any biological dad. I can remember a moment in the early life of our eldest, when she was a little girl, maybe two years old or less, when I detected some possible threat on a playground or something, and it suddenly struck me, 'Oh, my goodness, I think I would kill to protect this child.' And it scared me, almost. But it also thrilled me, because it was a recognition of the intensity and depth of emotional attachment. And that's what life is all about."" *Tom Chatfield is a British author and philosopher of technology.

Yield Spread Analysis,Leeds show fight and clearer plan to beat Wolves,2024-09-14,2022-08-05,Phil Dawkes,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62358052,"Brenden Aaronson (centre) was one of four debutants in the Leeds side for the win over Wolves As the final whistle blew on Leeds' feisty and fierce opening-game victory over Wolves, the Elland Road crowd roared their delight, the players punched the air and manager Jesse Marsch almost came to blows with opposite number Bruno Lage. 'I Predict A Riot' has never felt a more appropriate soundtrack. The Kaiser Chiefs song, with its growling depiction of menace and confrontation on the streets of the band's hometown, is now an anthem at Elland Road following home victories - and could well be a template for how Marsch wants his team to front up. In this soft reboot of the determined but ragged side that salvaged safety on the final day of last season, there was energy, endeavour and more than a little appetite for a fight as they battled their way back from Daniel Podence's early goal to seal victory. Rodrigo fired them level with an angled drive in the first half and Ryan Ait-Nouri found his own net for the winner. In between there was a lot of harrying, high pressing and hearty tackles. There was also a wobble, when Wolves came on strong and perilously close to exposing the weaknesses in Marsch's side for 25 minutes after half-time. Had the visitors a more ruthless centre-forward - such as the injured Raul Jimenez - to fire the ammunition provided by Podence and Pedro Neto, they would likely have three points themselves. Instead, though, Leeds had the final word on the pitch, leaving Marsch and Lage to argue over who would claim it on the touchline. Reaction and analysis from Saturday's Premier League games, including Leeds v Wolves This video can not be played Marsch impressed by debutants in Leeds win After the game, Marsch played down the argument, describing it as ""nothing, really"" and ""normal in a lot of ways"". This left the Portuguese boss to provide greater clarity on something that had been brewing throughout the match. ""In the first half, there were things that we cannot say, especially in these days, and I heard that. So if someone wants to apologise to me, it should be in that moment, not in the end when you've won the game,"" he said. ""There were plenty of moments between the first half and the end of the game when we could have shaken hands and apologised - it didn't happen and in the end it's more difficult to accept because there was a long time to do that. ""There's nothing wrong between the managers. Life goes on."" What is clear from the end of last season and the early stages of this is that Marsch is not a man to take a backward step, nor does he expect his teams to do so. There is a famous image from his playing days with Chivas USA of the then midfielder nose-to-nose with LA Galaxy's David Beckham after having booted the ex-England player in the stomach. Undaunted by his rival's reputation, Marsch stands his ground. Marsch played for a number of Major League Soccer sides before moving into coaching One thing he will not be is cowed by the managerial microscope under which he now sits, stripped of the shielding set of dire circumstances which surrounded the club when he was appointed. Marsch deserves huge credit for his role in driving Leeds to the points they needed to survive relegation in 2021-22 - often seemingly through determination rather than design - but now he needs to be a man with a plan. With four debutants on the field and a fit-again Patrick Bamford to lead the attack, there were certainly clearer signs of one. Some parts worked better than others. Tyler Adams and Marc Roca showed signs they can complement each other in midfield as successors to Kalvin Phillips, the former tasked with the winning the ball, the latter to distribute pinpoint forward passes. Rasmus Kristensen was all-action at full-back, but may need greater help in such a narrow formation against sides like Wolves with wide players eager to double up in attack. Most impressive of all was Brenden Aaronson, who was a constant source of energy and endeavour, some of which he used to dart into the box and force Ait-Nouri to score the winner into his own net from Bamford's cross. He lacks the outright flair of Raphinha - the man he was brought in to help replace - but in his own industrious way could prove as effective. As Marsch pointed out before the game, the team may have lost two stars, but in general it has become stronger, helped by the recent arrival of three players who have operated under the American before in Aaronson, Adams and Rasmussen. It wasn't perfect and at times threatened to topple over as Wolves came on strong after the break, but there was enough there for Leeds to believe they can avoid the trauma of last season's relegation fight. ""I am really pleased that we look like a team that understands what the tactics and ideas are with the ball much better than we did last season,"" said Marsch. ""It was a big struggle to implement tactically what we want to achieve. ""We still have a lot of work to do but the three points validates the pre-season we have had and the work we have done."" This video can not be played Wolves manager Bruno Lage says his team were the better side Wolves' deficiencies are clear to see. So are their qualities. Nathan Collins remains their only significant signing of the summer, with the ex-Burnley man making an efficient debut at Elland Road in the middle of a back four that did not include stalwart Conor Coady. With Jimenez sidelined for a few more weeks and Fabio Silva out on loan, they desperately need some firepower to complement the creative powers of their wide forwards. They finished 10th last season after having scored the fewest goals of any club to remain in the division, but to gamble on a repeat would be foolhardy. Lage was pleased with his side's performance - one that would have yielded greater reward but for key misses by Hwang Hee-chan and Leander Dendoncker - but is aware of the need for reinforcements. ""I think we did a good game,"" Lage said. ""I think we were the better team, we created a lot of chances, and we didn't score. I'm happy with the performance, but not happy with the result. ""I said before the game that we came here with big confidence, and we'll score goals because the pre-season was good and we have confidence to play in this system. I was right to feel that confidence, and we continued to play."" He added: ""It's time to be patient because we are talking with players. I know the club are talking with players and those players can come and increase the level of the team and the squad.  ""They will give solutions that we didn't have today."" Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment"
Yield Spread Analysis,Ireland set to launch virus app despite UK delay,2024-09-14,2020-06-22,By Leo Kelion,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53137816,"Ireland's health authority plans to press ahead with the launch of a coronavirus contact-tracing app based on Apple and Google's technology. The Health Service Executive told the BBC that it would submit a memo to government this week, and ""subject to approval"" would launch its Covid Tracker app shortly after. The move comes despite concerns raised about the tech's accuracy in its current state.  The UK is worried about false alerts. And researchers advising the Irish effort have also questioned whether the software should be rolled out in its current state. Ireland would follow Germany in deploying such an app nationwide. Two tests were carried out in Ireland ahead of the launch of its app. Members of the An Garda Siochana police force volunteered to take part in field trials at the start of the month to see how it would perform in everyday situations. ""The Gardai are one of the few groups of people that are moving around and interacting with each other as they carry out their duties,"" explained a spokeswoman for the country's government. The results have given health chiefs confidence to roll it out to the public. And they note that because it has been designed to support UK mobile numbers, visitors crossing the border from Northern Ireland or travelling across from Great Britain can also make use if it. The second experiment involved a team at Trinity College, Dublin testing an app based on the Google-Apple API [application programming interface] on a commuter bus. It found that metal in the vehicle's structure and fittings caused problems. The Google-API allows the threshold for what triggers a contact match to be adjusted based on the strength of the Bluetooth signal and duration of the exposure. When using the settings already in use by Switzerland's contact-tracing app, the researchers found that no contact logs were logged despite 60 pairs of handsets being placed within 2m of each other. And they only managed to raise this to an 8% detection rate when they shortened the exposure time and adjusted the Bluetooth strength to a level that they said would be likely to cause false alerts in other environments. In addition, the researchers said signal strength was sometimes higher for phones that were far apart than those close together, which they said made reliable proximity-detection ""hard or perhaps even impossible"" to achieve. ""As to whether it is sensible to deploy these apps, I'd say the jury is still out on that,"" Prof Doug Leith told the BBC. ""But the likely effectiveness of apps based on the Apple-Google API in real-world situations  -ie outside the lab - is certainly far from clear.""  Last week, the UK ditched its own contact-tracing technology to switch to the Apple-Google model. But while the government now intends to launch a Covid-19 app of some sort in England by the Autumn, it has said it may still not include contact-tracing functionality. ""I was only prepared to recommend to people that they download an app when I'm really confident in it,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. Apple and Google are under pressure to become less restrictive about the data they share to let apps become more accurate. ""The API does not expose Bluetooth received signal strength (RSS) measurements directly, rather it abstracts this,"" explained Dr Brendan Jennings, who is also involved in developing Ireland's app. ""There certainly are some changes in the API that we believe would be helpful - and we do believe that Google/Apple will be willing to take on board suggested changes in future revisions."" But in the meantime, others have already decided to launch apps based on the two US tech firms' software tool, including: One of the developers of Germany's app said it was currently 80% accurate at logging matches across a range of scenarios, and it had been felt that this was good enough to go with. ""There can be false alerts,"" added SAP's Thomas Leonhardi. ""But that can also happen via manual contact tracing. It's the best we have and of course we're still working on it."" The Robert Koch Institute, which published the Corona-Warn App on behalf of the German government, said on Friday morning that it had already been downloaded 9.6 million times. The country's population is about 83 million. Once Ireland has got an app based on the Apple/Google toolkit up and running then Northern Ireland and indeed the rest of the UK should be able to use it - job done, right? Well, no, say insiders on the NHS team. First, an app is more than just the code - you would need to integrate it with the public health advice, the testing infrastructure and the manual contact-tracing systems for each of the four home nations.  But the key issue is the question of whether the Apple/Google system is actually working well at measuring the distance between two phones using Bluetooth - last Thursday Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Test and Trace supremo Baroness Dido Harding made it clear they thought it wasn't. Incidentally, Baroness Harding may have overstated the failings of the centralised app in the Isle of Wight during Thursday's briefings when she said it could only detect 4% of iPhone contacts. Someone on the island who was briefed about what went wrong tells me that this disastrous 4% only referred to cases where the app was asleep in the background after a long period when two iPhones had not been in use for a while - which apparently accounts for just a small percentage of overall iPhone contacts. What's frustrated both the app team and Apple is that in the days before the U-turn, the two sides had apparently begun working closely on ways to make Bluetooth work better with the app in the background.  Thursday's announcement came as a surprise to the developers and to the tech giant - which was then dismayed to hear Mr Hancock accusing it of a failure to co-operate."
Yield Spread Analysis,Ukraine's frontline farmers toil on amid explosions,2024-09-14,2022-07-22,By Andrew Harding,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62266136,"A boom, like distant thunder, rolled over the wheat fields due west of Slovyansk - a Ukrainian city now being targeted daily by Russian rockets and artillery. Perched on his seat in a combine harvester, Vladimir Bukhantsev, 47, could see clouds of smoke from missiles hitting an industrial area, then another, thinner plume, from Russian positions on the frontline, perhaps 15km (nine miles) due north. ""It's noisy here. But life goes on. We had a spot of rain earlier, so we've been waiting for the wheat to dry. My son is serving in the army near here. I'm hoping our lads are going to start counter-attacking soon and push the Russians back,"" he said, on a brief break from work. Suddenly there was a shrieking roar as two Ukrainian fighter jets flew low, perhaps 25m (80ft) above the field, directly overhead.  Within seconds the jets were over Russian positions, and Bukhantsev watched the bright tail of a Russian rocket soaring up towards one aircraft, narrowly missing it. Both Sukhoi jets then released decoy flares, turned sharply and headed back south, again passing directly overhead with another deafening roar. ""They fly like that almost every day. It gets lively here. The pilots do their job. We do ours. Everyone is busy. But their work is harder,"" he said. The woods and narrow country lanes around Slovyansk are busy with Ukrainian troops, digging trenches and setting up artillery positions. There are reports that new Western weapons, including Himars rocket systems, are being used locally at night, to fire on ammunition stores and positions deep inside Russian-held territory. But Ukraine's frontline farmers remain focused on their own battle - to bring in the harvest, despite the constant danger posed by the conflict, and despite plummeting grain prices caused by Russia's blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports. Most of the farmers have already sent their families to safety, further west. In Slovyansk, buses organised by local volunteers and the city administration continue to evacuate dozens of civilians daily.  At 09:00 on Thursday, 30 people, many in tears, boarded one bus, along with their pets and a small amount of luggage, as the boom of incoming and outgoing rocket fire echoed around the largely empty streets. Later the same day, Sergei Kurinniy, owner of the KramAgroSvit farm near the village of Dmytrivka, clambered down the side of a crater, perhaps 4m deep, left by a huge Russian rocket. ""The Russians talk about high-precision targeting. So much for that. This one could easily have hit our village,"" said the 58-year-old. Kurinniy's farm, spread over two picturesque, rolling valleys, has more than 3,400 hectares (8,400 acres) of wheat and sunflower seeds, and cattle too. But he closed the livestock business down after rockets hit a cattle shed, killing more than 20 animals. Another rocket missed the farm offices by a few metres, shattering windows. ""It's very dangerous, of course. But we're continuing. Our major concern is that the price we receive for our products is lower than usual. Last year, we sold wheat for about $300 (£250) a tonne. Now it's $100. And the cost of fuel has risen threefold.  ""Then you have to add in fertilisers, seeds, pesticides, taxes, wages. So this year, we're likely to make no profits. And at any moment, we can be bombarded and everything will burn,"" he said, flicking through videos on his mobile phone that showed one of his fields on fire after a recent missile strike.  His neighbour lost up to 2,000 hectares of corn to another fire. Kurinniy was bitterly critical of President Vladimir Putin and his blockade of Ukrainian ports. ""We usually export 90% of our crops. We need this blockade to be lifted. But not at any price. There should be normal, civilised business relations. Not business combined with the use of threats and violence - as often happens with Russia. It should not be like that in the modern world,"" he said, angrily accusing Mr Putin of turning Russians into ""zombies"". The harvest in Donetsk province this year is expected to be less than half the size of last year's, because of the war, the occupation of territory by Russian troops, and some weather-related issues. ""Our plan is to put a lot of the grain in storage, so we can export it to other countries at a future date. So, our aim now is to bring in the harvest and transfer it to safer parts of Ukraine,"" said Artem Chahan, the director of agricultural development for Donetsk."
Yield Spread Analysis,Cuba crash plane's black box recovered,2024-09-14,2018-05-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44184751,"Cuban officials say they have found one of the two black boxes from a plane that crashed near Havana airport, killing more than 100 people, in ""good condition"". Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo says he hopes the second device will be recovered soon. He revised the official death toll up to 110 people, including 11 foreigners. Three women survived the crash, but are said to be in a critical condition with serious burns.  The incident is Cuba's worst air disaster in decades, and two days of national mourning began on Saturday.  Officials said investigators are combing through the wreckage of the plane, a Boeing 737 which was nearly 40 years old, at the field where it crashed some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital.  The black box which has already been recovered will hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane.  Mr Yzquierdo told journalists that the 110 dead included 99 Cubans, six Mexican crew members, two tourists from Argentina, one from Mexico, and two passengers from Western Sahara. The Argentine couple were named by their government as Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their sixties.  Several victims' relatives have travelled to Havana to help identify the deceased.  Those coming from Holguín - the plane's intended destination - and other eastern parts of Cuba made the 700km (435-mile) trip on buses, escorted by the National Revolutionary Police, EFE news agency reported.  President Miguel Diaz-Canel has visited the morgue where the victims are being identified. Cuban authorities do not plan to release the full list of the dead until all victims' families have been informed.  The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holguín. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near the airport. ""I saw it taking off,"" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. ""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"".  A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people initially survived the crash but one died after being taken to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39.  ""She is alive but very burnt and swollen,"" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. By Will Grant, BBC Cuba Correspondent  Two days of national mourning have begun, with the entire island sharing a little of the pain of the many families affected by the disaster. But in their grief, people also want answers. They are demanding an explanation as to why a routine flight from Havana came crashing down in a field barely a minute after it took off, with over 100 passengers and crew on board.  The country's new President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, faces his first real test in providing those answers. He visited the crash site to thank the emergency services and announced an investigation was already under way.  It emerged that the previous President, Raúl Castro, was recuperating from minor surgery on a hernia, and he too expressed his condolences to the victims' families.  The families of the survivors face an anxious wait to see if they will pull through, and their countrymen are praying that at least some will have survived this catastrophe. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de Aviación by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico earlier said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. According to industry research, last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travel with no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana, killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground."
Yield Spread Analysis,Could climate crisis impact the 2026 World Cup?,2024-09-14,2023-09-15,David Lockwood,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66211285,"At the 1994 World Cup in the US, Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton memorably criticised Fifa's policy of not allowing drinks bottles on the pitch ""One player is going to die."" That was the stark warning from Russian tennis player Daniil Medvedev as he battled the heat, humidity and Andrey Rublev at the US Open in New York last week. It came just a week after some races at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest were moved because of fears over the safety of competitors. , external With extreme temperatures more likely across the globe as a result of climate change, these kind of impacts are becoming the new reality for sport. In less than three years' time, the 2026 men's World Cup final will cap an expanded tournament of 48 teams playing 104 matches in six summer weeks across Canada, the United States and Mexico. The previous edition - held in Qatar in 2022 - was moved from June and July, when temperatures regularly exceed 40C and can reach 50C, to November and December to protect players and fans. But after a record-breaking summer of extreme heat and wildfire air pollution - in which 96% of the US population (318 million people) experienced an extreme heat alert, 175 cities had at least a week of extreme heat, and 45 cities witnessed unusually high temperatures for more than half of their summer days - could Fifa have another issue on its hands? Some of the world's leading sport scientists certainly think so. Here are some of the factors to consider: On 15 July, an all-time high of 48C was recorded in Phoenix, Arizona. Temperatures hit 43C for 19 days running. In Texas this summer, temperatures were above 38C for 27 consecutive days. The heat forced the closure of businesses and public facilities such as parks, museums and zoos. The US government's Heat Index - which measures temperature plus humidity - puts readings of 32C at 'extreme caution' for sporting activity and 39C at 'danger'. Miami, a 2026 host city, has registered 38C or higher every day for more than a month on the Heat Index. In total, about 100 million people have experienced very poor air quality this summer as Canadian wildfires spread smoke across several cities. University of Portsmouth professor Mike Tipton specialises in extreme temperature impacts on the human body and has worked with Team GB athletes, including triathlete Jonny Brownlee after his infamous collapse from heat stress in Mexico in 2016.   ""I would have concerns,"" Prof Tipton told BBC Sport. ""They would range from players through to officials and spectators. ""Probably the best approach is then to hope for the best but plan for the worst. That would mean giving some consideration to moving the event to a different time."" Prof Tipton believes if the World Cup is played in the extreme temperatures seen this summer in North America, performance and strategy will change. ""You simply cannot physically achieve what needs to be achieved and play the same game as you would play in Liverpool in the winter as you would under a 'heat dome' in America in the summer,"" he said. Almost 30 years ago, at the 1994 men's World Cup in the United States, news reports recorded on-field temperatures over 100F during several mid-afternoon kick-offs, with the New York Times reporting 160 fans were treated for heat-related stress and 12 were hospitalised. Sport and sustainability: More stories US Open heatwave: How hot is too hot to play a Grand Slam? These temperatures were taken in the first week of July in the United States - and the global average temperature was 63F (17.23C), according to the UN - the highest ever recorded What to expect from the 2026 men's World Cup What effect do heatwaves have on the body? The Canadian wildfire season, stoked by above-average temperatures this summer, is now the worst on record.  Fires have burned nearly 15 million hectares (37.5 million acres) of land. Last weekend there were more than 1,000 active fires burning in Canada. The smoke drifted into the US, with 18 states under air-quality alerts this summer, meaning people were advised to stay indoors, and baseball, football and even indoor basketball games were cancelled. World Cup 2026 host cities Vancouver, Seattle, Boston, Toronto, Philadelphia and New York have all been affected by wildfire smoke. Professor Michael Koehle is a respiratory health academic based at the University of British Colombia, Vancouver, and says being exposed to wildfire smoke over consecutive days ""will have health consequences"". ""The problem is you can't predict these things very far in advance,"" said Prof Koehle, who has worked with Athletics Canada and the Canada men's football team. ""I don't know how you manage the consequences of disruption. ""If the local Public Health Agency says you cannot hold this match, how do you handle that?"" Prof Koehle said it would be a ""logistical nightmare"" to move matches at short notice out of North America if air quality is poor in 2026, adding: ""It's certainly going to be easier for the players and the spectators if it's held in April, May, September or October, due to the risk of disruption."" Wildfires have collectively burned more than 7.9 million hectares (19.5 million acres) of land across Canada so far this year Critics believe Fifa has to address the emissions it is creating. By Fifa's own estimation, the 2026 World Cup will be the most emitting tournament it has ever staged. Its claims Qatar 2022 would be carbon-neutral were called ""dangerous and misleading"" by environmentalists, and a Swiss regulator ruled Fifa made ""unsubstantiated claims"" about the reduced climate impact of the tournament. Mexico and the USA held men's World Cups in 1986 and 1994 respectively, while Canada hosted the Women's World Cup in 2015.  However, in recent years all countries have seen an increasingly hostile climate. ""Scientists believe this unprecedented heatwave was made five times more likely due to human-induced climate change,"" says BBC weather forecaster Simon King. ""While these scenarios may not occur during the World Cup in 2026, the fact is climate change makes it more likely.""

This video can not be played World Cup 2026: Heat isn't safe for afternoon games - Rachel Daly The impacts of heat are already being felt by players. While playing in Houston - a 2026 host city - back in 2017, England international Rachel Daly had to be taken to hospital because of heat exhaustion. Monterrey is another 2026 host city - and former England player Gary Lineker played there during the 1986 World Cup. He recalls it being ""the hottest match I ever played in"". ""We played in 43-44C,"" he said. ""I think I lost about 12 pounds in fluids. In the second half I was dizzy and couldn't really perform. Most of the players were the same... it was ridiculous. ""I'd like to see Fifa worry more about things like climate change generally; it's something Fifa really need to look at."" This video can not be played 'I'd like to see Fifa worry more about climate change' In a paper published by the British Medical Journal this year - and co-authored by Vincent Gouttebarge, the chief medical officer of global players' union FifPro - concerns were raised that Fifa guidelines do not go far enough. ""Heat guidelines are often used as the default policy,"" it said. ""Still, these seem less protective than guidelines in other sports or from countries traditionally exposed to extreme hot conditions. ""Such a concern is likely to be relevant for the 2026 Fifa World Cup that will be held in the traditional June-July window across 16 host cities in Canada, Mexico and USA."" It recommends 11 ""hot tips"" which ""should be considered and facilitated by governing bodies, competition organisers, clubs, staff members and players"". The Qatar World Cup was moved seven years in advance to allow plenty of time for the global football calendar to adjust and was always considered a one-off by Fifa. A winter World Cup in 2026 would pose opposite challenges with several host cities such as Vancouver, Toronto and Seattle experiencing sub-zero temperatures. Speaking to the BBC earlier this year, Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani suggested stadiums would be ""climate controlled"", helping players and fans at the games. BBC Sport contacted FIFA for comment and was referred to the controls and significant considerations that are already in place. These include the monitoring of temperatures by officials - with referees advised to take water breaks when necessary, climatic controls in some of the stadiums, and the fact the allocation and scheduling of matches will aim to minimise the effects of high temperatures in line with analysis of the climate in the host cities. Detail on exact kick-off times has not yet been released, but Prof Tipton suggested only early morning starts would offer ""significant"" respite. Climate controls include roofs on some stadiums. Indoor arenas don't guarantee a safe environment, though, with netball player Amy Steele suffering career-ending heat exhaustion when playing indoors. Another factor will be the provision of water for the expected travelling support of at least a million people, and the related energy consumption demands to help keep fans cool inside stadiums, when public buildings have had to close this year. It is also anticipated there will be additional training grounds which don't have roofs. Montagliani added: ""Looking forward, it is not impossible to change tournaments, as we have seen, but I don't think that is going to be the solution. ""Having them play winter in Toronto might not be ideal or in Chicago or in Philadelphia. I think there are pros and cons either way. The reality is, winter, summer, spring or fall it doesn't change the fact that we need to do whatever we can to help in this whole climate and environment issue, ensuring that our footprint is as minimised as possible, through technology and how you run tournaments."" This video can not be played Will the 2022 World Cup be carbon neutral? On Fifa's wider climate responsibility, Montagliani said: ""The truth of the matter is whether it is a confederation or Fifa or a league or a club, we are not going to change the issue around the climate thing in the world. That has to be done by countries and bigger industries. ""We will try to do our bit, absolutely, and we will try to be cognisant in that. It is very important and we will obviously have experts helping us in that journey. But it is a much bigger issue than football.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Badger culling to be replaced by vaccine use,2024-09-14,2020-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-51753393,"Badger culling to tackle the spread of TB in livestock is to be phased out to be replaced with a cattle vaccine, the government has announced. Defra, the environment department, said trials of a vaccine will take place over the next five years, and there are plans to vaccinate more badgers. Opponents of the badger cull have said it is inhumane and ineffective, but the government backed the policy. The first cull zones were created in 2013 in Somerset and Gloucestershire. In September, badger culling was extended to 40 areas including Bristol, Cheshire, Devon, Cornwall, Staffordshire, Dorset, Herefordshire and Wiltshire. Farmers said it was necessary to control the disease that devastates the beef and dairy industries, while the government claimed it had led to reductions in the incidence of TB. Now Defra plans to gradually phase out ""intensive culling"" following a breakthrough by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). Previously it was not possible to vaccinate cattle as tests for the disease could not differentiate between vaccinated animals and those infected by bovine TB, but Apha has developed an ""effective"" test which can be trialled alongside the BCG vaccine. Defra is selling the shift to vaccination as the next phase in its policy to eradicate cattle TB. Opponents of the cull are calling it a U-turn.  Animal welfare campaigners believe culling to be cruel and many scientists suspect it may be ineffective and actually increase the spread of the infection in cattle. On the day Defra unveiled its culling policy in 2012 one of its most senior scientific advisors described it as a ""crazy scheme"".  The department's own independent expert group's review of the first year of the culls concluded that they were ineffective and inhumane and a member of that group told BBC News he believed that the government was ""wilfully ignoring the science"". Another senior researcher said ministers were using ""fake science"" to justify the culling policy. Defra's response was to disband the independent expert group and relax the strict scientific rules that were in place to minimise the spread of infection to cattle from badger movement. They were modified in subsequent culls in order to ensure more badgers were killed. Ministers justified their perseverance with the policy as wanting to use ""every tool in the box"".  But there has been no clear cut drop in cattle TB since the culls began so Defra has decided to begin to put one of its tools away. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said Apha's ""ground-breaking research"" meant it could now start on the ""field trials required to license the cattle vaccine and test it"". ""Whilst there is no single way to combat this damaging and complex disease, cattle vaccination will be a new tool for our multi-pronged approach to tackle it,"" she said. Environment Secretary George Eustice claimed: ""The badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease as demonstrated by recent academic research and past studies. ""But no-one wants to continue the cull of this protected species indefinitely so, once the weight of disease in wildlife has been addressed, we will accelerate other elements of our strategy, including improved diagnostics and cattle vaccination."""
Yield Spread Analysis,US to halt funding to WHO over coronavirus,2024-09-14,2020-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52289056,"US President Donald Trump has said he is going to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak. He accused the UN agency of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China, and said it must be held accountable.  In response, the UN's chief said it was ""not the time"" to cut funds to the WHO. Mr Trump has been under fire for his own handling of the pandemic. He has sought to deflect persistent criticism that he acted too slowly to stop the virus's spread by pointing to his decision in late January to place restrictions on travel from China.  He has accused the WHO of having ""criticised"" that decision and of being biased towards China more generally.  ""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday. The US is the global health body's largest single funder and gave it more than $400m in 2019. A decision on whether the US resumes funding will be made after the review, which Mr Trump said would last 60 to 90 days.  The WHO is yet to directly respond but UN Secretary General António Guterres said the international community should be uniting ""in solidarity to stop this virus"". ""It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against Covid-19,"" he said. Germany's foreign minister tweeted that strengthening the ""under-funded"" WHO was one of the best investments that could be made at this time. The WHO launched an appeal in March for $675m to help fight the coronavirus pandemic and is reported to be planning a fresh appeal for at least $1bn. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder and philanthropist, said on Twitter: ""Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds.""  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the second-largest funder of the WHO.  ""With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America's generosity has been put to the best use possible,"" the US president said. The US has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths worldwide- with more than 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths.  Mr Trump accused the WHO of having failed to adequately assess the outbreak when it first emerged in the city of Wuhan. ""Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,"" he told reporters. ""This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China's assurances to face value... and defended the actions of the Chinese government."" Chinese officials initially covered up the outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, and punished whistleblowers who tried to raise the alarm. Beijing later imposed draconian restrictions, including quarantine zones on an unprecedented scale, drawing effusive praise from the WHO and its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases.  White House reporters pointed out, however, that Mr Trump himself praised China's response to the outbreak and downplayed the danger of the virus at home long after the WHO had declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"". Democrats accused him of trying to shift blame away from himself in an election year, but many Republicans in Congress praised his decision to cut funding. It is not the first time the WHO's response to the outbreak has come under scrutiny.  On 14 January, the organisation tweeted that preliminary Chinese investigations had found ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" of the new virus. Mr Trump and others have used the tweet to attack the WHO for simply believing China, despite evidence to the contrary. But about a week after that tweet, on 22 January, the agency released a public statement saying that human-to-human transmission did appear to be taking place in Wuhan.  At the end of January, on the same day it declared a public health emergency, the WHO said that travel restrictions were not needed to stop the spread of Covid-19 - advice that was eventually ignored by most countries, including by the Trump administration the next day. In March, the UN agency was also accused of being unduly influenced by China after a senior official refused to discuss Taiwan's response to the outbreak. Meanwhile, some health experts also say that the WHO's guidance on face masks has led to public confusion. Other frequently-made criticisms of the WHO more generally are that it is constrained by politics and a sprawling bureaucracy. It came under particular fire for its response to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and how long it took to declare a public health emergency, leading the organisation to announce reforms in response. At one level, this move is about the coronavirus. Administration officials have been sharply accusing the WHO of missteps in the handling of the pandemic, saying it was biased towards China.  They say the WHO was too ready to support China's deceptive early claims about the virus and then didn't push hard enough against Beijing's attempts to cover up its misinformation. In particular President Trump has latched onto the WHO's criticism of his travel restrictions against China.  But at another level, the move to defund the WHO is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail China's growing global influence.  The argument is that Chinese leadership in international organisations undermines the rules-based, accountable international system needed to prevent and fight a pandemic.  But, the Wall Street Journal reports that the decision also stems from an ongoing discussion on whether to link US aid dollars to the number of Americans working in the groups that receive them. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Labour leader urges 2-3 week Covid circuit breaker,2024-09-14,2020-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54528807,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a short lockdown or ""circuit-breaker"" in England of two to three weeks to bring the rising rate of coronavirus under control.  He said measures were not working and another course was needed to prevent a ""sleepwalk into... a bleak winter"". His comments come after documents revealed government scientific advisers called for such action three weeks ago.  Another 143 people have died in the UK after testing positive for the virus. MPs have approved the legislation to write a new three-tier system for coronavirus restrictions in England into law - with every area of the country classified as being on medium, high or very high alert.  Sir Keir said his lockdown proposal would ""not mean schools closing"" but it should ""run across half-term to minimise disruption"". However, he said it would mean that ""all pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed"" and compensated ""so that no business loses out because of the sacrifices we all need to make"". ""The government has not got a credible plan to slow infections. It has lost control of the virus and it's no longer following scientific advice,"" Sir Keir said. He suggested it would also provide a chance for the government to ""fix"" problems by handing over track and trace responsibilities to local authorities. Documents detailing advice from scientists on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) were released on Monday night. Their views and evidence feed into the government's decision making. Sir Keir said his proposals were ""in line with Sage's recommendation"" for a circuit breaker to lower the reproduction number, or R value, of the virus - but acknowledged they would require significant sacrifices. He said:  Meanwhile, Wales' first minister has said he had asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a special Cobra meeting ""specifically to discuss the circuit-breaker idea"" earlier in the week - and repeated that call in a letter on Wednesday. ""I think it's an idea that will need further examination and needs to be shared in perspective between the four UK nations,"" Mark Drakeford added. Mr Johnson has rejected Mr Drakeford's demand for a travel ban on people coming to Wales from England's virus hotspots. Ministers in Northern Ireland's devolved government have been warned that Covid-19 infection rates will keep rising if both schools and the hospitality sector remain open, the BBC has learned. The Scottish government is to implement its own three-tier framework of restrictions later in October. In the meantime, pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, were closed on Friday until 25 October as part of a package of short-term measures. The daily figure of 143 deaths follows 50 deaths announced on Monday and was the highest daily total since the 164 deaths recorded on 10 June.  The latest government figures also show another 17,234 people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, compared with 13,792 cases the day before. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director, said the rising number of deaths was ""hugely concerning"". ""We have seen cases increasing especially in older age groups which is leading to more hospital admissions. This is a stark reminder for us to follow the guidelines,"" she said. The Labour leader's call has added to the volume of demand for extra caution - marking the end of the phase of what he used to describe as constructive opposition.   Sir Keir Starmer has been inching away from the broad front bench consensus on how to handle coronavirus for weeks.  To the frustration of some on his own side, rather than scream down the government's plans he has developed an attack on the government's ability to handle the situation and to act quickly enough.  But his call for a circuit-breaker means he believes the government has simply got it wrong.     Polling suggests too that there is public desire for tougher action to prevent a terrible second wave. Some senior figures in government agree. Read more from Laura Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier defended the new measures, telling MPs that Covid-19 posed ""a formidable threat"" until a vaccine can be found.  But he said the government makes ""decisions that are guided by the science, taking into account all of the different considerations"". ""Protecting our economy and protecting our health are not alternatives"", he added, but said action was required to ""protect lives and livelihoods"". Sir Keir said Labour would not vote against the measures - even though they did not go far enough. ""We are not going to vote down a package of restrictions because restrictions are needed,"" he said. A senior government source branded Sir Keir a ""shameless opportunist"", saying he was ""playing political games in the middle of a global pandemic"". The Liverpool region will enter a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of the new three-tier system for coronavirus restrictions in England.  Most parts of England are on the lowest tier, but Essex has asked to be moved to ""high"" level restrictions.  Meanwhile, London could be put in a stricter lockdown within days, Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government examines a ""wide range of different data"" and takes advice from health experts before deciding which tier applies to an area. ""We look not only at infection rates but also the rate of positive tests, admissions to hospitals, and admissions to intensive care units,"" they said. A committee of senior government health officials have been considering putting Greater Manchester and Lancashire into the highest level of restrictions and will hold a further meeting on Wednesday. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, said the government ""risks confusing people"" in the region just days after it was put in the second highest tier, adding ""unfunded restrictions are unfair"". In other developments:  The 143 new deaths reported is clearly a concern.  It is the highest daily figure since early June and feels significant, even taking into account the impact of the delayed reporting at the weekend which often pushes up the figures on a Tuesday. But to understand what is happening you have to rewind a month or so and look at cases.  Cases were rising rapidly then - it is what promoted the government's senior advisers to warn there could be 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. That has not happened. Just over 17,000 were announced today.  The trajectory has not been as steep as it could have been. We have seen a similar pattern happen with hospital admissions. They are rising, but over the last week the rate of increase has slowed just a little. Deaths will, sadly, continue to go up in the coming days and weeks, but if the patterns seen with cases and hospital admissions are sustained those rises will slow too. It is very, very different from the rapid surge we saw in the spring.  But a gradual and slow continual rise could still have a devastating impact over the long autumn and winter period. That is why we are seeing politicians and scientists argue about what is the best way to contain the virus, while limiting the impact restrictions have on wider society and the economy."
Yield Spread Analysis,'Land of heat and glory' after Ashes victory,2024-09-14,2019-08-25,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-49469105,"England cricketer Ben Stokes is pictured across the front pages, arms spread wide with bat held aloft, as he celebrates having led England to an unlikely comeback victory over Australia in the third Ashes Test at Headingley. ""Big Ben strikes again,"" says the Daily Star, remembering what the Guardian calls a Stokes ""masterclass"" that helped win the World Cup for his nation. The Daily Mail says England's cricketers and the scorching weather have combined to leave the country ""glowing"".  Meanwhile, the Sun says Australia were ""shell-shocked"" by Stokes' heroics - and that the odds on him being knighted have been slashed, to five-to-one. ""For a game perpetually teetering on the edge of crisis,"" writes Alex Massie on the Spectator website, ""cricket's in pretty good shape when it comes at you like this."" Papers in Australia are full of grudging admiration. ""Stokes revives the ghost of Botham,"" is the headline for The Australian, which says the country's prime minister is expecting a ribbing from British counterpart Boris Johnson when the two meet at the G7 summit in Biarritz later. The Australian players were left in a ""world of pain"", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. But, the paper says, in time they will appreciate they were part of something truly astonishing. Meanwhile, the Times makes mention of Stokes' final batting partner Jack Leach, whom it describes as a ""bespectacled number eleven of limited batting ability - but of giant heart"".  Without him, the paper says, Stokes might not have walked into Ashes immortality.  Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Times highlights Mr Johnson's remark in Biarritz that Britain could ""easily"" cope with the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal.  The paper says talks with the European Council President Donald Tusk failed to yield a significant breakthrough, with EU officials warning afterwards it's ""squarely and firmly"" up to the UK to find a solution to the Irish border issue.  The website Politico says the prime minister made plenty of noise in southern France but his bark proved worse than his bite.  It says the question of whether or not Britain would pay the Brexit divorce bill in full didn't even come up in the discussions. Meanwhile, Donald Trump ""barely seemed to notice"" Mr Johnson's intervention on the US-China trade war, it says. There's plenty of analysis of the prime minister's first meeting with the US president, with the Guardian describing them ""joshing and joking"" before breakfast.  The Daily Mirror says they ""began a bromance"" but cautions that you can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep. For the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson showed he was ""no poodle"" - unlike Tony Blair - when he pressed the president for concessions in a post-Brexit trade deal. The Daily Express and the Daily Mirror lead on the prime minister's call for the BBC to ""cough up"", and fund free television licences for all over-75s. A Downing Street source tells the Express the PM feels ""very strongly about"" the matter and isn't about to let the BBC ""off the hook"".  The Mirror notes that Mr Johnson made his demand despite finding billions to plan for the ""chaos"" of a likely no-deal Brexit. There's been a sharp rise in the number of patients whose hospital appointments are repeatedly cancelled, according to the Daily Telegraph, which says it has left some people waiting years to see a doctor. Figures obtained by the paper - from about half the NHS trusts in England - show that between 2016 and 2019, the number of patients with five or more cancelled appointments tripled to more than 13,000. The Telegraph says in some cases notice was only given the night before, in letters dispatched by taxi. An NHS spokesman acknowledges to the paper that cancelled appointments are inconvenient but says the overall proportion remains low.  Finally, the US website Axios reports that President Trump has repeatedly suggested dropping nuclear bombs on hurricanes to prevent them reaching the United States. A source describes how in a White House meeting Mr Trump said ""I got it, I got it - why don't we nuke them?"" A different official defends the president, saying ""his objective is not bad"". Axios points out that the idea is not new; it was first floated by a government scientist in the Eisenhower era. But it says the US government has in the past pointed out that even if the path of a storm was altered, radioactive fallout would drift over land, causing environmental devastation."
Yield Spread Analysis,FBI busts 'plot' to abduct US governor,2024-09-14,2020-10-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54470427,"The FBI says it has thwarted a plot to abduct and overthrow Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Mrs Whitmer has become a target for coronavirus sceptics after enacting strict measures that were overturned by a judge last week. Officials say the kidnapping plot involved six men who planned to hold a ""treason trial"" for her.  ""Hatred, bigotry and violence have no place"" in Michigan, Mrs Whitmer said, describing the accused as ""depraved"". According to a sworn FBI affidavit, an undercover law enforcement source attended a June meeting in Dublin, Ohio, where a group of Michigan-based militia members discussed overthrowing state governments ""that they believed were violating the US Constitution"". ""Several members talked about murdering 'tyrants' or 'taking' a sitting governor,"" the charging document states. In one video, a suspect denounced the state's role in deciding when to reopen gyms during the coronavirus lockdown. The men met in a basement that was accessed by a trapdoor hidden under a rug, investigators say. Their phones were gathered and placed in another room to avoid secret recordings, but the undercover FBI source was wearing a separate recording device. Thirteen people were arrested by investigators.  Six men - five from Michigan and one from Delaware - are accused in federal court of plotting the kidnap. They allegedly planned to hold a ""treason trial"" against Mrs Whitmer. These six were named as Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, Brandon Casert and Ty Garbin. Mr Garbin's residence, in a trailer park, was raided by authorities on Wednesday. The other seven face charges of terrorism and gang-related offences in state court in connection with the alleged abduction plot. They are Paul Bellar, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison. The group wished to gather about ""200 men"" to storm the capitol building and take hostages, including the governor. They hoped to enact their plan before the November presidential election. If that failed, they planned to attack the governor at her home, officials say. The accused ""co-ordinated surveillance of the governor's vacation home"", said the US Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, adding that they also planned Molotov cocktail attacks on police officers, purchased a taser, and pooled their funds to purchase explosives and tactical equipment. The accused held weapons training in several states, and at times attempted to create bombs, the FBI says, adding that their training was captured on video. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said that separate to the kidnapping charges seven members of the ""wolverine watchmen"" militia will be charged by the state with gang affiliation and providing material support to terrorists. Ms Nessel said the arrested militia members hoped to start a civil war. It's been reported that these men have links to a militia group called the Boogaloo Bois. This is a movement that has grown online.  It's actually quite hard to describe the motives of the group. It's not ""right-wing"" in a traditional sense. Members of the movement are vehemently against law enforcement - some have been arrested for killing police officers. Broadly speaking, they are extremist libertarians - think Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, but with guns.  The term ""Boogaloo"" is usually a reference to a civil war. They have an entrenched hatred of big government - confusingly they are also often pro-Trump, though not exclusively. Hence why their ire is often focused on state rather than federal government.  Social media took a long time to act on Boogaloo. Facebook removed a number of Boogaloo groups in June - including the group that these men were allegedly part of. I showed TikTok of a series of Boogaloo videos that were on its platform back in July. Even now it's very easy to find Boogaloo videos on social media - the hashtags they use often change so it's hard to keep up.  This story shows how important it is to monitor social media platforms for extremist content - before it leads to violence.  ""Michigan law enforcement officers are united in our commitment to rooting out terrorism in any form and we will take swift action against anyone seeking to cause violence or harm in our state,"" Colonel Joe Gasper, director of the Michigan State Police, said in a statement announcing charges against the ""wolverine watchmen"". In a press conference on Thursday, the governor tied the plot against her to the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who she said had spent the last several months ""stoking distrust, fomenting anger and giving comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division"". In April, Mr Trump implied support for the protesters, tweeting ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"". A month later, armed protesters opposed to the lockdown stormed the state capitol.  Michigan's attorney general confirmed on Thursday night that two men photographed at that May protest are among the arrested plot suspects. On Thursday night, Mr Trump, a Republican, sought to take credit for federal investigators eliminating the alleged threat to the governor. ""Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist - while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities,"" he tweeted. The Midwestern state of Michigan could prove pivotal in the outcome of next month's US presidential election. Joe Biden, the Democratic White House challenger to Mr Trump, condemned militias as ""a genuine threat"" and said Mr Trump's ""liberate"" tweet encouraged militias. ""The words of a president matter,"" he said, adding: ""Why can't the president just say stop, stop, stop, stop?"" Numerous violent incidents have been linked to citizen militia groups across the US in recent years. Adherents, who are often white men, sometimes brandish weapons during protests. The Department of Homeland Security warned this week in an annual report that violent white supremacy was the ""most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland"". Mrs Whitmer's lockdown orders drew thousands of protesters to the state capitol, where many compared her to German dictator Adolf Hitler.  ""None of us has faced a challenge like Covid-19,"" Mrs Whitmer said on Thursday. ""We are not one another's enemy. This virus is our enemy, and this enemy is relentless.""  Last Friday, the state's Supreme Court ruled that Mrs Whitmer did not have the legal authority to issue emergency executive orders and that that responsibility belonged to the state's legislature. Following the ruling, the attorney who argued the case before the top court advised citizens to ""burn your masks"", which health officials say are necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  "
Yield Spread Analysis,"PM vows more virus tests as UK deaths exceed 2,000",2024-09-14,2020-04-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52122761,"The government is facing growing pressure to ramp up coronavirus testing, as the UK saw its biggest daily increase in deaths. Some 2,352 virus patients had died in hospital as of 17:00 on Tuesday - up 563 in a day, the latest figures show. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said testing was ""massively increasing"" and it was ""the way through"" the pandemic. Meanwhile a major international climate meeting, COP26, is the latest event to be postponed as a result of the virus. The climate talks were due to take place at Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus in November - which is being turned into a temporary field hospital to treat coronavirus patients. The UN's climate body, the UNFCCC, and the UK government said the summit would be pushed back to 2021. In a video message posted on Twitter, the prime minister said Wednesday had been a ""sad, sad day"" due to the high number of deaths in the UK. Mr Johnson, who is self-isolating in Downing Street after contracting the virus, also reiterated the government's commitment to ""ramp up"" testing. He said: ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" The government has been under pressure to increase the screening of medics, so that those who are self-isolating unnecessarily can return to work. More than 3,500 NHS frontline staff in England and Wales have been tested for the virus since the outbreak began. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said a shortage of chemicals needed for the tests meant the NHS - which employs 1.2m in England - could not screen all workers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was working with NHS England, Public Health England and other organisations to boost test capacity with an additional network of labs and testing sites.  Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England medical director, told a daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street that there was currently capacity for about 3,000 tests a day for frontline NHS staff. She said the ""intention"" was for testing for frontline staff to increase from ""thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks"". The World Health Organization has said the world is set to reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide in the next few days. Dr Doyle said the UK was not in ""as severe"" a position as Spain, the US or Italy, but added there was ""no reason to be complacent"". She said while the spread of the virus was most advanced in London, the Midlands was ""obviously a concern"" too.  As of 9:00 on Wednesday, 152,979 people in the UK had been tested for the virus with 29,474 confirmed positive. This includes 4,139 cases in the Midlands and 8,341 in London. Dr Doyle added while use of public transport had gone down since the government enforced social distancing measures, an ""up-tick"" in motor vehicle use in the last 24 hours was ""slightly concerning"". She urged members of the public to stay home to ""protect the NHS"". The number of questions about the lack of testing at the daily press conference came as no surprise. The government has been heavily criticised for not increasing testing capacity more quickly. Dr Doyle said she was confident the UK would achieve the target of 25,000 tests a day by the end of the month. There is some way to go - over the past 24 hours just shy of 10,000 tests have been done. The lack of tests means NHS staff have had to self-isolate at home when members of their household show symptoms. News that there are going to be five drive-through centres for staff will also help. But it was interesting Dr Doyle was also asked by how much more testing can be increased by in the long-term. If the number of cases does come down, testing will play a crucial role in allowing the lockdown to be eased. The plan would be to contain the virus by testing lots of people quickly. That will require the UK to be able to tests hundreds of thousands of people a day. A doctor who came out of retirement to volunteer for the NHS has become the fourth UK medic to die with the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19. Dr Alfa Sa'adu, 68, had been volunteering at Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn when he contracted coronavirus. His son Dani Saadu posted online that his dad had died after ""fighting the virus for two weeks"". ""My dad was a living legend, worked for the NHS for nearly 40 years saving people's lives here and in Africa,"" he said. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the latest increases in the number of patients dying with coronavirus balance out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. He said the number of new deaths has been increasing at a slightly slower rate than earlier in the epidemic, ""but if that keeps up, we'd expect to see in the region of a thousand deaths a day by the weekend"". Downing Street said 390 million pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks, alcohol wipes and aprons, have been delivered to NHS staff over the last two weeks. The prime minister's official spokesperson said the government was working with a number of suppliers which had come forward with offers of PPE, or proposals to manufacture more. It follows criticism from some frontline workers over the lack of protective equipment, with staff at one hospital in Essex warning they could ""limit services"" to patients with coronavirus ""to a bare minimum"" over fears for their own safety. The prime minister's spokesperson also said the NHS will be sent 30 new ventilators next week and promised ""hundreds"" more would follow. The NHS is reported to have 8,175 ventilators and the government believes up to 30,000 ventilators could be needed at the peak of the pandemic. In other developments:   Do you work in the NHS?

Yield Spread Analysis,Did life hitch a ride to Earth?,2024-09-14,2023-10-07,Roberto Battiston,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231006-how-life-might-hitchhike-its-way-through-the-galaxy,"Long distance space travel is still beyond human reach. But other forms of life may already be hitching a ride from one planetary system to another. By the time we realised that there was an extrasolar intruder, 'Oumuamua, named after the Hawaiian word for ""scout"", had already passed its closest point to the Sun and was leaving, as fast and stealthily as it had arrived. We are talking about the first sighting, in 2017, of an asteroid-like object from another area of the galaxy, a messenger from distant worlds. What do we know about this dark, probably cigar-shaped shard, which visited our Solar System with a trajectory and velocity that allowed it to leave so quickly? Comment and analysis Roberto Battiston is a physicist at the University of Trento, Italy,  and author of several books, including ""First Dawn: From the Big Bang to Our Future in Space"", from which this article is adapted. Very little. We know that it was probably not made of nitrogen ice. It did not visibly ignite like a comet as it approached the Sun. We know that it does not emit electromagnetic radiation. The most powerful radio telescopes have found no trace of it. Its orbit is gravitational, determined by the attraction of the Sun; a small, non-inertial component could be explained by the effect of the pressure of the radiation in our star's vicinity. We know that its speed, before entering the Solar System, was compatible with the characteristic speeds of celestial bodies in the region of the Milky Way, of which our Solar System is part. This allows us to exclude the idea that it comes from one of the dozen stars closest to us, as its velocity would have been too high. We have, however, identified four more distant stars near which it could have passed in the past million years, with a velocity low enough that it could have originated in one of these star systems. So, we don't know exactly where it comes from, if it has already been in our Solar System, how many other systems it has visited, or its composition (some reports suggest it may be formed of hydrogen ice). According to one hypothesis, it could be a fragment of an exoplanet destroyed by tidal effects (the tug of gravity from other nearby objects). In this case it would be an object much rarer than main belt asteroids or objects from the Oort Cloud, which formed directly from the original nebula that collapsed to form the Sun and planets around 4.5 billion years ago. What is certain is that, on timescales of the order of millions or tens of millions of years, fragments like 'Oumuamua can bring different star systems into contact. One estimate even predicts that 10,000 extrasolar asteroids cross Neptune's orbit on a daily basis. It would be interesting to be able to explore one to see what it was made of. This type of object would seem to be the kind of vector suitable for transporting life, in hibernating form, from one part of the galaxy to another. While a space mission of this kind would be difficult because of the speed at which these fragments are moving, it wouldn't be impossible, considering that in the future our observational capacity will improve considerably, allowing us to identify these bodies sooner than we were able to identify 'Oumuamua. Another idea has to do with the possibility that some of these extrasolar objects have become trapped in our Solar System after having lost some of their energy in a close encounter with Jupiter. A few candidates have already been identified. This approach would make an exploratory mission much easier to accomplish. However, even the planets in our own Solar System are in communication and exchanging material at a fairly high rate. Not everyone knows that we have around a couple of hundred rock samples from Mars here on Earth, even though there has not yet been a mission that brought back material from that planet. The meteorite bombardment on Mars results in fragments that, given its thin atmosphere, can be projected into space. Some of them can reach the Earth, penetrate our atmosphere, and fall like normal meteorites. By comparing the isotopic composition of various meteorites with those measured on Mars during NASA's robotic missions to the planet, we are able to identify and distinguish Martian meteorites from all the others. Finally, we should remember that it takes the Solar System about 230 million years to revolve around the centre of the galaxy. Since it formed 4.5 billion years ago, it has made the full circuit about 20 times. This means that, in the timescale in which life emerged on Earth, the newborn Solar System had many opportunities to come into contact with fragments from distant star systems. In 2019 I participated in a Breakthrough Discuss conference in Berkeley on ""Migration of Life in the Universe"". I was puzzled by the conference theme: we know almost nothing about life in the Universe, I thought, so how we could talk about migration of life? But recalling the observation of 'Oumuamua, I did participate and I am glad I did. I was surprised by the scientific quality of the talks and by the extreme fascination of the topic. Life probably doesn't need massive, rocky starships to move from one planetary system to another. Considering the minuscule size of bacteria, the smallest living organisms we know, or even viruses, which can live and reproduce inside bacteria, we can also imagine other mechanisms suitable for this kind of transport. You might also like: Microscopic ice crystals and dust, for example, containing bacteria and spores capable of withstanding the conditions in space, can spread into space from areas of a planet's upper atmosphere. When the dimensions become microscopic, the relationship between gravitational force, which is dependent on mass, and the thrust due to stellar radiation, which is dependent on surface area, tips the balance in favour of the latter. It is as if a planet were leaving a trail of perfume behind it. Planetary dust containing hibernating life can be pushed by radiation until it reaches high velocities and potentially moves beyond a given star system, spreading to other systems or nebulae, where it can find suitable conditions to reproduce and evolve. We are used to thinking of space as vast and mostly empty, completely unsuitable for life. Perhaps we should change our minds. Space is less empty than we might think. In reality, the different parts of the galaxy communicate by exchanging material on timescales comparable to those of the appearance of life on our planet. But how possible is it for life to survive in space? Well, even here, nature surprises us. In fact, we know of various living species that can endure extremely hostile conditions such as those in space: a nearly perfect vacuum, extreme temperatures, and ionising radiation. Different kinds of lichens, bacteria, and spores are able to survive, losing all of their water and entering into a condition of total inactivity – which can last for long periods – from which they can emerge, once they find themselves in a humid atmosphere again. Tests of this kind have been done on the International Space Station and in various laboratories (although these tests are on the scale of months and years rather than hundreds, thousands or even millions of years). One truly extraordinary case is that of the tardigrades. These very common micro-animals are about a half a millimetre long and live in water. They have eight legs, a mouth and a digestive system, as well as a simple nerve and brain structure. They are also able to sexually reproduce. They exist in nature in thousands of different versions and have a metabolism with unique characteristics. In order to withstand prolonged drought conditions, their bodies can achieve complete dehydration, losing around 90% of their water and curling up into a tiny, barrel-shaped structure. In other words, it's as if they freeze-dry themselves. Once this process is complete, their metabolism becomes 100 times slower. The most amazing thing is that they can stay in this state for decades, only to wake up again within several hours once exposed to moisture. But there's more. When in a dehydrated state, they can withstand the vacuum of space as well as pressures higher than normal atmospheric pressures, temperatures near absolute zero or temperatures up to 150C (302F). Their radiation tolerance threshold is hundreds of times higher than what would be deadly for humans. The secret of their ability to harden is partly due to a sugar, trehalose, which is also widely used in the food industry. When dried, this sugar replaces the water molecules in the cells, leaving the animal in a kind of vitrified state.  In addition, the tardigrade's DNA is protected by a protein that reduces radiation damage. Is this information enough to make us assume that these micro-animals come from space? I would say no. Their unusual metabolism is more likely the result of evolutionary adaptation that happened on our planet. In fact, tardigrades are among the very few living beings that have emerged unscathed from all five mass extinction events that have occurred on Earth. That is why they are the best candidates for a long journey into space aboard a meteorite or a comet. Recently, tardigrades have achieved a bit of media notoriety resulting from the Beresheet1 mission, a private probe launched by Israel, that crashed on the Moon in early April of 2019. The probe was carrying a colony of these micro-animals, in their dehydrated state. Given their microscopic size, it is possible that they survived the crash and will remain inactive for a long time to come, ready to be reawakened from their hibernation. By replacing the Israeli probe with an asteroid or a comet, we have a textbook example of how life might have arrived on Earth. Or how life could have migrated from Earth to other planets in our galaxy. So, the problem of the origin of life remains open, even if, step by step, we are making progress toward a solution. In the last decade, increasingly powerful calculation instruments have allowed us to reproduce, starting from the first principles of quantum mechanics, the formation of increasingly large and complex molecular systems, now made up of thousands of atoms. The field of computational biology is growing at a formidable rate; it is now only a matter of computing power. At the same time we have dramatically developed our ability to decode and manipulate DNA, up to the creation of the first simplified genomic structures, derived from living organisms and able to reproduce. We are now talking about synthetic life, built around human-designed DNA, a field with huge development prospects. Therefore, it is likely that the creation of the complex molecular structures needed for life or the confirmation of the existence of islands of genomic stability in the evolution of viral and bacterial species are objectives that, in future, will be within our reach. At that point, we will have another tool for understanding how life on Earth developed. Who knows? Perhaps we will discover that aliens are particular biological life forms that have lived with us all along. * This article originally appeared in The MIT Press Reader, and is republished with permission.

Yield Spread Analysis,China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory,2024-09-14,2021-05-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57267729,"China has denounced US efforts to further investigate whether Covid-19 came from a Chinese lab. US President Joe Biden has said he expects to release the results of an intelligence report on the origins of the virus.  China's foreign ministry accused the US of ""political manipulation and blame shifting"". It has rejected any link between Covid-19 and a virus research lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019. Since then, more than 168 million cases have been confirmed worldwide and about 3.5 million deaths reported. Chinese officials linked early Covid cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise that the virus had first passed to humans from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus spread from a lab leak, following a visit to Wuhan earlier this year to investigate the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.  WHO virologist Marion Koopmans, who was part of that field visit, told the BBC that if the US authorities had any information they should share it. But recent US media reports have suggested growing evidence the virus could instead have emerged from a laboratory in China, perhaps through an accidental leak. In a statement on Wednesday, President Biden said he had asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office, ""including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident"". On receiving it this month, he asked for ""additional follow-up"". Mr Biden said the majority of the intelligence community had ""coalesced"" around those two scenarios, but ""do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other"". He said he had now asked agencies to ""redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion"". On Thursday, Mr Biden told reporters he planned to release the report ""unless there's something I'm unaware of"".  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau then voiced his support for efforts made by the US and other countries to better understand the origins of the virus. Wednesday's announcement angered Chinese officials. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it showed the US ""does not care about facts or truth, and has zero interest in a serious science-based study of origins"". ""Their aim is to use the pandemic to pursue stigmatisation, political manipulation and blame shifting. They are being disrespectful to science, irresponsible to people's lives and counter-productive to the concerted efforts to fight the virus,"" he said. The spokesman also said US intelligence agencies had a ""dark history"" of spreading misinformation. A statement from the Chinese embassy in the US, which did not directly refer to Mr Biden's order, said ""smear campaigns and blame shifting are making a comeback"".  Readers now long used to articles dismissing the lab-leak theory as a dangerous, fringe conspiracy may be slightly bemused to find it suddenly front-page, presented as an entirely plausible possibility. The truth is, there's always been plenty of circumstantial evidence to support both competing theories. A zoonotic origin, in which the virus passes naturally from bat to humans, is supported by the fact that coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier in exactly this way before.  There are also plenty of precedents for lab leaks in which researchers get accidentally infected by the virus they're working on. The Wuhan outbreak happens to be on the doorstep of the world's leading laboratory for the collection, study and experimentation on bat coronaviruses. What's changed is not the evidence - of which there is none so far to prove either scenario - but the politics. The lab-leak theory, born into an environment poisoned by disinformation, was undermined not so much by China's denials, but by the fact it was being pumped by former US President Donald Trump. Media organisations everywhere gave it the cold shoulder. My own attempts to look seriously at the lab-leak theory in May last year ran into long and fraught editorial discussions before it finally made it to publication. The prevailing narrative has also loomed large over the science. Despite the dominant voices of some leading virologists insisting that only a zoonotic origin needed be investigated, a determined group of scientists has continued to argue that both scenarios should remain on the table.  It may be too late, of course. Wherever the debate goes now, China is extremely unlikely to allow another investigation on its soil.  Speculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by Mr Trump. US state department cables came to light in April 2020 that showed embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report written jointly with Chinese scientists on the origins of Covid-19 which said the chances of it having started in a lab were ""extremely unlikely"". It said the virus had probably jumped from bats to humans via another intermediary animal, but that more research was needed. A WHO spokesperson on Thursday reiterated to the BBC that further studies were needed ""in a range of areas, including on the early detection of cases and clusters, and the potential roles of animal markets, transmission via the food chain and the laboratory incident hypothesis"". The laboratory theory has received increased public attention in the US amid recent reports attributed to intelligence sources that say three members of the Wuhan Institute of Virology were admitted to hospital in November 2019, several weeks before China acknowledged the first case of the new disease in the community. Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, has maintained he believes the virus was passed from animals to humans, though he conceded this month he was no longer confident Covid-19 had developed naturally. Mr Biden's order for further investigations came the day after Xavier Becerra, US secretary for health and human services, urged the WHO to ensure a ""transparent"" investigation into the virus's origins. ""Phase 2 of the Covid origins study must be launched with terms of reference that are transparent, science-based and give international experts the independence to fully assess the source of the virus and the early days of the outbreak,"" he said. While there is still no evidence to suggest it is man-made, Facebook on Thursday said that in light of the ongoing investigations and in consultation with public health experts it would ""no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made from our apps"". ""We're continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge,"" it said. "
Yield Spread Analysis,World Bank warns of 'human catastrophe' food crisis,2024-09-14,2022-04-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61171529,"The world faces a ""human catastrophe"" from a food crisis arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, World Bank president David Malpass has said. He told the BBC that record rises in food prices would push hundreds of millions people into poverty and lower nutrition, if the crisis continues. The World Bank calculates there could be a ""huge"" 37% jump in food prices. This would hit the poor hardest, who will ""eat less and have less money for anything else such as schooling"". In an interview with BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, Mr Malpass, who leads the institution charged with global alleviation of poverty, said the impact on the poor made it ""an unfair kind of crisis... that was true also of Covid"". ""It's a human catastrophe, meaning nutrition goes down. But then it also becomes a political challenge for governments who can't do anything about it, they didn't cause it and they see the prices going up,"" he said on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington. The price rises are broad and deep, he said: ""It's affecting food of all different kinds oils, grains, and then it gets into other crops, corn crops, because they go up when wheat goes up"". There was enough food in the world to feed everybody, he said, and global stockpiles are large by historical standards, but there will have to be a sharing or sales process to get the food to where it is needed. Mr Malpass also discouraged countries from subsidising production or capping prices. Instead, he said, the focus needed to be on increasing supplies across the world of fertilisers and food, alongside targeted assistance for the very poorest people. The World Bank chief also warned of a knock on ""crisis within a crisis"" arising from the inability of developing countries to service their large pandemic debts, amid rising food and energy prices. ""This is a very real prospect. It's happening for some countries, we don't know how far it'll go. As many as 60% of the poorest countries right now are either in debt distress or at high risk of being in debt distress,"" he said. ""We have to be worried about a debt crisis, the best thing to do is to start early to act early on finding ways to reduce the debt burden for countries that are on have unsustainable debt, the longer you put it off, the worse it is,"" he added. The acknowledgement by the World Bank president that we have to be worried about a developing country debt crisis, is very significant.  The combination of massive pandemic debts with rising interest rates, and rising prices is truly toxic.  The talk on the sidelines here at the IMF and World Bank meetings is that the rich countries told emerging economies not to worry about borrowing in order to spend to help suppress the pandemic. Now those countries are wondering if these record debts will be written off.  Campaigning groups are preparing mobilisations over a pandemic debt jubilee. But there is silence from the rich country lenders, so far.  And there is a very new dynamic these days. The bankers to whom these sums are owed are no longer just in the West. China is now, very broadly, owed as much as the entire collection of Western creditors known as the Paris Club.  How will it respond to calls for leniency on the repayment of loans?  Mr Malpass says of China: ""They have different rules, for example, contracts that have non-disclosure clauses, meaning you can't share the terms with other people that makes it very hard to restructure those debts"". China has also secured its lending against ports and natural resources. Sri Lanka is a case in point right now. The unwinding of all of this might not be orderly, and could have significant geopolitical consequences. Earlier this month, the United Nations said that the Ukraine war had led to a ""giant leap"" in food prices, as they hit a new record high in March.  It came as the war cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil and the cost of alternatives climbed. Ukraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat which have risen sharply in price too. The UN said ""war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils"". The UN Food Prices Index tracks the world's most-traded food commodities - measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar. Food prices are at their highest since records began 60 years ago, according to the index, after they jumped nearly 13% in March, following February's record high. Food commodity prices were already at 10-year highs before the war in Ukraine, according to the index, because of global harvest issues."
Yield Spread Analysis,Rodgers' Celtic win controversial Old Firm derby,2024-09-14,2023-09-03,Nick McPheat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66631549,"Kyogo Furuhashi's sixth Old Firm goal concluded a frenetic first half at Ibrox Brendan Rodgers answered early questions surrounding his second Celtic tenure by delivering a statement Old Firm win over Rangers in a controversial derby in the Scottish Premiership. Kyogo Furuhashi provided the decisive moment once again in this fixture, capitalising on slack defending by the home defence just before the break at Ibrox to ruthlessly lash in his sixth goal in five starts in the fixture. But the Japan forward's strike came after Rabbi Matondo had an offside effort disallowed inside the first minute, before Kemar Roofe had another chalked off for Cyriel Dessers' contentious foul on Gustaf Lagerbielke. The Celtic centre-back appeared to kick through the back of the Rangers striker while being dispossessed, but referee Don Robertson opted to rule the goal out after an on-field VAR review. Michael Beale stressed the importance to ""lay down a marker"" pre-match following Wednesday's Champions League humiliation in Eindhoven, but instead more pressure will now build on the Ibrox boss, who has just one win from six derbies. Celtic, whose depleted defence consisted of a centre-back pairing of Lagerbielke and Liam Scales making their Old Firm debuts, just about held firm after the interval with the help of goalkeeper Joe Hart to help Rodgers' men move four clear of their fiercest rivals and go top by two points. Reaction & as it happened How Celtic 'stood up' to seize Rangers' 'big opportunity' Everything Rangers - go straight to all the best content Visit our Celtic page for all the latest news, views & analysis Old Firm management is a pressure cooker at the best of times, but prior to Sunday it was difficult to think of a derby in which both managers went into the fixture feeling a similar amount of heat. Rodgers, still trying to win over a chunk of the Celtic fanbase since his return, came into the game off the back of a Viaplay Cup exit at Kilmarnock a fortnight ago and a goalless draw at home to St Johnstone last week. Beale, who also suffered defeat at Rugby Park in the first league game of the season, was fresh off a chastening 5-1 second-leg defeat to PSV in a failed Champions League qualifying campaign.  So it was little wonder that in a cauldron of noise at Ibrox, which was completely packed with home fans, both sets of players took turns in handling the pressure better. Sandwiched between Rangers' ruled out strikes, Kyogo failed to connect from close range and saw a finish cleared off the line by Connor Goldson, before firing over when he should have teed up Liel Abada, who had just forced Jack Butland into a superb fingertip save. The remainder of the game was about Celtic's defensive resistance and Rangers' lack of clinical edge, which was laid bare by Sam Lammers' glaring miss when he rounded Hart, who then made two key stops to deny Danilo in the dying stages. After a shaky opening period, the Celtic centre-back - making his Old Firm debut - delivered a colossal second-half display at the heart of a makeshift defence ""When you have a big opportunity, you need big performances,"" were the words of Beale pre-match. Against a depleted Celtic defence, that opportunity was there for his players, but again they failed to grasp it. Rightly or wrongly, a lot of the Rangers focus will be on Roofe's disallowed goal, but that simply cannot detract attention from another defensive lapse which has decided a derby. A simple Matt O'Riley header over the top caught John Souttar too deep in the hosts' defensive line, allowing Kyogo to dispatch a clinical finish from an onside position. What Beale would do for someone with the ruthless streak of the Japan striker, who had just nine touches in the game - four of which were shots. Instead, his recent attacking recruits are doing little to inspire. The Rangers boss' decision to start Roofe and Matondo perhaps highlights that he is also yet to be convinced by the recent arrivals. On the flipside, this win - Rodgers' 10th from 13 derbies - will swat away minor doubts that were threatening to build up in the infancy of his second spell at the club. Based on this evidence, there is nothing to suggest that Celtic's dominance will come to a halt, especially with a serial winner at the helm. This video can not be played 'It's been a rough week' - Beale Rangers manager Michael Beale: ""Having seen [Roofe's disallowed goal] back, he kicks Cyriel [Dessers], so I think it's a harsh call. I think that's one that's gone against us, but there's a lot of time to play in the game. ""The [Celtic] goal is an error on our part, a huge error. Second half, we pushed and pushed, but you'd like us to be more inventive and ruthless because the chances were there. It's a desperately disappointing day for everybody. It's been a rough week."" Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: ""It's a massive result for the squad when you consider virtually half the team is unavailable. To come here and keep a clean sheet, with not one away supporter in the stadium, is brilliant. ""It's a great finish from Kyogo, and it puts us in a position that I thought we deserved at half-time. The players stood up. Liam [Scales] was outstanding. A lot of the new players needed that big win to feel what the intensity is like at a club like Celtic.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Leeds show fight and clearer plan to beat Wolves,2024-09-14,2022-08-05,Phil Dawkes,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62358052,"Brenden Aaronson (centre) was one of four debutants in the Leeds side for the win over Wolves As the final whistle blew on Leeds' feisty and fierce opening-game victory over Wolves, the Elland Road crowd roared their delight, the players punched the air and manager Jesse Marsch almost came to blows with opposite number Bruno Lage. 'I Predict A Riot' has never felt a more appropriate soundtrack. The Kaiser Chiefs song, with its growling depiction of menace and confrontation on the streets of the band's hometown, is now an anthem at Elland Road following home victories - and could well be a template for how Marsch wants his team to front up. In this soft reboot of the determined but ragged side that salvaged safety on the final day of last season, there was energy, endeavour and more than a little appetite for a fight as they battled their way back from Daniel Podence's early goal to seal victory. Rodrigo fired them level with an angled drive in the first half and Ryan Ait-Nouri found his own net for the winner. In between there was a lot of harrying, high pressing and hearty tackles. There was also a wobble, when Wolves came on strong and perilously close to exposing the weaknesses in Marsch's side for 25 minutes after half-time. Had the visitors a more ruthless centre-forward - such as the injured Raul Jimenez - to fire the ammunition provided by Podence and Pedro Neto, they would likely have three points themselves. Instead, though, Leeds had the final word on the pitch, leaving Marsch and Lage to argue over who would claim it on the touchline. Reaction and analysis from Saturday's Premier League games, including Leeds v Wolves This video can not be played Marsch impressed by debutants in Leeds win After the game, Marsch played down the argument, describing it as ""nothing, really"" and ""normal in a lot of ways"". This left the Portuguese boss to provide greater clarity on something that had been brewing throughout the match. ""In the first half, there were things that we cannot say, especially in these days, and I heard that. So if someone wants to apologise to me, it should be in that moment, not in the end when you've won the game,"" he said. ""There were plenty of moments between the first half and the end of the game when we could have shaken hands and apologised - it didn't happen and in the end it's more difficult to accept because there was a long time to do that. ""There's nothing wrong between the managers. Life goes on."" What is clear from the end of last season and the early stages of this is that Marsch is not a man to take a backward step, nor does he expect his teams to do so. There is a famous image from his playing days with Chivas USA of the then midfielder nose-to-nose with LA Galaxy's David Beckham after having booted the ex-England player in the stomach. Undaunted by his rival's reputation, Marsch stands his ground. Marsch played for a number of Major League Soccer sides before moving into coaching One thing he will not be is cowed by the managerial microscope under which he now sits, stripped of the shielding set of dire circumstances which surrounded the club when he was appointed. Marsch deserves huge credit for his role in driving Leeds to the points they needed to survive relegation in 2021-22 - often seemingly through determination rather than design - but now he needs to be a man with a plan. With four debutants on the field and a fit-again Patrick Bamford to lead the attack, there were certainly clearer signs of one. Some parts worked better than others. Tyler Adams and Marc Roca showed signs they can complement each other in midfield as successors to Kalvin Phillips, the former tasked with the winning the ball, the latter to distribute pinpoint forward passes. Rasmus Kristensen was all-action at full-back, but may need greater help in such a narrow formation against sides like Wolves with wide players eager to double up in attack. Most impressive of all was Brenden Aaronson, who was a constant source of energy and endeavour, some of which he used to dart into the box and force Ait-Nouri to score the winner into his own net from Bamford's cross. He lacks the outright flair of Raphinha - the man he was brought in to help replace - but in his own industrious way could prove as effective. As Marsch pointed out before the game, the team may have lost two stars, but in general it has become stronger, helped by the recent arrival of three players who have operated under the American before in Aaronson, Adams and Rasmussen. It wasn't perfect and at times threatened to topple over as Wolves came on strong after the break, but there was enough there for Leeds to believe they can avoid the trauma of last season's relegation fight. ""I am really pleased that we look like a team that understands what the tactics and ideas are with the ball much better than we did last season,"" said Marsch. ""It was a big struggle to implement tactically what we want to achieve. ""We still have a lot of work to do but the three points validates the pre-season we have had and the work we have done."" This video can not be played Wolves manager Bruno Lage says his team were the better side Wolves' deficiencies are clear to see. So are their qualities. Nathan Collins remains their only significant signing of the summer, with the ex-Burnley man making an efficient debut at Elland Road in the middle of a back four that did not include stalwart Conor Coady. With Jimenez sidelined for a few more weeks and Fabio Silva out on loan, they desperately need some firepower to complement the creative powers of their wide forwards. They finished 10th last season after having scored the fewest goals of any club to remain in the division, but to gamble on a repeat would be foolhardy. Lage was pleased with his side's performance - one that would have yielded greater reward but for key misses by Hwang Hee-chan and Leander Dendoncker - but is aware of the need for reinforcements. ""I think we did a good game,"" Lage said. ""I think we were the better team, we created a lot of chances, and we didn't score. I'm happy with the performance, but not happy with the result. ""I said before the game that we came here with big confidence, and we'll score goals because the pre-season was good and we have confidence to play in this system. I was right to feel that confidence, and we continued to play."" He added: ""It's time to be patient because we are talking with players. I know the club are talking with players and those players can come and increase the level of the team and the squad.  ""They will give solutions that we didn't have today.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Saka scores twice as England thrash Iran in opener,2024-09-14,2022-11-20,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63603382,"This video can not be played England thrash Iran in World Cup opener England's Fifa World Cup campaign opened in thoroughly convincing fashion as they outclassed Iran in an incident-packed match in Doha. Gareth Southgate's side strolled to victory, with Iran's hopeless plight made worse by the early loss of goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand to concussion after a clash of heads with team-mate Majid Hosseini.  Jude Bellingham got England off the mark in this World Cup with a soaring header from Luke Shaw's cross 10 minutes before the break and the game was wrapped up before half-time thanks to Bukayo Saka's fine strike and Raheem Sterling's classy volley with the outside of his foot from Harry Kane's cross. Saka got his second before Iran's supporters were given a moment of real delight when Mehdi Taremi scored a fine goal after 65 minutes - but England substitute Marcus Rashford then netted another smooth, composed strike with his first involvement. To put the gloss on an incredibly dominant display, Jack Grealish slotted home from close range after a good run and pull back by Callum Wilson.  Iran did pull another back in injury time when Taremi slotted in a penalty after a John Stones foul. The game was played out against the backdrop of more off-field controversy here in Qatar after England were forced to ditch plans to wear the OneLove armband promoting diversity and inclusivity under threat from Fifa of players being cautioned should they carry out the gesture of support.

Iran were expected to provide stern resistance as they reside in the top 20 in the Fifa rankings and have a recent victory against Uruguay on their record but England made light work of the task once Bellingham gave them the lead.  Bellingham is being touted as one of the big emerging names at this World Cup, the 19-year-old Borussia Dortmund star already a target for a host of the game's elite names.  And, even in the context of this game, Bellingham showed exactly why as he joined Saka as the dominant force in this game, scoring his first England goal with a magnificent header and bestriding midfield with a complete authority that belied his years.  This was only the second time England have scored six goals in a major tournament but on this evidence you would not bet against the brilliant Bellingham being involved the next time it happens.  Bellingham is a player with the world at his feet and a long career ahead of him at international level.  Southgate picked Saka ahead of Manchester City's Phil Foden, the only mildly contentious decision in his line-up, but there can be no arguments after a hugely impressive performance from the 21-year-old who has played such a big part as Arsenal head the Premier League.  Saka scored twice and was a threat throughout and thoroughly deserved the warm applause he received when he was substituted.

Iran coach Carlos Queiroz hinted at a bold approach beforehand but this was never going to be the case and once the game settled down following an opening 20 minutes littered with interruptions, this opening World Cup game was only going one way.  Iran's many fans had a moment of real joy when Taremi thumped home his finish but there was little else to celebrate in this game as their team took a heavy beating.  This was not a day without great significance, however, as both Iran's players and supporters used this global stage to make their feelings clear about the growing human rights protests against the ruling regime in their homeland.  The national anthem was shouted down by the supporters and none of the Iran players joined in.  Iran were heavily supported inside the Khalifa International Stadium and clearly regarded this as an ideal platform to make their grievances clear.

Here's your morning briefing: Research by BBC News has found the NHS across the UK is missing key targets for cancer treatment, A&E and planned operations. After analysing the data for each of the country's four nations, it can be seen that the health services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have failed to hit one of their three key targets in the past 18 months. Scotland hit its A&E target three times in the past 12 months. Figures show patients are now twice as likely to wait longer than four hours in casualty than they were four years ago. The proportion of people waiting more than 62 days for cancer treatment has risen by a third in the past four years. Nearly one in five patients now wait longer. Ministers say most patients across the UK are still being seen in time, but British Medical Association chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the situation highlighted by the BBC was ""unacceptable"". The analysis coincides with the launch of the BBC's online NHS Tracker, where you can find out how your local service is performing on three key waiting time targets. After Brexit, one of this Parliament's hottest issues is the government's rollout of Universal Credit, which combines six separate benefits into one. On Wednesday, MPs will debate the programme, amid concerns over reported delays of up to six weeks in getting payments to claimants, a situation which senior Labour backbencher Frank Field has said is causing some people to be ""pushed towards destitution"". Labour wants the rollout to be paused - the government plans to bring in Universal Credit at 50 job centres each month - and will use its debate to bring pressure on ministers. A Commons vote on Universal Credit is not binding on the government, although it has been reported that about a dozen Conservative MPs want the scheme to be put on hold.

More than 40,000 people a year in England are getting fines of £100 - from an automated system that dentists say is hitting the most vulnerable. They warn that people such as dementia sufferers are unfairly getting caught up in a system meant to stop fraudsters from getting free treatment. The fines, about £4m per year, are being applied by a random screening process that checks on whether people going to the dentist are really eligible for free treatment.

Yield Spread Analysis,Police to enforce virus lockdown with fines,2024-09-14,2020-03-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52049776,"People who do not comply with social distancing rules in Scotland could be fined by the police, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. Emergency legislation has been passed at Westminster to curb the spread of coronavirus. Ms Sturgeon said it meant Police Scotland could have new powers as early as today to enforce social distancing. There have now been 894 confirmed cases of the virus in Scotland, with 25 people having died. This was an increase of 175 confirmed cases and three deaths since Wednesday. The actual number of cases is likely to be much higher.  The new powers will allow police to hand out fixed penalties to anyone caught flouting the social distancing rules that were imposed earlier this week, which have left the whole of the UK effectively in ""lockdown"". Ms Sturgeon said these were ""last resort"" measures, but that ""ultimately this is about saving lives"". Police Scotland's Chief Constable, Iain Livingstone, told BBC Radio Four that officers would be able to instruct people to go home, and ""to use reasonable force if required"" - but said the power to make arrests was an ""absolute backstop"". People across the UK have been urged to stay at home to help slow the spread of Covid-19 and reduce pressure on health services. Only limited trips out of the house are to be permitted - for exercise, to buy vital supplies or to attend essential work - and gatherings of more than two people, unless they are from the same household, are banned. The first minister said that ""those found not to be acting in line with regulations can be made to return home"". And she said police officers will also have the power to  give out ""prohibition notices"" and to close businesses and premises if needed.  People could also be given spot fines - the level of which is currently being decided - ""and ultimately if necessary be prosecuted"", Ms Sturgeon warned.  The first minister said she hoped the new powers would not have to be used, with officers taking a ""soft approach to enforcement"" - but ""they will have the power to act if that is deemed necessary"". The first minister said she expected the ""vast majority"" of people to ""do the right thing"" and comply with social distancing voluntarily.  She said: ""This will get harder with every day that passes, to stay at home and follow all of the advice, but it remains essential that we all do so. ""This has to be a collective effort. The power to stop this epidemic rests with each and everyone of us as individuals."" Mr Livingstone later said there had been ""overwhelming levels of compliance"" with the new regulations, and that officers had already been speaking to people to ""make it very, very clear what the expectations are"". He said: ""If there is continued defiance, the absolute back-stop is a power of arrest. I would expect that to be used very, very infrequently, if at all, but I do think it is important that people know that that power is there."" The NHS in Scotland is scaling up to cope with the coronavirus crisis, and the country's chief medical officer says she believes we are behind London and the rest of England in terms of the accelerating caseload. This means the lockdown may have a bigger impact here.  However, Scotland is still facing significant capacity issues. The authorities say they are on track to double intensive care capacity, and then want to quadruple it.  The postponement of elective surgery has meant they are just short of freeing up 3,000 other hospital beds.  There has also been a lot of talk about ""field hospitals"". One interesting point made at this morning's briefing was that they are still saying the empty Sick Children's hospital in Edinburgh is not safe to use. Even if they look elsewhere, a field hospital could be for non-Covid 19 patients rather than the ""fever hospitals"" we've been seeing in China and elsewhere. Ms Sturgeon also announced that an extra 1.5 million facemasks have been ""brought back into use from the NHS Scotland central stockpile"".  These masks had passed their expiry date, but have undergone ""extensive testing which has shown them to be fit for use"". Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was no shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline health workers, with supplies being monitored ""daily"". She said: ""We are paying very close and detailed attention to the overall stock of PPE for our health and social care staff, and we have now taken over the ordering, supply and distribution of PPE to social care and care at home staff. ""As of today we have no shortages. We are increasing the distribution routes and networks to ensure the supplies people need get to where they are needed, including in remote and rural areas, as quickly as possible. ""The safety of our health and social care staff is of absolute critical importance, so we are taking every step we can to make sure they have the equipment they need, and we have orders in the pipeline to make sure stocks are replenished."""
Yield Spread Analysis,How missing weather data is a 'life and death' issue,2024-09-14,2017-11-14,By Dan Simmons,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41967241,"A shortage of weather data is putting many African countries at an economic disadvantage, experts believe. The BBC's Click team went to Tanzania to meet a tech start-up trying to change the outlook. Tanzania is at the centre of a meteorological experiment that promises to transform lives across Africa. Tech start-up, Kukua, wants to introduce hundreds of low-cost weather stations in the country and beyond, to fill what has become a troubling data void. The World Bank is also backing a scheme being rolled out in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere to spread personal weather monitors. Without accurate weather data, people don't have evidence of what the weather is doing at ground level across the continent. And this, as former TV weather presenter Peter Gibbs explains (see video), can be a matter of ""life and death"". Climate change has brought more extreme weather conditions to many parts of the world and Africa is no exception. Farmers also face less predictable seasons.  ""Climate change has made an impact over recent years. At first we lost harvests to droughts and recently to heavy unexpected rain,"" say smallholder farmers, Agnes Chekira and Asha Ahmadi. ""If the rains come too early at the end of the longer rainy season our beans rot. But it's harder now to tell what will happen."" A short drive away, also in the Lushoto district of northern Tanzania, we meet Peter, a runner bean grower. Earlier this year he lost his entire crop at the start of the shorter spring rainy season.  ""Timing is everything. If you plant the seeds too early and heavy rains come in the first days, the seeds and dry top soil will be washed off the hillside and into the river channels at the bottom of the fields,"" he says. Knowing what the weather might do helps him work out when to add pesticides and fertilisers, he explains. Peter has been one of the first farmers in the region to sign up to a text alert scheme that tells him each day what the weather is expected to do in his area. Kukua provides the data from several of its new weather stations it has installed in the area. They are low-cost - about $2,500 (£1,900) depending on the location of the station. ""Obviously the weather stations themselves don't give us a forecast directly but we are able to send the information they collect back to the forecasters in Europe and provide better, more reliable advice on the ground,"" says Micha van Winkelhof, Kukua's chief executive. The World Meteorological Office estimates there are just over 1,100 active weather stations in the whole of Africa - a continent of 54 countries, many with starkly different climates.  And the number of stations has halved over the last 30 years due to inadequate government funding, maintenance costs and limited resources.  Dr Joseph Mukabana, in his recent report for the African Ministerial Conference on Meteorology, says this ""poor and sparse"" network needs to be expanded to at least 12,000 to provide basic weather services and help manage climate change.  It has created ""key gaps in our abilities to predict high-impact weather events"", he says. This dearth of weather stations means that what meteorologists call ""ground truthing"" - verifying predictions made from satellite data with earth-based evidence - is very difficult. One station has to cover an area of 27,000 sq km (10,425 sq miles) on average, meaning that what should be hard evidence is often just ""best guess"". Kukua wants to install thousands of weather stations across Africa. They are already in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, as well as Tanzania.  The first went up in 2016 and the 100th will be in by the end of 2017, some effectively paid for by large agricultural companies who want to benefit from more accurate information about what's happening on the ground. ""On a large scale we have clients interested in climate change and how that's affecting the cocoa belt in West Africa,"" says Mr van Winkelhof. ""Firms want to know where to base their operations, not just now but in the future."" Weather data is also useful for renewable energy firms wanting to know where to place their wind farms, and for insurance companies needing to assess flood risk and verify claims. The US-based International Research Institute for Climate and Society believes that giving farmers access to reliable weather forecasts can help them increase yields by 20%, and sometimes by as much as 80%.  ""That's the difference between eating to survive and sending your kids to school,"" says Mr van Winkelhof.  He hopes the data might also be useful for national health departments and non-governmental organisations looking to predict outbreaks of cholera and the spread of malaria - diseases closely linked to rainfall, humidity and temperature.  Kukua plans to sell tailored analysis of the data that the weather stations collect to fund further installations. It shares the raw data it collects with each country's national met office. David Lemayian, co-director and head of technology at Code for Africa, a not-for-profit organisation campaigning for free access to such information, says he wants everyone to have access to weather and air quality information.  Code for Africa is collaborating with the World Bank to spread small, automated weather sensors across Tanzania, Kenya, and other African countries. By the end of 2017 it hopes to have 300 of the basic-looking units working in four countries. ""Climate change is severe and is happening here in Africa, and we're finding it's women and children who are hurt the most,"" says Mr Lemayian. The $35 sensors measure temperature, humidity, and the size of particles found in the air. ""We found the biggest amount of interest has come from mothers wanting to know about the air quality near their homes for the sake of their babies' health,"" says Mr Lemayian. There are several other projects aiming to fill the weather data void in Africa. But if commercial organisations keep the data to themselves, campaigners argue, local communities could suffer."
Yield Spread Analysis,O2 data network restored after outage,2024-09-14,2018-12-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46464730,"Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!""   Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings.""   An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating.  ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries.  Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog called The Complaining Cow, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president Börje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption.  He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added.  Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted.  O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts.  ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having. Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline. ""I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair,"" she told the BBC. ""So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything."" Lynsey Greaves runs a company in Doncaster providing home visits to the elderly and vulnerable. Her 130 staff all rely on O2 phones to access rotas, schedules, names and addresses. She called in extra office staff to give out the information for each visit over the phone.  ""There are nine of us trying to sort it now,"" she said. ""It's been a nightmare.""  Luke Stagg runs a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but he couldn't get through to customers or use his sat nav.  ""That's a whole day wasted,"" he said. ""I'll be seeking to recoup my losses, especially as a business customer."" Mischa Bittar is also a plumber. He said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools today"".  ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all, disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amirat said he had been a loyal O2 customer for a long time. He said he had bids on eBay on Thursday morning but he could not do them because the O2 network was down. ""It's Christmas, the budget's tight for me, there were presents I was supposed to be buying for my daughter and my son on eBay today. They've gone now."" He said he had lost the bids and ""O2 are responsible"". "
Yield Spread Analysis,US to halt funding to WHO over coronavirus,2024-09-14,2020-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52289056,"US President Donald Trump has said he is going to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak. He accused the UN agency of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China, and said it must be held accountable.  In response, the UN's chief said it was ""not the time"" to cut funds to the WHO. Mr Trump has been under fire for his own handling of the pandemic. He has sought to deflect persistent criticism that he acted too slowly to stop the virus's spread by pointing to his decision in late January to place restrictions on travel from China.  He has accused the WHO of having ""criticised"" that decision and of being biased towards China more generally.  ""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday. The US is the global health body's largest single funder and gave it more than $400m in 2019. A decision on whether the US resumes funding will be made after the review, which Mr Trump said would last 60 to 90 days.  The WHO is yet to directly respond but UN Secretary General António Guterres said the international community should be uniting ""in solidarity to stop this virus"". ""It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against Covid-19,"" he said. Germany's foreign minister tweeted that strengthening the ""under-funded"" WHO was one of the best investments that could be made at this time. The WHO launched an appeal in March for $675m to help fight the coronavirus pandemic and is reported to be planning a fresh appeal for at least $1bn. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder and philanthropist, said on Twitter: ""Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds.""  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the second-largest funder of the WHO.  ""With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America's generosity has been put to the best use possible,"" the US president said. The US has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths worldwide- with more than 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths.  Mr Trump accused the WHO of having failed to adequately assess the outbreak when it first emerged in the city of Wuhan. ""Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,"" he told reporters. ""This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China's assurances to face value... and defended the actions of the Chinese government."" Chinese officials initially covered up the outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, and punished whistleblowers who tried to raise the alarm. Beijing later imposed draconian restrictions, including quarantine zones on an unprecedented scale, drawing effusive praise from the WHO and its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases.  White House reporters pointed out, however, that Mr Trump himself praised China's response to the outbreak and downplayed the danger of the virus at home long after the WHO had declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"". Democrats accused him of trying to shift blame away from himself in an election year, but many Republicans in Congress praised his decision to cut funding. It is not the first time the WHO's response to the outbreak has come under scrutiny.  On 14 January, the organisation tweeted that preliminary Chinese investigations had found ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" of the new virus. Mr Trump and others have used the tweet to attack the WHO for simply believing China, despite evidence to the contrary. But about a week after that tweet, on 22 January, the agency released a public statement saying that human-to-human transmission did appear to be taking place in Wuhan.  At the end of January, on the same day it declared a public health emergency, the WHO said that travel restrictions were not needed to stop the spread of Covid-19 - advice that was eventually ignored by most countries, including by the Trump administration the next day. In March, the UN agency was also accused of being unduly influenced by China after a senior official refused to discuss Taiwan's response to the outbreak. Meanwhile, some health experts also say that the WHO's guidance on face masks has led to public confusion. Other frequently-made criticisms of the WHO more generally are that it is constrained by politics and a sprawling bureaucracy. It came under particular fire for its response to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and how long it took to declare a public health emergency, leading the organisation to announce reforms in response. At one level, this move is about the coronavirus. Administration officials have been sharply accusing the WHO of missteps in the handling of the pandemic, saying it was biased towards China.  They say the WHO was too ready to support China's deceptive early claims about the virus and then didn't push hard enough against Beijing's attempts to cover up its misinformation. In particular President Trump has latched onto the WHO's criticism of his travel restrictions against China.  But at another level, the move to defund the WHO is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail China's growing global influence.  The argument is that Chinese leadership in international organisations undermines the rules-based, accountable international system needed to prevent and fight a pandemic.  But, the Wall Street Journal reports that the decision also stems from an ongoing discussion on whether to link US aid dollars to the number of Americans working in the groups that receive them. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Australia 'not intimidated' by Facebook news ban,2024-09-14,2021-02-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56109036,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said his government will not be intimidated by Facebook blocking news feeds to users. He described the move to ""unfriend Australia"" as arrogant and disappointing. Facebook is responding to a proposed law which would make tech giants pay for news content on their platforms. It says the legislation ""fundamentally misunderstands"" the relationship between the platform and publishers. Australians on Thursday woke up to find that Facebook pages of all local and global news sites were unavailable. People outside the country are also unable to read or access any Australian news publications on the platform. Several government health and emergency pages were also blocked. Facebook later asserted this was a mistake and many of these pages are now back online. Both Google and Facebook have fought the law, saying it unfairly ""penalises"" their platforms. However, in contrast to Facebook, Google has in recent days signed payment deals with major Australian media outlets. Facebook's action came hours after Google agreed to pay Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for content from news sites across its media empire. In a statement posted on Facebook, Mr Morrison said that big tech companies might be changing the world but this did not mean they should run it. ""Facebook's actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,"" he said. ""I am in regular contact with the leaders of other nations on these issues. We simply won't be intimidated,"" he added. Mr Morrison urged Facebook to work constructively with the government, ""as Google recently demonstrated in good faith"". Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban on news information had a ""huge community impact"". About 17 million Australians visit the social media site every month.  Consumption of digital news through social media and search engines is growing in Australia, according to the Reuters Digital News Report for 2020. Some 37% of consumers who took part said they had gained access to news via social media over the course of a week, compared with 31% who had directly accessed websites or apps, the report said. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan accused Facebook of ""behaving like a North Korean dictator"". Others suggested that a news vacuum could be filled by misinformation and conspiracy theories.  Human Rights Watch's Australia director said Facebook was censoring the flow of information in the country - calling it a ""dangerous turn of events"". The move also faced criticism abroad. Julian Knight, the head of the British parliamentary committee overseeing the media industry, told Reuters news agency it was ""bully boy action"". Meanwhile, the company behind the Guardian newspaper said it was ""deeply concerned"". Many Australians are angry about their sudden loss of access to trusted and authoritative sources. ""It feels obviously very restrictive in what Facebook is going to allow people to do in the future, not only in Australia but around the world,"" Peter Firth, in Sydney, told the BBC.  Amelia Marshall said she could not believe the firm's decision ""in the middle of a pandemic"", adding: ""I've made the long-overdue decision to permanently delete my Facebook account.""  Australian authorities had drawn up the laws to ""level the playing field"" between the tech giants and struggling publishers over profits. Of every A$100 (£56; $77) spent on digital advertising in Australian media these days, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. But Facebook said the law left it ""facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia"". ""With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,"" it said in a blog post. The law sought ""to penalise Facebook for content it didn't take or ask for"", the company's local managing director William Easton said. Facebook said it helped Australian publishers earn about A$407m last year through referrals, while ""the platform gain from news is minimal"". However, Facebook is by far the most important social platform for news. In Australia, about 36% of people use the platform for news. Meanwhile, only 14% of Australians pay for online news. Also, media companies have seen a long-term decline in advertising revenue while that of Google and Facebook has risen in recent years. Under the ban, Australian publishers are restricted from sharing or posting any links on their Facebook pages. The national broadcaster, ABC, and newspapers like The Australian have millions of followers.  Australia's conservative government is standing by the law - which passed the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. It has broad cross-party support and the Senate is likely to pass it next week. ""We will legislate this code. We want the digital giants paying traditional news media businesses for generating original journalistic content,"" said Mr Frydenberg. He pointed out that Facebook, like Google, had been negotiating pay deals with local organisations.  Facebook's ban on news sites on its Australian-facing site could well lead to greater prominence for unverified and untrusted information, helping disinformation to spread further.  First Draft, a site which investigates the spread of false and misleading posts online,  warned the restrictions will ""open up a vacuum that could be filled in part by mis and disinformation"". Facebook says it will continue to remove harmful misinformation, connect users with reliable health advice and work with third party fact checkers. One of the topics for which a great deal of unreliable information is shared online is that of Covid-19 vaccines. So we looked at search results for the word ""vaccine"" over the past 12 hours on Facebook pages primarily based in Australia and found prominent results for sites casting doubt on the coronavirus pandemic.  This search also brings up reliable information sources, and further analysis will be needed over the next few days to see whether this anecdotal evidence is backed up by longer term data."
Yield Spread Analysis,Cuba crash plane's black box recovered,2024-09-14,2018-05-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44184751,"Cuban officials say they have found one of the two black boxes from a plane that crashed near Havana airport, killing more than 100 people, in ""good condition"". Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo says he hopes the second device will be recovered soon. He revised the official death toll up to 110 people, including 11 foreigners. Three women survived the crash, but are said to be in a critical condition with serious burns.  The incident is Cuba's worst air disaster in decades, and two days of national mourning began on Saturday.  Officials said investigators are combing through the wreckage of the plane, a Boeing 737 which was nearly 40 years old, at the field where it crashed some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital.  The black box which has already been recovered will hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane.  Mr Yzquierdo told journalists that the 110 dead included 99 Cubans, six Mexican crew members, two tourists from Argentina, one from Mexico, and two passengers from Western Sahara. The Argentine couple were named by their government as Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their sixties.  Several victims' relatives have travelled to Havana to help identify the deceased.  Those coming from Holguín - the plane's intended destination - and other eastern parts of Cuba made the 700km (435-mile) trip on buses, escorted by the National Revolutionary Police, EFE news agency reported.  President Miguel Diaz-Canel has visited the morgue where the victims are being identified. Cuban authorities do not plan to release the full list of the dead until all victims' families have been informed.  The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holguín. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near the airport. ""I saw it taking off,"" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. ""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"".  A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people initially survived the crash but one died after being taken to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39.  ""She is alive but very burnt and swollen,"" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. By Will Grant, BBC Cuba Correspondent  Two days of national mourning have begun, with the entire island sharing a little of the pain of the many families affected by the disaster. But in their grief, people also want answers. They are demanding an explanation as to why a routine flight from Havana came crashing down in a field barely a minute after it took off, with over 100 passengers and crew on board.  The country's new President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, faces his first real test in providing those answers. He visited the crash site to thank the emergency services and announced an investigation was already under way.  It emerged that the previous President, Raúl Castro, was recuperating from minor surgery on a hernia, and he too expressed his condolences to the victims' families.  The families of the survivors face an anxious wait to see if they will pull through, and their countrymen are praying that at least some will have survived this catastrophe. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de Aviación by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico earlier said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. According to industry research, last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travel with no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana, killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground."
Yield Spread Analysis,The week of economic contagion,2024-09-14,2020-03-14,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-51888442,"There are health fears, of course, and concerns about care for the old, the young and the unwell. We're all gaining expertise in epidemiology. There is disruption to the way we work, with many people preparing for a move from the office to the kitchen table. Companies should by now have their business continuity plans in place, to cope with disruption of supplies and widespread sick leave taken by staff. As ever, the markets - as if they had rational brains and personalities - like to think they get there first. And this week saw them plunged into an immense tizz, as analysts and traders realised the implications of the Covid-19 or coronavirus outbreak wreaking economic havoc throughout the world's two biggest market economies - Europe and North America. No-one is immune: actor Tom Hanks, the Canadian premier's wife, Sophie Trudeau and the chief executive of BT tested positive. The jet-set lifestyle may itself create higher risk of infection, with a fast-revolving door of visitors. Nowhere is immune either, even if President Trump believes this is a ""foreign virus"", blocking the entry of Europeans, while India shuts its doors to visitors. Three people at a dinner the president attended with visiting Brazilians on 7 March have since tested positive. A terrifying new wave awaits as countries such as India and in Africa, with the least equipped or resilient health systems, try to delay the virus's spread from China, Iran, the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic countries. So what do the markets tell us about the way ahead? The main London index had two of its biggest one-day falls during the past week, on Thursday down by 11%. The FTSE100 has fallen 30% in only a month. That index reflects international business conditions. The more British-oriented FTSE 250 has fallen 29%. That scale of decline was in line with other share indices in Europe and the US. They tanked on Monday, after the crisis was compounded by a falling-out between oil exporters. Russia refused last Friday to join with others in a proposed cut in supply, intended to match the virus-driven cut in demand. So Saudis launched an all-out price war two days later, pushing the price down to the mid-30 dollar range, where it has bounced around for the rest of the week. There's a fierce battle for market share, and a challenge from these big exporters as to who can absorb the most pain. At the start of the year, a barrel of Brent crude sold for $69: a month ago, it was over $60. So down by half, that's good news for buyers of fuel: bad for the firms and regions, including north-east Scotland, that rely on a stable and higher price to keep the investment flowing. It's also bad news for the environment, as one important way to discourage the burning of oil is for the price to be high. Stock markets rallied, helped a bit by the Budget splurge at Westminster, and then a double whammy on Thursday - responding to an address by President Trump. He intended to reassure the public and markets, but this was inept even by his standards. It backfired spectacularly - an address that will live in infamy, ""the most expensive speech in history"". Less high-profile, Christine Lagarde, the new boss at the European Central Bank, chose her words carelessly, and spooked European investors. In one day, Wall Street was down 10%. A pan-Europe index was down 12.5%. In Madrid, the fall was 14%. For London and European financial centres, helped by additional liquidity pumped into the market by central banks, Friday saw a steadying of the fall. After European markets closed, President Trump tried again - this time with $50 billion in national emergency funding, and Wall Street responded positively. So what was going on? Share prices, fundamentally, reflect the expectation of future profit from that company. They also fluctuate in terms of confidence about the economy in general. And however well informed by data and analysis, investors also tend to follow the herd. To some extent, they reflect the relative attraction of other assets.  So while cash has earned so little interest, and government bond yields have been low, there's more of an incentive to put money into shares - all the moreso while others are doing so. This week, after an 11-year rise, the herd stampeded in the other direction.  The fundamental fears about future profit, or the very survival of firms, was a driving factor. Airlines look like they face a horrific year, as business travel is axed ferociously, leisure travellers take fright, their insurers remove cover for travel disruption, and governments impose bans. That feeds through to the many supply firms that feed off airports; Swissport and John Menzies ground handlers in British airports are cutting jobs following the collapse of Flybe: Edinburgh Airport has warned that there may be a number of months this year when it has zero, or near-zero, passengers: lower footfall in the departure lounge is hitting profits at WH Smith shops. The Budget on Wednesday at Westminster, which seems distant only three days later, had big gestures for small firms (they're still to be translated at Holyrood into tax relief and grants in Scotland, with some consternation that there was more detail about the sums available from the Treasury in my last blog than there was for Scottish ministers). However, the Budget did nothing much for the aviation sector, and it's complaining loudly. The cruise liner business is being savaged by the bad publicity, with some suspending operations for at least two months. That will hit Miami and the Caribbean particularly hard, but spare a thought for the many businesses in Lerwick, Invergordon and Greenock which have grown up around that traffic. Shares in those supplying healthcare and groceries are less affected. It is the broader leisure and hospitality sector that is joining travel in the danger zone. Restaurants and bars are emptying, and may not see sustainable levels of custom return for several months. Hotels and guest houses are seeing bookings cancelled. The potential upside later this year could be a big surge in UK staycations. But where people gather in numbers, there's trouble ahead. Football clubs face dire financial straits without the 43% of income that comes in through the turnstiles. The spring and summer economy was intended to blossom from now, with festivals and concerts, but cancellations are going to hit these catering and hospitality firms that depend on them. Yesterday, we got Glasgow's Aye Write book festival cancelled because authors didn't want to travel to it: big, money-spinning concerts at the city's SSE Hydro arena have been cancelled - this weekend the Country to Country music festival, later this month The Who and Santana: BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was scheduled for Dundee in May, but no longer. Edinburgh can merely hope that the worst will be over by August. And while Roger Daltrey won't be on his uppers with The Who's tour cancelled, think of the number of people with occasional, insecure work in the hi-viz vests around these events, marshalling or pulling pints. Many are students. And students are being told to go home, sucking their spending power out of the diverse business districts that grow up around universities. So what happened as investors rushed to sell shares this week? One destination for that money at times like these would normally be secure government bonds, and there's none more secure than America's. But that market is also in a lot of trouble. Over recent weeks, the demand for Treasury bonds pushed prices up and the yield (therefore, automatically) down, to historic lows. In the past week, the market was struggling with lack of liquidity. There weren't enough buyers. Why? One theory is that traders have been told to work from home. They're now sitting on the sofa in their ""leezhure pant"", and don't have the psychological energy of the trading floors to fire up their risk-taking synapses. Such asset flows also affect currency rates. They have been less dramatic over the past few days, but over time, sterling has been weakening. Against the euro, it's lost 8% of its value since a mid-February peak, and a pound now buys €1.11.  Against the US dollar, it dropped 6% in the past week, or 8 cents, to reach $1.23. Sterling had perked up over winter months, when a no-deal Brexit was taken off the table for 2020. But it's not off the table for the start of 2021, and the flight for safety may also reflect that prospect. This week saw the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tell the 27 capitals what a deal might look like, though with important details left blank. It left little doubt that fisheries remains a big problem in these talks. If annual negotiations on fishery quotas can't be agreed, the European side is asserting a right to continue past entitlements. With government bandwidth absorbed by the virus crisis, there's a risk that Whitehall's previous all-consuming focus on Brexit risks being ignored. The economic risks from it played a very small role in Rishi Sunak's first Budget, though for that and virus reasons, he may be back during financial year 2020-21 with significant budget adjustments. A second round of Brexit talks between negotiating teams of around 100 were due in London in the coming week, and Brussels a fortnight after that. But they've been cancelled, and the two sides are looking to the possibility of video-negotiating.  I'm no negotiating expert, but I fear Skype is better suited to keeping in touch with your granny in her care home than to getting Brexit talks to a happy ending."
Yield Spread Analysis,Hearts dismantle County to boost third-place hopes,2024-09-14,2023-04-22,Andy Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65283766,"Josh Ginnelly doubled Hearts' lead and was a pest to the County defence Lawrence Shankland scored a hat-trick as Hearts boosted their hopes of finishing third in the Scottish Premiership by thrashing Ross County and giving Steven Naismith a first win as interim boss. The striker netted twice in the first half, the second a penalty, after earlier strikes by Alex Cochrane and Josh Ginnelly.  Ginnelly added another and Shankland chipped in the hosts' sixth as they moved to within two points of Aberdeen. And Naismith says his players will ""go into the split confident"", adding: ""There's loads to play for."" The day got worse for bottom side Ross County, who replied through Owura Edwards' late penalty, with nearest rivals Kilmarnock and Dundee United both winning to move four points clear. Follow the latest Hearts news Keep up to date with Ross County Hearts, who had lost six in a row in all competitions, seized control shortly after Barrie McKay had volleyed over the County bar. Shankland and Ginnelly combined to set up Cochrane, who struck diagonally from the inside right channel to beat Ross Laidlaw. Ginnelly then ran on to Cammy Devlin's intelligent through ball down the same channel, progressed into the box and turned back to finish well into the left corner. The forward was flagged offside but the goal was awarded after a VAR check. And it got worse for the visitors when Cochrane clipped from the left for Shankland to head back across Laidlaw into the net. Shankland was inches away from a spectacular second moments later, his lob from the right edge of the box beating the goalkeeper but smacking the crossbar. Laidlaw kept out Devlin's low shot, Peter Haring fired over, Nathaniel Atkinson should have finished from Shankland's delightful backheel, and McKay and Shankland had further efforts blocked. But the domination did yield a fourth goal before half-time. Dylan Smith's trailing leg tripped Shankland and, though play continued, a VAR review resulted in a penalty. Shankland made no mistake. Hearts were hungry for more goals after the break with Ginnelly getting away from Alex Iacovitti too easily and burying from 20 yards. Yutaro Oda then looked in line for his first Hearts goal but was blocked, the ball falling for Shankland to dink into the net for his treble and a 25th goal of the season. Edwards won County's spot-kick when he teased Cochrane on the right and the substitute converted the penalty well. Hearts' recent malaise coincided with the striker's own dip in form but he was back to his best Hearts played with a freedom that belied their recent downturn in form. This was the Hearts of earlier in the season with Ginnelly and Shankland in full flow and Haring and Devlin providing solidity in midfield. And they were not satisfied with six. Ginnelly was denied by Laidlaw; Devlin's rebound was touched on to the bar; Kye Rowles headed narrowly wide at a corner; Shankland forced another Laidlaw save; and substitute Stephen Humphrys went close twice. There was no respite for the visitors. The challenge for Naismith's side is whether they can replicate this level of performance against top-six sides next month, with Aberdeen playing their game in hand against Rangers on Sunday. County could take heart from their performances in recent losses to Aberdeen and Celtic but their visit to Tynecastle offered no solace at all. They were passive, disjointed and square in defence, making it difficult for their attacking players to really affect the game. That said, Jordan White's header and George Harmon's cross hit the bar in the second half. But, with five defeats from six since February, a daunting few weeks await Mackay and his players. Hearts interim manager Steven Naismith: ""I could see that we were a team that can create chances and have got good forwards. We've got real quality players going forward and that showed with the goals that we score. Everybody that played was excellent."" Ross County manager Malky Mackay: ""They played well and we didn't. We were, to a man, off it all over the park. My regular players that give very consistent performances weren't at their best. There were too many of those and when you get too many of those, you get a performance like that. ""We've got a break next week. It gives us time to draw breath going into these last five games. We've got the teams round about us to play now."" Both sides begin their post-split games over the first weekend in May, with the fixtures expected to be confirmed early next week.

Yield Spread Analysis,Hearts 'have lot to learn' despite Kilmarnock win,2024-09-14,2022-12-17,George O'Neill,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63896775,"This video can not be played Watch: Hearts get the better of Kilmarnock Hearts ""still have a lot of things to learn"" despite moving to within a point of third place in the Scottish Premiership after beating Kilmarnock. Goals from Josh Ginnelly and Lawrence Shankland put Robbie Neilson's side 2-0 up at half-time at Tynecastle. Kilmarnock improved in the second half, and pulled one back through Ash Taylor, but a Shankland penalty restored Hearts' two-goal cushion. ""I thought we were exceptional in the first half,"" Neilson said. ""We weren't so good in the second and we have to rectify that. To Kilmarnock's credit, they were more aggressive and got after us."" Hearts move up to fourth, just behind Aberdeen, while Kilmarnock remain 11th, three clear of Dundee United.   Get all your Hearts news here Kilmarnock news and analysis Kilmarnock's recent record against Hearts is impressive, but Neilson's side did not seem perturbed by that as they dominated proceedings from the outset. It took just 10 minutes for them to carve their visitors open, but Andy Halliday could only shoot straight at Sam Walker after Cammy Devlin found him on the penalty spot.  Hearts didn't have to wait long for another sight of goal, though, and this time, they took full advantage.  An aimless long ball over the top seemed to pose little threat, but Joe Wright made a mess of his attempted header and Ginnelly pounced to race clear and shoot beyond Walker. More sloppy defending gifted Hearts a second goal. Shankland was left completely unmarked from a free-kick and Hearts' top scorer nodded home Robert Snodgrass' pinpoint cross from close range. Alex Cochrane thought he had scored a third, but was denied by the offside flag, and then Ginnelly shanked a shot wide after some intricate passing opened Kilmarnock up once more. The best chance for Derek McInnes' side came on the stroke of half-time. Liam Donnelly climbed highest to flick on a corner, but the ball just evaded Lewis Mayo at the back post. Kilmarnock improved after the break after Christian Doidge's introduction gave them a focal point up front, and they carved out a glorious chance on 50 minutes. Wright had the goal at his mercy after he escaped his marker from a free-kick, but could only head tamely at Craig Gordon from close range. It was from another set-piece that Kilmarnock found just their second away goal in the league this season. Daniel Armstrong whipped a free-kick into a dangerous area, and Taylor ghosted in at the back post to shoot underneath Gordon.  Kilmarnock continued to press, but were unable to create another clear-cut chance and, with time running out, Hearts sealed victory. This video can not be played Hearts penalty decision 'ludicrous' - Sportscene analysis Wright appealed for a foul as he challenged Shankland, but the ball hit his outstretched hand and referee Willie Collum showed no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Shankland stepped up and blasted it down the middle to maintain his 100% penalty record for Hearts and secure all three points. Shankland's took his goals with consummate ease, and is now the league's joint-top scorer with 11 goals Injuries have wreaked havoc with Hearts so far this season, but Neilson's threadbare squad narrowed the gap to Aberdeen in third, and are now far closer to full-strength. Neilson is no longer having to field makeshift backlines, and Kye Rowles - fresh from his impressive World Cup campaign - will be available again on Christmas Eve after serving his suspension. Kilmarnock, meanwhile, have struggled for goals all season, and were profligate again. However, it was the ease with which Hearts scored their goals that will alarm boss McInnes.  Not taking chances and leaking goals at the other end is a combination that rarely ends well, and if Kilmarnock don't tighten up soon, they will find themselves back in the Championship next season.

Yield Spread Analysis,'Caring for my autistic brother changed my life',2024-09-14,2023-02-18,By Neil Prior,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-64655742,"A woman who passed up going to university to care for her autistic foster brother has described how he inspired her to set up her own behavioural therapy centre. Risca Solomon, from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, first met Dan when he was four years old. His previous respite placements had broken down due to his challenging behaviour. But Ms Solomon, whose parents were foster carers, wanted to help. ""When I first met Dan I was 18 and on work experience at a special school, and he touched my heart,"" Ms Solomon said. ""I begged my parents, who'd been foster and respite carers since I was 11, to step in.""  Her parents were reluctant at first due to the level of care Dan would need, something they felt was beyond their level of experience and expertise.  But they agreed after Ms Solomon promised to be one of his primary care givers. ""It changed my life,"" Ms Solomon said. ""Instead of going away to study, I enrolled on an Open University course so I could still be around to help out with Dan. ""I started to look into behaviour analysis, and once I saw the beneficial effects it was having on him I knew I had to spread the word."" Behaviour analysis focuses on understanding why people behave the way they do and how behaviours can be changed. Ms Solomon said when Dan first came to live with them, his behaviour could be challenging. ""It was hard not to take it personally; we were providing all this love and care, but it was difficult for us,"" she said. ""But as time went on we learned his trigger actions and showed him there was a simpler way to get what he needed."" Part of the therapy involves de-sensitising the trigger points which can provoke challenging behaviour. Autistic young people can be hyper-sensitive to noise and light, but by making environments calmer symptoms can be reduced. Within a month of living with Ms Solomon and her parents, Dan was able to use sign language to communicate. Ms Solomon then helped Dan to learn how to talk. ""We knew he wanted to talk, he was making some noises, and trying to mimic what we were doing,"" Ms Solomon explained. ""The more I got to know him, the more I realised that it wasn't a developmental issue, he simply didn't know how to manipulate his mouth into the shapes required for speech."" After studying a masters degree in challenging behaviour at Cardiff University, Ms Solomon tried using Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) to teach Dan to speak.  After finding the right combination of techniques, Dan began to develop speech.  Documenting Dan's progress on YouTube, Ms Solomon started getting requests from other families for support.  At the time, she was preparing to sit a behaviour analyst exam and was then able to create her own therapy company, Skybound. Alongside 38 staff members, Ms Solomon now delivers therapy and care to those who need it.  ""We use a system called talk tools, a series of plastic mouthpieces which help to shape the lips and tongue into the position to make the sounds needed for speech"", she said. ABA is considered by some people to be a controversial method of treatment, which the National Autism Society has described as polarising. But Ms Solomon said it is all about how it is taught. ""I wouldn't ask any of our clients to do anything I wouldn't do myself. I put the pieces into my mouth and show them the shapes they're creating. ""We then look for signs of consent for us to help them with the tools. ""It's purely based on consent, and for many it's their favourite part of the therapy; they try to hurry us along to the point at which we get the talk tools out."" The National Autism Society's website acknowledges that some believe ABA has developed considerably and that it can help people to develop vital life skills and stay safe. But it points out that some remain fundamentally opposed to ABA. Ms Solomon said for the people she works with, ""what is a good outcome entirely depends on where we're starting from. ""On one end of the scale is a young girl who can use a switch with her head to attract attention, because she loves music, and when she hit the switch she heard a pop song. ""On the other are lads who are very chatty but whose diets are so severely limited that they were in danger of needing to become tube-fed.  ""We were able to desensitise their food phobia to the extent that they were making their own sandwiches and eating all sorts of things they'd never even tried before."" Skybound is now attempting to open a new residential centre to educate clients alongside their families. Meanwhile Dan lives two days a week with Risca, her husband and their two young children, and spends the rest of the week with Risca's parents."
Yield Spread Analysis,O2 data network restored after outage,2024-09-14,2018-12-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46464730,"Mobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users. A statement on its website, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday. It said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening. But some users told the BBC they were still having issues with texting and urged O2 to fix the glitches. ""I have a Tesco mobile [which uses the O2 network] - any texts I send say 'not sent. Tap to try again',"" wrote Lesley. ""Each tap brings the same message! But I find the person I've sent it to actually has received it!""   Another user Steve wrote: ""No, it's most definitely not fixed as there are numerous error messages sending texts as well as duplicated sendings.""   An O2 spokeswoman said: ""A small proportion of customers have reported issues sending text messages. We can see that the vast majority are being sent and received successfully and our technical teams are investigating.  ""Our 3G and 4G data services are performing as normal."" Earlier, O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected, while many businesses faced disruption. Ericsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the ""faulty software"" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned. In a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: ""I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can. ""We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry."" Ericsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries.  Customers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney. Ms Dewdney, who writes a blog called The Complaining Cow, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care. That means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone. This must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle. Ms Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint. Ericsson president Börje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption.  He said ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". The company was carrying out ""a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis"", he added.  Japan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted.  O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working. Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts.  ""As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses. ""Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,"" he said. On Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having. Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline. ""I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair,"" she told the BBC. ""So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything."" Lynsey Greaves runs a company in Doncaster providing home visits to the elderly and vulnerable. Her 130 staff all rely on O2 phones to access rotas, schedules, names and addresses. She called in extra office staff to give out the information for each visit over the phone.  ""There are nine of us trying to sort it now,"" she said. ""It's been a nightmare.""  Luke Stagg runs a plumbing business and depends on his phone, but he couldn't get through to customers or use his sat nav.  ""That's a whole day wasted,"" he said. ""I'll be seeking to recoup my losses, especially as a business customer."" Mischa Bittar is also a plumber. He said he had been ""unable to contact any of my engineers or customers via email, unable to use our mobile systems to contact any engineers at all, so everyone's just had to down tools today"".  ""A lot of money lost and the first thing I know about it is via the BBC website, no contact from O2 at all, disappointing,"" he added. Omeran Amirat said he had been a loyal O2 customer for a long time. He said he had bids on eBay on Thursday morning but he could not do them because the O2 network was down. ""It's Christmas, the budget's tight for me, there were presents I was supposed to be buying for my daughter and my son on eBay today. They've gone now."" He said he had lost the bids and ""O2 are responsible"". "
Yield Spread Analysis,Saka scores twice as England thrash Iran in opener,2024-09-14,2022-11-20,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63603382,"This video can not be played England thrash Iran in World Cup opener England's Fifa World Cup campaign opened in thoroughly convincing fashion as they outclassed Iran in an incident-packed match in Doha. Gareth Southgate's side strolled to victory, with Iran's hopeless plight made worse by the early loss of goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand to concussion after a clash of heads with team-mate Majid Hosseini.  Jude Bellingham got England off the mark in this World Cup with a soaring header from Luke Shaw's cross 10 minutes before the break and the game was wrapped up before half-time thanks to Bukayo Saka's fine strike and Raheem Sterling's classy volley with the outside of his foot from Harry Kane's cross. Saka got his second before Iran's supporters were given a moment of real delight when Mehdi Taremi scored a fine goal after 65 minutes - but England substitute Marcus Rashford then netted another smooth, composed strike with his first involvement. To put the gloss on an incredibly dominant display, Jack Grealish slotted home from close range after a good run and pull back by Callum Wilson.  Iran did pull another back in injury time when Taremi slotted in a penalty after a John Stones foul. The game was played out against the backdrop of more off-field controversy here in Qatar after England were forced to ditch plans to wear the OneLove armband promoting diversity and inclusivity under threat from Fifa of players being cautioned should they carry out the gesture of support.

Iran were expected to provide stern resistance as they reside in the top 20 in the Fifa rankings and have a recent victory against Uruguay on their record but England made light work of the task once Bellingham gave them the lead.  Bellingham is being touted as one of the big emerging names at this World Cup, the 19-year-old Borussia Dortmund star already a target for a host of the game's elite names.  And, even in the context of this game, Bellingham showed exactly why as he joined Saka as the dominant force in this game, scoring his first England goal with a magnificent header and bestriding midfield with a complete authority that belied his years.  This was only the second time England have scored six goals in a major tournament but on this evidence you would not bet against the brilliant Bellingham being involved the next time it happens.  Bellingham is a player with the world at his feet and a long career ahead of him at international level.  Southgate picked Saka ahead of Manchester City's Phil Foden, the only mildly contentious decision in his line-up, but there can be no arguments after a hugely impressive performance from the 21-year-old who has played such a big part as Arsenal head the Premier League.  Saka scored twice and was a threat throughout and thoroughly deserved the warm applause he received when he was substituted.

Iran coach Carlos Queiroz hinted at a bold approach beforehand but this was never going to be the case and once the game settled down following an opening 20 minutes littered with interruptions, this opening World Cup game was only going one way.  Iran's many fans had a moment of real joy when Taremi thumped home his finish but there was little else to celebrate in this game as their team took a heavy beating.  This was not a day without great significance, however, as both Iran's players and supporters used this global stage to make their feelings clear about the growing human rights protests against the ruling regime in their homeland.  The national anthem was shouted down by the supporters and none of the Iran players joined in.  Iran were heavily supported inside the Khalifa International Stadium and clearly regarded this as an ideal platform to make their grievances clear.

Yield Spread Analysis,Russia brokers Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal,2024-09-14,2020-11-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54882564,"Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia have signed an agreement to end military conflict over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.  Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the deal ""incredibly painful both for me and both for our people"". It follows six weeks of fighting between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians. The region is internationally recognised as Azerbaijani but has been run by ethnic Armenians since 1994. A Russian-brokered truce was signed at the end of the war in the early 1990s but there was no peace deal.  Although both sides took steps to reduce tensions last year, fighting erupted at the end of September and several attempts to end the conflict failed. The new ceasefire agreement prompted anger in Armenia, as protesters stormed the parliament, beating up the speaker and reportedly looting the prime minister's office.  The peace deal, which was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenia's prime minister, took effect on Tuesday from 01:00 local time (21:00 GMT Monday). Under the deal, Azerbaijan will hold on to areas of Nagorno-Karabakh that it has taken during the conflict. Armenia has also agreed to withdraw from several other adjacent areas over the next few weeks. The BBC's Orla Guerin in Baku says that, overall, the deal should be read as a victory for Azerbaijan and a defeat for Armenia. During a televised online address, President Putin said that Russian peacekeepers would be deployed to patrol the front line.  Russia's defence ministry confirmed that 1,960 personnel would be involved and reports said planes had left an airbase at Ulyanovsk on Tuesday carrying peacekeepers and armoured personnel carriers to Karabakh. Part of their role will be to guard the ""Lachin corridor"", which links the Karabakh capital, Stepanakert, to Armenia. Turkey will also take part in the peacekeeping process, according to Azerbaijan's president, who joined President Putin during the address. President Putin said the agreement would include an exchange of war prisoners, with ""all economical and transport contacts to be unblocked."" By Orla Guerin, BBC News, Baku There is a mood of national celebration in Baku. At Martyrs' Alley - a memorial to Azerbaijan's fallen soldiers - there are surging crowds among a sea of flags. There is a real sense here that a key victory has been achieved after a very long fight. Groups are breaking out in chants and singing the national anthem.  Two young students are holding a homemade sign that reads: ""Tell the world we are coming home."" It is a home they have never seen. Their parents were driven from Nagorno-Karabakh almost 30 years ago, but now they intend to move there to build a new life.  Asked if they could imagine living side by side with Armenians, one replied that this might take decades. ""Our children may see this,"" she told me. President Aliyev said the agreement was of ""historic importance,"" and amounted to a ""capitulation"" by Armenia. Armenia's prime minister said that his decision had been based on ""deep analyses of the combat situation and in discussion with best experts of the field"".   ""This is not a victory but there is not defeat until you consider yourself defeated,"" Mr Pashinyan said. The Armenian leader in Nagorno-Karabakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, said a ceasefire had been unavoidable after the loss of Karabakh's second biggest town, Shusha (known as Shushi in Armenian).   Battles were already taking place on the outskirts of Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert, and if the conflict had continued the whole of Karabakh would have been lost, he said on Facebook. ""We would have far more losses,"" he said. In the Armenian capital Yerevan, a large crowd gathered to protest against the agreement, according to local media.  They broke into parliament and government buildings, shouting ""We will not give it up."" Protesters ransacked the prime minister's official residence and Mr Pashinyan said they ""stole a computer, a clock, perfume, drivers licence and other items"". By Yuri Vendik, BBC Russian, Yerevan It was a night of unrest and upset in Armenia's capital, where crowds of protesters stormed government buildings and the country's parliament.  But by Tuesday morning, that anger appeared to have died down. Leading politicians, with the exception of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, are in talks to find a way out of this deep crisis. And this is a crisis: the defeat in Nagorno-Karabakh is a devastating one The protesters who gathered here overnight accused the government of betrayal. They believed the fighting should have continued until the end and they were confident of victory. But in Nagorno-Karabakh itself there was no such optimism. The leadership of the enclave earlier admitted that, had the fighting continued, the main city of Stepanakert would have been lost within days. The Armenians steadily lost territory and significantly over the weekend Azerbaijani forces took over Shusha. Azerbaijan also admitted to mistakenly shooting down a Russian military helicopter over Armenia, killing two crew members and injuring a third. It is unclear exactly how many have died. Both sides deny targeting civilians but accuse the other of doing so. Nagorno-Karabakh's authorities say nearly 1,200 of its defence forces have died in the fighting, and civilians have also been killed or injured.  Azerbaijan has not released its military casualty figures but has said more than 80 civilians were killed in the fighting - including 21 in a missile strike on the town of Barda last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that almost 5,000 people had been killed in the fighting. Russia has a military base in Armenia, and the two countries are members of the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organization.  The treaty envisages Russia's military support if Armenia is attacked - but it does not include Nagorno-Karabakh or the other Azerbaijani regions around it seized by Armenian forces. At the same time, Moscow also has strong ties to Azerbaijan, which is being openly backed by Turkey, a Nato member. Russia has been selling weapons to both Armenia and Azerbaijan."
Yield Spread Analysis,How missing weather data is a 'life and death' issue,2024-09-14,2017-11-14,By Dan Simmons,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41967241,"A shortage of weather data is putting many African countries at an economic disadvantage, experts believe. The BBC's Click team went to Tanzania to meet a tech start-up trying to change the outlook. Tanzania is at the centre of a meteorological experiment that promises to transform lives across Africa. Tech start-up, Kukua, wants to introduce hundreds of low-cost weather stations in the country and beyond, to fill what has become a troubling data void. The World Bank is also backing a scheme being rolled out in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere to spread personal weather monitors. Without accurate weather data, people don't have evidence of what the weather is doing at ground level across the continent. And this, as former TV weather presenter Peter Gibbs explains (see video), can be a matter of ""life and death"". Climate change has brought more extreme weather conditions to many parts of the world and Africa is no exception. Farmers also face less predictable seasons.  ""Climate change has made an impact over recent years. At first we lost harvests to droughts and recently to heavy unexpected rain,"" say smallholder farmers, Agnes Chekira and Asha Ahmadi. ""If the rains come too early at the end of the longer rainy season our beans rot. But it's harder now to tell what will happen."" A short drive away, also in the Lushoto district of northern Tanzania, we meet Peter, a runner bean grower. Earlier this year he lost his entire crop at the start of the shorter spring rainy season.  ""Timing is everything. If you plant the seeds too early and heavy rains come in the first days, the seeds and dry top soil will be washed off the hillside and into the river channels at the bottom of the fields,"" he says. Knowing what the weather might do helps him work out when to add pesticides and fertilisers, he explains. Peter has been one of the first farmers in the region to sign up to a text alert scheme that tells him each day what the weather is expected to do in his area. Kukua provides the data from several of its new weather stations it has installed in the area. They are low-cost - about $2,500 (£1,900) depending on the location of the station. ""Obviously the weather stations themselves don't give us a forecast directly but we are able to send the information they collect back to the forecasters in Europe and provide better, more reliable advice on the ground,"" says Micha van Winkelhof, Kukua's chief executive. The World Meteorological Office estimates there are just over 1,100 active weather stations in the whole of Africa - a continent of 54 countries, many with starkly different climates.  And the number of stations has halved over the last 30 years due to inadequate government funding, maintenance costs and limited resources.  Dr Joseph Mukabana, in his recent report for the African Ministerial Conference on Meteorology, says this ""poor and sparse"" network needs to be expanded to at least 12,000 to provide basic weather services and help manage climate change.  It has created ""key gaps in our abilities to predict high-impact weather events"", he says. This dearth of weather stations means that what meteorologists call ""ground truthing"" - verifying predictions made from satellite data with earth-based evidence - is very difficult. One station has to cover an area of 27,000 sq km (10,425 sq miles) on average, meaning that what should be hard evidence is often just ""best guess"". Kukua wants to install thousands of weather stations across Africa. They are already in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, as well as Tanzania.  The first went up in 2016 and the 100th will be in by the end of 2017, some effectively paid for by large agricultural companies who want to benefit from more accurate information about what's happening on the ground. ""On a large scale we have clients interested in climate change and how that's affecting the cocoa belt in West Africa,"" says Mr van Winkelhof. ""Firms want to know where to base their operations, not just now but in the future."" Weather data is also useful for renewable energy firms wanting to know where to place their wind farms, and for insurance companies needing to assess flood risk and verify claims. The US-based International Research Institute for Climate and Society believes that giving farmers access to reliable weather forecasts can help them increase yields by 20%, and sometimes by as much as 80%.  ""That's the difference between eating to survive and sending your kids to school,"" says Mr van Winkelhof.  He hopes the data might also be useful for national health departments and non-governmental organisations looking to predict outbreaks of cholera and the spread of malaria - diseases closely linked to rainfall, humidity and temperature.  Kukua plans to sell tailored analysis of the data that the weather stations collect to fund further installations. It shares the raw data it collects with each country's national met office. David Lemayian, co-director and head of technology at Code for Africa, a not-for-profit organisation campaigning for free access to such information, says he wants everyone to have access to weather and air quality information.  Code for Africa is collaborating with the World Bank to spread small, automated weather sensors across Tanzania, Kenya, and other African countries. By the end of 2017 it hopes to have 300 of the basic-looking units working in four countries. ""Climate change is severe and is happening here in Africa, and we're finding it's women and children who are hurt the most,"" says Mr Lemayian. The $35 sensors measure temperature, humidity, and the size of particles found in the air. ""We found the biggest amount of interest has come from mothers wanting to know about the air quality near their homes for the sake of their babies' health,"" says Mr Lemayian. There are several other projects aiming to fill the weather data void in Africa. But if commercial organisations keep the data to themselves, campaigners argue, local communities could suffer."
Yield Spread Analysis,Australia 'not intimidated' by Facebook news ban,2024-09-14,2021-02-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56109036,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said his government will not be intimidated by Facebook blocking news feeds to users. He described the move to ""unfriend Australia"" as arrogant and disappointing. Facebook is responding to a proposed law which would make tech giants pay for news content on their platforms. It says the legislation ""fundamentally misunderstands"" the relationship between the platform and publishers. Australians on Thursday woke up to find that Facebook pages of all local and global news sites were unavailable. People outside the country are also unable to read or access any Australian news publications on the platform. Several government health and emergency pages were also blocked. Facebook later asserted this was a mistake and many of these pages are now back online. Both Google and Facebook have fought the law, saying it unfairly ""penalises"" their platforms. However, in contrast to Facebook, Google has in recent days signed payment deals with major Australian media outlets. Facebook's action came hours after Google agreed to pay Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for content from news sites across its media empire. In a statement posted on Facebook, Mr Morrison said that big tech companies might be changing the world but this did not mean they should run it. ""Facebook's actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,"" he said. ""I am in regular contact with the leaders of other nations on these issues. We simply won't be intimidated,"" he added. Mr Morrison urged Facebook to work constructively with the government, ""as Google recently demonstrated in good faith"". Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban on news information had a ""huge community impact"". About 17 million Australians visit the social media site every month.  Consumption of digital news through social media and search engines is growing in Australia, according to the Reuters Digital News Report for 2020. Some 37% of consumers who took part said they had gained access to news via social media over the course of a week, compared with 31% who had directly accessed websites or apps, the report said. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan accused Facebook of ""behaving like a North Korean dictator"". Others suggested that a news vacuum could be filled by misinformation and conspiracy theories.  Human Rights Watch's Australia director said Facebook was censoring the flow of information in the country - calling it a ""dangerous turn of events"". The move also faced criticism abroad. Julian Knight, the head of the British parliamentary committee overseeing the media industry, told Reuters news agency it was ""bully boy action"". Meanwhile, the company behind the Guardian newspaper said it was ""deeply concerned"". Many Australians are angry about their sudden loss of access to trusted and authoritative sources. ""It feels obviously very restrictive in what Facebook is going to allow people to do in the future, not only in Australia but around the world,"" Peter Firth, in Sydney, told the BBC.  Amelia Marshall said she could not believe the firm's decision ""in the middle of a pandemic"", adding: ""I've made the long-overdue decision to permanently delete my Facebook account.""  Australian authorities had drawn up the laws to ""level the playing field"" between the tech giants and struggling publishers over profits. Of every A$100 (£56; $77) spent on digital advertising in Australian media these days, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. But Facebook said the law left it ""facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia"". ""With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,"" it said in a blog post. The law sought ""to penalise Facebook for content it didn't take or ask for"", the company's local managing director William Easton said. Facebook said it helped Australian publishers earn about A$407m last year through referrals, while ""the platform gain from news is minimal"". However, Facebook is by far the most important social platform for news. In Australia, about 36% of people use the platform for news. Meanwhile, only 14% of Australians pay for online news. Also, media companies have seen a long-term decline in advertising revenue while that of Google and Facebook has risen in recent years. Under the ban, Australian publishers are restricted from sharing or posting any links on their Facebook pages. The national broadcaster, ABC, and newspapers like The Australian have millions of followers.  Australia's conservative government is standing by the law - which passed the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. It has broad cross-party support and the Senate is likely to pass it next week. ""We will legislate this code. We want the digital giants paying traditional news media businesses for generating original journalistic content,"" said Mr Frydenberg. He pointed out that Facebook, like Google, had been negotiating pay deals with local organisations.  Facebook's ban on news sites on its Australian-facing site could well lead to greater prominence for unverified and untrusted information, helping disinformation to spread further.  First Draft, a site which investigates the spread of false and misleading posts online,  warned the restrictions will ""open up a vacuum that could be filled in part by mis and disinformation"". Facebook says it will continue to remove harmful misinformation, connect users with reliable health advice and work with third party fact checkers. One of the topics for which a great deal of unreliable information is shared online is that of Covid-19 vaccines. So we looked at search results for the word ""vaccine"" over the past 12 hours on Facebook pages primarily based in Australia and found prominent results for sites casting doubt on the coronavirus pandemic.  This search also brings up reliable information sources, and further analysis will be needed over the next few days to see whether this anecdotal evidence is backed up by longer term data."
Yield Spread Analysis,Ukraine seeks meeting with Russia within 48 hours,2024-09-14,2022-02-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60370541,"Ukraine has called for a meeting with Russia and other members of a key European security group over the escalating tensions on its border. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had ignored formal requests to explain the build-up of troops.  He said the next step was requesting a meeting within the next 48 hours for transparency about Russia's plans. Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine despite the build-up of some 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine's borders. But with the US saying Moscow could begin with aerial bombardments ""at any time"" more than a dozen nations have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine. Ukraine's ambassador in London, Vadym Prystaiko, has backtracked on comments he made to the BBC in which he said Ukraine was willing to be ""flexible"" on its ambition to join Nato, which would have been be a major concession to Russia.  But in a subsequent interview he said that Ukraine had a constitutional commitment to join Nato and it depended on the ""readiness of Nato itself"" whether Ukraine would be admitted.  British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the UK would support whatever Ukraine decided to do.  Ukraine has made a request via the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) for Russia to explain its build-up of troops. Under the Vienna Document, of which Russia is party to, OSCE members can ask for information on a member's military activities.  ""If Russia is serious when it talks about the indivisibility of security in the OSCE space, it must fulfil its commitment to military transparency in order to de-escalate tensions and enhance security for all,"" Mr Kuleba said.  However, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who criticised the ""panic"" that could spread from such claims, said he had seen no proof that Russia was planning an invasion in the coming days. On Sunday, he spoke for nearly an hour by phone with US President Joe Biden. The White House said President Biden had reiterated US support for Ukraine, and that both leaders had agreed on ""the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence"". Ukraine's statement of the call said its president had thanked the US for its ""unwavering support"" and that, at the end, President Zelensky had invited the US leader to come to Ukraine. There has been no comment on the invite from the White House. An hour-long call between President Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin the day before failed to yield a breakthrough.  In the latest attempt to find a diplomatic solution, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has meetings scheduled with President Zelensky in Kyiv later on Monday and with President Putin in Moscow on Tuesday.  The chancellor, who took over the leadership of Germany from Angela Merkel in December, has warned of severe economic consequences for Russia if it should launch any invasion, echoing statements by other Western nations and members of the Nato military alliance. But Berlin officials have downplayed any expectation of a breakthrough.  Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to hold fresh diplomatic talks across Europe to bring Russia ""back from the brink"" of war. In Washington, President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said an invasion could begin ""any day now"". Mr Sullivan said the US is closely monitoring for a potential ""false flag"" operation by Moscow as a pretext for a full-scale invasion so it can claim it is responding to Ukrainian aggression. Russia contends that its build-up of troops along the Ukraine border is its own concern, within its own territory. On Sunday, senior foreign policy official Yuri Ushakov characterised the US warnings of imminent invasion as ""hysteria has reached its peak""."
Yield Spread Analysis,Shares volatile on debt concerns,2024-09-14,2011-07-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-14113796,"This video can not be played Commissioner Olli Rehn: ""I'm relieved to see member states taking swift action"" European shares have been volatile on fears that the debt crisis in the eurozone may spread to Italy and Spain. Italy's main index fell 4% at one point, before recovering to rise 1.2%. Spanish shares fell 0.7% and the UK's FTSE 100 shed 1%. The yields on Italian and Spanish bonds also continued to rise as worries over the two countries grew. After the European markets closed, ratings agency Moody's cut the Irish Republic's debt rating to junk status. Moody's said its decision was based on the ""growing possibility"" that the country would need a second bail-out before it can return to capital markets. The move also sent US stocks lower - they had been trading up prior to the announcement but the Dow Jones fell 0.5% at the close and the Nasdaq dropped 0.7%. On Monday, eurozone finance ministers said they were ready to pass new measures to stop the crisis spreading. They met in Brussels again on Tuesday, this time with their colleagues from European Union nations that do not use the euro.  Diplomats have said that a meeting of leaders of the 17 eurozone countries was being considered for Friday. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy said a summit ""has not been excluded"", while EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn declined to comment on the possible meeting. But Mr Rehn said he was ""relieved to see our member states now taking swift action to face any weaknesses"". The euro was also lower, falling to a four-month low against the dollar at $1.3835. The concern is that Italy and Spain may have to follow Greece, Portugal and the Republic of Ireland and seek a European Union and International Monetary Fund (IMF) bail-out. On Monday, eurozone finance ministers said increased efforts to ""improve the euro area's systemic capacity to resist contagion risk"" would include ""enhancing the flexibility and the scope"" of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). This is the bail-out fund to which eurozone member states contribute. Finance ministers also agreed to look at lowering the interest rates that Greece, Portugal and the Irish Republic have to pay, plus lengthening the maturities of their loans. ""Ministers reaffirmed their absolute commitment to safeguard financial stability in the euro area,"" the finance ministers said in a statement after eight hours of talks in Brussels. Concern that Italy could be the next country to require a financial bail-out comes as Italy's Finance Minister, Giulio Tremonti, left Tuesday's talks early so he could continue to work on an austerity budget to reduce Italy's public deficit. He has proposed 48bn euros ($67bn; £42bn) in budget cuts over three years and aims to cut the deficit to zero by 2014 from this year's 3.9% of gross domestic product. However, financial markets were unsettled by earlier remarks from Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who indicated in a newspaper interview that the austerity plan might not have full cabinet support. Shares in Italian banks were down sharply in early trading, with Intesa SanPaolo losing 4% and UniCredit heading 7% lower. However, both then rebounded after the Italian government announced a successful sale of 12-month bonds, albeit at a high price. Intesa rose 3.3% and UniCredit was up 5.9% on the day, while Italy's main share index, the FTSE MIB, reversed earlier losses. Yet in a sign that investors remain more risk-averse to Italy, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds on Tuesday increased to 5.8% from 5.6% on Monday. Meanwhile, yields on 10-year bonds issued by the Spanish government rose to 6.3%, from 6.1%. Analysts say both these yields are now close to levels at which the two countries will have problems servicing their debts. Asian shares had earlier closed lower, with the situation in the eurozone being closely monitored around the world, with Japan's Nikkei index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng both falling 1.4%. Jean-Francois Robin of French investment bank Natixis said: ""We find ourselves at one of the worst moments of the European monetary crisis.  ""The idea of a contagion from the Greek crisis to other eurozone countries like Italy and Spain is gaining ground."" On Monday, eurozone finance ministers also discussed how, and by how much, banks and other financial institutions could contribute to a new rescue package for Greece. However, no final decision was reached on this, as it also has to be agreed with the IMF. Speaking from Washington, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said it was not yet ready to discuss terms for a second Greek bail-out. ""Nothing should be taken for granted,"" she said.

Yield Spread Analysis,Florida bans new African American course in schools,2024-09-14,2023-01-20,By Nadine Yousif,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64348902,"Florida officials have blocked the introduction of a new advanced-level high school course that teaches African American history.  Governor Ron DeSantis' administration said the proposed course ""lacks educational value and is contrary to Florida law"".  The course is being rolled out in a pilot programme by the US College Board to 60 high schools across the country.  Officials did not specify what law the course breaks.  The Florida Department of Education outlined its intent to block the course in a 12 January letter to the College Board, writing that the course violates state law.  ""In the future, should the College Board be willing to come back to the table with lawful, historically accurate content, (the Department of Education) will always be willing to reopen the discussion,"" the letter said. The Advanced Placement (AP) African American studies course is the College Board's first new class since 2014. It is set to cover more than 400 years of African American history, touching on topics like literature, political science and geography.  The course is part of a broader AP programme in US high schools, which gives students the chance to take college-level courses before graduation.  A statement by a spokesperson for Florida's Republican governor DeSantis said the course ""leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow"". ""If the College Board amends the course to comply, provides a full course curriculum, and incorporates historically accurate content, then the Department will reconsider the course for approval,"" said spokesperson Bryan Griffin in a statement to media.  In response, the College Board said the course is ""undergoing a rigorous, multi-year pilot phase, collecting feedback from teachers, students, scholars and policymakers"".  ""We look forward to bringing this rich and inspiring exploration of African-American history and culture to students across the country,"" the board said. The decision to block the African American studies course has been met with outrage from the National Parents Union, who said the ban is a ""direct attack on the Black and all (Black, Indigenous and Persons of Colour) communities"".  ""This behaviour is dangerous and should concern every American,"" the organisation said, adding they will challenge the decision.  The ban was also criticised by Florida's state senator and Democrat Shevrin Jones, who wrote on Twitter that other AP courses, like European History and several language and culture courses, are still being taught in the state. ""It's crazy how AP African-American studies made the chopping block in FL,"" Mr Jones wrote.  Last year, Gov DeSantis passed a ""Stop WOKE"" act that regulates how lessons on race and gender are taught in Florida schools. ""In Florida, we are taking a stand against the state-sanctioned racism that is critical race theory,"" Mr DeSantis said, citing the academic framework that denotes the existence of systemic racism in American society.  However, one of the developers of the AP African American studies course had previously told Time magazine that the class does not teach ""critical race theory"".  Rather, Henry-Louis Gates Jr, a leading scholar on African American history in the US, said the course ""is a mainstream, rigorously vetted, academic approach to a vibrant field of study"".  Ron DeSantis has been assembling the kind of record on hot-button conservative issues that could form the core of a presidential campaign later this year. He repeatedly criticised government mandates to control the spread of Covid-19 and has expanded his attacks to include the development of the coronavirus vaccines. He railed against big corporations, including Florida powerhouse Disney, for catering to liberal interests and ideologies. He's accused social media companies of bias against conservatives.  The topic Mr DeSantis appears most focused on, however, is education. He enthusiastically backed state legislation limiting the ability of school teachers to talk about LGBTQ issues in their classrooms. He's supported conservative candidates for local education boards and appointed controversial conservative activists as university trustees. He's called for a ban on transgender athletes in interscholastic competitions.  His latest move, blocking the use of an advanced African American Studies curriculum in Florida public high schools, is just one piece of this larger puzzle. If Mr DeSantis runs for president, his pitch to primary voters is that he is the Republican who takes real action on conservative concerns- the kind of culture-war red meat that is a staple on right-wing media outlets."
Yield Spread Analysis,Suspected Chinese spy balloon was 200ft tall - US,2024-09-14,2023-02-06,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64548140,"A suspected Chinese surveillance balloon shot down off the US coast was about 200 ft (60m) tall and carrying an airliner-sized load, officials say. At a briefing on Monday, a US defence official said the size and make-up of the object informed the decision not to shoot it down while it was over land. ""Picture large debris weighing hundreds if not thousands of pounds falling out of the sky,"" Gen Glen VanHerck said. The US is still working to recover debris off the coast of South Carolina. Remnants of the object - which the US believes is a spy balloon but China says is a weather monitoring device blown astray - have been collected from a roughly 1,500m (4,920 ft) by 1,500m sized area, but it is thought debris is spread over a far larger site. Multiple fighter jets were involved in the operation to shoot it down, but only one US Air Force F-22 took the shot at 14:39 local time (19:39 GMT) on Saturday days after it first appeared over US territory. It sent debris hurtling down about six nautical miles off the US coast.  ""They have recovered some remnants off the surface of the sea and weather conditions did not permit much undersea surveillance of the debris field,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. He said US personnel would ""in the coming days be able to get down there and take a better look at what's on the bottom of the ocean, but it's just started"". There is no plan to give the remnants back to China, officials said, adding that the retrieved debris would be analysed by intelligence experts. A number of specialist ships have been deployed to the area, including an oceanographic survey ship that uses sonar and other means to map out a debris field, Gen VanHerck, who commands both the US military's Northern Command and joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Command, or Norad, said. He added that while the balloon was several hundred feet tall, the payload - the portion which would have carried equipment - was about the same size as a regional airliner.  Gen VanHerck said the US was still working to determine whether the debris includes potentially dangerous materials, such as explosives or battery components.  Republican politicians have accused US President Joe Biden of a dereliction of duty for allowing the balloon to traverse the country unhindered. The decision to shoot it down also triggered a diplomatic spat between the US and China, and prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a scheduled trip to Beijing that had been aimed at easing tensions. On Monday, China accused the US of using ""indiscriminate force"" when it downed the balloon. It said it ""obviously overreacted and seriously violated the spirit of international law"". The US believes the balloon was being used to monitor sensitive military sites. Adm Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because ""it has propellers on it"". ""This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,"" he added. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson has confirmed that a second balloon - currently floating over Latin America - is also Chinese."
Yield Spread Analysis,Fernandes hat-trick helps Man Utd thump Leeds,2024-09-14,2021-08-12,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58124893,"This video can not be played Match of the Day analysis: Manchester United's 'outstanding' performance against Leeds Bruno Fernandes scored an opening-day hat-trick as Manchester United swept Leeds aside with a devastating second-half display. The Portugal midfielder opened the scoring on the half-hour at a packed Old Trafford, but Luke Ayling's thunderous strike drew Leeds level early in the second half. Mason Greenwood restored the hosts' lead with a crisp finish less than two minutes later, before Fernandes' low shot was ruled to have crossed the line by referee Paul Tierney after a check of goalline technology. The 26-year-old quickly completed his hat-trick with a thumping finish from Victor Lindelof's pass, before Fred added United's fourth goal in 14 minutes from Paul Pogba's cross - the Frenchman's fourth assist of the afternoon. This video can not be played Man Utd 5-1 Leeds Utd: 'I couldn't have asked for more,' says Solskjaer It was Fernandes' first hat-trick since he moved to Old Trafford in January 2020 and only the second by a Red Devils player since Robin van Persie's title-winning effort against Aston Villa in 2013. But the game was also a personal triumph for Pogba. The France midfielder's future has been the subject of intense debate as he enters the final year of his contract. But his four assists included a sublime pass for Greenwood's goal, and he left the field to a standing ovation 15 minutes from time as £74m new-boy Jadon Sancho was introduced for his debut. A glimpse of peak Pogba - but can he keep it going? How all of Saturday's action unfolded This video can not be played Bruno Fernandes on scoring his first hat-trick for Manchester United in Leeds win Fernandes' last hat-trick was for Sporting Lisbon in an 8-1 hammering of Belenenses in front of just over 5,000 in May 2019. Although the Portuguese has assumed hero status since moving to England, this was only the fourth time he had played a Premier League game in front of capacity crowd at Old Trafford. After a disappointing Euro 2020, any concerns about his impact at domestic level have been completely dispelled. His opener was excellent as he ran on to Pogba's first-time pass, controlled a bouncing ball in the Leeds area, then put enough power into his shot to take it into the net despite Illan Meslier's half-save. Another Pogba pass offered Fernandes the opportunity to sit Meslier on his backside as he turned sharply before hitting a low shot goalwards that referee Tierney was correctly informed had crossed the line before Ayling cleared. Fernandes' third was route one. Lindelof's pass fell perfectly for the forward, who allowed the ball to bounce before crashing it into the net.  It meant he followed Anthony Martial as the only Manchester United player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Van Persie - and the first to do it in front of fans. The volume for an already noisy crowd was turned up another notch by Raphael Varane's introduction just before the teams emerged. Manchester United's new £34m defender will be tasked with bringing greater stability to a back four that, even here, looked shaky at times. Skipper Harry Maguire was almost embarrassed in a foot race with Patrick Bamford which he started with a clear advantage and poor marking should have been exploited by Rodrigo, who was off target with his header after being allowed to meet Raphinha's curling free-kick unopposed. This video can not be played Marcelo Bielsa says his side struggled with the 'succession' of goals Manchester United scored For a team whose league record at Old Trafford is poor - Leeds have not won here since 1981 - and who conceded six in the corresponding fixture last season, it did not bode well. Ayling did offer some hope when he was afforded far too much space to shoot - presumably on the basis he had never previously scored a Premier League goal - and promptly found the corner from 25 yards. But it was only the prelude to a Manchester United onslaught from which there was no chance of recovery. This was always likely to be a tinderbox fixture on the first weekend of full Premier League stadiums for 19 months. Trouble in the city centre, in which Greater Manchester Police said there were ""isolated incidents of disorder"", briefly gave way to unanimity at the stadium as supporters joined together to applaud figures from both clubs who have passed away during the coronavirus pandemic. But that did not last. Amid the mutual loathing was one chant about the Munich air disaster among the visiting support, which BBC Sport has been told was in response to a Turkish flag being dropped into the Leeds fans from a higher tier of the stand. For Leeds this is massively inflammatory as it references the two fans who were killed in Istanbul in 2000 before the Uefa Cup semi-final with Galatasaray. Later, substitute Jadon Sancho was told he ""let his country down"" as he began his first warm-up - a reference to his missed penalty for England in the Euro 2020 final against Italy. Given the chaos of United's end to last season, when a home game against Liverpool had to be abandoned after home fans broke into the stadium, club officials will probably be relieved there was no threat to this fixture, although there was an anti-Glazer chant to underline that the issues with the owners have not gone away.

Yield Spread Analysis,Staying at home this weekend 'not a request',2024-09-14,2020-04-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52155430,"Staying at home this weekend is an instruction and ""not a request"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said, as he updated the country on the coronavirus. Speaking at the No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock said that while warm weather was forecast in some areas this weekend ""the disease is still spreading"". England's chief nursing officer Ruth May also paid tribute to two nurses who have died from the disease. ""Please stay at home for them,"" she urged people. Areema Nasreen, 36, had spent weeks in intensive care with coronavirus, while Aimee O'Rourke, 39, died at the hospital where she worked. ""They were one of us, they were one of my profession, of the NHS family,"" said Ms May. ""I worry that there's going to be more and I want to honour them today and recognise their service."" It comes as latest figures showed a further 684 people with the virus died in the UK, bringing the total to 3,605. There are 38,168 confirmed cases. In Scotland, the number of deaths has risen by 46, while in Wales a further 24 people died. In NI, the number of people who died with coronavirus has risen by 12. Mr Hancock - who recently ended his seven days of self-isolation after contracting the virus - said: ""We cannot relax our discipline now. If we do, people will die. ""I end with the advice we all know. This advice is not a request - it is an instruction. ""Stay at home, protect lives and then you will be doing your part."" The warning follows messages from local councils, tourism bosses and police urging people to stay away from beauty spots, as the Easter holidays begin and warm weather is expected. Mr Hancock also said the UK has set up three national clinical trials looking at how existing drugs can be altered to treat Covid-19. He added that more patients are needed to volunteer to take part in the trials - but England's deputy chief medical officer later clarified that people cannot apply themselves and it was up to doctors to refer patients. Ms May also appealed to the public to stay at home, saying: ""This weekend is going to be very warm and it will be very tempting to go out and enjoy those summer rays. ""But please, I ask to remember Aimee and Areema. Please stay at home for them."" By BBC News health correspondent Lauren Moss This was one of the longest daily briefings that has been held since the coronavirus outbreak began. It is the first time we've been given detail of clinical trials which are under way in the UK to treat patients with Covid-19 and find out which medicines will help those who are sick.  At the moment there is no single proven drug to tackle coronavirus and a vaccine is still a long way off.  The trials involve patients from primary to critical care and more than 900 people are already involved.  A word of caution though, even if clinicians give their patients the go ahead to take part, it will probably take a few months for that data to be gathered and then made available. Also mentioned in Friday's daily update:  New cases have been slowing down recently: dipping slightly at the weekend and growing more slowly this week (doubling roughly every five days).  Even that trend would have predicted over 5,000 new cases today, and so this looks like further evidence that the case numbers could be slowing down (as long as every patient who needs testing is getting tested). Today's figures on deaths follow the recent trends closely (doubling roughly every 3.5 days). Remember that doubling every few days means that we should expect to see record new highs regularly. It takes more than three weeks from infection to death to being reported in these figures. So while we can hope to see the effects of pre-lockdown social distancing soon, it will take longer for the effect of the lockdown, announced on 23 March, to become apparent. Meanwhile, the Queen, 93, will speak to the nation on Sunday evening about the coronavirus outbreak in a rare special address. Buckingham Palace said the message, recorded at Windsor Castle, will be broadcast on TV and radio at 20:00 BST. The Queen's address will be broadcast on TV, radio and social media, Buckingham Palace said. She has been staying at Windsor Castle since mid-March as a precaution. It is only her fourth special address at a time of national crisis during her 68-year reign. The other occasions were after the Queen Mother's death in 2002, ahead of Diana, Princess of Wales's funeral in 1997, and during the First Gulf War in 1991. The Queen also made a televised address to mark her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. The monarch, 93, released a statement about the outbreak last month, when the number of UK deaths stood at 144. She said the UK was ""entering a period of great concern and uncertainty"" and praised the work of scientists, medics and emergency staff, saying everyone has a ""vitally important part to play"". BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Sunday's speech had been decided ""in close consultation with Downing Street"" as ""they have had it in their minds for some days now"". He suggested the speech might include thanks for NHS staff and key workers, as well as an emphasis on the important role individuals can play - while also aiming to reassure and rally people.  The heir to the throne, Prince Charles, was seen in public for the first time on Friday after being diagnosed with coronavirus and spending seven days in self-isolation. He opened the first of the National Health Service's emergency field hospitals to treat coronavirus patients in east London's ExCel centre, via a video-link from his home on  the Queen's Balmoral estate. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced he had contracted the virus last Friday, said he will carry on self-isolating after continuing to display mild symptoms of the virus including a high temperature."
Yield Spread Analysis,'Aggressive action' needed as Africa cases pass 1m,2024-09-14,2020-08-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53677481,"""Aggressive and bold"" action is needed as Africa's coronavirus cases pass the one-million mark, according to the African Union (AU) body dealing with the pandemic.  It says South Africa - where testing has been widespread - accounts for more than half of all cases. Tanzania's lack of data meanwhile is a ""concern"" for the AU. Experts say a lack of comprehensive testing across Africa means the true extent of the pandemic is not known. Tanzania, for example, has not published figures for weeks and in early July its health minister said the virus was ""heading towards an end"". ""We continue to reach out [to Tanzania] but we're not having the right responses,"" director of the AU's Centres for Disease and Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), Dr John Nkengasong, told the BBC. In the continent overall, more than 22,000 people have died with Covid-19 and almost 690,000 people have recovered, the figures show. Just over eight million tests have been carried out, but Dr Nkengasong said at least 13 million tests should have taken place. Africa's first coronavirus case was confirmed in Egypt in February - three weeks after Europe, and two months after the outbreak began in China in December. The two countries with the highest numbers of cases are South Africa and Egypt. They accounted for 75% of all the new cases reported by mid-July. South Africa has the highest recorded number of total cases and reported deaths, and make up more than half of all the cases in Africa. You may also want to watch: The Africa CDC is keeping a close eye on Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe, Dr Nkengasong told the BBC's Newsday programme. More than 65% of Africa's 55 countries have reported fewer than than 5,000 cases, Africa CDC says. African nations have been praised for locking down more swiftly than other parts of the world. The continent has fewer confirmed cases than Europe, which has 1.7 million, and the United States which has 4.8 million. But there are concerns about insufficient testing, and the Africa CDC admits this should be expanded along with tracing. Dr Nkengasong said another risk was ""community fatigue"" where people tire of prevention messages. ""We know that wearing masks constantly will help this situation,"" he added. A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and tested in South Africa, the UK and Brazil, appears to be safe and triggers an immune response. But it is still too soon to know if this is enough to offer protection and larger trials are under way. This is a significant milestone and an alarming one. But it is also a mystery.  More than 500,000 cases of Covid-19 have already been confirmed in South Africa alone. The country has good data and - compared with most of Africa - a huge testing operation under way. So, is it really possible that there are only another half a million cases across rest of the entire continent?  The short answer is no.  Experts here agree that, given the minimal amount of testing it is almost certain that Africa has already sailed far past the one million mark. But doctors also point out that hospitals in many countries are not yet overloaded with suspected Covid-19 cases.  There are many possible explanations: fear of going to clinics, early lockdowns in many countries and sparser populations.  And because there is still so much to learn about Covid-19, it is possible that some populations may enjoy some extra protection against the virus, perhaps because of immune systems already bolstered by previous battles against malaria, cholera and other diseases."
Yield Spread Analysis,Criticism grows over Facebook's Australia news ban,2024-09-14,2021-02-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56116738,"Facebook is facing mounting criticism after it blocked news content in Australia amid a dispute with the government over a planned law. The law will force tech giants to pay for news content on their platforms. Facebook says the legislation ""fundamentally misunderstands"" its relationship with publishers. But politicians, publishers and rights groups in several countries have accused it of bullying, and raised concerns over access to information. Under Facebook's new rules, Australian users are blocked from viewing and sharing local and international news, while local publishers are restricted from sharing or posting any links on their pages.  Several government health and emergency pages were also blocked, but Facebook later said this was a mistake and many of these pages are now back online. In a statement posted on Facebook, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the social media company's actions to ""unfriend Australia"" were ""as arrogant as they were disappointing"". He added that he was in ""regular contact with the leaders of other nations"" over the issue and would not be ""intimidated"". Mr Morrison later raised the issue with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he sought to gain international support, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.  Other Australian officials have also criticised the move. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban on news information had a ""huge community impact"". About 17 million Australians visit the social media site every month. It is the most important social platform for news in the country.  Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan accused Facebook of ""behaving like a North Korean dictator"". Others suggested that a news vacuum could be filled by misinformation and conspiracy theories.  Human Rights Watch's Australia director said Facebook was censoring the flow of information, calling it a ""dangerous turn of events"". A local campaigner with rights group Amnesty International said it was ""extremely concerning that a private company is willing to control access to information that people rely on"". The move also faced criticism outside Australia. Julian Knight, the head of the British parliamentary committee overseeing the media industry, called Facebook's action ""bullying"". ""I think it's staggeringly irresponsible - at a time when we are facing a plethora of fake news and disinformation in relation to the Covid vaccine,"" he told the BBC.  ""This is not just about Australia. This is Facebook putting a marker down, saying to the world that 'if you do wish to limit our powers… we can remove what is for many people a utility'."" Global publishers also reacted, with the company behind the Guardian newspaper saying it was ""deeply concerned"". The head of Germany's BDZV news publishers' association said it was ""high time that governments all over the world limit the market power of the gatekeeper platforms"". Many Australian users are also angry about their sudden loss of access to trusted and authoritative sources. ""It feels obviously very restrictive in what Facebook is going to allow people to do in the future, not only in Australia but around the world,"" Peter Firth, in Sydney, told the BBC.  Facebook's ban on news sites on its Australian-facing site could well lead to greater prominence for unverified and untrusted information, helping disinformation to spread further.  First Draft, a site which investigates the spread of false and misleading posts online, warned the restrictions would ""open up a vacuum that could be filled in part by mis and disinformation"". Facebook says it will continue to remove harmful misinformation, connect users with reliable health advice and work with third-party fact checkers. One of the topics for which a great deal of unreliable information is shared online is that of Covid-19 vaccines. So we looked at search results for the word ""vaccine"" over the past 12 hours on Facebook pages primarily based in Australia and found prominent results for sites casting doubt on the coronavirus pandemic.  This search also brings up reliable information sources, and further analysis will be needed over the next few days to see whether this anecdotal evidence is backed up by longer term data. Australian authorities say they drew up the legislation to ""level the playing field"" on profits between the tech giants and struggling publishers. Of every A$100 (£56; $77) spent on digital advertising in Australian media these days, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. But Facebook's local managing director William Easton says the law seeks to ""penalise"" the company ""for content it didn't take or ask for"". ""The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content. It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,"" Mr Easton wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. Facebook said it helped Australian publishers earn about A$407m last year through referrals, while ""the platform gain from news is minimal"". Australia's conservative government is standing by the law - which passed the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. It has broad cross-party support and the Senate is likely to pass it next week. ""We will legislate this code. We want the digital giants paying traditional news media businesses for generating original journalistic content,"" said Mr Frydenberg. Search giant Google is also opposed to the Australian law, but it has now signed payment deals with major media outlets in the country. "
Yield Spread Analysis,NI testing for new coronavirus variant 'limited',2024-09-14,2021-01-24,By Marie-Louise  Connolly,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-55783564,"Northern Ireland is testing for the new coronavirus variant but capacity is limited, BBC News NI understands. The ""English"" variant is thought to be about 50-70% more infectious than the original Covid-19 strain that emerged early last year.  It is thought that up to 50% of current Covid-19 cases could be related to the new variant. The variant was first detected in Northern Ireland in December 2020.  On Sunday, the Department of Health reported 14 more coronavirus-related deaths, bringing the NI total to 1,730. Another 433 people have tested positive for Covid-19. There are 796 people in hospital in Northern Ireland with the virus, 74 of them are in intensive care and 54 are ventilated. In the past 36 hours, the Nightingale Hospital - based in the tower block at Belfast City Hospital - has opened eight additional ICU beds, in response to the number of people needing care for Covid-19. Some patients are being transferred from other hospitals, as are staff. Testing for the new variant is crucial in identifying clusters. It involves a process called Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) - a detailed and complex analysis system requiring specialist equipment.   While Belfast laboratories, including those at Queen's University, are conducting tests, BBC News NI understands that this is only in a small proportion of cases.  Experts in the field have told BBC News NI that it is widely accepted that Northern Ireland is on the ""back foot"" when it comes to detecting the new strain and that officials would support an urgent expansion of the service.  Such testing helps identify outbreaks and clusters faster, allowing hospitals and care homes to lock down more quickly. Concerns were raised in December as the new Covid-19 strain was detected after sampling just a small proportion of tests.  On Saturday, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin said that it was his ""understanding"" that Northern Ireland was not testing for the new variant. However, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said this was not true.   In a statement released on Sunday, it said the Regional Virus Laboratory (RVL) had reported over 200 genome sequences and that it is likely to increase its throughput to over 300 sequences next week and over 400 the following week. ""At present the UK, including NI as part of the COG-UK Consortium, is carrying out 40% of all global whole genome sequencing and is submitting its data... to share with other countries,"" the statement read. The statement said that whole genome sequencing has been in place from an early stage of the pandemic and to suggest NI is inactive in this field ""would be wholly incorrect - and is unfair to the dedicated, expert local staff working intensively in this area"".  The Republic of Ireland uses WGS at the National Virus Reference Lab at University College Dublin (UCD).  The Irish Coronavirus Sequencing Consortium also has testing facilities in some of the larger hospitals and universities.   On Sunday, the Irish Department of Health reported an additional 23 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic, bringing the country's death toll to 2,970. It also recorded a further 1,378 confirmed cases of the virus, taking the total number of cases to 186,554. The new variant could be increasing the death rate by up to 30%.  With the original virus, for every 1,000 cases, 100 people will be admitted to hospital and 10 could die. But it is thought that with the new variant and the same number of cases, 130 people could be hospitalised and 13 could die. It is likely that the new variant will eventually become the dominant strain. This does not mean the virus is changing into something else, but rather it is mutating into a variation of itself and that is expected of viruses.   Sources have told BBC News NI that testing may be expensive and dependant on specialists, but it is key to suppressing the infection.    The Department of Health said the expansion of whole genome sequencing in NI ""represents a targeted response to the concerns that have arisen in recent weeks in relation to specific variants"". Following outbreaks of C-Difficile and Pseudomonas in Northern Ireland an inquiry highlighted that Northern Ireland needed much better testing facilities and equipment for detecting these specific infectious diseases - an issue which has been addressed.

The Blues, who had 17 shots to Brentford's seven, were punished through Pinnock's thumping header from Mbeumo's wicked cross. With Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez up the field for a late corner, Neal Maupay led a Brentford counter-attack and set up Mbeumo for the second. Chelsea, who went closest in the first half when Noni Madueke struck the woodwork, slipped to a ninth home defeat this year thanks to some poor finishing. Brentford keeper Mark Flekken was never truly stretched and the visitors defended resolutely before hitting Chelsea on the break.

Brentford's goal was also created down the right when Mbeumo fired in a brilliant, pacy delivery and Pinnock sprinted to meet it with a powerful header. On the break Yegor Yarmolyuk was clean through when he was kept out by Sanchez, before Mbeumo stabbed a shot narrowly wide.

Cole Palmer looked impressive and crossed for an unmarked Marc Cucurella midway through the first half, but his first-time shot was straight at Flekken. After the restart Chelsea's wastefulness became more apparent and they did not have a shot on target in the second half.

Yield Spread Analysis,Ten-man Motherwell snatch late point against Dundee,2024-09-14,2023-12-02,Thomas Duncan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67528590,"Connor Wilkinson scored in the seventh minute of stoppage time Struggling 10-man Motherwell scored a dramatic goal in stoppage time to grab a much-needed point against Dundee in a Scottish Premiership thriller. Connor Wilkinson fired into the bottom corner in the seventh minute of added time for Stuart Kettlewell's side, who looked on course for an eighth defeat in 11 games after Zach Robinson's 88th-minute strike for Dundee, which came after Harry Paton's sending off. The red card for the Motherwell midfielder followed an on-field review of his tackle on Luke McCowan just four minutes after Bevis Mugabi had headed in an equaliser. It set up a frantic finish which swung from end-to-end, with Dundee eventually denied victory having themselves battled back from a goal down. Keep up to date with Motherwell The latest Dundee news After Mika Biereth smashed Motherwell in front on six minutes, Lyall Cameron latched on to Aaron Donnelly's hooked ball to nod Dundee level before the break, and just four minutes later Owen Beck showed composure to collect Zak Rudden's cross and plant the ball past goalkeeper Liam Kelly. Both sides had chances before Paton's dismissal, with Jon Obika inexplicably firing wide from close range before Mugabi's header restored parity and set up struggling Motherwell to claim at least a point. The video assistant referee's intervention seemed to have changed that after Paton was dismissed and Robinson finished a fine Dundee move. But their boss Tony Docherty will be frustrated his failed to deal with a long ball forward, which fell to Georgie Gent and then Oli Shaw, who teed up Wilkinson to snatch a brilliant point for Motherwell. Kettlewell's side are still winless in 11 league games and sit eighth but will almost feel like they won the game, while Dundee are sixth behind Hibernian on goal difference. The midfielder (right) put in an outstanding performance that included a goal After last week's draw at Celtic Park, this felt like a game Motherwell could attack and break their winless run. Biereth again showed his quality with a magnificent opener to give them the perfect start, but what came after was firmly in the script. No side has conceded more goals than Motherwell in the Premiership and they have kept just one clean sheet all season. They defended poorly again and were dominated in midfield for large spells. However, their character and recent ability to score goals at home recently cannot be questioned, having also netted in stoppage time to rescue a 3-3 draw against Ross County this season. Dundee will be frustrated they did not hold on for a win having scored a brilliant goal late on through Robinson and having played some neat football. Cameron was outstanding in the middle of the pitch alongside McCowan and Malachi Boateng. Beck is having a wonderful season on loan from Liverpool and was excellent again. It's still just one defeat in nine for Dundee so there is plenty to be pleased about for Docherty and the club's fans. Motherwell manager Stuart Kettlewell: ""Dundee manage to get the third goal, but it doesn't surprise me we show character to come back. Even though there is a lot of doubt and people us with the run we're on. ""But I said to the players the first goal should be massive in the Premiership but it wasn't for us today. It had the opposite effect."" Dundee manager Tony Docherty: ""Hugely disappointed to draw a game in which we were so dominant and the level of performance was so high. ""I thought we were outstanding and I should be talking about how good my team were. But we don't manage the last 90 seconds of the game properly and we end up dropping two points."" Motherwell travel to Dingwall to take on Ross County on Tuesday (19:45 GMT), while Dundee do not play until next Saturday, when they face Rangers at Ibrox (15:00). BBC Sport Scottish Football SPFL"
Yield Spread Analysis,Brentford beat Luton after second-half goal spree,2024-09-14,2023-12-01,Bobbie Jackson,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67528610,"Ben Mee scored his first goal in the Premier League this season Brentford returned to winning ways with a deserved victory against Premier League strugglers Luton. Neal Maupay put the Bees in front early in the second half when he prodded in from close range after Ben Mee scuffed a shot. Mee did not have to wait long to get his name on the scoresheet, as his header just seven minutes later put Brentford firmly in the driving seat. Jacob Brown gave Luton hope by halving the hosts' lead, but Shandon Baptiste calmed Brentford's nerves by restoring the two-goal cushion. In almost an exact repeat of Luton's meeting with Crystal Palace last Saturday, there was a distinct lack of goalmouth action early on at both ends of the field at Gtech Community Stadium. Tha drabness was summed up by the fact Hatters goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski was shown a yellow card for time-wasting in the 38th minute. Brentford's Yegor Yarmolyuk went closest to scoring for either side before the break when his low shot was deflected narrowly wide by Luton's Carlton Morris. But the Bees, who dominated possession without creating enough in the first period, came out with more purpose in the second period and were given an extra boost as Luton captain Tom Lockyer failed to re-emerge after sustaining an injury. Luton had to wait until the 61st-minute to register their first attempt on or off target in the game, substitute Brown firing a speculative effort wide of goal. Brown showed greater accuracy 15 minutes later with his second shot, Luton's first on target, when he latched on to a beautiful defence-splitting ball from Ross Barkley before driving low past Mark Flekken. Brentford's Baptiste, scoring his first goal since December 2021, wrapped up the points with just under 10 minutes remaining when he reacted quickest to convert after Keane Lewis-Potter's shot was parried into his path. This video can not be played Brentford 3-1 Luton Town: Brentford boss Frank applauds team spirit following injuries After successive losses in the Premier League against Arsenal and Liverpool, Brentford would have been relishing the chance to get back on track against relegation candidates Luton. They might have had one or two pre-match concerns, with the Hatters showing last weekend they can cause problems when they ran out 2-1 winners against Crystal Palace, albeit at home. But the campaign so far has been a struggle for Luton on their travels, and this result means they have won one, drawn one and lost five away from Kenilworth Road in the league. Brentford, who were hit by an injury to Kristoffer Ajer in the warm-up, initially struggled to break down a well organised outfit, enjoying plenty of possession but failing to turn that into anything meaningful. With little to get the home fans excited about on a chilly afternoon in West London during the opening 45 minutes, Brentford came out of the traps quickly after the restart and Luton were unable to continue keeping them at arm's length. It is worth noting that Brentford boss Thomas Frank is also dealing with a lengthy injury list, with eight players - including Ajer - sitting out with issues, while Ivan Toney remains suspended for breaking Football Association betting rules. Despite being far from full strength, Brentford showed enough to get through a testing encounter and confidence levels will be starting to creep back up in the right direction as they prepare for a trip to Brighton on Wednesday. Manager Frank told BBC Match of the Day: ""Very deserved, it was a very good performance in many ways. We had a plan for the Arsenal game a week ago and it was a different plan for Luton today. ""Until their goal, we were very dominant. With the amount of injuries we have - basically we have our four full-backs out - it was great. ""When you are dominating a game, if you keep the tempo and intensity, that is difficult to defend against and we did that very well."" This video can not be played Brentford 3-1 Luton Town: Rob Edwards admits Luton weren't good enough Luton's tally of 57 goals was the lowest of any club to finish in the top six of the Championship last season, while only one club scored fewer in the top 10. It appears manager Rob Edwards has not been able to solve those scoring issues since leading the club to a surprise promotion to the Premier League. Only Sheffield United (11) have netted fewer goals than Luton (13) after 14 fixtures in the top-flight this term. The Hatters looked uninterested in trying to attack during the first half, slowing the game down at every opportunity, and Anthony Taylor rightly dished out a yellow card to goalkeeper Kaminski after several complaints over his antics. If Brentford had not managed to get two early quickfire goals in the second half, Luton may have continued to sit deep with every intention of holding out for a draw. Morris, their top scorer this term with three, had no service throughout and the absence of attack-minded wing-back Alfie Doughty, who missed out with a hip injury, was a major blow. Luton manager Edwards told BBC Sport: ""The better side won today. We struggled to find rhythm with the ball and we weren't able to keep it as well as we wanted to. We've been doing that better recently. ""We lost our captain at half-time and that change was big for us. We were a little bit makeshift at the back and Brentford getting those goals made it tough.

Yield Spread Analysis,Greatest US films: Amazing facts,2024-09-14,2015-07-24,Fiona Macdonald,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150720-greatest-us-films-an-a-z-analysis,"Which Pinocchio song inspired Close Encounters of the Third Kind? And how did Buster Keaton break his neck without realising? Find out in BBC Culture’s A-Z of the stories behind the classics. A – Aliens Close Encounters of the Third Kind, number 75 Director Steven Spielberg was inspired by watching a meteor shower with his father as a child. He later recalled: “When I was a five-year-old kid in New Jersey… my dad woke me up in the middle of the night and rushed me into our car in my night clothes… He had a thermos of coffee and had brought blankets, and we drove for about half an hour. We finally pulled over to the side of the road, and there were a couple hundred people, lying on their backs in the middle of the night, looking up at the sky. My dad found a place, spread the blanket out, and we both lay down… He pointed to the sky, and there was a magnificent meteor shower.” The song When You Wish Upon a Star was a big influence on Spielberg in the film.  He referred to the score by John Williams as “When You Wish Upon a Star meets science fiction”, and wanted the song included in the closing credits. “I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me emotionally.” Star Wars, number 36 Director George Lucas was inspired to create the Wookiee character Chewbacca – a “gentle, hairy, non-English-speaking co-pilot” – after seeing his wife’s dog sitting in the passenger seat of his car. (The dog, called Indiana, provided the name for the lead character in another Lucas franchise.) The word ‘Chewbacca’ is close to the Russian word for dog, собака (sobaka). ET: The Extra-terrestrial, number 91 The film was based on Spielberg’s need for an imaginary friend after his parents’ divorce. “ET is a film that was inside me for many years,” the director has said. “ET was about the divorce of my parents, how I felt when my parents broke up. I responded by escaping into my imagination to shut down all my nerve endings crying ‘Mom, Dad, why did you break up and leave us alone?’… My wish list included having a friend who could be both the brother I never had and a father that I didn’t feel I had any more. And that’s how ET was born.” Apart from Elliott’s mother, adults are not seen from the waist up in the first half of the film, reinforcing a child’s viewpoint. B – Bombshells The icy, sophisticated blonde – personified by the stars Ingrid Bergman, Tippi Hedren and Grace Kelly – is an iconic part of the director’s style. He explained his choice in an interview with François Truffaut: “Sex on the screen should be suspenseful, I feel. If sex is too blatant or obvious, there’s no suspense. You know why I favour sophisticated blondes in my films? We’re after the drawing-room type, the real ladies, who become whores once they’re in the bedroom. Poor Marilyn Monroe had sex written all over her face.” Hitchcock favoured suspense over shock, saying: “There is no terror in the bang… only in the anticipation of it.” Vertigo, number 3 Being blonde takes on added meaning in Vertigo. When James Stewart’s character begs Kim Novak to dye her hair, she asks him: “If I let you change me, will that do it? If I let you change me … will you love me?” Psycho, number 8 Hitchcock’s penchant for blondes reveals a dark side to the director. He said in an interview: “Blondes make the best victims. They’re like virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints.” Marnie, number 47 Hitchcock wanted Grace Kelly to play the title role. The actress-turned-royal consort was forced to turn down the part after the citizens of Monaco objected to their princess playing a sexually disturbed thief: former model Tippi Hedren took her place. C – Charlie Chaplin on cocaine Modern Times, number 67 The Tramp character struggles to survive in an industrialised world – with assembly lines, factory machinery and cocaine in salt shakers. Charlie Chaplin planned Modern Times as his first ‘talkie’ but reverted to a silent format, fearing the character’s universal appeal would be damaged if he spoke. The Tramp’s voice can be heard for the first time, as he sings a song in gibberish. D – Dreams  Mulholland Drive, number 21 “The movie is a surrealist dreamscape in the form of a Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can’t stop watching it,” wrote Roger Ebert in his review of Mulholland Drive. “Nothing leads anywhere, and that’s even before the characters start to fracture and recombine like flesh caught in a kaleidoscope. Mulholland Drive isn’t like Memento, where if you watch it closely enough, you can hope to explain the mystery. There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.” Director David Lynch has said: “I don't know why people expect art to make sense when they accept the fact that life doesn't make sense.” E – Ear Blue Velvet, number 60 “Jeffrey finds an ear in a field as the clue,” Lynch told the New York Times in 1986. “I don’t know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body – a hole into something else, like a ticket to another world. The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect. Maybe a psychiatrist would have something to say about that.” F – Foreigners Casablanca, number 9 Many of the actors playing exiles were themselves refugees from war-torn Europe. According to Aljean Harmetz, who wrote The Making of Casablanca: “A dozen good actors, cast adrift, brought to a dozen small roles in Casablanca an understanding and a desperation that could never have come from Central Casting.” Just three of the credited actors were born in the US. G – Gunslingers Johnny Guitar, number 64 In his book The Films of My Life, the French New Wave director François Truffaut described how much he admired the 1954 Western. “It is dreamed, a fairytale, a hallucinatory Western… The cowboys vanish and die with the grace of ballerinas.” The Searchers, number 5 Ranked seventh in the BFI’s 2012 Sight and Sound poll, and named the greatest Western of all time by the AFI in 2008, John Ford’s epic wasn’t received as well by critics at the time. Variety’s review declared it “somewhat disappointing”. H – Hats Raiders of the Lost Ark, number 82 George Lucas created the character of Indiana Jones (originally named Indiana Smith) in 1973, but shelved the idea to work on Star Wars. Avoiding the spotlight as Star Wars opened in 1977, he went to Hawaii with Steven Spielberg, who told Vanity Fair: “I told him that I wanted to, for the second time, approach [film producer] Cubby Broccoli, who had turned me down the first time, to see if he would change his mind and hire me to do a James Bond movie. And George said, ‘I’ve got something better than that. It’s called Raiders of the Lost Ark.’ He pitched me the story, and I committed on the beach.” They based the film on the action serials of the 1930s, and made sure Indy kept his hat on in even the most hair-raising sequences. I – Idols Some Like it Hot, number 30 Marilyn Monroe’s contract stipulated that her films had to be shot in colour, but test shots of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in drag were said to be so grotesque that director Billy Wilder opted for black and white. Jerry Lewis turned down Jack Lemmon’s role, later telling Esquire: “I felt I couldn’t bring anything funny to it. The outfit was funny. I don’t need to compete with the wardrobe. So whenever Billy Wilder saw me, he said, ‘Good afternoon, schmuck, how’s it going?’ And, of course, Jack Lemmon sent me candy and roses every holiday, and the card always read: THANKS FOR BEING AN IDIOT.” North by Northwest, number 13 Cary Grant’s suit in the 1959 Hitchcock thriller was voted “the most legendary in the history of American cinema” by GQ magazine in 2006. Writer Todd McEwen even wrote a short story called Cary Grant’s Suit, telling the film from its viewpoint. J – Jungle Apocalypse Now, number 90 George Lucas was originally going to direct the 1979 war film, but turned it down after receiving the go-ahead to make Star Wars. Francis Ford Coppola stepped in, setting out to take the audience ‘through an unprecedented experience of war and have them react as much as those who had gone through the war’. The line “I love the smell of napalm in the morning” topped a 2004 poll of the best speeches in cinema history. K – Kisses It’s A Wonderful Life, number 46 This was James Stewart’s first screen kiss after returning from World War Two. To help with his nerves, director Frank Capra shot it in one take – it worked so well that Hollywood Production Code representatives demanded cuts to some of the scene, deeming it too passionate. L – Laments Sunset Boulevard, number 54 Director Billy Wilder wanted the corpse of Joe Gillis to be viewed from the pool’s bottom, but was unhappy with shots taken from a camera placed underwater in a box. In the end, the corpse’s reflection was filmed in a mirror on the bottom of the pool. M – Mobsters Mean Streets, number 93 The title was inspired by Raymond Chandler’s essay The Simple Art of Murder, which contains the line: “But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid.” N – Noir  Touch of Evil, number 51 Orson Welles’s noir won first prize at the 1958 Brussels World Fair; François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard – then critics – were on the jury. It was said to influence both – they went on to make their debut films (The 400 Blows and Breathless) in 1959 and 1960. Yet Welles had been denied the final cut, with Touch of Evil edited against his wishes. “There are scenes in the film I neither wrote nor directed, about which I know absolutely nothing,” he said in an interview for Cahiers du Cinéma. “I’ve been working since I was seventeen, I’ve directed eight films, and I’ve been able to edit only three of them myself… They always tear the film out of my hands – violently.” O – Odysseys 2001: A Space Odyssey, number 4 In a 1965 interview with Jeremy Bernstein, writer Arthur C Clarke said: “Science-fiction films have always meant monsters and sex, so we have tried to find another term for our film.” Director Stanley Kubrick argued: “About the best we have been able to come up with is a space odyssey – comparable in some ways to the Homeric Odyssey. It occurred to us that for the Greeks the vast stretches of the sea must have had the same sort of mystery and remoteness that space has for our generation.” P – Private eyes Chinatown, number 12 Director Roman Polanski was good friends with Jack Nicholson and screenwriter Robert Towne. The script for the 1974 LA noir is now considered ‘perfect’ in terms of structure, characters and dialogue. “I’ll tell you my favourite story about Roman,” said Towne in a 2009 interview. “When we started working on the re-write of Chinatown, Roman presented me with a book, a gift, called How to Write a Screenplay. He inscribed it ‘To my dear partner, with fond hope’.”  Q – QWERTY The Shining, number 62 The typewritten pages featuring ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy’ were replaced with expressions in different languages for international versions of the 1980 psychological horror. In Italian, they said ‘Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca’ – meaning ‘The morning has gold in its mouth’; in Spanish, ‘No por mucho madrugar amanece más temprano’ – ‘No matter how early you get up, you can't make the sun rise any sooner’; in French, ‘Un «Tiens» vaut mieux que deux «Tu l'auras»’ – ‘One “here you go” is worth more than two “you'll have it”’; and in German ‘Was du heute kannst besorgen, das verschiebe nicht auf morgen’ – ‘Never put off till tomorrow what may be done today’. R – Race The Birth of a Nation, number 39 The 1915 silent epic faced calls for its ban upon release, prompting a reaction from director DW Griffith. According to Roger Ebert, “stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its brutal images of blacks, Griffith tried to make amends in Intolerance (1916), which criticised prejudice. And in Broken Blossoms [1919] he told perhaps the first interracial love story in the movies – even though, to be sure, it’s an idealised love with no touching.” 12 Years a Slave, number 99 The 2013 period drama’s sweep at the Oscars meant that Steve McQueen became the first black director of a Best Picture winner. He chose a rich visual style for the film, saying: “When you think about Goya, who painted the most horrendous pictures of violence and torture and so forth, and they’re amazing, exquisite paintings, one of the reasons they’re such wonderful paintings is because what he’s saying is, ‘Look – look at this.’” S – Slapstick Sherlock Jr, number 44 Buster Keaton did most of his stunts in real time, without camera trickery: in one scene, he falls slowly from the roof of a moving train using a waterspout as counter-weight. The force of the water as the spout opened was so great that his head was knocked against a rail, giving him regular migraines. During a routine check-up years later, it emerged that he had fractured his neck doing the stunt. T – Technicolor The Wizard of Oz, number 34 “The transition from black and white (or sepia-coloured) footage for the Kansas sequences into the full Technicolor Oz scenes required some sleight of hand on set,” according to A Brief Guide to Oz. “The inside of the farmhouse was repainted in the sepia tone, and Judy Garland’s stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, went to the door, wearing a sepia version of the gingham dress. She then backed out of the frame, and Judy Garland, wearing the full-colour bright-blue dress, walked forward into the Technicolor Oz.” U – Umbrellas Singin’ in the Rain, number 7 When Gene Kelly filmed the title number, he was sick with a fever of 103 F and the director wanted to send him home. He later said: “The concept was so simple I shied away from explaining it to the brass at the studio in case I couldn't make it sound worth doing. The real work for this one was done by the technicians who had to pipe two city blocks on the backlot with overhead sprays, and the poor cameraman who had to shoot through all that water. All I had to do was dance.” V – Violins  Psycho, number 8 Composer Bernard Herrmann once told director Brian De Palma: “I remember sitting in a screening room after seeing the rough cut of Psycho. Hitch was nervously pacing back and forth, saying it was awful… ‘Wait a minute,’ I said, ‘I have some ideas. How about a score completely for strings? I used to be a violin player you know.’” According to Hitchcock’s original notes, “Through the killing, there should be the shower noise and the blows of the knife. We should hear water gurgling down the drain of the bathtub, especially when we go closer it… during the murder, the sound of the shower should be continuous and monotonous, only broken by the screams of Marion.” As Herrmann put it, “He didn't even want any music in the shower scene. Can you imagine that?” W – Weddings  The Godfather, number 2 Francis Ford Coppola took on The Godfather after 12 directors had turned it down; he described it as a ‘nightmarish experience’. “When it was all over I wasn’t at all confident … that I’d ever get another job,” he told an interviewer. X – Xanadu Citizen Kane, number 1 Orson Welles studied John Ford’s Stagecoach before he started shooting his debut film Citizen Kane. “As it turned out, the first day I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director,” he told Peter Bogdanovich in This is Orson Welles. “I’d learned whatever I knew in the projection room – from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I’d run Stagecoach… and ask questions. ‘How was this done? Why was this done?’ It was like going to school.” Y – Years with most films in the top 100: 1970s  Taxi Driver, number 19 Screenwriter Paul Schrader has revealed how his own state of mind bled into the script: “At the time I wrote it I was very enamoured of guns, I was very suicidal, I was drinking heavily, I was obsessed with pornography in the way a lonely person is, and all those elements are upfront in the script,” he says in Schrader on Schrader. “The most memorable piece of dialogue in the film is an improvisation: the ‘Are you looking at me?’ part. In the script it just says, ‘Travis speaks to himself in the mirror’. Bobby asked me what he would say and I said, well, he's a little kid playing with guns and acting tough. So De Niro used this rap that an underground New York comedian had been using at the time as the basis for his lines.” Z – Zombies Night of the Living Dead, number 85 Director George A Romero has revealed how his walking dead differed from zombies that had appeared on screen before his 1968 horror classic. “I didn’t call them zombies in Night of the Living Dead, and I didn’t think they were. Because in those films, the traditional Haitian voodoo zombie is not dead. And I thought I was doing something completely new by having the dead rise. The recently dead. They’re too weak to dig themselves out of graves. They’re too weak to eat brains, because they’ll never crack the skull. I have these sort of rules that I use, that everyone seems to have gone away from.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Yield Spread Analysis,Villa two points off top after win over Arsenal,2024-09-14,2023-12-08,Joe Rindl,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67598695,"John McGinn has scored seven goals in 29 games for Aston Villa and Scotland this season Aston Villa moved to within two points of the summit of the Premier League with a narrow win over Arsenal, who missed out on a chance to go top. Villa took the lead at Villa Park through skipper John McGinn, who brought Leon Bailey's cross under control before hammering the ball into the net. Arsenal had a late Kai Havertz effort ruled out for handball by referee Jarred Gillett, with the video assistant referee upholding the call after a lengthy review. Despite Arsenal pressure, Villa held on to back up their statement victory over champions Manchester City on Wednesday and record a club record 15th straight home league victory. Defeat will be a blow for title-chasing Arsenal, whose run of six straight wins in all competitions came to an end. 'I'm banning the t-word' - are Villa title contenders? How did you rate Villa's performance? Have your say here What did you make of Arsenal's display? Send us your views here Only in 1980-81, when they last won the title, have Aston Villa taken more points after 16 games of a top-flight season, and there is a real belief that they can break into the top four. There are even whispers that Unai Emery, once of Arsenal, could manage an outside push for the title. This video can not be played Villa 'can be excited' to be in title race - Emery Villa are the only Premier League club not to have dropped a point from a winning position this season, and, although Arsenal had the better chances after falling behind, Villa did create a few more of their own. Ollie Watkins forced two good saves from Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya, one of them when clean through, although the England striker was soon flagged for offside. In the second period Lucas Digne and Watkins both had shots saved following counter-attacks. Villa defended with discipline and intensity, ultimately benefitting from a late VAR call to stay third, one point off Arsenal in second place, and win their opening eight home matches in a top-flight season for the first time since 1932-33. This video can not be played How McGinn 'inspired' Villa to win over Arsenal Arsenal started Saturday top of the table, dropping to second after Liverpool's win over Crystal Palace at lunchtime. Mikel Arteta's side's last defeat had come at Newcastle at the start of November and his team had been enjoying a four-match winning run in the league. They created plenty of chances at a boisterous Villa Park. Bukayo Saka put a shot wide from close range just before McGinn's opener and Gabriel Martinelli dinked the ball over Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez but saw his effort hacked off the line by Diego Carlos in the first half. Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard had good chances from 12 yards out either side of the break. The first was saved by Martinez, while the second skidded wide. They also had a penalty shout just after half-time when Douglas Luiz caught Gabriel Jesus' ankle in the area, only for the VAR to uphold referee Gillett's decision to wave play on. The Gunners came close again midway through the second period when a routine corner was spilled by Martinez and deflected off Watkins on to the post before being cleared away with William Saliba lurking. And Saka had the ball in the net in the second half after dribbling around Martinez but had timed his run a fraction too early. But the real drama was still to come. In stoppage time Havertz brought down a cross and hacked the ball into the Villa net. The goal was immediately ruled out on the field, but it took a VAR review to confirm Havertz had inadvertently controlled the ball with his hand. Arsenal would not create another clear chance, slipping to a second league defeat of the season. This video can not be played Arsenal did enough to beat Villa - Arteta"
Yield Spread Analysis,Florida bans new African American course in schools,2024-09-14,2023-01-20,By Nadine Yousif,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64348902,"Florida officials have blocked the introduction of a new advanced-level high school course that teaches African American history.  Governor Ron DeSantis' administration said the proposed course ""lacks educational value and is contrary to Florida law"".  The course is being rolled out in a pilot programme by the US College Board to 60 high schools across the country.  Officials did not specify what law the course breaks.  The Florida Department of Education outlined its intent to block the course in a 12 January letter to the College Board, writing that the course violates state law.  ""In the future, should the College Board be willing to come back to the table with lawful, historically accurate content, (the Department of Education) will always be willing to reopen the discussion,"" the letter said. The Advanced Placement (AP) African American studies course is the College Board's first new class since 2014. It is set to cover more than 400 years of African American history, touching on topics like literature, political science and geography.  The course is part of a broader AP programme in US high schools, which gives students the chance to take college-level courses before graduation.  A statement by a spokesperson for Florida's Republican governor DeSantis said the course ""leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow"". ""If the College Board amends the course to comply, provides a full course curriculum, and incorporates historically accurate content, then the Department will reconsider the course for approval,"" said spokesperson Bryan Griffin in a statement to media.  In response, the College Board said the course is ""undergoing a rigorous, multi-year pilot phase, collecting feedback from teachers, students, scholars and policymakers"".  ""We look forward to bringing this rich and inspiring exploration of African-American history and culture to students across the country,"" the board said. The decision to block the African American studies course has been met with outrage from the National Parents Union, who said the ban is a ""direct attack on the Black and all (Black, Indigenous and Persons of Colour) communities"".  ""This behaviour is dangerous and should concern every American,"" the organisation said, adding they will challenge the decision.  The ban was also criticised by Florida's state senator and Democrat Shevrin Jones, who wrote on Twitter that other AP courses, like European History and several language and culture courses, are still being taught in the state. ""It's crazy how AP African-American studies made the chopping block in FL,"" Mr Jones wrote.  Last year, Gov DeSantis passed a ""Stop WOKE"" act that regulates how lessons on race and gender are taught in Florida schools. ""In Florida, we are taking a stand against the state-sanctioned racism that is critical race theory,"" Mr DeSantis said, citing the academic framework that denotes the existence of systemic racism in American society.  However, one of the developers of the AP African American studies course had previously told Time magazine that the class does not teach ""critical race theory"".  Rather, Henry-Louis Gates Jr, a leading scholar on African American history in the US, said the course ""is a mainstream, rigorously vetted, academic approach to a vibrant field of study"".  Ron DeSantis has been assembling the kind of record on hot-button conservative issues that could form the core of a presidential campaign later this year. He repeatedly criticised government mandates to control the spread of Covid-19 and has expanded his attacks to include the development of the coronavirus vaccines. He railed against big corporations, including Florida powerhouse Disney, for catering to liberal interests and ideologies. He's accused social media companies of bias against conservatives.  The topic Mr DeSantis appears most focused on, however, is education. He enthusiastically backed state legislation limiting the ability of school teachers to talk about LGBTQ issues in their classrooms. He's supported conservative candidates for local education boards and appointed controversial conservative activists as university trustees. He's called for a ban on transgender athletes in interscholastic competitions.  His latest move, blocking the use of an advanced African American Studies curriculum in Florida public high schools, is just one piece of this larger puzzle. If Mr DeSantis runs for president, his pitch to primary voters is that he is the Republican who takes real action on conservative concerns- the kind of culture-war red meat that is a staple on right-wing media outlets."
Yield Spread Analysis,Suspected Chinese spy balloon was 200ft tall - US,2024-09-14,2023-02-06,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64548140,"A suspected Chinese surveillance balloon shot down off the US coast was about 200 ft (60m) tall and carrying an airliner-sized load, officials say. At a briefing on Monday, a US defence official said the size and make-up of the object informed the decision not to shoot it down while it was over land. ""Picture large debris weighing hundreds if not thousands of pounds falling out of the sky,"" Gen Glen VanHerck said. The US is still working to recover debris off the coast of South Carolina. Remnants of the object - which the US believes is a spy balloon but China says is a weather monitoring device blown astray - have been collected from a roughly 1,500m (4,920 ft) by 1,500m sized area, but it is thought debris is spread over a far larger site. Multiple fighter jets were involved in the operation to shoot it down, but only one US Air Force F-22 took the shot at 14:39 local time (19:39 GMT) on Saturday days after it first appeared over US territory. It sent debris hurtling down about six nautical miles off the US coast.  ""They have recovered some remnants off the surface of the sea and weather conditions did not permit much undersea surveillance of the debris field,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. He said US personnel would ""in the coming days be able to get down there and take a better look at what's on the bottom of the ocean, but it's just started"". There is no plan to give the remnants back to China, officials said, adding that the retrieved debris would be analysed by intelligence experts. A number of specialist ships have been deployed to the area, including an oceanographic survey ship that uses sonar and other means to map out a debris field, Gen VanHerck, who commands both the US military's Northern Command and joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Command, or Norad, said. He added that while the balloon was several hundred feet tall, the payload - the portion which would have carried equipment - was about the same size as a regional airliner.  Gen VanHerck said the US was still working to determine whether the debris includes potentially dangerous materials, such as explosives or battery components.  Republican politicians have accused US President Joe Biden of a dereliction of duty for allowing the balloon to traverse the country unhindered. The decision to shoot it down also triggered a diplomatic spat between the US and China, and prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a scheduled trip to Beijing that had been aimed at easing tensions. On Monday, China accused the US of using ""indiscriminate force"" when it downed the balloon. It said it ""obviously overreacted and seriously violated the spirit of international law"". The US believes the balloon was being used to monitor sensitive military sites. Adm Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because ""it has propellers on it"". ""This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,"" he added. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson has confirmed that a second balloon - currently floating over Latin America - is also Chinese."
Yield Spread Analysis,UK forecast to have slowest growth in G7 next year,2024-09-14,2022-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61142906,"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said.  The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countries to try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased.""  The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war.  The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%.  The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises.  Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets.  UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added.  It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"".  ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years""."
Yield Spread Analysis,Scotland 2-0 Georgia: 90-minute rain delay can’t stop Scots inching closer to Euro 2024,2024-09-14,2023-06-19,Scott Mullen,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65886502,"Scott McTominay's second-half strike effectively ended the contest A 90-minute rain delay was not enough to knock swaggering Scotland off their stride towards Euro 2024 as Georgia were swept away at Hampden. The European Championship qualifier was halted by referee Istvan Vad immediately after Callum McGregor slammed the Scots into a sixth-minute lead in near farcical conditions in Glasgow. A lengthy break followed, in part due to the furious Georgians not emerging until 21:15 BST, before play resumed when the match was initially due to finish. Scotland continued in a similarly confident vein, though, with Scott McTominay's thumping finish just after the break sealing victory for the table-topping Scots. Napoli's Khvicha Kvaratskhelia ballooning an injury-time penalty over the bar just before 23:20 summed up the night for the frustrated visitors.  The win leaves Steve Clarke's side eight points clear of both Georgia and Norway as they reach the halfway point in the group, with four huge wins from four already in the bag.  McTominay: Unloved at Man Utd, adored by Scotland 'Hell of a lot closer' but Scotland boss still wary Are Scotland now on the brink of Euro 2024 place? Squeegees, angry Georgians & classy Scotland Watch Sportscene highlights from Hampden When McGregor's rifled shot flew through the air towards Giorgi Mamardashvili's sodden net, few could have predicted it would be more than three hours before the evening would eventually be brought to a triumphant close. A deluge pre-match saw pitch-side TV pundits reach for their brollies, while the opening exchanges were so treacherous underfoot that Clarke and Georgia counterpart Willy Sagnol could be seen signalling to the fourth official that the game should be halted. A heroic performance from ground staff, stewards, ball boys and Scottish Football Association officials did just enough to get the game back on eventually in what felt in spite of the stubborn Georgians. Scotland restarted brightly with both Lyndon Dykes and John McGinn going close with headers. The latter then struck a puddle instead of the ball with the goal right in front of him. McTominay brought an incredible fingertip stop from Mamardashvili, but within a minute of the restart, he was helpless as the Manchester United midfielder swept a low shot into the keeper's bottom-left corner. Scotland never looked like they weren't in control, although the Georgians, seeking a spot at their first Euros while sitting second in Group A, huffed and puffed during a late whimper. And they almost snuck a consolation when Aaron Hickey was ruled to have handballed in the box after a video assistant referee review, but Kvaratskhelia's spot-kick was sent shooting into the dark and damp Glasgow sky. Captain Splashtastic, Andy Robertson was as inspired in Glasgow as he was in Oslo. He was inspirational for Scotland on the most surreal of nights. This has been a huge campaign for Scotland, with the win on Saturday over Norway seismic in Clarke's hopes of back-to-back Euros. However, a true mark of how much they have grown was evident here. Remember, these two nations have history on a football field. On more than one occasion Georgia have been Scotland's bogey team, and how like them it would have been to pluck out a landmark result only to then blow it at home to supposed lesser opposition. Yes, there was a late scare, but Scotland's charge to Germany is building. It's hard to see right now who can slow it down, let alone stop it. Scotland have won 10 consecutive qualifiers for the first time, keeping eight clean sheets during this run, excluding play-off games This was Georgia's first competitive defeat since October 2021 against Greece, having gone unbeaten across their past 10 (W8 D2). Scotland have scored at least twice in four consecutive matches for the first time since June-September 1983. They have won six consecutive home matches with Steve Clarke at the helm for the first time, their most under a specific manager since a run of seven from August 1995 to April 1997 with Craig Brown. McGregor scored his third goal for Scotland in his 53rd appearance, with all three coming at Hampden in June (2021 v Croatia, 2022 v Ukraine, 2023 v Georgia). After scoring one goal in his first 19 home games for Scotland, McTominay has since scored five goals in his past three at Hampden."
Yield Spread Analysis,"Biodiversity: Almost half of animals in decline, research shows",2024-09-14,2023-05-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65681648,"Almost half of the earth's animal species are currently declining, according to research led by Queen's University Belfast (QUB). The study examined population densities of more than 70,000 animals and researchers say it is the most comprehensive record to date. It found 48% of species on earth are currently undergoing population declines, with less than 3% increasing. Researchers said it was a drastic alert on the global erosion of biodiversity. The research, which has been published in the Biological Reviews journal, was led by PhD student Catherine Finn and Dr Daniel Pincheira-Donoso from the School of Biological Sciences at QUB, and Dr Florencia Grattarola from the Czech University of Life Sciences, Prague. It warns that global erosion of biodiversity caused by human industrialisation is ""significantly more alarming"" than previously thought. The study describes the biodiversity crisis as one of ""the most pressing challenges to humanity for the coming decades"" that threatens the functioning of ecosystems life depends on, the spread of diseases and the stability of the global economy. It is normal for species to evolve and become extinct over time - 98% of all species that have ever lived are now extinct. However, the extinction of species is now happening between 100 and 1,000 times more quickly than scientists would expect., according to the Natural History Museum. As a result, many scientists warn humans could be causing the ""sixth mass extinction"" on earth. The extent of extinction crisis is traditionally measured by ""threat conservation categories"". The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has kept a ""red list"" of threatened species since 1964.  More than 150,000 species have been assessed, and, based on their method, 28% are considered to be threatened with extinction. The researchers from the Queens' study undertook a different method of analysis by examining population trends and found the magnitude of the extinction crisis is considerably more severe than shown by traditional measures. Using their method, researchers determined that 33% of species considered ""safe"" by the IUCN are in fact declining towards risk of extinction. Dr Pincheira-Donoso said the new method ""provides a clearer picture"" that traditional approaches cannot offer. ""Our work is a drastic alert about the current magnitude of this crisis that has already devastating impacts on the stability of nature as a whole, and on human health and wellbeing."" Biodiversity is the variety of all life on earth - animals, plants, fungi and micro-organisms like bacteria. Animals and plants provide humans with everything necessary for survival - including fresh water, food, and medicines. However, humans cannot get these benefits from individual species - a rich variety of animals and plants must work together. Plants are also very important for improving the physical environment: cleaning the air, limiting rising temperatures and providing protection against climate change. Mangrove swamps and coral reefs can act as a barrier to erosion from rising sea levels. Common trees found in cities such as the London plane or the tulip tree, are excellent at absorbing carbon dioxide and removing pollutants from the air."
Yield Spread Analysis,Fernandes hat-trick helps Man Utd thump Leeds,2024-09-14,2021-08-12,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58124893,"This video can not be played Match of the Day analysis: Manchester United's 'outstanding' performance against Leeds Bruno Fernandes scored an opening-day hat-trick as Manchester United swept Leeds aside with a devastating second-half display. The Portugal midfielder opened the scoring on the half-hour at a packed Old Trafford, but Luke Ayling's thunderous strike drew Leeds level early in the second half. Mason Greenwood restored the hosts' lead with a crisp finish less than two minutes later, before Fernandes' low shot was ruled to have crossed the line by referee Paul Tierney after a check of goalline technology. The 26-year-old quickly completed his hat-trick with a thumping finish from Victor Lindelof's pass, before Fred added United's fourth goal in 14 minutes from Paul Pogba's cross - the Frenchman's fourth assist of the afternoon. This video can not be played Man Utd 5-1 Leeds Utd: 'I couldn't have asked for more,' says Solskjaer It was Fernandes' first hat-trick since he moved to Old Trafford in January 2020 and only the second by a Red Devils player since Robin van Persie's title-winning effort against Aston Villa in 2013. But the game was also a personal triumph for Pogba. The France midfielder's future has been the subject of intense debate as he enters the final year of his contract. But his four assists included a sublime pass for Greenwood's goal, and he left the field to a standing ovation 15 minutes from time as £74m new-boy Jadon Sancho was introduced for his debut. A glimpse of peak Pogba - but can he keep it going? How all of Saturday's action unfolded This video can not be played Bruno Fernandes on scoring his first hat-trick for Manchester United in Leeds win Fernandes' last hat-trick was for Sporting Lisbon in an 8-1 hammering of Belenenses in front of just over 5,000 in May 2019. Although the Portuguese has assumed hero status since moving to England, this was only the fourth time he had played a Premier League game in front of capacity crowd at Old Trafford. After a disappointing Euro 2020, any concerns about his impact at domestic level have been completely dispelled. His opener was excellent as he ran on to Pogba's first-time pass, controlled a bouncing ball in the Leeds area, then put enough power into his shot to take it into the net despite Illan Meslier's half-save. Another Pogba pass offered Fernandes the opportunity to sit Meslier on his backside as he turned sharply before hitting a low shot goalwards that referee Tierney was correctly informed had crossed the line before Ayling cleared. Fernandes' third was route one. Lindelof's pass fell perfectly for the forward, who allowed the ball to bounce before crashing it into the net.  It meant he followed Anthony Martial as the only Manchester United player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Van Persie - and the first to do it in front of fans. The volume for an already noisy crowd was turned up another notch by Raphael Varane's introduction just before the teams emerged. Manchester United's new £34m defender will be tasked with bringing greater stability to a back four that, even here, looked shaky at times. Skipper Harry Maguire was almost embarrassed in a foot race with Patrick Bamford which he started with a clear advantage and poor marking should have been exploited by Rodrigo, who was off target with his header after being allowed to meet Raphinha's curling free-kick unopposed. This video can not be played Marcelo Bielsa says his side struggled with the 'succession' of goals Manchester United scored For a team whose league record at Old Trafford is poor - Leeds have not won here since 1981 - and who conceded six in the corresponding fixture last season, it did not bode well. Ayling did offer some hope when he was afforded far too much space to shoot - presumably on the basis he had never previously scored a Premier League goal - and promptly found the corner from 25 yards. But it was only the prelude to a Manchester United onslaught from which there was no chance of recovery. This was always likely to be a tinderbox fixture on the first weekend of full Premier League stadiums for 19 months. Trouble in the city centre, in which Greater Manchester Police said there were ""isolated incidents of disorder"", briefly gave way to unanimity at the stadium as supporters joined together to applaud figures from both clubs who have passed away during the coronavirus pandemic. But that did not last. Amid the mutual loathing was one chant about the Munich air disaster among the visiting support, which BBC Sport has been told was in response to a Turkish flag being dropped into the Leeds fans from a higher tier of the stand. For Leeds this is massively inflammatory as it references the two fans who were killed in Istanbul in 2000 before the Uefa Cup semi-final with Galatasaray. Later, substitute Jadon Sancho was told he ""let his country down"" as he began his first warm-up - a reference to his missed penalty for England in the Euro 2020 final against Italy. Given the chaos of United's end to last season, when a home game against Liverpool had to be abandoned after home fans broke into the stadium, club officials will probably be relieved there was no threat to this fixture, although there was an anti-Glazer chant to underline that the issues with the owners have not gone away.

Yield Spread Analysis,Facebook reverses ban on news in Australia,2024-09-14,2021-02-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56165015,"Facebook has announced it will restore news content to its users in Australia. The tech giant has blocked news to Australians on its platform since last Thursday amid a dispute over a proposed law which would force it and Google to pay news publishers for content. Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg had told him the ban would end ""in the coming days"", after the pair had talks. Mr Frydenberg said amendments would be made to the law. ""Facebook has re-friended Australia,"" he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday.  The government has been debating the law - seen as a possible test case for regulation globally - in the Senate, after it was passed in the lower house last week. Last Thursday, Australians woke up to find they could not access or share any news stories on their accounts.  Facebook argued it had been forced to block Australian news in response to the proposed legislation. The government's news code aims to set up a ""fairer"" negotiation process between the tech giants and news companies over the value of news content. But it has been strongly opposed by Facebook and Google - both argue the code misunderstands how the internet works. Facebook has also said it gets little commercial gain from news content. But the Australian government says the code is needed to ""level the playing field"" for news publishers, which have seen profits slump in the internet age.  By Tuesday evening it was reported that multiple companies, including the Guardian Australia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, had resumed talks with the social media giant.  Seven West Media, a large media company, then announced in a statement they had signed a letter of intent to provide its news content to the platform after reaching an agreement.  Facebook said on Tuesday that it had been reassured by recent discussions with the government. ""Going forward, the government has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won't automatically be subject to forced negotiation,"" said Campbell Brown, vice president of global news partnerships at Facebook. ""We have come to an agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to, including small and local publishers."" Facebook already has its own ""showcase"" product - Facebook News Tab - through which it pays media organisations a fee to display their stories on its platform. This feature however, is only available in the UK and US.  Google had also threatened to withdraw its primary search engine from Australia, but the company has recently agreed deals with local media companies. Facebook's move to ban Australian news was a big risk last week. It made global headlines - not least because it also initially restricted some government health-department and emergency services pages.  Some have been perplexed by the move. Why would Facebook openly court such negative headlines?  Critics called the move undemocratic - authoritarian even. There are claims that fake news on the platform increased since the ban - though that's difficult to prove.  But Facebook isn't the only voice to say these new laws are badly drafted.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, said he was concerned that forcing companies to pay for certain content could make the internet ""unworkable"".  The proposed law was also seen by some as heavily influenced by the lobbying operations of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp - which owns many of Australia's major newspapers. The law's intention was to protect struggling journalism, not to line the pockets of a media dynasty.  There does now appear to be movement on both sides. Crucially, Facebook objected to the idea of a ""forced negotiation' with news outlets, which it now believes is off the table.  However although both sides have moved, and both will claim victory, this whole episode has damaged Facebook.  Politicians from across the world offered support to the Australian government - there were even accusations of bullying by the social network.  And considering Facebook desperately doesn't want these laws replicated in other countries, antagonising Australia's allies may not have been the smartest of moves.  The government and Facebook have reached a compromise of sorts. Australian authorities will introduce four further amendments, including one that means the government may not apply the code to Facebook if it can demonstrate a ""significant contribution"" to local journalism.  They include a two-month mediation period before government-enforced arbitration kicks in - giving parties more time to reach a private deal.  Australia's largest locally-owned company Nine Entertainment said it was ""pleased"" the government had found a compromise and was looking forward to resuming talks about a commercial arrangement. "

A total of 35 runs came from Broad's set, beating the previous record of 28, which had occurred three times. In chaotic, comedic and downright daft scenes on the second morning of the fifth Test at Edgbaston, Bumrah swiped two sixes and four fours. Broad's plight was made worse by one of the sixes coming off a no-ball and another delivery going for five wides. It meant Bumrah, a tailender with a Test average of six, set a batting record against a bowler who had just claimed his 550th career wicket. Follow day two of fifth Test live with clips, text and analysis TMS podcast: Pant leads India recovery Watch: Broad takes 550th Test wicket Bumrah, standing in as India captain, also set a new record for the number of runs off the bat in a single Test over - 29. The previous record of 28 was jointly held by Australia's George Bailey and West Indies legend Brian Lara, meaning Bumrah has taken a batting record from one of the all-time greats of the game. Lara dished out his punishment to South Africa spinner Robin Peterson in 2003, while Bailey's assault was on Broad's long-time new-ball partner James Anderson in an Ashes Test in Perth in 2013.

Coincidentally, England's Joe Root, who was on the field at Edgbaston, had also previously bowled an over that went for 28, but only 24 of those runs were off the bat. It is also the second time in Broad's career he has set an unwanted record with the ball. In 2007 he became the first bowler to be hit for six sixes in a Twenty20 international when he was flayed by India's Yuvraj Singh. The mayhem caused by Bumrah compounded a poor morning for England, as India moved their overnight 338-7 to 416 all out. Though England were able to remove Ravindra Jadeja for 104 and Mohammed Shami for 16, their nonsensical short-ball tactics allowed Bumrah to punish Broad in one of the strangest overs ever seen in Test cricket. This video can not be played When Yuvraj smashed Broad for six sixes in a row Ball one - four runs - A top edge at a short ball teases Zak Crawley at fine leg, but bounces to the boundary. Ball two - five wides - Too short, over the head of everyone, including wicketkeeper Sam Billings. Ball three - no-ball, six runs - A top edge flies over the slips, thudding into the advertising boards. The no-ball means it is seven in total and Broad has conceded 16 from one legal delivery. Ball four - four runs - The wheels are off now. Broad serves up a full toss that Bumrah swats through mid-on for four. Ball five - four runs - It's all Bumrah. Even an inside edge goes for four. Start reaching for the record books. Ball six - four runs - Bumrah has swung himself off his feet for a boundary on the leg side. He's equalled the Test record of 28 from an over and there are still two balls to go. Ball seven - six runs - Incredible. Bumrah breaks the record with his second six, as yet another short ball is swung into the stands at fine leg. Ball eight - one run - The final insult. Broad finally bowls a yorker, Bumrah digs it out and wants a single. Broad is in a race with non-striker Mohammed Siraj. Both men dive, Broad destroys the stumps, but Siraj is home. The over has cost 35 runs.

It was an astonishing passage of play, largely because Stuart Broad is such an experienced bowler but England had men spread far and wide - even Ben Stokes was at long-on. It was breathtaking strokeplay with a bit of luck. ""The short-ball barrage became very predictable. Bumrah is just sat back knowing what was to come.""  Former England spinner Phil Tufnell : ""I don't understand it [the tactics]. England have done it before and it's the definition of madness.  ""I know we're in this new fantastic era where everything's great and everything's positive but that is just annoying because as much as they will want to go out there and bat positively now, with 400 on the board they will also have to dig in a bit.  ""I've never been a fan of the short-ball tactic to lower-order batters, especially to guys like Shami and Bumrah who can actually play that shot well when they know it's coming every ball. What happened to top of off stump with the new ball?"" Test Match Special commentator Daniel Norcross: ""I have just seen some of the most careless brainlessness I have ever seen on a cricket field.

Yield Spread Analysis,'Aggressive action' needed as Africa cases pass 1m,2024-09-14,2020-08-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53677481,"""Aggressive and bold"" action is needed as Africa's coronavirus cases pass the one-million mark, according to the African Union (AU) body dealing with the pandemic.  It says South Africa - where testing has been widespread - accounts for more than half of all cases. Tanzania's lack of data meanwhile is a ""concern"" for the AU. Experts say a lack of comprehensive testing across Africa means the true extent of the pandemic is not known. Tanzania, for example, has not published figures for weeks and in early July its health minister said the virus was ""heading towards an end"". ""We continue to reach out [to Tanzania] but we're not having the right responses,"" director of the AU's Centres for Disease and Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), Dr John Nkengasong, told the BBC. In the continent overall, more than 22,000 people have died with Covid-19 and almost 690,000 people have recovered, the figures show. Just over eight million tests have been carried out, but Dr Nkengasong said at least 13 million tests should have taken place. Africa's first coronavirus case was confirmed in Egypt in February - three weeks after Europe, and two months after the outbreak began in China in December. The two countries with the highest numbers of cases are South Africa and Egypt. They accounted for 75% of all the new cases reported by mid-July. South Africa has the highest recorded number of total cases and reported deaths, and make up more than half of all the cases in Africa. You may also want to watch: The Africa CDC is keeping a close eye on Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe, Dr Nkengasong told the BBC's Newsday programme. More than 65% of Africa's 55 countries have reported fewer than than 5,000 cases, Africa CDC says. African nations have been praised for locking down more swiftly than other parts of the world. The continent has fewer confirmed cases than Europe, which has 1.7 million, and the United States which has 4.8 million. But there are concerns about insufficient testing, and the Africa CDC admits this should be expanded along with tracing. Dr Nkengasong said another risk was ""community fatigue"" where people tire of prevention messages. ""We know that wearing masks constantly will help this situation,"" he added. A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and tested in South Africa, the UK and Brazil, appears to be safe and triggers an immune response. But it is still too soon to know if this is enough to offer protection and larger trials are under way. This is a significant milestone and an alarming one. But it is also a mystery.  More than 500,000 cases of Covid-19 have already been confirmed in South Africa alone. The country has good data and - compared with most of Africa - a huge testing operation under way. So, is it really possible that there are only another half a million cases across rest of the entire continent?  The short answer is no.  Experts here agree that, given the minimal amount of testing it is almost certain that Africa has already sailed far past the one million mark. But doctors also point out that hospitals in many countries are not yet overloaded with suspected Covid-19 cases.  There are many possible explanations: fear of going to clinics, early lockdowns in many countries and sparser populations.  And because there is still so much to learn about Covid-19, it is possible that some populations may enjoy some extra protection against the virus, perhaps because of immune systems already bolstered by previous battles against malaria, cholera and other diseases."
Yield Spread Analysis,Truss enters Tory race to replace Johnson,2024-09-14,2022-07-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62115709,"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has joined the race to replace Boris Johnson. Declaring her plans in the Daily Telegraph, Ms Truss pledged to start cutting taxes ""from day one"". Many of the 11 leadership hopefuls looking to become the Tory party leader have set out competing tax plans as a core element of their proposals.  Mr Johnson said he would not be endorsing anyone as his successor, as he preferred leaving the candidates to ""get on with it"". The 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs which organises Conservative leadership contests will meet on Monday to decide the timetable and rules of the race. The two-stage process will see Tory MPs whittle down the candidates to two, through voting rounds, before party members decide the winner to become new Conservative party leader and prime minister. Ms Truss indicated that she would echo her rivals in planning to slash corporation tax, reverse the National Insurance hike and reform business rates.  She wrote that it ""isn't right to be putting up taxes now"" and if elected she would take ""immediate action"" to assist with living costs.  The foreign secretary said she would ""fight the election as a Conservative and govern as a Conservative"".  The candidates for Tory leader, and prime minister, who have declared so far are:  Home Secretary Priti Patel is also believed to be weighing up whether to run. Speaking for the first time since he announced his resignation last week, Mr Johnson said: ""The job of the prime minister at this stage is to let the party decide [its new leader], let them get on with it and to continue delivering on the projects that we were elected to deliver."" ""Whatever happens and whoever takes over, there is a great, great agenda to be continued,"" he added. Taxation has emerged as a key policy area for many of the candidates, but questions have been raised about how cuts will be paid for, and whether spending plans will be slashed. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said he would be ""looking to lower taxes across every aspect of society"", adding that he had been ""one of a few Conservative MPs who didn't vote for the National Insurance rise"", which he called a ""tax on jobs"". He said the UK needed to be ""going for growth"" - which he insisted could only be achieved by taking ""the brakes off the economy"" and boosting the private sector.  Mr Tugendhat also pledged to ""deliver the benefits"" of Brexit, saying he would open up trade agreements and change ""the way we invest around the country"". Meanwhile, Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast he would ""get the British economy going"", having served ""at the coalface"" by setting up his own business. ""We need to have a lower-tax environment to help businesses get off the ground,"" he added, which would include cutting corporation tax. Mr Hunt said it was possible to do this ""within our fiscal rules if we spread them over a five-year period, which means that our national debt continues to fall as a proportion of our output"". ""And I think that's not just right; it's moral,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be cutting taxes if we're loading up debts on future generations."" Mr Chishti also declared his candidacy on Sunday, speaking about the importance of lower taxes, a small state and a big society.  The abundance of tax-cutting plans announced so far, contrasts with Mr Sunak, who has played down the prospect of tax cuts before public finances improve. The former chancellor released a video to launch his campaign, but is yet to set out his economic pitch.  He warned against ""comforting fairy tales"" that would ""leave our children worse off tomorrow"". This wide field of candidates could be narrowed down significantly within days.  Conservative backbenchers will meet on Monday to finalise the rules and timetable for the contest. They're likely to set a relatively high bar for the number of confirmed supporters needed to enter the first round of voting among MPs. The hopefuls will then have to scramble for backers before nominations close, likely on Tuesday evening. A final two are expected to be chosen by the start of Parliament's summer break on 21 July. Then it's over to the Conservative Party membership to pick the winner and our next prime minister. Writing in the Sun, former levelling up secretary Michael Gove, who was sacked by Boris Johnson, has endorsed Ms Badenoch's campaign.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng acknowledged public spending cuts would be required if tax cuts were implemented, but refused to say which services would be affected. ""I'm not going to specify cuts at the moment because we've got a leadership contest and I'm sure the leadership contenders will spell that out more clearly,"" he told the Today programme. Mr Zahawi, who became chancellor this week, joined the chorus of leadership hopefuls in calling for lower taxes in an fresh interview with the Telegraph, telling the paper ""nothing is off the table"". Mr Zahawi - who has faced claims that his tax affairs have been investigated - also said he would publish his tax returns should he become one of the final two candidates in the race. Experts have raised questions about the ability of a new prime minister to slash taxes without affecting public spending. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said predictions of a budget surplus of about £30bn by 2024 had been calculated at a time when inflation predictions were lower. Writing on Twitter, he added that using the headroom to fund tax cuts would ""almost certainly"" require public sector pay cuts or more borrowing.  ""Everyone would like lower taxes. But [we] need to be clear about consequences,"" he added. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has taken aim at the leadership hopefuls for signing up to ""unfunded spending commitments"", describing them as taking part in an ""arms race of fantasy economics"". He has also criticised them for now opposing tax rises introduced by Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak, after voting for them previously. Watch Boris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questions on iPlayer."
Yield Spread Analysis,US governor 'moved around' as FBI tracked militia,2024-09-14,2020-10-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54482846,"Michigan's governor was kept updated about a plot to abduct her and was moved around as the FBI tracked her would-be kidnappers, the US state's attorney general has revealed.  On Thursday the FBI said it had thwarted the plot by alleged militiamen who planned to hold a ""treason trial"" for Governor Gretchen Whitmer.  A total of 13 men have been charged. Strict measures against coronavirus in Michigan have made Governor Whitmer a target for Covid-19 sceptics. On Friday Attorney General Dana Nessel told CBS news: ""At times, she and her family had been moved around as a result of activities that law enforcement was aware of."" Ms Nessel said the Democratic governor had been kept updated about the investigation in recent months. The suspects came close enough to executing their plan that police had to move in ""before anybody lost their lives"", she added. According to a sworn FBI affidavit released on Thursday, an undercover source attended a June meeting in Ohio, where a group of Michigan-based militia members discussed overthrowing state governments ""that they believed were violating the US Constitution"". In one video, a suspect denounced the state's role in deciding when to reopen gyms during the coronavirus lockdown. The men met in a basement that was accessed by a trapdoor hidden under a rug, investigators said. Six men - five from Michigan and one from Delaware - are accused in federal court of plotting the kidnap.  These six were named as Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, Brandon Casert and Ty Garbin. Mr Garbin's residence, in a trailer park, was raided by authorities on Wednesday. The other seven face charges of terrorism and gang-related offences in state court in connection with the alleged abduction plot. They are Paul Bellar, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison. The group wished to gather about ""200 men"" to storm the capitol building and take hostages, including the governor. They hoped to enact their plan before the November presidential election. If that failed, they planned to attack the governor at her home, officials said. It's been reported that these men have links to a militia group called the Boogaloo Bois. This is a movement that has grown online.  It's actually quite hard to describe the motives of the group. It's not ""right-wing"" in a traditional sense. Members of the movement are vehemently against law enforcement - some have been arrested for killing police officers. Broadly speaking, they are extremist libertarians - think Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, but with guns.  The term ""Boogaloo"" is usually a reference to a civil war. They have an entrenched hatred of big government - confusingly they are also often pro-Trump, though not exclusively. Hence why their ire is often focused on state rather than federal government.  Social media took a long time to act on Boogaloo. Facebook removed a number of Boogaloo groups in June - including the group that these men were allegedly part of. I showed TikTok of a series of Boogaloo videos that were on its platform back in July. Even now it's very easy to find Boogaloo videos on social media - the hashtags they use often change so it's hard to keep up.  This story shows how important it is to monitor social media platforms for extremist content - before it leads to violence.  In a news conference on Thursday, the governor tied the plot against her to the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who she said had spent months ""stoking distrust, fomenting anger and giving comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division"". According to social media posts cited by US media, some of the suspects have previously expressed support for Mr Trump, though one of the militiamen had called the president ""a tyrant"", adding ""every single person that works for government is your enemy, dude"". In April, Mr Trump had backed anti-lockdown protesters, tweeting ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"". A month later, armed protesters opposed to the lockdown stormed the state capitol.  Michigan's attorney general confirmed on Thursday that two men photographed at that May protest are among the arrested plot suspects. On Thursday night, Mr Trump, a Republican, sought to take credit for federal investigators eliminating the alleged threat to the governor. ""Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist - while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities,"" he tweeted. Michigan could prove pivotal in the outcome of next month's US presidential election. Joe Biden, the Democratic White House challenger to Mr Trump, condemned militias as ""a genuine threat"" and said Mr Trump's ""liberate"" tweet encouraged militias. ""The words of a president matter,"" he said, adding: ""Why can't the president just say stop, stop, stop, stop?"" Numerous violent incidents have been linked to citizen militia groups across the US in recent years. Adherents, who are often white men, sometimes brandish weapons during protests. The Department of Homeland Security warned this week in an annual report that violent white supremacy was the ""most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland""."

It was not such a good weekend for Arsenal, who lost again - this time at Brighton - to further increase the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger. Liverpool brushed aside Newcastle and Tottenham eased to victory over Huddersfield. At the bottom, Swansea claimed a big win, beating West Ham 4-1, while West Brom limped to another damaging defeat - 1-0 at Watford. You've seen my picks this week. But who would you go for? Choose your XI from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends. Let's be honest, VAR (video assistant referees) has been a disaster. Quite what business the Football Association, which hosts the oldest club competition in the world, is doing experimenting with such a high-profile property beggars belief.  For over 100 years the referee's 'opinion' has been final. With the aid of technology the FA and now Fifa, from what I understand, are about to bow to science, and an element of public pressure, and spit on the game's roots and most sacrosanct tradition by introducing this technological evil.  I know I will be labelled a luddite but before you condemn me let's consider what is at stake here.  The game has, for generations, respected the view of the referee. The technocrats in the game told us that goal-line technology was essential and without it the game was being starved of natural justice. I could have lived without goal-line technology but I see the logic. However, what VAR is attempting to do is reduce the referee to a mere traffic warden.  Every conceivable angle is covered in a Premier League fixture and quite rightly so. The public pay though the nose to see live football and therefore should get value for money. But the game itself should be assessed on the values it has always set itself and that is the referee's 'view' must be the final arbiter and must be respected.  Referees have never had eyes at the back of their heads, and neither should they, but that is what VAR is proposing. What VAR is about to do is challenge every decision based on the letter of the law.  Well, if you did that you could arguably find an infringement in every challenge regardless of which team you supported. The match would eventually grind to a halt.  The game has always been about opinions and on the field of play there is only one opinion that counts and that is the referee. He can only give what he sees. VAR sees everything and will only serve to complicate matters. It will not make the game better.   It is the lack of respect for referees that is in danger of killing the game and allowed VAR to take centre stage. And I must say it is doing it very badly.

Yield Spread Analysis,Polluting gases fall rapidly as coronavirus spreads,2024-09-14,2020-03-19,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51944780,"Levels of air pollutants and warming gases over some cities and regions are showing significant drops as coronavirus impacts work and travel. Researchers in New York told the BBC their early results showed carbon monoxide mainly from cars had been reduced by nearly 50% compared with last year. Emissions of the planet-heating gas CO2 have also fallen sharply.  But there are warnings levels could rise rapidly after the pandemic.  With global economic activity ramping down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, it is hardly surprising that emissions of a variety of gases related to energy and transport would be reduced.  Scientists say that by May, when CO2 emissions are at their peak thanks to the decomposition of leaves, the levels recorded might be the lowest since the financial crisis over a decade ago.  While it is early days, data collected in New York this week suggests that instructions to curb unnecessary travel are having a significant impact.  Traffic levels in the city were estimated to be down 35% compared with a year ago. Emissions of carbon monoxide, mainly due to cars and trucks, have fallen by around 50% for a couple of days this week according to researchers at Columbia University. They have also found that there was a 5-10% drop in CO2 over New York and a solid drop in methane as well.  ""New York has had exceptionally high carbon monoxide numbers for the last year and a half,"" said Prof Róisín Commane, from Columbia University, who carried out the New York air monitoring work. ""And this is the cleanest I have ever seen it. It's is less than half of what we normally see in March."" Although there are a number of caveats to these findings, they echo the environmental impacts connected to the virus outbreaks in China and in Italy. An analysis carried out for the climate website Carbon Brief suggested there had been a 25% drop in energy use and emissions in China over a two week period. This is likely to lead to an overall fall of about 1% in China's carbon emissions this year, experts believe.  Both China and Northern Italy have also recorded significant falls in nitrogen dioxide, which is related to reduced car journeys and industrial activity. The gas is a serious air pollutant and also indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet. With aviation grinding to a halt and millions of people working from home, a range of emissions across many countries are likely following the same downward path.  While people working from home will likely increase the use of home heating and electricity, the curbing of commuting and the general slowdown in economies will likely have an impact on overall emissions.  ""I expect we will have the smallest increase in May to May peak CO2 that we've had in the northern hemisphere since 2009, or even before,"" said Prof Commane. This view is echoed by others in the field, who believe that the shutdown will impact CO2 levels for the whole of this year.  ""It will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, and how widespread the slowdown is in the economy particularly in the US. But most likely I think we will see something in the global emissions this year,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia. ""If it lasts another three of four months, certainly we could see some reduction.""  What's likely to make a major difference to the scale of carbon emissions and air pollution is how governments decide to re-stimulate their economies once the pandemic eases.  Back in the 2008-09, after the global financial crash, carbon emissions shot up by 5% as a result of stimulus spending that boosted fossil fuel use.  In the coming months, governments will have a chance to alter that outcome. They could insist, for instance, that any bailout of airlines would be tied to far more stringent reductions in aviation emissions. ""Governments now have to be really cautious on how they re-stimulate their economies, mindful of not locking in fossil fuels again,"" said Prof Le Quéré. ""They should focus those things that are ready to go that would lower emissions, like renovating buildings, putting in heat pumps and electric chargers. These are not complicated and can be done straight away, they are just waiting for financial incentives.""  However, some argue that if the pandemic goes on a long time, any stimulus would more likely focus on promoting any economic growth regardless of the impact on the environment.  ""I certainly think climate could go on the back burner, and in this case, I don't think there is much hope that stimulus goes to clean energy,"" said Prof Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate Research. ""Any stimulus will help those with job losses such as tourism and services. I think this is very different to the global financial crisis. The only silver linings could be to learning new practices to work remotely, and buying a few years of lower growth allowing solar and wind to catch up a bit, though, these may be rather small silver linings.""

The Spurs wing-backs linked up for the first goal of the game, with Ben Davies releasing Emerson Royal to shoot into the bottom corner.  West Ham had an immediate chance to equalise but Jarrod Bowen's powerful effort, after he outpaced Cristian Romero, was well saved by home goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Spurs substitute Son Heung-min scored four minutes after coming on when he raced onto Harry Kane's through ball and slotted a finish past Lukasz Fabianski. The Hammers would have moved above both Bournemouth and Everton with a draw, but instead remain 18th after a first defeat in five matches in all competitions. ""We've only got ourselves to blame for it, and overall the players did a lot of good things as well,"" Moyes told Match of the Day. ""We've been here before so I'm sure we can do it again, but I'm looking forward to the players who are joining me in the fight because that is going to be noticeable in the weeks to come. They're all for it."" Speaking to Sky Sports, he added: ""There are bits of it I want to build on and hope that we take it in.

Tottenham v West Ham as it happened, plus reaction and analysis Visit our Tottenham page Go to our West Ham content Harry Kane is only the third player to reach 200 Premier League goals In Tottenham's last home game, the 1-0 win over reigning champions Manchester City on 5 February, Kane scored his 267th Spurs goal to take him above Jimmy Greaves' total and become the club's all-time record goalscorer. Before this match there was a celebration of that achievement as Kane was handed a silver boot trophy, with members of the Greaves family making the presentation. Tottenham's fans also spelled out the word 'Harry' with an impressive Tifo before the game, with Kane's children, wearing Spurs shirts that said 'Daddy 267' on the back, joining the England captain on the pitch. However, he could not find his 268th Tottenham goal, shooting wastefully wide with only Fabianski to beat midway through the second half from his only notable chance. But Kane did manage to record an assist, with his pass through to Son shortly after the South Korean, dropped for Richarlison, had come on as a substitute. This video can not be played Tottenham 2-0 West Ham: Moyes says Hammers can get back to form Towards the end of the match, the home fans taunted the away supporters with chants of ""West Ham are going down"" and it was a disappointing performance from Moyes' side after they had gained decent draws against Newcastle and Chelsea in their previous two Premier League games. The visitors had wasted a good chance to take the lead inside the opening minute but England forward Bowen sent a 20-yard half-volley just wide. Bowen had a chance to make it 1-1 but was denied by Forster with what proved to be West Ham's only shot on target. Tottenham are still in this season's Champions League but lost 1-0 away to AC Milan in Tuesday's last-16 first-leg tie and this result puts them in one of the four automatic qualifying spots for next season's tournament. In the end, Spurs ran out deserved winners against West Ham as a controversial video assistant referee call did not come back to prove costly. The hosts thought they should have earlier been given a 12th-minute penalty when Thilo Kehrer, standing close behind Richarlison and falling over, put his hand down and handled the ball. But a decision was not given by on-field official Michael Oliver, with those in the VAR room not telling him to review the decision. Premier League official site"

Drey Wright gave the hosts a first-half lead with his second goal of the season, latching onto a poor parry from Liam Kelly. Blair Spittal equalised just before the interval as his diverted free-kick left Remi Matthews helpless. Saints go into the World Cup break fifth as Motherwell stay ninth. While Motherwell pressed in the second half, boss Steven Hammell will be content as it means his side avoid a ninth defeat in 11 games. Live Scottish football Get the best St Johnstone news Head to our dedicated Motherwell page St Johnstone have not won three consecutive Scottish Premiership home games since April 2019, but they started in the right manner to end that wait. Following victories against Rangers and Kilmarnock, respectively, Davidson's side swallowed the pressure from their visitors before pouncing on the break and tearing Motherwell apart in a melodic move. Adam Montgomery coolly collected Graham Carey's cross-field pass before feeding through Canadian World Cup hopeful David Wotherspoon. Crafting out the angle to get his shot away, Liam Kelly fended the effort directly into the path of Wright to send the Saints ahead. Motherwell's response was far from instant, retreating into their shell but shuddering away any hopes of a St Johnstone second.  Their resilience was rewarded eventually, through Spittal's free-kick. Taking a nick on the way through off the wall, Remi Matthews remained rooted and perplexed. A dishevelled second period transpired, with Motherwell in desperate desire to avoid going three games without picking up a single point.  Louis Moult snatched possession from Liam Gordon inside his own box and carved out a drive, before Kevin van Veen had a tame shot blocked. An encounter lacking in quality culminated with an Ali Crawford free-kick sailing high into the Perthshire night sky. Drey Wright's opener got the ball rolling and in a game of very little standouts, his contribution carries extra weight. Far from a classic in Perth, but Motherwell really will not care. The Steelmen just desperately needed something to build on during the winter break.  A frustration for Hammell will be come from having Moult and Van Veen on the park without much trouble being caused to the St Johnstone goal. The hosts failed to show any of the fervour displayed at home in recent outings but did still look the more likely to gain a winner.

Yield Spread Analysis,Did life hitch a ride to Earth?,2024-09-14,2023-10-07,Roberto Battiston,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231006-how-life-might-hitchhike-its-way-through-the-galaxy,"Long distance space travel is still beyond human reach. But other forms of life may already be hitching a ride from one planetary system to another. By the time we realised that there was an extrasolar intruder, 'Oumuamua, named after the Hawaiian word for ""scout"", had already passed its closest point to the Sun and was leaving, as fast and stealthily as it had arrived. We are talking about the first sighting, in 2017, of an asteroid-like object from another area of the galaxy, a messenger from distant worlds. What do we know about this dark, probably cigar-shaped shard, which visited our Solar System with a trajectory and velocity that allowed it to leave so quickly? Comment and analysis Roberto Battiston is a physicist at the University of Trento, Italy,  and author of several books, including ""First Dawn: From the Big Bang to Our Future in Space"", from which this article is adapted. Very little. We know that it was probably not made of nitrogen ice. It did not visibly ignite like a comet as it approached the Sun. We know that it does not emit electromagnetic radiation. The most powerful radio telescopes have found no trace of it. Its orbit is gravitational, determined by the attraction of the Sun; a small, non-inertial component could be explained by the effect of the pressure of the radiation in our star's vicinity. We know that its speed, before entering the Solar System, was compatible with the characteristic speeds of celestial bodies in the region of the Milky Way, of which our Solar System is part. This allows us to exclude the idea that it comes from one of the dozen stars closest to us, as its velocity would have been too high. We have, however, identified four more distant stars near which it could have passed in the past million years, with a velocity low enough that it could have originated in one of these star systems. So, we don't know exactly where it comes from, if it has already been in our Solar System, how many other systems it has visited, or its composition (some reports suggest it may be formed of hydrogen ice). According to one hypothesis, it could be a fragment of an exoplanet destroyed by tidal effects (the tug of gravity from other nearby objects). In this case it would be an object much rarer than main belt asteroids or objects from the Oort Cloud, which formed directly from the original nebula that collapsed to form the Sun and planets around 4.5 billion years ago. What is certain is that, on timescales of the order of millions or tens of millions of years, fragments like 'Oumuamua can bring different star systems into contact. One estimate even predicts that 10,000 extrasolar asteroids cross Neptune's orbit on a daily basis. It would be interesting to be able to explore one to see what it was made of. This type of object would seem to be the kind of vector suitable for transporting life, in hibernating form, from one part of the galaxy to another. While a space mission of this kind would be difficult because of the speed at which these fragments are moving, it wouldn't be impossible, considering that in the future our observational capacity will improve considerably, allowing us to identify these bodies sooner than we were able to identify 'Oumuamua. Another idea has to do with the possibility that some of these extrasolar objects have become trapped in our Solar System after having lost some of their energy in a close encounter with Jupiter. A few candidates have already been identified. This approach would make an exploratory mission much easier to accomplish. However, even the planets in our own Solar System are in communication and exchanging material at a fairly high rate. Not everyone knows that we have around a couple of hundred rock samples from Mars here on Earth, even though there has not yet been a mission that brought back material from that planet. The meteorite bombardment on Mars results in fragments that, given its thin atmosphere, can be projected into space. Some of them can reach the Earth, penetrate our atmosphere, and fall like normal meteorites. By comparing the isotopic composition of various meteorites with those measured on Mars during NASA's robotic missions to the planet, we are able to identify and distinguish Martian meteorites from all the others. Finally, we should remember that it takes the Solar System about 230 million years to revolve around the centre of the galaxy. Since it formed 4.5 billion years ago, it has made the full circuit about 20 times. This means that, in the timescale in which life emerged on Earth, the newborn Solar System had many opportunities to come into contact with fragments from distant star systems. In 2019 I participated in a Breakthrough Discuss conference in Berkeley on ""Migration of Life in the Universe"". I was puzzled by the conference theme: we know almost nothing about life in the Universe, I thought, so how we could talk about migration of life? But recalling the observation of 'Oumuamua, I did participate and I am glad I did. I was surprised by the scientific quality of the talks and by the extreme fascination of the topic. Life probably doesn't need massive, rocky starships to move from one planetary system to another. Considering the minuscule size of bacteria, the smallest living organisms we know, or even viruses, which can live and reproduce inside bacteria, we can also imagine other mechanisms suitable for this kind of transport. You might also like: Microscopic ice crystals and dust, for example, containing bacteria and spores capable of withstanding the conditions in space, can spread into space from areas of a planet's upper atmosphere. When the dimensions become microscopic, the relationship between gravitational force, which is dependent on mass, and the thrust due to stellar radiation, which is dependent on surface area, tips the balance in favour of the latter. It is as if a planet were leaving a trail of perfume behind it. Planetary dust containing hibernating life can be pushed by radiation until it reaches high velocities and potentially moves beyond a given star system, spreading to other systems or nebulae, where it can find suitable conditions to reproduce and evolve. We are used to thinking of space as vast and mostly empty, completely unsuitable for life. Perhaps we should change our minds. Space is less empty than we might think. In reality, the different parts of the galaxy communicate by exchanging material on timescales comparable to those of the appearance of life on our planet. But how possible is it for life to survive in space? Well, even here, nature surprises us. In fact, we know of various living species that can endure extremely hostile conditions such as those in space: a nearly perfect vacuum, extreme temperatures, and ionising radiation. Different kinds of lichens, bacteria, and spores are able to survive, losing all of their water and entering into a condition of total inactivity – which can last for long periods – from which they can emerge, once they find themselves in a humid atmosphere again. Tests of this kind have been done on the International Space Station and in various laboratories (although these tests are on the scale of months and years rather than hundreds, thousands or even millions of years). One truly extraordinary case is that of the tardigrades. These very common micro-animals are about a half a millimetre long and live in water. They have eight legs, a mouth and a digestive system, as well as a simple nerve and brain structure. They are also able to sexually reproduce. They exist in nature in thousands of different versions and have a metabolism with unique characteristics. In order to withstand prolonged drought conditions, their bodies can achieve complete dehydration, losing around 90% of their water and curling up into a tiny, barrel-shaped structure. In other words, it's as if they freeze-dry themselves. Once this process is complete, their metabolism becomes 100 times slower. The most amazing thing is that they can stay in this state for decades, only to wake up again within several hours once exposed to moisture. But there's more. When in a dehydrated state, they can withstand the vacuum of space as well as pressures higher than normal atmospheric pressures, temperatures near absolute zero or temperatures up to 150C (302F). Their radiation tolerance threshold is hundreds of times higher than what would be deadly for humans. The secret of their ability to harden is partly due to a sugar, trehalose, which is also widely used in the food industry. When dried, this sugar replaces the water molecules in the cells, leaving the animal in a kind of vitrified state.  In addition, the tardigrade's DNA is protected by a protein that reduces radiation damage. Is this information enough to make us assume that these micro-animals come from space? I would say no. Their unusual metabolism is more likely the result of evolutionary adaptation that happened on our planet. In fact, tardigrades are among the very few living beings that have emerged unscathed from all five mass extinction events that have occurred on Earth. That is why they are the best candidates for a long journey into space aboard a meteorite or a comet. Recently, tardigrades have achieved a bit of media notoriety resulting from the Beresheet1 mission, a private probe launched by Israel, that crashed on the Moon in early April of 2019. The probe was carrying a colony of these micro-animals, in their dehydrated state. Given their microscopic size, it is possible that they survived the crash and will remain inactive for a long time to come, ready to be reawakened from their hibernation. By replacing the Israeli probe with an asteroid or a comet, we have a textbook example of how life might have arrived on Earth. Or how life could have migrated from Earth to other planets in our galaxy. So, the problem of the origin of life remains open, even if, step by step, we are making progress toward a solution. In the last decade, increasingly powerful calculation instruments have allowed us to reproduce, starting from the first principles of quantum mechanics, the formation of increasingly large and complex molecular systems, now made up of thousands of atoms. The field of computational biology is growing at a formidable rate; it is now only a matter of computing power. At the same time we have dramatically developed our ability to decode and manipulate DNA, up to the creation of the first simplified genomic structures, derived from living organisms and able to reproduce. We are now talking about synthetic life, built around human-designed DNA, a field with huge development prospects. Therefore, it is likely that the creation of the complex molecular structures needed for life or the confirmation of the existence of islands of genomic stability in the evolution of viral and bacterial species are objectives that, in future, will be within our reach. At that point, we will have another tool for understanding how life on Earth developed. Who knows? Perhaps we will discover that aliens are particular biological life forms that have lived with us all along. * This article originally appeared in The MIT Press Reader, and is republished with permission.

Yield Spread Analysis,Labour leader urges 2-3 week Covid circuit breaker,2024-09-14,2020-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54528807,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a short lockdown or ""circuit-breaker"" in England of two to three weeks to bring the rising rate of coronavirus under control.  He said measures were not working and another course was needed to prevent a ""sleepwalk into... a bleak winter"". His comments come after documents revealed government scientific advisers called for such action three weeks ago.  Another 143 people have died in the UK after testing positive for the virus. MPs have approved the legislation to write a new three-tier system for coronavirus restrictions in England into law - with every area of the country classified as being on medium, high or very high alert.  Sir Keir said his lockdown proposal would ""not mean schools closing"" but it should ""run across half-term to minimise disruption"". However, he said it would mean that ""all pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed"" and compensated ""so that no business loses out because of the sacrifices we all need to make"". ""The government has not got a credible plan to slow infections. It has lost control of the virus and it's no longer following scientific advice,"" Sir Keir said. He suggested it would also provide a chance for the government to ""fix"" problems by handing over track and trace responsibilities to local authorities. Documents detailing advice from scientists on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) were released on Monday night. Their views and evidence feed into the government's decision making. Sir Keir said his proposals were ""in line with Sage's recommendation"" for a circuit breaker to lower the reproduction number, or R value, of the virus - but acknowledged they would require significant sacrifices. He said:  Meanwhile, Wales' first minister has said he had asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a special Cobra meeting ""specifically to discuss the circuit-breaker idea"" earlier in the week - and repeated that call in a letter on Wednesday. ""I think it's an idea that will need further examination and needs to be shared in perspective between the four UK nations,"" Mark Drakeford added. Mr Johnson has rejected Mr Drakeford's demand for a travel ban on people coming to Wales from England's virus hotspots. Ministers in Northern Ireland's devolved government have been warned that Covid-19 infection rates will keep rising if both schools and the hospitality sector remain open, the BBC has learned. The Scottish government is to implement its own three-tier framework of restrictions later in October. In the meantime, pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, were closed on Friday until 25 October as part of a package of short-term measures. The daily figure of 143 deaths follows 50 deaths announced on Monday and was the highest daily total since the 164 deaths recorded on 10 June.  The latest government figures also show another 17,234 people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, compared with 13,792 cases the day before. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director, said the rising number of deaths was ""hugely concerning"". ""We have seen cases increasing especially in older age groups which is leading to more hospital admissions. This is a stark reminder for us to follow the guidelines,"" she said. The Labour leader's call has added to the volume of demand for extra caution - marking the end of the phase of what he used to describe as constructive opposition.   Sir Keir Starmer has been inching away from the broad front bench consensus on how to handle coronavirus for weeks.  To the frustration of some on his own side, rather than scream down the government's plans he has developed an attack on the government's ability to handle the situation and to act quickly enough.  But his call for a circuit-breaker means he believes the government has simply got it wrong.     Polling suggests too that there is public desire for tougher action to prevent a terrible second wave. Some senior figures in government agree. Read more from Laura Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier defended the new measures, telling MPs that Covid-19 posed ""a formidable threat"" until a vaccine can be found.  But he said the government makes ""decisions that are guided by the science, taking into account all of the different considerations"". ""Protecting our economy and protecting our health are not alternatives"", he added, but said action was required to ""protect lives and livelihoods"". Sir Keir said Labour would not vote against the measures - even though they did not go far enough. ""We are not going to vote down a package of restrictions because restrictions are needed,"" he said. A senior government source branded Sir Keir a ""shameless opportunist"", saying he was ""playing political games in the middle of a global pandemic"". The Liverpool region will enter a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of the new three-tier system for coronavirus restrictions in England.  Most parts of England are on the lowest tier, but Essex has asked to be moved to ""high"" level restrictions.  Meanwhile, London could be put in a stricter lockdown within days, Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government examines a ""wide range of different data"" and takes advice from health experts before deciding which tier applies to an area. ""We look not only at infection rates but also the rate of positive tests, admissions to hospitals, and admissions to intensive care units,"" they said. A committee of senior government health officials have been considering putting Greater Manchester and Lancashire into the highest level of restrictions and will hold a further meeting on Wednesday. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, said the government ""risks confusing people"" in the region just days after it was put in the second highest tier, adding ""unfunded restrictions are unfair"". In other developments:  The 143 new deaths reported is clearly a concern.  It is the highest daily figure since early June and feels significant, even taking into account the impact of the delayed reporting at the weekend which often pushes up the figures on a Tuesday. But to understand what is happening you have to rewind a month or so and look at cases.  Cases were rising rapidly then - it is what promoted the government's senior advisers to warn there could be 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. That has not happened. Just over 17,000 were announced today.  The trajectory has not been as steep as it could have been. We have seen a similar pattern happen with hospital admissions. They are rising, but over the last week the rate of increase has slowed just a little. Deaths will, sadly, continue to go up in the coming days and weeks, but if the patterns seen with cases and hospital admissions are sustained those rises will slow too. It is very, very different from the rapid surge we saw in the spring.  But a gradual and slow continual rise could still have a devastating impact over the long autumn and winter period. That is why we are seeing politicians and scientists argue about what is the best way to contain the virus, while limiting the impact restrictions have on wider society and the economy."
Yield Spread Analysis,'Land of heat and glory' after Ashes victory,2024-09-14,2019-08-25,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-49469105,"England cricketer Ben Stokes is pictured across the front pages, arms spread wide with bat held aloft, as he celebrates having led England to an unlikely comeback victory over Australia in the third Ashes Test at Headingley. ""Big Ben strikes again,"" says the Daily Star, remembering what the Guardian calls a Stokes ""masterclass"" that helped win the World Cup for his nation. The Daily Mail says England's cricketers and the scorching weather have combined to leave the country ""glowing"".  Meanwhile, the Sun says Australia were ""shell-shocked"" by Stokes' heroics - and that the odds on him being knighted have been slashed, to five-to-one. ""For a game perpetually teetering on the edge of crisis,"" writes Alex Massie on the Spectator website, ""cricket's in pretty good shape when it comes at you like this."" Papers in Australia are full of grudging admiration. ""Stokes revives the ghost of Botham,"" is the headline for The Australian, which says the country's prime minister is expecting a ribbing from British counterpart Boris Johnson when the two meet at the G7 summit in Biarritz later. The Australian players were left in a ""world of pain"", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. But, the paper says, in time they will appreciate they were part of something truly astonishing. Meanwhile, the Times makes mention of Stokes' final batting partner Jack Leach, whom it describes as a ""bespectacled number eleven of limited batting ability - but of giant heart"".  Without him, the paper says, Stokes might not have walked into Ashes immortality.  Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Times highlights Mr Johnson's remark in Biarritz that Britain could ""easily"" cope with the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal.  The paper says talks with the European Council President Donald Tusk failed to yield a significant breakthrough, with EU officials warning afterwards it's ""squarely and firmly"" up to the UK to find a solution to the Irish border issue.  The website Politico says the prime minister made plenty of noise in southern France but his bark proved worse than his bite.  It says the question of whether or not Britain would pay the Brexit divorce bill in full didn't even come up in the discussions. Meanwhile, Donald Trump ""barely seemed to notice"" Mr Johnson's intervention on the US-China trade war, it says. There's plenty of analysis of the prime minister's first meeting with the US president, with the Guardian describing them ""joshing and joking"" before breakfast.  The Daily Mirror says they ""began a bromance"" but cautions that you can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep. For the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson showed he was ""no poodle"" - unlike Tony Blair - when he pressed the president for concessions in a post-Brexit trade deal. The Daily Express and the Daily Mirror lead on the prime minister's call for the BBC to ""cough up"", and fund free television licences for all over-75s. A Downing Street source tells the Express the PM feels ""very strongly about"" the matter and isn't about to let the BBC ""off the hook"".  The Mirror notes that Mr Johnson made his demand despite finding billions to plan for the ""chaos"" of a likely no-deal Brexit. There's been a sharp rise in the number of patients whose hospital appointments are repeatedly cancelled, according to the Daily Telegraph, which says it has left some people waiting years to see a doctor. Figures obtained by the paper - from about half the NHS trusts in England - show that between 2016 and 2019, the number of patients with five or more cancelled appointments tripled to more than 13,000. The Telegraph says in some cases notice was only given the night before, in letters dispatched by taxi. An NHS spokesman acknowledges to the paper that cancelled appointments are inconvenient but says the overall proportion remains low.  Finally, the US website Axios reports that President Trump has repeatedly suggested dropping nuclear bombs on hurricanes to prevent them reaching the United States. A source describes how in a White House meeting Mr Trump said ""I got it, I got it - why don't we nuke them?"" A different official defends the president, saying ""his objective is not bad"". Axios points out that the idea is not new; it was first floated by a government scientist in the Eisenhower era. But it says the US government has in the past pointed out that even if the path of a storm was altered, radioactive fallout would drift over land, causing environmental devastation."
Yield Spread Analysis,The Pochettino-Levy dynamic shaping Tottenham's 'crisis',2024-09-14,2019-10-16,Guillem Balague,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50054375,"Mauricio Pochettino has said he is not worried about the sack, despite his side's poor form Last year's Champions League campaign hid a lot of cracks in Tottenham's season; this year's has only served to expose them. Effectively what we are seeing is the irrefutable decay of a squad that should have been recycled, reinvigorated, revitalised, a squad that has been allowed to drift into the footballing crisis it now finds itself in. Why a crisis? Because this team, judging by results, is not moving forward - they are at best standing still and at worst going backwards. It is a situation that has occurred because different elements of the club have had different views on the strategy and pace needed to move forward. It has meant a lack of decisiveness in the transfer market and, by the time decisions on players have been made, it has often not been possible to implement the moves.  On the one hand you have Mauricio Pochettino, a coach who wants to make his team as good as it can be and to continue winning. On the other you have Daniel Levy, the chairman and a man who analyses the football world inhabited by the top clubs in a different way. In a nutshell, in Pochettino Spurs have a coach who will look at and evaluate players on the basis of what they can do for the team, while also having one eye on the business. Levy, however, is more likely to view them in terms of what they can do for the business, while having one eye on the football. In situations such as this, the final decisions will always lie with the chairman. This has led to scenarios where players have had their contracts renewed with a view to maximising their marketability - selling them on - rather than on the basis of what they might contribute to the team on the field. Or of players signed who were not necessarily what the team needed but were considered a good market bargain. But nothing is as black and white as it seems. The relationship between the two key men in the club has certainly not broken down.  ""People might say that the relationship with the chairman has got worse, but that is not the case,"" said Pochettino, speaking at a conference in Qatar. ""What is important is to maintain the relationship and respect each other. We both need to know how to work our philosophy to be close together. ""In difficult times the manager also has to be up for the fight. I've joked a bit about our big defeats, but we are hurt. It is the time to be genuinely together and to turn things around. Let's put that in our heads and recover."" That is the same message spread out within the club. It is important that everyone, from the chairman to the lowest-profile employee, backs the team. It is a team, after all, which can beat anyone when on form. There is no denying Tottenham's heroic Champions League campaign last season - ultimately losing in the final to Liverpool - hid their shortcomings.  The stats make for painful perusal. Spurs have lost 19 of their past 41 games in all competitions. Bayern Munich's brutal efficiency in beating them 7-2 on 1 October and Brighton's energy four days later in a 3-0 victory exposed once and for all the yawning cracks that Pochettino and his team have been trying to paper over for the past nine and a half months. The news conference that followed the Bayern defeat was a calculated reaction from the coach to a game which clearly highlighted that this is undoubtedly a crisis. What is needed now is a calm head and concentration on trying to make sure things do not get even worse. If that means using the veterans - the usual players, some of whom know that in normal circumstances they would not be at the club right now - so be it. What Pochettino does now and how he manages to create the minimum fallout from this situation will very probably define him as a manager. It will be the yardstick by which his achievements are measured when judgments are being made in 10 years' time. A footballing version of the old question: ""What did you do in the war, Daddy?"" Did he blame the club because of a lack of money and new players? Did he try to play it down by reminding everyone that he had said all along this was going to be a rollercoaster ride? If - or more likely, when - he leaves, he will want to do so comfortable in the knowledge he played the very best hand with the cards he was dealt. Any future top-flight employers would demand nothing less from him. Pochettino has never asked the club for players or for money. What he has done - and he has been saying this for the past two years - is make it clear he needs to start a new chapter. The club themselves feel the refresh has begun already. Pochettino's coaches identified problems a long time ago and they were not addressed with the pace that was demanded, but the club believe the next phase of the Spurs project is well under way. Some fringe players have been sold or will be sold in January and next summer. New players have arrived recently. It is hard to question Levy, who believes he has always done what is in the club's very best interests. You only need to walk into the gleaming new showpiece stadium to realise that in many ways he has more than fulfilled his brief to Tottenham's owners.  And whatever the verdict on his transfer dealings, there have been numerous occasions when departures have been agreed by the manager and the club, only for a deal to prove impossible. In fact, in almost all the cases where a move from the squad was agreed, no teams showed interest or eventually the player decided not to move to those clubs making offers.  Those situations create confusion. It has been reported that Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen searched for - or had the chance of - a departure. They remain at the club. Christian Eriksen has been offered a new contract but he needs a new challenge and prefers a move to La Liga, but neither Barcelona nor Real Madrid have shown enough interest to take him away.  Eriksen, 27, joined Spurs for £11.5m from Ajax in August 2013 at the age of 21 While off-field strategy has been a factor, there have also been on-field errors - by players and by the manager, as they would admit themselves. But the club also understand that injuries have not helped. Now everybody is back in training.  ""The team has lost confidence and we have to work to recover it,"" Pochettino admits. ""We talk to players, we tell them that we lost because of all of our mistakes, but we have to forget about them. Nobody can hide, we have to share responsibility."" Part of that responsibility is to work out why there has been such a downturn in results. There is a school of thought that this is a team which runs less than it used to and as a consequence exerts less pressure on the ball than previously. Maybe, but why? In his first years the system used most often was 3-4-3 or a 4-4-2 with offensive full-backs and mobile forwards, but it suddenly became clear to Pochettino and his team last season that their squad possessed an abundance of defensive players and so they began to play five at the back. That stops that pressure high up the pitch as the number of players up front is reduced. The players in the squad are also older and, frankly, many of them simply do not have the 'legs' they had three or four years ago. The youthfulness and vigour of the side when Pochettino first arrived, if not totally a thing of the past, has diminished. It is also worth noting that it is considered easier to play a high-pressure game on the smaller White Hart Lane surface they used to call home, compared to the longer and slightly wider pitches of Wembley and the new stadium. The easy thing for Pochettino to do would be to clear his desk and wave an emotional goodbye to north London. He considered that during the summer and, had he left, would have had nothing to apologise for. He has taken Spurs and its fans into a land they could only have dreamed of and has done it by building a team that has played some of the most exhilarating football seen anywhere in the world. But that is not where his mind is now.  In Qatar, Pochettino added: ""We have to recover the emotional level… It is very difficult to control emotions, to go from playing the Champions League final and a few months later be in the situation we are in. It is in our hands to fight it off, to change dynamics. This is how this sport works. It is not a drama. There are much worse dramas in life and we have to understand that."" A four-year contractual commitment on both sides will almost certainly prevent any clean break from taking place and Pochettino also feels a loyalty towards the club. When Real Madrid came calling for him last spring and approached Levy directly, the Argentine was the first to state he would not go against the wishes of his employers. The worst-case scenario is that things go from bad to worse, especially if Pochettino decides it's time to leave only to find he is faced with the task of dealing with an agreement that will probably stipulate where he can or cannot go in the immediate future.  Pochettino, who joined Spurs in May 2014, signed a new five-year contract in 2018 He is not in the position where he could - or would want to - ""do a Mourinho"", namely creating a situation so untenable at a club that showing you the door with a fat cheque and no handcuff clauses about your future suddenly becomes the only sensible option. And if Pochettino does go, which big name, knowing what they know, is going to be prepared to grasp this particular nettle? It will mean Spurs will have to go for a young, ambitious type of manager, someone with energy and enthusiasm, ready and willing to fight to change the situation. Is there anyone out there who would be up to the task? Put another way, where can Levy find another Pochettino? I am told that the constant stories being published that players are unhappy are not totally or all true, but discontent exists. The footballers are receiving more analysis than ever and experience different types of training, but the main problem, as is usual in these moments of difficulties, is that everyone is looking for a scapegoat. In truth, everyone and every level at the club must take some share of the responsibility. There is a natural frustration with what is happening, what has happened, and probably most of all with what should have happened. The club believe a positive turnaround in fortunes is inevitable and that Pochettino will soon start maximising his team's potential once again. It is, looking at the bigger picture, the logical approach.  Only time will tell if the club continue making changes at the right pace to stop the rot, if Pochettino has the ingredients to keep competing at the top and if he is able to revitalise and re-energise his squad to write the next chapter.

Yield Spread Analysis,London's NHS Nightingale 'treated 51 patients',2024-09-14,2020-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-52448982,"London's NHS Nightingale hospital treated 51 patients in its first three weeks, sources have told the BBC. The temporary field hospital was built in east London's ExCel centre to hold as many as 4,000 Covid-19 patients. The NHS would not confirm the figures, though the BBC believes 13 people have died at the hospital. An NHS Nightingale spokesperson said it would be a ""mark of success"" if the hospital ""continues not to operate at full capacity"". ""That will mean that the rest of the NHS has managed well and because the public have helped slow the spread of the virus, meaning fewer people needing care and ultimately few fewer people losing their lives,"" they added. The NHS confirmed that on 24 April there were 26 patients at NHS Nightingale, with plans to take about 250 more in the coming weeks.  The hospital was built in nine days and opened on 3 April to care for patients with the virus in intensive care who have been transferred from other London hospitals. Karl Mercer, BBC London Political Correspondent Critics may look at these figures and say the NHS Nightingale was a waste of time. We were told it would treat the expected surge of Covid-19 patients in the capital. It's probably truer to say it's a victim of the rest of the NHS in London, where local hospitals have stepped up and increased their intensive care capacity. At the weekend there were just over 2,500 Covid-19 patients in hospital in London, around a third in intensive care. The exhibition halls were fitted out with the framework for about 80 hospital wards and some 500 beds were equipped with oxygen and ventilators. Professor Stephen Powis, medical director of the NHS, has said the Nightingale hospitals would continue to treat coronavirus patients. ""Although the peak is reducing we still feel we need to have them there as the insurance policy for Covid patients, but as we go forward we will be keeping them under review,"" he said."
Yield Spread Analysis,Cosmic signal rattles Earth after 7 billion years,2024-09-14,2020-09-02,By Jonathan Amos,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53993937,"Imagine the energy of eight Suns released in an instant. This is the gravitational ""shockwave"" that spread out from the biggest merger yet observed between two black holes. The signal from this event travelled for some seven billion years to reach Earth but was still sufficiently strong to rattle laser detectors in the US and Italy in May last year. Researchers say the colliding black holes produced a single entity with a mass 142 times that of our Sun. This is noteworthy. Science has long traced the presence of black holes on the sky that are quite a bit smaller or even very much larger. But this new observation inaugurates a novel class of so-called intermediate-sized black holes in the range of 100-1,000 Sun (or solar) masses. The analysis is the latest to come out of the international LIGO-VIRGO collaboration, which operates three super-sensitive gravitational wave-detection systems in America and Europe. The collaboration's laser interferometer instruments ""listen"" for the vibrations in space-time that are generated by truly cataclysmic cosmic events - and on 21 May, 2019, they were all triggered by a sharp signal lasting just one-tenth of a second. Computer algorithms determined the source to be the end-stage moments of two in-spiralling black holes - one with a mass 66 times that of our Sun, and the other with 85 solar masses. The distance to the merger was calculated to be the equivalent of 150 billion trillion km. ""It's astounding, really,"" said Prof Nelson Christensen from the Côte d'Azur Observatory in France. ""This signal propagated for seven billion years. So this event happened 'just before halftime' for the Universe, and now it's mechanically moved our detectors here on Earth,"" he explained to BBC News. The involvement of an 85-solar-mass object in the collision has made collaboration scientists sit up because their understanding of how black holes form from the death of a star can't really account for something on this scale.  Stars, when they exhaust their nuclear fuel, will experience an explosive core collapse to produce a black hole - if they're sufficiently big. But the physics that's assumed to operate inside stars suggests the production of black holes in the particular mass range between 65 and 120 solar masses is impossible. Dying stars that might yield such entities actually tear themselves apart and leave nothing behind.  If the science is correct on this point then the most likely explanation for the existence of an 85-solar-mass object is that it was itself the result of an even earlier black hole union. And that, believes Prof Martin Hendry, from Glasgow University, UK, has implications for how the Universe evolved. ""We're talking here about a hierarchy of mergers, a possible pathway to make bigger and bigger black holes,"" he said. ""So, who knows? This 142-solar-mass black hole may have gone on to have merged with other very massive black holes - as part of a build-up process that goes all the way to those supermassive black holes we think are at the heart of galaxies."" The LIGO-VIRGO collaboration is reporting the 21 May, 2019, event (catalogued as GW190521) in two scholarly papers.  One is in the journal Physical Review Letters and describes the discovery. The second can be found in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, and discusses the signal's physical properties and scientific implications. GW190521 is one of over 50 gravitational wave triggers presently being investigated at the laser laboratories. The pace of research has increased rapidly since the collaboration made its first, Nobel-Prize-winning detection of gravitational waves in 2015. ""We are increasing the sensitivity of the detectors and, yes, we could end up making more than one detection a day. We will have a rain of black holes!

Yield Spread Analysis,Trump says coronavirus not Asian Americans' fault,2024-09-14,2020-03-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52013361,"US President Donald Trump - under fire for labelling Covid-19 the ""Chinese virus"" - has said Asian Americans should not be blamed for the outbreak. He said it is ""very important that we totally protect"" Asian Americans, whom he praised as ""amazing people"". Mr Trump spoke out amid rising reports of verbal and physical attacks on the community amid the pandemic. Coronavirus is still spreading in the US, which currently has more than 43,000 confirmed cases and 533 deaths. At a White House coronavirus task force news conference on Monday, Mr Trump said: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. ""They're amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. ""They're working closely with us to get rid of it - we will prevail together."" Asked by a reporter why he had spoken out, Mr Trump said: ""It seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don't like that at all. ""These are incredible people, they love our country and I'm not going to let it happen."" During press conferences last week, Mr Trump used the term ""China virus"" and ""Chinese virus"", rejecting suggestions from reporters that the term was racist. ""It comes from China,"" Mr Trump said then. ""It's not racist at all."" The World Health Organization has issued guidance against ""stigmatising certain communities"" when naming illnesses. US lawmaker Judy Chu - a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus - was not impressed by Mr Trump's remarks. She told NBC News his comments would not ""be necessary if he and his supporters had not already endangered so many by spreading this toxic xenophobia"".  Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News Chinese, Washington In describing Covid-19 as the ""Chinese virus"", Mr Trump has been accused of attempting to deflect scrutiny for his domestic handling of the crisis on to external factors. Despite mounting criticism from China and Asian Americans, the president and several high-ranking US officials have continued to use the term.  Other than potentially stigmatising Asian-Americans, Mr Trump's ""Chinese virus"" label could turn out to be a self-inflicted wound in the 2020 presidential election. Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the US. According to recent surveys, the community's voters have increasingly leaned Democratic in the past few years, and they are becoming influential in electoral battleground districts. Even as he lavished praise on Asian Americans on Monday, the president was accused of breaking fences, rather than mending them.  ""They [Asian Americans] are working closely with us to get rid of it [virus],"" he tweeted, leading some observers to take offence at the ""they/us"" dichotomy. On the day that Britain announced a national lockdown to combat the virus, Mr Trump announced: ""America will again and soon be open for business."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo appeared to suggest the president was putting the country's economic well-being ahead of its public health, tweeting: ""You cannot put a value on human life."" The US is currently in the middle of 15 days of social distancing. Despite the president's signal that he was inclined to ease restrictions, state by state the nation was tightening lockdown measures. On Monday, Washington, Ohio, Louisiana, Oregon, Michigan, Indiana and Massachusetts became the latest to issue ""stay at home"" orders for residents. Wisconsin, Delaware and New Mexico will follow suit on Tuesday, taking the total number of states withdrawing behind closed doors to well over a dozen. These orders will affect about one in three Americans - more than 100 million people. Maryland stopped short on Monday of a ""stay at home"" order, instead joining several other states that have closed all non-essential businesses. Neighbouring Virginia closed schools for the rest of the academic year.  The US now has the third highest number of cases in the world, behind Italy and China. Half of America's total caseload is in New York state, which has recorded more than 20,000 positive tests and 157 deaths. US National Guard troops are helping to distribute food and medical supplies across the country. The homeland military force's leader, General Joseph Lengyel, described the situation as like having ""54 different hurricanes hitting every state"". As state officials clamour for aid, Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Monday said the US military ""can't meet everybody's needs"". Mr Esper said the Pentagon was working to send field hospitals to support the hard-hit cities of New York and Seattle. On Monday, the top US public health official, Surgeon General Dr Jerome Adams, said: ""I want America to understand this week it's going to get bad.""  He noted on the NBC morning show Today that young people were ignoring guidance to practise social distancing. The University of Tampa in Florida said that at least five students who ignored social distancing advice to party on spring break had since tested positive for Covid-19.  A man from Phoenix, Arizona, is dead and his wife is in a critical condition after the couple ingested chloroquine phosphate - a substance used to clean fish tanks that is similar to a drug touted by President Trump as a possible treatment for coronavirus. Chloroquine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating malaria, but it is not authorised as a medication for Covid-19."
Yield Spread Analysis,The grim crisis in Europe's care homes,2024-09-14,2020-03-31,By Lucy Williamson,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52094491,"Deaths can be invisible, coffins are hard to hide. Outside the Rothschild care home in Paris, a delivery van pulls up to unload its pale wooden cargo, still wrapped in factory plastic. A delivery man tells one waiting journalist, it is ""non-stop"". The gates of the care home are firmly shut. Sixteen people have died here from suspected coronavirus, another 80 are infected. More than a third of care homes in the Paris region alone are thought to have been affected by coronavirus. But while hospital deaths are recorded in the daily toll of coronavirus, deaths in care homes are not. Alexandre Sanner works as a doctor for another care home, in Vosges, in the east of France, where at least 20 people have died. ""There was a cluster of about fifty people with fever, followed by severe pneumonia,"" he said.  ""At the height of the epidemic here, there must have been 25 or 30 patients on oxygen."" Few of the cases in France's retirement homes are ever tested for the virus, once an initial outbreak has been confirmed. But day after day, stories are emerging of double-digit death tolls inside these institutions, now virtually shuttered from the outside world. As Italy and Spain have so far seen Europe's biggest and deadliest outbreaks, so have the elderly in care homes borne the most painful brunt, enveloped by twin crises of mass infection and staffing shortages. In Italy, hundreds of deaths have been reported in residential homes in Bergamo in the north, while 83 elderly residents went without food at a home for two days in the south because staff had to go into quarantine. Alarm at runaway death rates in Spain's care homes was first raised at Madrid's Monte Hermoso centre, where at least 20 died from coronavirus. Military units were dispatched to care homes around the country, offering emergency assistance and disinfecting more than 1,300 centres. The arrival of authorities often comes too late. Twenty-three people were found dead in another Madrid residence, including two of the nuns who provided care.  In a home in Alcoi, near Alicante, 26 out of 130 residents died. More than 1,600 residents of care homes died in the first four weeks of March, with more than half believed to have fallen victim to Covid-19. Relatives express anger at the lack of information about the outbreaks, while workers explain that already insufficient staffing levels and a lack of protective clothing quickly lead to a state of collapse as carers come down with the virus and have to self-isolate. France is launching a new app to count coronavirus cases inside care homes, and include them in its national totals. France's most senior health official has said that numbers could spiral as a result. The speed of this epidemic has left the government racing to catch up.  At the beginning of March, President Emmanuel Macron visited a care home to talk about protection from the virus. He was filmed sitting at a table, surrounded by elderly residents: no face-masks; no social distancing. A few days later, all visits to France's retirement homes were banned. And last week, the government said all residents should be individually isolated in their rooms. But care workers say that they are now the biggest risk to residents.  We talked to one nurse, who wanted to be known just as ""Carol"".  She said that some homes had been keeping masks in reserve for a coronavirus outbreak, and not giving them to staff. And with many staff off sick or in isolation themselves, she says, the spread of this virus is very hard to control. ""As soon as the coronavirus enters a care home, it's all over,"" she told me.  ""There's nothing we can do. Since we don't have enough staff, it'll be dramatic. Once the virus enters the home, there'll be a huge number of deaths."" Space in hospital life-support units in the Paris region is now critically low and there are shortages of some drugs. The health minister has said France will begin mass testing of its population, and has ordered a billion face-masks to protect healthcare staff.  The prime minister Edouard Philippe has extended the national quarantine for another two weeks.  ""The fight has only just begun,"" he said, warning that the first half of April would be ""even more difficult"" than the previous 15 days. Every night, French residents stand at their open windows to applaud the country's medical staff.    Solidarity with doctors, nurses and care-home workers is one thing.  But polls suggest that trust in the government has plummeted, even before the wave of this epidemic has peaked."
Yield Spread Analysis,Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply - WHO,2024-09-14,2020-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54704677,"Europe's daily Covid deaths rose by nearly 40% compared with the previous week, the World Health Organization (WHO) has told the BBC. WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris said France, Spain, the UK, the Netherlands and Russia accounted for the majority of cases which increased by a third. ""The concern... is that intensive care units in hospitals are now beginning to fill with very ill people,"" she warned.  Russia reported a daily record of 320 deaths, pushing the tally to 26,589. There has been a sharp increase in Italy too, with 221 fatalities announced in the past 24 hours. The total number of fatalities in Austria went above 1,000 on Tuesday. Russia has the world's fourth highest number of Covid-19 cases after the US, India and Brazil. It recorded another 16,550 infections on Tuesday alone and authorities have now made the wearing of face masks compulsory in all crowded places.  While infections surged in Italy too, to almost 22,000 in the past 24 hours, officials said testing had also been ramped up. Protests took place in towns and cities across Italy on Monday evening against a new round of restrictions.  And in Belgium, doctors have been asked to keep working, even if they have the virus, because the health system is in danger of being overwhelmed. Speaking to the BBC's World at One programme on Tuesday, Dr Harris said: ""Across the European region we're seeing an intense and indeed alarming increase in cases and deaths. She said daily cases rose by a third compared with the previous week, while daily deaths increased by ""close to 40%"".  ""Despite better management of hospital capacity, hospitals in several countries are filling up fast,"" she warned. Dr Harris said the effectiveness of new restrictions imposed in a number European nations could only be analysed in two weeks' time because of ""the lag"". ""We will see the reduction in cases, but you don't see it overnight,"" the WHO spokeswoman said.  And asked whether the second wave would be worse than the first one, she replied: ""We're going to see a different sort of peak.  ""The good news is our hospitals are much better at understanding what's going on here, but the reverse of that is in gaining that experience they've been working incredibly hard for a very long time and they also know that what they are going to face is going to be grim. ""The other good thing in a sense is that the very large numbers we're seeing are in groups that ideally won't progress to the more severe illness - that's the younger groups. But that's not a guarantee.  ""Those two factors suggest that we may not see the terrible rise in deaths that we saw in April,"" Dr Harris said.  From Wednesday, face masks will be mandatory in all potentially crowded areas including public transport, taxis, car parks and lifts, public health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said. Regional authorities will have responsibility for implementing the new rules.  Russia brought in similar measures at the beginning of the initial outbreak in the spring but lifted them in July as the number of cases eased. In addition, Rospotrebnadzor head Anna Popova recommended an overnight curfew for bars, restaurants and other public venues. Other recommendations include increased efforts to disinfect public transport, taxis and public spaces. In total, Russia has recorded more than 1.5 million infections and 26,589 deaths, according to national figures. This summer, Russia declared ""victory"" over Covid-19 but it's now seeing a fresh surge in cases and a record number of deaths.  Even so, the country has been reluctant to reintroduce significant restrictions. President Putin recently assured businesses that there would be no, new national lockdown - to protect the economy as far as possible.  But the latest steps - enforcing face masks and recommending a curfew on nightlife - follow a flurry of reports from Russia's provinces about hospitals running out of beds, overflowing morgues and overworked doctors.  In Moscow, more than 1,000 Covid patients are admitted to hospital each day. But the facemask rules in the capital have already been tightened, and clubbers and bar-goers already have to register their phones. City officials say the rate of new infections has been slowing, so they won't force venues to implement the new curfew - or close ""any sectors of the economy"" - for now. In France, the government is discussing stricter measures - including extending curfews already in place in Paris and other cities. On Tuesday the country reported 33,417 new cases and 523 new deaths over the previous 24 hours - the highest daily death toll since April. In Italy, a protest against new restrictions in the northern city of Turin ended in police firing tear gas at demonstrators on Monday evening. Clashes were also reported in Milan. People have reacted angrily to the closures of restaurants, bars, gyms and cinemas from 18:00 since last Friday. Researchers at the UK's Imperial College London say immunity against coronavirus may only last a few months after infection. They say the number of people testing positive for antibodies fell by about a quarter between June and September, with the biggest drop in those over 65. Belgium has seen an 88% rise in hospital admissions, with officials warning that half of intensive care beds are already filled. Ten hospitals have asked medics who have tested positive - but shown no symptoms - to continue working.  Slovakia is to begin testing its entire population from this weekend to try to avoid harsher anti-coronavirus measures. Prime Minister Igor Matovic hopes to identify tens of thousands of infected people who, together with their families, would then spend the next 10 days in quarantine. ""We had only two options, either general testing or complete lockdown,"" he said. The Czech Republic has introduced a night-time curfew, which came into effect on Tuesday for a week. No-one is allowed to leave their home between 21:00 and 04:59 except to travel to and from work, for medical reasons or a few other exceptions."
Yield Spread Analysis,Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions,2024-09-14,2021-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58650634,"A surge in gas prices has hit consumers and energy firms in the UK, with knock-on effects for the food industry and supplies of carbon dioxide. Elsewhere in Europe, consumers are also facing a steep rise in energy bills, and governments are scrambling to help. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty for Europeans in funding the move to renewable energy. Here, five correspondents explain how different countries are responding. Consumers' bills have spiralled here in recent months, with the cost of electricity increasing 35% over the last year and nearly 8% in August alone. Energy prices in Spain are closely tied to the wholesale gas market, so the price per megawatt hour for consumers has repeatedly hit new highs recently.  ""I was paying about €40 (£34) per month and now I'm paying around €60,"" said Amparo Vega, who has a newspaper kiosk in central Madrid.     Earlier this month, the coalition government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez unveiled a series of measures aimed at bringing bills back down.  They include tax cuts and a temporary reduction in extraordinary profits made by energy companies. The latter move has drawn criticism from the industry, although the government has clarified that renewable energy providers will be exempt.   The government says its aim is to reduce electricity bills by over 20% by the end of the year. As winter approaches, consumers such as Ms Vega hope that happens. ""The outlook isn't very rosy,"" says Michele Fiorita, taking some air outside his shop in central Rome. ""My energy bills have gone up by about 15% but I've heard they'll rise by around 40% in the next few months."" Italy is particularly exposed to gas price hikes: 40% of its energy comes from natural gas and around half of that is imported from Russia.  So lower Russian gas exports to Europe and an increase in the price of raw materials have hit hard.  The Italian government has already spent some €1.2bn to cut the increase in energy prices for households and this week pledged another €3bn to help further in the coming months.  Prime Minister Mario Draghi says for the next three months ""system costs"" will be eliminated from gas and electricity bills. They're the tariffs added to bills to help fund the transition to renewable energy. It's a short-term sticking plaster to help reduce the jump in energy prices for struggling households but removes an important financial incentive to help the switch to renewables.  Fundamentally, Italy will need to diversify its energy sources, moving away from its dependence on gas and more towards green energy. ""That's surely the future,"" says Michele, ""it's the only way to reduce costs in the long-term."" As soaring energy costs present huge personal difficulties for families, they also pose some tricky politics for Brussels.  EU leaders have been busy pushing their sweeping climate plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 - a drive known as ""Fit for 55"". It's wide-ranging but includes proposals that, critics say, could lead to huge further price hikes.   Even backers of the measures quietly admit the transition to a greener economy inevitably, one way or another, hits people in the pocket. On the current crisis, the European Commission says that price rises are a combination of several factors, particularly the global surge in demand.  Increases in the price of CO2 permits under the EU's carbon pricing scheme are blamed for some of the rises, but the Commission says it's only a ""small percentage"". It wants to expand that scheme under ""Fit for 55"".  But with calls from the Spanish government for the energy crisis to be on the table at the next EU leaders' summit, Brussels is facing questions over what it can or will do to help.  Guidance is being worked on in terms of the mitigation measures member states can individually take within EU rules. But there's no sign of any significant, centralised intervention.  The more the crisis heats up, the greater the backlash may be over the EU's climate plans. However, those in favour would argue that the faster the move to a green economy, the faster member states can escape this kind of volatility.   Surging European gas prices have been felt by Polish consumers because the country's energy regulator has approved three price hikes this year, raising bills by more than 20%. But household gas bills are still regulated here, so customers are insulated from any sharp changes in market prices. Also, about half of Poland's gas demand is met by domestic production, which is typically cheaper than imported gas.  That cheaper, domestic gas is used to cover the needs of households first, while industry is mostly supplied with more expensive imports. But here again, energy-intensive Polish companies are shielded from sky-rocketing market prices because they have long-term supply contracts with a fixed price.  In Poland, coal is still the main fuel driving the economy, with gas a long way behind. That is starting to change.  The solar power market is one of the fastest growing in Europe and state-controlled power companies are planning huge investments in offshore wind.  Gas will become more important then, because the government sees natural gas as a bridging fuel to replace ageing coal plants and ensure the lights remain on when the wind drops under cloudy skies.  In Poland, the origin of the gas is a political issue. The government plans to cease its decades-old dependence on Russian gas next year and replace it with US and Norwegian gas, arguing it will no longer suffer Gazprom overcharging it for gas, because it can abuse its position as a monopoly supplier. POLAND'S COAL: The vast European mine infuriating the neighbours Non-EU Norway is one of the biggest producers of oil and natural gas in Europe, though very little of it is used for its own needs. Only 1.4% of electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels and waste, 5.8% by wind power and the remaining 92.9% is produced by hydroelectric power.  Norway's Equinor energy company has agreed to allow a 2bn-cubic-metre increase in gas exports for the next year to support increased European and UK demand. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor is two-thirds owned by the state.  While bills are not as high as elsewhere in Europe, Norwegians are not immune from increasing energy prices. ""We currently pay 750 NOK (£63) a month for energy and warm water, but in Oslo prices are relatively low,"" says Magnus, 26, who lives in a studio apartment in the capital with his girlfriend. The couple are moving to a bigger flat in Bergen on the west coast and expect their bills to go up: ""When you live somewhere where fewer people are, then electricity is more expensive. That's why I'm thinking of just getting solar panels."" From 1 October, Norway will be able to export electricity to the UK via a ""North Sea link"" of underwater high-voltage electric cables connecting the two power grids. There have been concerns the recent UK price surge could spread to Norwegian households and industries. But one proposal to impose a tax on outgoing energy has been rejected, as Norway also needs to import energy in certain periods of the year."
Yield Spread Analysis,Tricky decisions as councils face budget shortfalls,2024-09-14,2023-02-08,By Glenn Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-64573317,"Scotland's councils are facing a £700m funding gap as they prepare to set their budgets for the coming year.  Individual local authorities have shortfalls ranging from around £7m in the Scottish Borders to £120m at Glasgow City Council, according to research by the BBC.  Councils have been appealing to the Scottish government for more cash but ministers have said they have been given a fair settlement in challenging circumstances.  Without additional national funding, councils are considering major cuts to local jobs and services and increases in council tax to balance their books.  The BBC asked all 32 local authorities for more details of the options under consideration. All but Angus and Dumfries & Galloway replied.  Councils are large employers and cutting staff numbers - or ""headcount"" in the jargon - could significantly reduce costs.  Western Isles council - Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar - may not replace the only traffic warden on the islands who retired last year.  While that may not be the most unpopular job cut, according to a leaked document from the council body, Cosla, it could be one of more than 7,000 in the next three years.  That figure included the anticipated loss of around 1,750 teachers with proposals for extensive job cuts in Glasgow making headlines.  The Scottish government has now stepped in to stop cuts to teaching posts.  The SNP has a manifesto to increase teacher numbers and big cuts to the workforce could worsen relations with unions whose members are already striking over pay.  In a letter to council leaders, seen by the BBC, the education secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville has made clear she will claw back cash from local authorities that don't maintain teacher and pupil support staff numbers at current levels.  Cosla's leadership has said this ""means significant cuts will have to be made in other areas that support children, young people, families and our communities"".  Midlothian Council is considering the closure of St Matthew's RC primary school in Rosewell and potential cuts to music tuition.  Caroline Haddock, who has two children at the school, said she was ""absolutely devastated"" at the possibility it could shut, arguing that it does not make sense because new housing is to be developed in the village.  ""We've got capacity, we've got room - where are they going to put the children?"" she said. The council has stressed that no final decision has been taken.  In Clackmannanshire, councillors are considering reducing home to school transport and the amount of money spent on the delivery of less popular secondary school subjects.  In North Ayrshire, the Arran outdoor education centre could be shut to save cash.  Beyond education, leisure services face cuts in many areas with Inverclyde Council looking at the closure of Greenock sports centre and Port Glasgow swimming pool.  Local swimmer Gary Anderson said he would be ""very upset"" if the Port Glasgow facility shut and another pool user, Pamela Atkinson said it helped keep her fit and healthy.  Inverclyde Council is still considering a range of cost-saving options.  The library in West Calder is one of several that could be shut under savings plans being considered by West Lothian Council.  In West Dunbartonshire, the council is thinking about reducing the opening hours of its recycling centres.  Many charities are worried about the loss of grant funding from local authorities with concerns being raised from Argyll and Bute to North Lanarkshire and Edinburgh.  Introducing or increasing charges for some services can help boost council funds.  Aberdeen City Council is putting up most parking charges, while West Dunbartonshire thinks it could generate an extra £325,000 through parking enforcement.  In East Ayrshire, they are looking at a 4% increase in the rent charged for temporary accommodation.  Moray Council is proposing a 10% increase in the cost of burying the dead, with charges for the interment of local adults to rise from £949 to £1,044.  In East Renfrewshire, there is already a £40 charge, on top of council tax, for households that want garden waste removed. This could go up to £60.  Council tax only generates about 13% of local government funding. Most of their cash comes from the Scottish government.  That means small council tax increases don't generate huge amounts of extra money compared to what councils say they need.  Big increases are unlikely to be considered widely acceptable when many households are already struggling with cost of living pressures.  Aberdeenshire Council agreed to a 4% increase in council tax on Thursday, a decision which will see Band D bills go up by more than £50 a year.  Typically, councils seem to be looking at increases of 3-5%.  In future, councils may have broader tax powers at their disposal including a local visitor levy, which is sometimes dubbed the ""tourist tax"".  Selling off buildings and other things councils own and consider they no longer need is another way they can raise money.  East Renfrewshire Council has decided to sell its distinctive civic number plate HS 0 to the highest bidder, with experts estimating it could be worth £150-250,000.  Falkirk Council has agreed in principle to offload up to 133 properties that it describes as ageing and in need of repair.  It is willing to transfer these buildings to community organisations, rather than sell them, to save on maintenance costs.  Where asset transfers are not possible these buildings could be closed over the next few years.  The list includes Polmonthill ski centre, Stenhousemuir gym and Bo'ness recreation centre.  There's particular concern about the future of Grangemouth stadium which describes itself as ""one of the premier training facilities in Scotland"".  The athlete Eilish McColgan, who first ran for Scotland at the venue, has said: ""It must be saved because it is so important for track and field in Scotland.""  Falkirk Council have carried out a consultation on their proposals to inform their decision making.  There are some other options available to councils.  Some may choose to draw on their financial reserves - money typically kept aside for emergencies and other unforeseen challenges.  Others are planning to spread the cost of paying back PPP/PFI debts, for things like school buildings, over a longer period of time.  South Ayrshire started ""reprofiling"" its debts in December 2022, Fife is looking to do the same and East Dunbartonshire said it was continuing to ""explore financial flexibilities"".  Councils have faced a long term squeeze on their finances and argue that they are underfunded by the Scottish government.  Ministers accept that councils are under pressure but point out that they are receiving a cash uplift of more than half a billion pounds in 2023/24.  Cosla says most of that cash is ring-fenced for particular national priorities and gives councils little flexibility.  Independent analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that when new and expanding responsibilities are taken into account ""grant funding for Scottish councils is set to fall by 0.8% in real terms this April"".  ""Even if Scottish councils were to increase their council tax rates by 5% in April, their overall funding would still fall by about 0.3% in real terms,"" the institute said.  All Scotland's councils are obliged to set their budgets for 2023/24 in the coming weeks with many of them making their decisions on either 23 February or 1 March. "
Yield Spread Analysis,What is the true death toll of the coronavirus pandemic?,2024-09-14,2020-06-17,By Becky Dale & Nassos Stylianou,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-53073046,"At least another 130,000 people worldwide have died during the coronavirus pandemic on top of 440,000 officially recorded deaths from the virus, according to BBC research. A review of preliminary mortality data from 27 countries shows that in many places the number of overall deaths during the pandemic has been higher than normal, even when accounting for the virus. These so-called ""excess deaths"", the number of deaths above the average, suggest the human impact of the pandemic far exceeds the official figures reported by governments around the world. Some will be unrecorded Covid-19 victims, but others may be the result of the strain on healthcare systems and a variety of other factors. Explore the animated guide to excess deaths below and scroll further to see how the pandemic has affected countries such as Brazil, Italy, South Africa and the UK. Directly comparing the death toll between different countries is difficult. The accuracy of coronavirus data depends on how many people are tested for the virus and whether governments include deaths outside hospitals in their counts. As the virus has spread around the world, countries have reached different stages of their outbreaks at different times. In some places, the number of excess deaths may still increase in the coming weeks and months, especially as figures are revised, while in others the number of deaths is beginning to return to normal levels. Analysing deaths from all causes during the outbreak and comparing them with deaths in the same period from previous years can begin to provide a more accurate, if still provisional, assessment of the coronavirus pandemic's true death toll. Read through our analysis of excess deaths in 27 locations and personal stories highlighting some of the tragic consequences of the pandemic. There is no definitive league table of the hardest hit, but we can still make broad comparisons between the countries through the first wave. Peru, Chile and Brazil are still dealing with growing numbers of deaths so the picture there will change rapidly over the coming weeks.  The picture is more stable in countries where the total number of deaths has peaked and is now back to, or near to, normal.  Among these countries, there's a group like the UK, Spain, Italy and Belgium who have seen deaths rise by more than 30%.  That's very different to Japan or Germany, or many other countries whose weekly deaths have stayed within about 5% of normal.  If we looked at the data slightly differently - counting deaths per head of population, or using the same number of weeks for every country - we'd get slightly different results.  And the data itself is only provisional.  So we can't produce a precise ranking of countries, but we can identify the unhappy club of hard hit countries whose membership, unfortunately, is only going to grow. Read more from Robert about how countries compare To measure excess deaths, we have used mortality data showing deaths from all causes. These types of reports are often recorded and published by the central civil registry, health ministry or a country's statistical authority. They can take significant time to process and confirm, so all numbers of deaths recorded in recent months are preliminary and subject to revisions, and likely to include more deaths. The number of excess deaths represents the total number of deaths above the historical average. These figures have not been adjusted for age, so do not take into account demographic differences across country populations. The total number of excess deaths for each country have been rounded to the nearest hundred. We have focused on locations that have robust mortality data covering at least four weeks from the start of the coronavirus pandemic in that place. Where reliable data is not available at the national level, we have focused on a smaller region with complete data, such as Istanbul in Turkey. In Jakarta, Indonesia, records of burials within the city serve as a proxy for death counts. The start of each location's outbreak is counted from the week or month during which it recorded its fifth official death from Covid-19. The period extends to the latest date for which there is available data that is unlikely to change significantly. In most cases, we have calculated our baseline of expected deaths from an average of reported fatalities for the area over five years, from 2015 to 2019. Where possible, we defer to a number of expected deaths that has been modelled by the statistical authority in that country in order to account for population changes or known environmental factors. In the charts above the term ""none overall"" means either that all excess deaths in this particular location have been accounted for by the official coronavirus figures, or that there have been no excess deaths there. The figure for other excess deaths is calculated by taking the total number of excess deaths minus the sum of all Covid-19 deaths during the outbreak period in each place. Counts of official Covid-19 deaths are often sourced directly from the local government's own public reports. Where official data is not easily available, we have instead used data compiled and published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). For sub-national areas like Jakarta, we have used Covid-19 deaths specific to that area. For Istanbul, the available Covid-19 data is only released at the national level. This causes an underestimation of the actual number of excess deaths that are not attributed to the coronavirus in Istanbul because the number attributed to Covid-19 represents the total for the whole of Turkey. Comparing excess deaths to expected deaths during a country's outbreak is one of several ways to measure impact. It is a useful way of assessing the raw death toll in a place, expressed either as a number of people beyond the expected level or as a percentage above average. But the duration of the outbreak plays a role in these calculations. For places that have a quick rise in deaths followed by a quick fall, like Spain, there will be fewer expected deaths during their outbreak period compared to places with an outbreak that lasted much longer, like the UK. The lower number of expected deaths for Spain makes its excess appear much higher in percentage terms. Another measure is to look at the excess deaths per million of population. The benefit is that it puts countries of differing populations on a more level playing field. However, measuring by deaths per million will look worse for a country with an older or less healthy population, since it doesn't account for the fact that an ageing country would expect to see more deaths.

Yield Spread Analysis,Radar technology could improve gritting,2024-09-14,2019-01-26,By Ken Macdonald,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-47004588,"A spinout company from Heriot-Watt University is using smart sensing technology in a bid to help spread grit and salt on Scotland's roads more efficiently.  MicroSense Technologies has developed a sensing system - about the size of a mobile phone - to ensure an equal spread of grit across road surfaces. When fitted to a gritter it uses advanced data analysis and radar sensing to detect how much de-icer salt is already on the road. It can also spot the early signs of potholes before they develop into craters.  Last year 122,000 tonnes of salt and grit were spread on Scotland's main roads and motorways.   The UK-wide bill for gritting motorways and main roads is about £150m a year, and for potholes it is estimated at £120m. With forecasters predicting temperatures will drop next week, the gritters will be out but the team at MicroSense Technologies say some will be spreading salt where it is not needed.  They have been working on using radar on gritters, with a small microwave transmitter which can be pointed at the road and attached to a smaller black box. Lead researcher Jamie Blanche explained: ""What is being calculated by this box is a ratio between the output signal and the return signal.  ""The return signal, when it comes back, has a fingerprint - a signature - which we are then analysing to tell us the properties of that target.  ""So essentially it could just be a road with no salt on it, it could be a road with water on it, and obviously it could be a road with lots of salt on it."" The data about how much of the radio signal bounces back, and how wet the road is dictates what happens next, said Mr Blanche.  ""That would then be relayed in real-time to a laptop on the gritter, or within the platform that delivers the salt, and that would determine how much salt need to be spread,"" he said. Prof David Flynn, director of the Smart Systems Group at Heriot-Watt University said the radar technology allows the team to scan through things like steel-reinforced concrete ""basically making it appear invisible"". He added: ""This gave us a great opportunity to look at low-cost, safe and very insightful means of monitoring these critical systems."" The team are already exploring another use for radar-equipped gritters. By finding out how much water is just below the road surface, they will then, they say, be able to spot potholes before they appear.   The sensor can be fitted to a remotely controlled vehicle - or to an aerial drone.  Prof Flynn said it will be able to tell, not just how icy the road is, and whether it needs to be gritted, but what kind of grit and salt is already there. ""We've been training this sensor, in a sense giving it a library or you could consider it a memory, of what all these different signatures look like. ""We are training it so that when it's deployed in the field - so on highway maintenance vehicles, gritters, local council vehicles - it is able, not only to detect changes around it, but to do so very, very quickly."" The point of the system is to help save taxpayers' money and MicroSense are now working with the suppliers Peacock Salt. ""Our roads are critical infrastructure and keeping them free and running smoothly is of massive importance,"" said Mr Blanche. ""Often councils run out of salt simply because it is over-used. What we are intending to do here is minimise the amount of salt that is necessarily spread at any given point."" With so many potential applications, this is an idea that is likely to spread far beyond gritting.  "
Yield Spread Analysis,North Korea to focus on economy and food in 2022,2024-09-14,2022-01-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59845636,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has said the faltering economy will be the national priority this year as the country faces a ""great life-and-death struggle"".  He was speaking at the end of a key ruling party meeting, coming as Mr Kim marks 10 years in power.  A self-imposed coronavirus blockade has left North Korea struggling with food shortages.  There was no direct mention of the US or South Korea in his speech.  Mr Kim said increasing development and improving people's living standards was the main task.  He acknowledged the ""harsh situation"" in 2021 and set ""an important task for making radical progress in solving the food, clothing and housing problem for the people"", the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. He said battling the pandemic was one of the main goals for the coming year: ""Emergency epidemic prevention work should be made a top priority in the state work,"" he is quoted as saying by KCNA. But he also said Pyongyang would continue to strengthen its defence capabilities because of an increasingly unstable military environment on the Korean peninsula. He was speaking on Friday at the end of the 4th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), which began on Monday. There were reports earlier this year that people in the country were going hungry, giving rise to concerns as winter approached about a full-blown food crisis. The border has been closed since January 2020 to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from China. Following a year in which leader Kim Jong-un repeatedly stressed North Korea's dire economic condition and food shortages, these challenges were once again in the spotlight at the ruling Workers' Party's year-end plenum. Kim's warning of a ""great life-or-death struggle"" in 2022 echoes last April's rhetoric urging officials to prepare for another ""Arduous March"", referencing North Korea's greatest economic crisis and famine in the 1990s. While such comparisons overexaggerate the situation, North Korea's economic woes have indeed been exacerbated by Covid-19-related border closures, international sanctions and natural disasters. These have all contributed to what Kim described in June as a ""tense"" food situation, and international agencies also warn of growing food insecurity and starvation. Kim's emphasis on implementation of the national economic plan, rural development and advancing ""scientific farming"" now serves to remind citizens that their leader is prioritising their needs, while setting expectations for another year of economic struggles.        Mr Kim's new year speeches have previously included messages to South Korea and the US, but there were no explicit mentions this time. ""If we consider this report on the plenum as a replacement of Kim Jong-un's annual New Year's speech, it can be said that it's by far the shortest mention of inter-Korean relations and foreign policy ever,"" Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at Sejong Institute, told NK News. At the end of last year, North and South Korea, the US, and China agreed in principle to declare a formal end to the Korean War which ended in an armistice. But talks have yet to begin because of North Korea's demands, South Korea has said. You may also be interested in:"
Yield Spread Analysis,Are Amazon fires worse than last year?,2024-09-14,2020-08-28,By Jack Goodman and Christopher Giles,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53893161,"Preserving the Amazon rainforest is of global importance in the fight against climate change, but it is under threat from forest fires, mostly started to clear land for agriculture. Early numbers from this year's fire season show an increase, leading to concern from scientists. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil recently said that claims the Amazon ""is going up in flames"" were not true, despite statistics published by his own government showing the spread of fires. So what does the data show about what's happening this year? Brazil is a huge country with many different environments, including grassland, wetland and rainforest.  Some 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil, and it plays a vital role in absorbing harmful CO2 that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere. So there's particular concern about the damage that fires might do here. The total number of fires in Brazil's Amazon until July this year is high - but slightly lower than the same period last year.  But there is concern about a surge in blazes last month, earlier than would normally be expected. ""If we consider the average number of fires in July over the period from 2010-2019, then the number of fires in July 2020 represented an increase of 55.6% of the average,"" says Prof Marcia Castro, a Brazilian scientist based at Harvard University.  ""An increase also happened in June (19.6% compared to June last year, and 36.1% compared to the average for the month of June between 2010-19). The peak of the fire season is often seen in August to September. ""So the consistent increase in June and July is worrisome,"" says Prof Castro.  And alerts so far in August look set to rival the number recorded last year. Fires this year are at the second highest level since 2010. In the first seven months of 2020, more than 13,000sq km (5,019sq miles) of the Brazilian Amazon was burned, according to analysis of satellite data provided by Dr Michelle Kalamandeen, a tropical ecologist on the Amazon rainforest. That's more than eight times the size of London. Dr Kalamandeen says the torched forest often struggles to grow back. ""When a forest is lost, it is gone forever. Recovery may occur but never 100% recovery,"" she says. When you look at the spread of the fires in Brazil, during the week of 11 August, there were noticeable clusters of fires in the Amazon, with Para, Mato Grosso, Amazonia and Rondonia states reporting a high number of alerts. In areas around Novo Progresso in Para state, farmers reportedly held a ""day of fire"" last year and satellites have picked up more than 1,300 fire alerts in the past month, according to official statistics. To the north-east, the large municipality of Altamira has recorded the most fires in Brazil's Amazon region during this  period.  Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre says there are two main issues contributing to forest fires this year.  The first is that this year's dry season is much drier than usual.  ""The waters of the tropical north Atlantic are warmer this year and when that happens, we have less rainfall over the southern Amazon,"" says Professor Nobre.  The second is that there is a lot of felled forest left over from last year's logging - this is chopped wood that can fuel fires. A lot of it didn't get burned as there was a military campaign to stop illegal activity in the forest This year, the army has been conducting an operation to stop deforestation since June, and in July, President Bolsonaro imposed a four-month ban on forest fires. Vice-President Hamilton Mourao recently launched a campaign against the fires, including an app for the public to report them. ""We will be out in the field in August to try to stop these fires becoming worse than last year,"" he told the BBC. Activists and government critics remain sceptical, says Camilla Costa, a BBC World Service journalist.  According to the Brazilian defence ministry, 28,100 cubic metres of illegal wood has been confiscated with fines totalling 407.2 million Brazilian reais ($72.6m; £55m).   However, fires have continued in the region and critics complain about a lack of sufficient enforcement.  The number of forest fires in the Amazon regions of Colombia, Peru and Venezuela is up on this time last year.  For Amazonian countries, mining and agriculture is driving deforestation and as a result forest fires, according to Dr Kalamandeen.  In Venezuela, an increase in mining for gold is likely to be behind the increase, as since 2016 President Nicolas Maduro has opened up the sector to try and stem the country's economic collapse.  In Colombia, following the government's rapprochement with rebel group Farc in the past few years, areas have been opened up for farming, causing an increase in blazes, says Dr Kalamandeen.

Yield Spread Analysis,The hottest business stories of 2018,2024-09-14,2018-12-31,By Rebecca Marston,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46481167,"Kylie Jenner, Donald Trump, Elon Musk. Snow, heatwaves, hugging and the collapsing UK High Street. There were no dull moments in business over the past 12 months.   Here are the most-read business stories of 2018. A grim start to the year with news that one of the biggest providers of UK public services was foundering. It wasn't a household name. Carillion ran into trouble after losing money on big contracts and running up debts of around £1.5bn. If we had been in the dark about the company's importance before this, we were soon enlightened. Not content with hoovering up increasing amounts of our retail spend online, internet behemoth Amazon made one of its increasing ventures into the physical retail environment when it opened supermarket without checkouts. With three million hits Amazon proved it draws the clicks for readers as well as shoppers. Meanwhile, Christmas trading updates revealed the losers as Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser and Debenhams. Spoiler alert: they ended the year in that camp, too.  And after running unremarked for 30 years the Presidents Club charity fundraising dinner, suddenly went beyond the pale. Financial Times reporter Madison Marriage went undercover as a waitress at the event and said she was groped ""several times"", which led to the organiser of the dinner quitting his post on the Department for Education board. This was an early sign of one of the key themes of the year as the #MeToo movement really got going.  KFC caused ""chicken chaos"" for four million readers when it closed more than half of its 900 UK outlets after delivery problems meant the chain ran out of chicken. It had recently switched to using DHL for its deliveries. DHL blamed ""operational issues"" for the supply disruption. Rather a literal statement.  A real poser here: Should everybody get £10,000? This intriguing idea came courtesy of the Royal Society for the encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). Is it enough to live on? Will it encourage laziness? Where can I get £10,000 - all reasons to click on this tale. The power of the influencer. If there was anyone left who doubted the influence of the Kardashian family they were in doubt no longer. A tweet from Kylie Jenner hammered Snapchat's shares, wiping $1.3bn (£1bn) off developer Snap's stock market value when she said she no longer used its messaging app.  Time for a weather story. Enter the Beast from the East. Which prompted this thought: it's snowing - can I refuse to go to work? No. Well, sometimes. Oh, it DEPENDS! So many questions and not the answer you might have wanted. You did ask...  It took a few months before President Trump seriously caught the eye of our readers, but his move to put tariffs on $60bn in Chinese goods certainly did. And it continued to cause real setbacks to the Chinese and global economy as the war of the tariffs ramped up over the year.  Perhaps someone should have tried earlier to curb Lego's production.  Too many Lego bricks is a problem many parents will sympathise with, but the toy firm itself had to admit it had made too many. Or mined too many. You decide.  The biggest retail story of the month was the surprising news that two leading supermarkets, Sainsbury's and Asda, were in merger talks. One analyst called it a ""game changer in the UK grocery market of epic proportions"". It still needs regulatory approval. That's expected in late January.  Enter Brexit. Very late into the year. One suspects there were so many stories that eyeballs were spread thinly across them.  Passports concentrated the mind. British company De La Rue - which had lost the £490m contract to print the new British post-Brexit passports to French-Dutch Gemalto in March - had requested a ""standstill period"" to try to regain the contract. This was granted. It still didn't win it.  DIY disaster as Homebase sold for £1! We've all been here with a DIY project. Starts off promisingly then you realise there's a bit more work than was anticipated.  The optimists here were the Australian firm Wesfarmers. It paid £340m for the retailer two years ago, but losses and other costs ended up giving it a total bill of about £1bn. One analyst called the takeover an ""unbelievable disaster"". Retail's epic dreadful year saw bad news for some small towns, too. Marks & Spencer said it would close 100 stores by 2022, leaving some High Streets without a flagship store. This theme continued into the year when Debenhams said it would close about a third of its stores and House of Fraser about half of its outlets. And this story caused sinking feelings for parents everywhere. Wet wipes, used for cleaning sticky fingers and just about anything else, could themselves face wipeout as the government declared war on single-use plastic.  The wipes contain non-biodegradable plastic and are the overwhelmingly main component of sewer-blocking fatbergs. Lovely. Back to the weather. The summer brought some frightening news: the heatwave that had blazed for weeks prompted lettuce growers to warn of an imminent shortage. We became friends with the trade body the British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA) who warned the heat was causing ""havoc"" for growers. Broccoli and cauliflower were also having a hard time of it.  Our next story could hardly be further (in tone, in origin?) from the farmers' field. The cash payments system Visa went down in June and was the second best-read story of the month. President Trump's tariffs on European products also caught the eye of the reader. The US is playing a ""dangerous game"" by slapping tariffs on European steel and aluminium, said the EU's trade commissioner. The EU issued a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. And as the heatwave continued: peas were now under threat of shortage.  More startling facts: the UK, it turns out, is the biggest consumer of peas per head in Europe, and it is also the biggest producer of peas for freezing. But, things were looking up elsewhere: we learnt that by then life for the lettuce had begun to improve.  One of the other biggest hits with our readers was the news that Burberry had burned luxury goods worth millions. It appalled the growing taste for cutting down on waste, though Burberry did say that the energy generated from burning its products was captured, making it environmentally friendly.  Startling news from personal care giant, Johnson & Johnson, which was ordered to pay $4.7bn (£3.6bn) in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer.  The women's lawyers alleged the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks.  J&J said it was ""deeply disappointed"" and planned to appeal. Stories about the ""world's best places"" always score very highly in readership numbers. This year's offering from the Economist Intelligence Unit was no exception, attracting more than a million views. Vienna was named the winner - the first time a European city topped the rankings of the annual survey.  Meanwhile, retail entrepreneur and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley was big news. His Sports Direct business bought troubled House of Fraser. He said he would make it ""the Harrods of the High Street"", curiously symmetrical as Harrods was once itself the flagship of the House of Fraser chain.  And the heatwave was still going. This time it was potatoes that saw prices rising thanks to a shortage caused by an unusually cold winter, followed by that scorching summer. Another Trump trade development as China hit back at the US with fresh tariffs on $60bn of US goods in retaliation against US duties on $200bn of Chinese imports.  China this time targeted goods such as liquefied natural gas, produced in states loyal to the US president.  Elon Musk paid the price for an ill-considered tweet, losing his position as Tesla chair. A tweet stating he was considering taking the electric carmaker off the stock market and into private ownership and had funding secured at a price of $420 per share was the culprit.  Investor regulator the SEC said those claims were ""false and misleading"" and launched a fraud investigation. But Mr Musk stepping down as chair and paying a fine put things right as far as the SEC was concerned. The economic impact of Brexit also hit the headlines this month. It was the mention of property that stirred the senses as Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that house prices could plunge in the event of a no-deal Brexit. An alarming tale of a collapsed airline caught the attention of millions of readers. Even though Primera was hardly a household name. Not surprising as it has only 14 planes and is based in Denmark with most of its business serving Scandinavian passengers. But BBC website readers love a bit of aviation. And why not? Here's a definitive household name and a firecracker of a story. Sir Philip Green was named over harassment claims. This followed days of guesswork after the Daily Telegraph said ""a leading businessman"" was being accused of acting wrongly. Sir Philip denies the allegations.  Readership numbers for the annual set piece that is the Budget are always high. And so it was this year with the main headline being: Chancellor turns on the cash taps. Planes again. A Ryanair plane was seized by French authorities in a row over money. The dispute was caused by French subsidies paid to Ryanair for flights from Angoulême regional airport between 2008 and 2009, which the European Commission later deemed illegal. Meanwhile, in Japan the car industry was hit by a bombshell: the Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn was arrested over claims of financial misconduct. Mr Ghosn, a ""towering figure"" in car manufacturing, was at the helm of the three-headed Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi partnership.  Nissan and Mitsubishi both later sacked him as chairman. Mr Ghosn has denied the accusations against him. And... Brexit again. This time new government analysis suggested the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But, it said, a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit.  Mrs May's response? She said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. When the O2 network crashed the country was all but stopped in its tracks. Well, the 25 million O2 users were. People were unable to use mobile payments, SatNavs, call or email contacts, and countless other things that we were barely aware had made our mobiles the centre of our lives.  One of the best-read stories of December was about a seven-year-old making $22m on YouTube. Little Ryan's toy reviewing business (set up by his parents) has made him very rich.  Happy for you, Ryan. And back to the beginning. Employees complaining of unwanted physical contact. Staff at Ted Baker alleged there was a culture of ""forced hugging"" by the firm's founder and boss, which they are now demanding be ended. The fashion group said hugs were part of Ted Baker's culture, but were absolutely not insisted upon. An independent investigation is being carried out. Happy New Year."
Yield Spread Analysis,Criticism grows over Facebook's Australia news ban,2024-09-14,2021-02-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56116738,"Facebook is facing mounting criticism after it blocked news content in Australia amid a dispute with the government over a planned law. The law will force tech giants to pay for news content on their platforms. Facebook says the legislation ""fundamentally misunderstands"" its relationship with publishers. But politicians, publishers and rights groups in several countries have accused it of bullying, and raised concerns over access to information. Under Facebook's new rules, Australian users are blocked from viewing and sharing local and international news, while local publishers are restricted from sharing or posting any links on their pages.  Several government health and emergency pages were also blocked, but Facebook later said this was a mistake and many of these pages are now back online. In a statement posted on Facebook, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the social media company's actions to ""unfriend Australia"" were ""as arrogant as they were disappointing"". He added that he was in ""regular contact with the leaders of other nations"" over the issue and would not be ""intimidated"". Mr Morrison later raised the issue with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he sought to gain international support, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.  Other Australian officials have also criticised the move. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban on news information had a ""huge community impact"". About 17 million Australians visit the social media site every month. It is the most important social platform for news in the country.  Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan accused Facebook of ""behaving like a North Korean dictator"". Others suggested that a news vacuum could be filled by misinformation and conspiracy theories.  Human Rights Watch's Australia director said Facebook was censoring the flow of information, calling it a ""dangerous turn of events"". A local campaigner with rights group Amnesty International said it was ""extremely concerning that a private company is willing to control access to information that people rely on"". The move also faced criticism outside Australia. Julian Knight, the head of the British parliamentary committee overseeing the media industry, called Facebook's action ""bullying"". ""I think it's staggeringly irresponsible - at a time when we are facing a plethora of fake news and disinformation in relation to the Covid vaccine,"" he told the BBC.  ""This is not just about Australia. This is Facebook putting a marker down, saying to the world that 'if you do wish to limit our powers… we can remove what is for many people a utility'."" Global publishers also reacted, with the company behind the Guardian newspaper saying it was ""deeply concerned"". The head of Germany's BDZV news publishers' association said it was ""high time that governments all over the world limit the market power of the gatekeeper platforms"". Many Australian users are also angry about their sudden loss of access to trusted and authoritative sources. ""It feels obviously very restrictive in what Facebook is going to allow people to do in the future, not only in Australia but around the world,"" Peter Firth, in Sydney, told the BBC.  Facebook's ban on news sites on its Australian-facing site could well lead to greater prominence for unverified and untrusted information, helping disinformation to spread further.  First Draft, a site which investigates the spread of false and misleading posts online, warned the restrictions would ""open up a vacuum that could be filled in part by mis and disinformation"". Facebook says it will continue to remove harmful misinformation, connect users with reliable health advice and work with third-party fact checkers. One of the topics for which a great deal of unreliable information is shared online is that of Covid-19 vaccines. So we looked at search results for the word ""vaccine"" over the past 12 hours on Facebook pages primarily based in Australia and found prominent results for sites casting doubt on the coronavirus pandemic.  This search also brings up reliable information sources, and further analysis will be needed over the next few days to see whether this anecdotal evidence is backed up by longer term data. Australian authorities say they drew up the legislation to ""level the playing field"" on profits between the tech giants and struggling publishers. Of every A$100 (£56; $77) spent on digital advertising in Australian media these days, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. But Facebook's local managing director William Easton says the law seeks to ""penalise"" the company ""for content it didn't take or ask for"". ""The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content. It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,"" Mr Easton wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. Facebook said it helped Australian publishers earn about A$407m last year through referrals, while ""the platform gain from news is minimal"". Australia's conservative government is standing by the law - which passed the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. It has broad cross-party support and the Senate is likely to pass it next week. ""We will legislate this code. We want the digital giants paying traditional news media businesses for generating original journalistic content,"" said Mr Frydenberg. Search giant Google is also opposed to the Australian law, but it has now signed payment deals with major media outlets in the country. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Managerless Man Utd into last 16,2024-09-14,2021-11-22,Michael Emons,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59380052,"This video can not be played It's not about me, it's about the result for Man United - Carrick Manchester United interim boss Michael Carrick dedicated victory over Villarreal to former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as United booked their place in the Champions League last 16. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho gave Carrick a win in his first game in temporary charge two days after Solskjaer was sacked.

""We had a job to do and things needed to be taken care of. I was happy to do it and thankfully it all went to plan.

Ronaldo maintained his record of scoring in every game in this season's competition when he lifted the ball over goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in the 78th minute, after Fred had dispossessed Etienne Capoue. Sancho then sealed the victory in injury time, blasting a shot that went in off the underside of the crossbar. However, United were indebted to goalkeeper David de Gea as he produced two superb one-handed saves, one in each half, to keep out well-struck efforts from Manu Trigueros when it was goalless. United will progress as group winners with a game to spare after Atalanta could only draw 3-3 with Young Boys in the later game on Tuesday. Analysis and reaction of Villarreal v Man Utd, plus the rest of Tuesday's Champions League matches Go straight to all the best United content Pochettino 'so happy' at PSG and not distracted by Manchester United link Valverde contacted over interim manager role Sancho passes test on his 'big night' The result delighted United's travelling fans, with Carrick hugging his players at the final whistle as some of the gloom over the club lifted. A bad run of form has left them eighth in the Premier League, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea, with Solskjaer's three years in charge coming to an end after an embarrassing 4-1 defeat by Watford on Saturday. Carrick, Solskjaer's assistant, said on Monday he was not thinking about a chance to impress and earn the role on a full-time basis. Before the game in Spain, former team-mate Paul Scholes, now a BT Sport pundit, was scathing of Carrick and fellow coaches Kieran McKenna and Mike Phelan, saying: ""I would be embarrassed being on the staff now. ""They all should have gone - sacked or gone off their own back. They have let the club down as much as Ole has."" United have said they are looking to appoint an interim boss until the end of the 2021-22 campaign before potentially hiring a full-time manager after that. Earlier on Tuesday, former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said he was ""so happy"" at current club Paris St-Germain and that he would not be distracted by links to the United job. During the match, it was revealed former Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde had been contacted about the role of interim manager. However, despite the off-field distractions and criticism, United secured their first clean sheet in 15 matches - only their second of the season - and whoever takes over will have Champions League football to look forward to in February. Solskjaer scored the winning goal for United in the 1999 Champions League final and, despite losing his job, remains a club legend and was still sung about by their fans. Without him, Carrick made four changes from the 11 that began the loss to Watford, as Donny van de Beek was handed his first start in two months and Bruno Fernandes dropped to the bench. Villarreal, managed by ex-Arsenal boss Unai Emery, are 12th in La Liga, having only won three of 13 domestic league matches, but were the better side in the first half and start of the second. In a repeat of last season's Europa League final, which Villarreal won 11-10 on penalties in Solskjaer's solitary final as United boss, the hosts had good chances to take the lead. Yeremi Pino fired into the side netting, Trigueros twice forced excellent one-handed saves from De Gea and Arnaut Danjuma twice shot over the bar as United came under pressure. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored six of Manchester United's 10 Champions League goals this season But Ronaldo, whose 95th-minute goal gave United a 2-1 win against Villarreal in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford in September, again made the difference with his sixth goal of this season's competition. Rulli's clearance found Capoue, but the former Tottenham and Watford midfielder lost the ball to Fred, and it then fell to Ronaldo with the Portuguese forward quickly lifting it over Rulli for United's first. Fred was again involved in United's second goal as he began the move, also involving substitutes Marcus Rashford and Fernandes, with the ball ending up at Sancho's feet. The England international struck powerfully past Rulli for his first goal since his £73m summer move from Borussia Dortmund to clinch the victory and a last-16 place.

Yield Spread Analysis,Tonga volcano more powerful than Hiroshima - Nasa,2024-09-14,2022-01-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60106981,"A volcanic eruption in Tonga that triggered a tsunami was hundreds of times more powerful than the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima during World War Two, Nasa says. The eruption ""obliterated"" a volcanic island north of the Tongan capital Nuku'alofa, the agency said. Tonga says more than four-fifths of the population has been affected by the tsunami and falling ash.  Three people were confirmed killed in the tsunami last week. Before the eruption, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic island was two separate islands joined by new land formed in 2015. Nasa says the eruption was so powerful all the new land is gone, along with ""large chunks"" of the two older islands.  The widespread emission of volcanic ash, gases and particles from the eruption has proven to be a massive challenge for Tongan officials. In the immediate aftermath of the eruption and tsunami, there were fears that water sources had been polluted by the thick blanket of ash, increasing the risk of diseases like cholera and diarrhoea. However, officials noted that testing in recent days had cleared ground water and rainwater as safe to drink. But fine volcanic ash and emissions continue to pose a public health risk. Exposure could potentially cause breathing difficulties, affect the cardiovascular system, and irritate the lungs, eyes and skin. In an update, the government said 62 people on Mango, one of the worst-hit islands, had to be relocated to the outer island of Nomuka ""after losing their homes and all of their personal belongings"".  The government added however, that many of those residents could be moved again to the main island Tongatapu due to a lack of food and supplies. It added that there were under two dozen injuries, mostly from Nomuka .  Rescuers have set up a field hospital there after the existing clinic was swept away in the tsunami.  Ships and planes carrying foreign aid have been arriving in Tonga since last week, after locals were finally able to clear the island's only airport runway of ash. New Zealand and Australia have led the international response, using their air force and naval carriers to make contact-less drops of supplies including water, food, hygiene kits and tents, as well as water-treating and telecommunications repair equipment. The remote archipelago was cut off for five days because the explosions severed the sole fibre-optic sea cable bringing internet to the island. A patchy telephone line was restored last week, allowing ""limited international phone calls"". But even communication between Tongatapu, the main island, and the outer islands remains ""an acute challenge"", the Tongan government statement said. They added that a ship was due to arrive this week to repair the internet cable. Firms had previously estimated the cable could take up to four weeks to repair. The arrival of foreign aid has vastly accelerated the flow of information from the stricken island. Due to Covid fears, the aid work is still all being carried out by locals through groups like the Red Cross. Tonga, which is effectively Covid-free, has requested no foreign aid workers land in the country to prevent an outbreak. But the UN's representative in the region, Sione Hufanga, told the BBC that could change given the scale of damage. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Bergwijn double as Spurs snatch victory,2024-09-14,2021-12-15,Michael Emons,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59589154,"Tottenham were losing after 94 minutes, 52 seconds - the latest time a team has been behind before winning a Premier League match Steven Bergwijn scored two injury-time goals as Tottenham fought back from 2-1 down to snatch an incredible victory at Leicester in a thrilling finish at the King Power Stadium. Leicester were moments away from inflicting a first Premier League defeat on Spurs since Antonio Conte took charge, before Bergwijn grabbed a 95th-minute equaliser from Matt Doherty's pass. But there was more drama to come. The Dutchman, who had only been introduced as a 79th-minute substitute, then took the ball around goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel in the seventh minute of stoppage time and scored the winner with the ball going in off the post. It was a fitting finale to a brilliant match. The Foxes had taken the lead against the run of play in the 24th minute with Patson Daka's clinical finish over visiting goalkeeper Hugo Lloris with the hosts' first shot on target. But Harry Kane, who had earlier had a shot cleared off the line and also hit the crossbar, equalised just before half-time, collecting Harry Winks' ball forward, cutting inside Caglar Soyuncu and side-footing past Schmeichel. James Maddison then put Leicester ahead in the 76th minute after he had linked up well with substitute Harvey Barnes and the hosts thought they were collecting the three points before Bergwijn's dramatic double. Tottenham's win takes them above north London rivals Arsenal and up to fifth in the Premier League, while Leicester are 10th in the table.

The Foxes were without top scorer Jamie Vardy because of a thigh injury, while Nigeria's Kelechi Iheanacho is on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Daka was making only his third Premier League start and he took his opportunity in style, finishing well after a challenge from Tottenham's Sergio Reguilon saw the ball drop into his path. That goal came after Spurs had missed numerous chances, with two shots cleared off the line and a Kane header bouncing off the crossbar. Kane, who impressed throughout, then registered only his fifth Premier League goal of the season, although he has also netted eight times in cup games in 2021-22 as well as scoring 10 for his country. It also brought up a landmark for the England captain as the goal was his 250th in club matches. Harry Kane has scored 234 goals for Tottenham as well as nine for Millwall, five for Leyton Orient and two for Leicester during loan spells away from Spurs The performance of Maddison, capped once by the Three Lions in 2019 but pushing for a recall, would have also been pleasing for watching England boss Gareth Southgate. The Leicester midfielder produced two fine saves from Lloris, one in each half, before getting the goal his play deserved after he linked up with Barnes, who had only been on the field for a minute before getting the assist. In Maddison's last 11 appearances in all competitions, he has now been directly involved in 13 goals - eight goals and five assists. Spurs had not been beaten in the Premier League since they lost 1-0 at West Ham on 24 October when Nuno Espirito Santo was in charge. But Conte maintained his unbeaten league run in the most dramatic of fashions, with not one, but two goals deep into added time. The victory also set a new Premier League feat as Spurs were behind at 94 minutes, 52 seconds - the latest time a team has been behind before winning a Premier League match. The previous mark had been back in May 2012 when Manchester City were trailing 2-1 at home to QPR after 91 minutes, 14 seconds before goals from Edin Dzeko and, famously, Sergio Aguero clinched City's first Premier League title.

Yield Spread Analysis,Six steps to stop Ebola from spreading,2024-09-14,2019-07-27,By Alice Cuddy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49109478,"For health workers on the frontlines of the battle against Ebola, time means everything. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international health emergency in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after an outbreak of Ebola. The second-deadliest Ebola epidemic in history, it has killed more than 1,600 people so far and the numbers are rising. Haitian doctor Marie Roseline Darnycka Belizaire is helping lead the WHO's efforts to tackle the disease in the DRC, where additional challenges include armed conflict, tough terrain and widespread fear and suspicion. Here, Marie Roseline talks us though the process of trying to contain Ebola. One case of Ebola is an epidemic. When someone is suspected to have the virus, we must quickly get samples to check and confirm that.  The symptoms are very, very similar to lots of other diseases, like malaria for example. It can begin with abdominal aches, headaches, sore throats, fevers. After two days, there will be an exacerbation of these symptoms and others may be exposed. For example, you can have diarrhoea, you can also have a higher fever. After five to seven days, we can begin to see haemorrhagic symptoms. When we get into the last stages of symptoms, we have very pronounced asthenia, when the person becomes very weak. Ebola patients look like any person who is sick. When you are very accustomed to seeing people with Ebola, you can distinguish an Ebola sufferer with the most severe symptoms. It's like someone who is very ill with a lot of pain in his body. He's looking at you with some anxiety, some fear of dying. We have found people who have escaped and have gone to hide themselves to die. We have put in place what we call a surveillance system. Members of the community go between houses to detect if someone is sick. If this is the case, they will refer this person to a health centre where the health worker has to refer this person to the Ebola team if the symptoms are the same as those seen in Ebola. At that point, we will receive an alert.  To distinguish a case of Ebola we have to make a sample. When we suspect a case, only a laboratory can say it is or it is not. The person is then transferred to an Ebola treatment centre for the sample to be collected and analysed. Throughout this time, the patient will be receiving psychological support. This is important because it is a deadly disease that can kill several family members at the same time, people are often stigmatised when they have it, and some people think they have Ebola because they have done something wrong. If the sample is positive, we now know we have an Ebola case. At this point, we put all pillars of our response plan into action. Ebola is not killing you spontaneously, there is time to go for help. If you get to a treatment centre in the first two days of symptoms, you have a 95% chance of being healed. But if you go 10 days after symptoms begin, you have a 95% chance of dying. One of the main difficulties we're having is when a doctor within the local health structure suspects someone of having Ebola they are not calling quickly. The problem that we have is that 90-95% of the health structure is private. So when they refer the patient quickly, they say that they are not earning anything. Sometimes they keep the patient and then the patient infects other people in the health structure.  After the patient is informed of a positive result, the team will go to the family to tell them and offer psychological support. In the Ebola treatment centre, we make sure that every treatment is available to the patient. We make some laboratory analyses to see if the kidneys are OK, if the heart is OK. Once we check all the biological functions of the person, the committee dealing with the treatment meet and decide what the best option available is.  If the person comes early, if they come late, they are treated at the same level. All of the patients are receiving the treatment. All of those patients are receiving the vital support. All the patients are receiving psychological support, and all the patients have the right to have a family member there, although direct contact is not allowed.  We are some times also called after a community death. In this case we arrange a safe and dignified burial. Once the psychological support is in place and the family is accepting of the result and understands what it means, our surveillance team will go deeper into an investigation we launched when we validated the case as suspected. We do what we call ""mapping"". The mapping is to find where and with whom this person has been, not only in the period since symptoms began but also 21 days before this.  If someone has been in a church, we have to go to the church and try to find all the people that have been around this person. If this person went to prayer, then the pastor may have put his hand under the person. So then we have to find all the people that have been in the same room praying as this person. How many people are affected completely depends on the movements of this person.  Sometimes we find that families are the main contacts, but we find also friends who are visiting, and in the community we find neighbours who have been visiting after hearing that this person has been sick in their house. When the person has been in hospital, this means all the co-patients are also contacts, workers in this hospital who have been dealing with the person are also contacts and people who have been visiting patients in the same room as the confirmed case are also contacts. You can understand how difficult it is after listing all those contacts to identify them and find them. When we have identified each direct contact in the case one by one, we follow all of them for 21 days.  While we are monitoring them, we also offer them vaccinations.  We also offer vaccinations to contacts of contacts. Those are people who have been in contact with someone who has been in direct contact with the confirmed case. Contacts of contacts of contacts are offered vaccines too. We call these groups the first, second and third generation of contacts.  There is a median number of contacts we have established of between 50 and 150 people, which helps to guide us when we are looking for them.  We have had a case that generated 356 contacts because he was a singer. It all depends on the mapping of the person. The first, second and third generation of contacts are all offered the vaccine, but the vaccine is not mandatory.  Before offering them the vaccine, we explain why we are proposing it and why it would be good for them to take it. We also explain to them what will happen to them once they take it, because there are some symptoms they can have afterwards. After all this, they decide if they want it. When they decide not to take the vaccine, we try to convince them. But in the end, it is a personal decision. It is normally not so difficult to get people to take the vaccine but sometimes we have issues.  We have found people who don't want to take the vaccine because they don't want to put any external liquid in their body. We have those that have refused because they have a religion that doesn't want them to take vaccines. We have people who refuse just because they don't believe in Ebola. And we have people refuse because they think they are protected against all the bad things in the world. We have faced all of those things when people refuse them. The vaccine has been invaluable for those who want to take it.  We do not vaccinate everyone in the country because the vaccine is still under investigation, the number of vaccines that are available now is not enough, and by vaccinating the third ring of contacts, we create what we call community immunisation anyway. This means that the entire population is not in need of the vaccine.  We are working in very remote places, so sometimes we are carrying the vaccine on our heads. We had a team who had to walk more than five hours to a place because no cars, no motorcycles could get there so they had to go by foot. With very remote places in the forest, we can also have insecurity because there are armed groups operating there. Sometimes you think you might not survive. One of our colleagues has been killed and there are also people in the community who have been killed in their houses because they are working with us in the response.  We also support bordering countries with their preparedness and response plan.  When someone - a contact -  is displaced to another place, we rapidly contact the other country.  We have contacts who have travelled to Uganda but we have informed Uganda quickly and those contacts have been identified and come back to the DRC. So far, the recommendation of WHO is not to close the borders. We should reinforce checks on the borders, screenings at the point of entry - this is the recommendation. At the points of entry, if someone is sick and trying to get to another country, you can detect them there. To declare that an epidemic is over, we have to have 42 days without any cases. Forty-two days is double the incubation period. After the Ebola is declared finished, we begin with a surveillance phase. This is 90 days during which the team is still in the field. We train local people to try to make the system sustainable. We also actively search the community to find any cases that have been hiding somehow.  After an outbreak, we want to help local health systems to become more reliable.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus,2024-09-14,2020-03-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52060791,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the past 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but would continue to lead the government. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had also tested positive while England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms. Another 181 people died with the virus in the past day, figures showed. It takes the total number of UK deaths to 759, with 14,543 confirmed cases. The daily coronavirus news conference was led by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, alongside deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens.  They announced plans to begin a large-scale testing programme of health service staff, starting with critical care teams. It will later be expanded to cover social care staff too.   It follows mounting criticism from NHS staff over a lack of testing - currently, only seriously-ill patients in hospital are being tested. Testing will be carried out on staff showing possible symptoms of the virus or staff who live with people who have symptoms - not for all frontline workers as a matter of course. ""This will be antigen testing - testing whether people currently have the disease - so that our health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative,"" Mr Gove said. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the announcement was ""long overdue"" and the lack of testing so far had been ""incredibly frustrating"". ""For every healthy member of staff at home self-isolating needlessly when they do not have the virus, the NHS is short of someone who could be providing vital care to patients on the frontline,"" BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said.  Sir Simon Stevens also announced plans for two further field hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester, similar to that being readied at the ExCel centre in east London. He said that 33,000 beds - the equivalent of 50 hospitals - had been freed up across England ready for coronavirus patients. The government has imposed strict restrictions on everyday life designed to slow the spread of the virus. However, BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said the UK's daily death toll will still rise into the many hundreds in the coming weeks.  This does not mean social distancing measures are not working - but there will be a lag of two to four weeks before we see the effects, our correspondent says.  Mr Gove said scientific analysis suggested the rate of infection had been doubling every three to four days, but the ""fantastic"" public response to the restrictions would make a difference. Asked whether the prime minister and health secretary should have been ""better protected"", he said: ""The fact that the virus is no respecter of individuals, whoever they are, is one of the reasons why we do need to have strict social distancing measures so that we can reduce the rate of infection and reduce the pressure on the NHS,"" he added.  Mr Johnson is thought to be the first world leader to announce they have the virus. He was last seen on Thursday night, clapping outside No 10 as part of a nationwide gesture to thank NHS staff and carers. In a video on his Twitter account, Mr Johnson, 55, said: ""I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do. ""But, be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight-back against coronavirus."" The PM chaired a phone call on Friday morning, and later in the day, Downing Street said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump. ""The president wished the prime minister a speedy recovery from coronavirus,"" a spokesman said. ""They agreed to work together closely, along with the G7, the G20, and other international partners, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic.""   Mr Hancock said he was experiencing mild symptoms of the virus, and would be self-isolating until next Thursday. He told BBC Look East it was ""understandable that people will ask the question"" why he and the prime minister were tested, but most people with possible symptoms were not. The health secretary said there was a protocol laid down by the chief medical officer which required a small number of senior figures, key to the national effort, to be tested. Earlier this week the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. The prime minister's fiancée, Carrie Symonds, who is several months pregnant, is also self-isolating, although it is not known if they are still living together. Pregnant women in their third trimester are advised to be particularly stringent when following social distancing advice, and minimise social contact for up to 12 weeks. Maybe it was inevitable. One of the first moments that raised eyebrows in the course of the UK outbreak was when health minister Nadine Dorries came down with coronavirus. Then, last week, we discovered that some key staff in No 10, including the prime minister's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost, were self-isolating with suspected symptoms. A fair number of MPs took themselves off into isolation for fear of having contracted the infection. Their remaining colleagues were continually ordered to sit far apart on the green benches, before finally, this week, Parliament itself closed early, with no certain date for a return of normal business. Still, the news this morning that the prime minister himself has contracted coronavirus felt like a shock. Read more from Laura Neither the PM's senior adviser Dominic Cummings nor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has symptoms. They have not been tested.  A Buckingham Palace spokesman confirmed the Queen, 93, saw Mr Johnson more than two weeks ago on 11 March, and she is in good health. The pair usually meet weekly for the prime minister's audience with the Queen, but the most recent meetings have been over the phone. In other developments:  Other world leaders including Canada's Justin Trudeau and Germany's Angela Merkel have self-isolated after coming into contact with people who have tested positive for the virus. Politicians including Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott shared messages to the PM, wishing him a ""speedy recovery"". Meanwhile, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, told Mr Johnson: ""Europe wishes you a speedy recovery.""  In the Irish Republic, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has announced tough new restrictions on movement. From midnight on Friday, for a two-week period until Easter Sunday, everyone must stay at home unless their work is essential or they are buying food. Twenty two people with coronavirus have died in the Irish Republic. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Top EU scientist forced out in Covid-19 row,2024-09-14,2020-04-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52212390,"The president of the European Union's ERC scientific research council has resigned after three months in the job with an attack on the EU's scientific governance and political operations. Mauro Ferrari said he had lost faith in the system after he failed to set up a special programme to fight coronavirus. But the research council said later his resignation followed a written, unanimous vote of no confidence. It said it regretted Prof Ferrari's comments. ""Since his appointment, Professor Ferrari displayed a lack of engagement with the ERC, failing to participate in many important meetings, spending extensive time in the USA and failing to defend the ERC's programme and mission when representing the ERC,"" it said in a statement. The EU's executive insisted it had the most comprehensive measures to combat the virus. One MEP had earlier been quoted accusing Prof Ferrari of taking a ""window-dressing public relations stand"". Mauro Ferrari is an Italian-American scientist known as a pioneer in the field of nanomedicine with decades of work in the US. When he took up the role as head of the European Research Council he stressed his commitment to serving society. In a statement to the Financial Times and Corriere della Sera in Italy, he spoke of his commitment to the ""idealistic dream of a United Europe... crushed by a very different reality"". As the tragedy of the pandemic became clear Prof Ferrari says he pushed for a special programme directed at combating Covid-19, with the world's best scientists having the resources to fight it with new drugs, vaccines, diagnostic tools and behavioural approaches based on sciences ""to replace the oft-improvised intuitions of political leaders"". His proposals were rejected unanimously, he said, by the council's governing body because the ERC funded ""bottom-up"" research proposed by scientists themselves and did not see the beneficial impact on society as a justification for funding. Prof Ferrari describes how he then worked directly with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and developed a plan which she contributed to.  However, he complains his direct involvement with Mrs von der Leyen ""created an internal political thunderstorm"" and once it went to the different parts of the Commission he believes it ""disintegrated upon impact"". There are many questions surrounding the real reasons behind the resignation of Mauro Ferrari.  Yes, his stinging accusations about EU institutions weighed down by bureaucracy and internal politics ring true, but he will have known that before he agreed to become the bloc's chief scientist.  He will have also known that EU countries have always fought to keep sovereignty over national health services, so it is odd that he singled the lack of public health co-ordination across the EU as another reason for his departure.  In fact, high-level insiders in the European Research agency tell me Mr Ferrari's resignation was not voluntary. He was asked to leave, they say.  They say he was absent for half of the three months he was supposedly at the helm of the ERC, spending time instead in the US, where he has an affiliate professorship at the University of Washington as well as private interests in the pharmaceutical industry. He is listed on the board of directors at US biotech company Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals.  Mauro Ferrari announced he was now returning to the US to fight Covid-19 on the front line.  The ERC is eager to point out that many of its top scientists have already done that.  It says virologists, epidemiologists and others who were doing basic research for them have now joined Covid research teams in other European Commission programmes.  Professor Ferrari's personal ambitions clashed with the cumbersome structures of the EU, perhaps. A crying shame on all sides when all hands are needed on deck in Europe, the US and globally to help protect the general public from coronavirus.     The research council detailed several of those points in its statement, saying: Speaking to the BBC's Newshour programme on Wednesday, Prof Ferrari said his departure was caused by a ""very significant divergence of opinion"" about the strategy needed for the current crisis. He also denied his other work commitments hindered his ability to fulfil the role.  The EU has often struggled to reach a consensus on tackling the Covid-19 outbreak. Finance ministers suspended talks early on Wednesday on how to help southern eurozone countries worst affected by the pandemic. The talks were due to resume on Thursday. After Prof Ferrari's resignation, German MEP Christian Ehler told the Science Business website that Prof Ferrari's proposals contradicted the legal basis of the ERC and were a ""window-dressing public relations stand on the coronavirus crisis"".  One of the conditions for an ERC grant is that scientists apply for funding on a ""bottom-up"" basis for research either in a public or private research organisation. A Commission spokesman said more 50 ERC projects had been involved in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and 18 research and development proposals had been selected.- across a variety of scientific fields from virology to social behaviour. Prof Ferrari said it was time for him to return to ""the frontlines of the fight against Covid-19, with real resources and responsibilities, away from offices in Brussels, where my political skills are clearly inadequate"". The Commission said it was grateful for Prof Ferrari's ""strong personal investment"" and wished him well for the future."
Yield Spread Analysis,Cosmic signal rattles Earth after 7 billion years,2024-09-14,2020-09-02,By Jonathan Amos,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53993937,"Imagine the energy of eight Suns released in an instant. This is the gravitational ""shockwave"" that spread out from the biggest merger yet observed between two black holes. The signal from this event travelled for some seven billion years to reach Earth but was still sufficiently strong to rattle laser detectors in the US and Italy in May last year. Researchers say the colliding black holes produced a single entity with a mass 142 times that of our Sun. This is noteworthy. Science has long traced the presence of black holes on the sky that are quite a bit smaller or even very much larger. But this new observation inaugurates a novel class of so-called intermediate-sized black holes in the range of 100-1,000 Sun (or solar) masses. The analysis is the latest to come out of the international LIGO-VIRGO collaboration, which operates three super-sensitive gravitational wave-detection systems in America and Europe. The collaboration's laser interferometer instruments ""listen"" for the vibrations in space-time that are generated by truly cataclysmic cosmic events - and on 21 May, 2019, they were all triggered by a sharp signal lasting just one-tenth of a second. Computer algorithms determined the source to be the end-stage moments of two in-spiralling black holes - one with a mass 66 times that of our Sun, and the other with 85 solar masses. The distance to the merger was calculated to be the equivalent of 150 billion trillion km. ""It's astounding, really,"" said Prof Nelson Christensen from the Côte d'Azur Observatory in France. ""This signal propagated for seven billion years. So this event happened 'just before halftime' for the Universe, and now it's mechanically moved our detectors here on Earth,"" he explained to BBC News. The involvement of an 85-solar-mass object in the collision has made collaboration scientists sit up because their understanding of how black holes form from the death of a star can't really account for something on this scale.  Stars, when they exhaust their nuclear fuel, will experience an explosive core collapse to produce a black hole - if they're sufficiently big. But the physics that's assumed to operate inside stars suggests the production of black holes in the particular mass range between 65 and 120 solar masses is impossible. Dying stars that might yield such entities actually tear themselves apart and leave nothing behind.  If the science is correct on this point then the most likely explanation for the existence of an 85-solar-mass object is that it was itself the result of an even earlier black hole union. And that, believes Prof Martin Hendry, from Glasgow University, UK, has implications for how the Universe evolved. ""We're talking here about a hierarchy of mergers, a possible pathway to make bigger and bigger black holes,"" he said. ""So, who knows? This 142-solar-mass black hole may have gone on to have merged with other very massive black holes - as part of a build-up process that goes all the way to those supermassive black holes we think are at the heart of galaxies."" The LIGO-VIRGO collaboration is reporting the 21 May, 2019, event (catalogued as GW190521) in two scholarly papers.  One is in the journal Physical Review Letters and describes the discovery. The second can be found in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, and discusses the signal's physical properties and scientific implications. GW190521 is one of over 50 gravitational wave triggers presently being investigated at the laser laboratories. The pace of research has increased rapidly since the collaboration made its first, Nobel-Prize-winning detection of gravitational waves in 2015. ""We are increasing the sensitivity of the detectors and, yes, we could end up making more than one detection a day. We will have a rain of black holes! But this is beautiful because we will learn so much more about them,"" Prof Alessandra Buonanno, director at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, told BBC News.

Yield Spread Analysis,Beale hails Rangers' first half after 'tough week',2024-09-14,2023-03-04,Nick McPheat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64767995,"Connor Goldson's first goal of 2023 opened the scoring for Rangers at Ibrox Rangers manager Michael Beale hailed his side's ""excellent"" first-half display after they responded to a ""tough week"" with a home Scottish Premiership victory over Kilmarnock. Beale demanded his players to ""move forward quickly"" after last Sunday's Viaplay Cup final defeat by Celtic, and they did so by racing into a three-goal lead thanks to Connor Goldson, Fashion Sakala and a James Tavernier penalty. But the hosts' performance level fluctuated after the break as Jeriel Dorsett pulled one back for Kilmarnock. ""We showed good energy [in the first half],"" Beale told BBC Sportsound. ""We looked strong, it was whether we were going to be ruthless in the final third. ""The start of the second half we made sloppy errors. It's something that's plagued the team to be honest. But first half we played some really good stuff and we shouldn't lose sight of that."" The victory cuts Celtic's lead at the top to six points, but a win for Ange Postecoglou's men at St Mirren on Sunday would restore their nine-point advantage over Rangers, who are yet to taste defeat in the league under Beale after 11 games. Meanwhile, Derek McInnes' relegation-threatened side remain 11th without an away league win this season. Visit our Rangers page for the latest news, analysis & fan views Everything Kilmarnock - go straight to all the best content The Kilmarnock boss will rue his players' defensive fragility in the first period as Goldson was able to tap into an empty net after the rampant hosts were afforded far too much space in the box. More poor defending then resulted in Sakala, who should have scored twice shortly before, adding a second 19 minutes later when Antonio Colak teed up the Zambian forward to finish past Sam Walker. And it was three just before the break when Tavernier hammered in a penalty after an on-field VAR review judged Ryan Alebiosu to have handled the ball in the box when challenging Ryan Kent. But the home side's intensity dipped in the early stages of the second half as a much-improved Kilmarnock reduced the deficit through a brave header from Dorsett after they had claims for a penalty waved away when Allen McGregor came through the back of Rory McKenzie. McInnes' men failed to maintain their attacking spark, though, as Rangers looked to add a fourth late on. But they were thwarted by visiting keeper Walker, who saved Colak's close-range header, before an offside flag denied Ryan Jack. Like the rest of his team-mates, the Rangers winger's performance level dropped in the second half - but his electrifying first-half display was key to the home side racing into a three-goal lead The nature of the Old Firm is you will always be compared to your rival across the city, and one of the glaring differences between Beale's side and Postecoglou's Celtic is their ruthless streaks in attack. Rangers' first-half attacking display was fantastic, but they failed to maintain that level for the entire match as Beale continues to look for consistency in his side's 90-minute displays. It is broken record stuff, but for Kilmarnock - and any non-Old Firm side - they will not be judged on trips to Ibrox and Celtic Park. McInnes' men can be judged, however, on the fact they have only picked up two points from a possible 45 on the road, which is simply not good enough. The Ayrshire side's soft touch in defence will also be of concern. The opening goal, which saw Rangers have four shots on goal inside the Kilmarnock box in one phase of play, was evidence of that. McInnes will take comfort in his players' second-half display, though. They showed far more attacking threat and looked more organised, although a lot of that was down to the dip in Rangers' showing.  Rangers manager Michael Beale: ""I was delighted with [Colak]. The last couple of weeks I've seen a different boy. He was really bright and in the game. The only thing he didn't do was score."" Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes: ""First half we never had any real threat in behind. [Connor] Goldson and [Ben] Davies were allowed to squeeze the game and suffocate us. ""Second half we were far better. We brought Jordan [Jones] on to give us a threat and I thought he was really good."" Rangers are in midweek league action as they travel to Hibernian on Wednesday (19:45 GMT). Kilmarnock next play on Friday (19:45) when they go to Inverness Caledonian Thistle for their Scottish Cup quarter-final. BBC Sport Scottish Football SPFL"
Yield Spread Analysis,ESL a 'closed chapter' says Guardiola after win,2024-09-14,2021-04-20,Michael Emons,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56741406,"Only Kevin De Bruyne (24) has been directly involved in more goals in all competitions for Manchester City this season than Phil Foden (23 - 14 goals, nine assists) Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said the failed European Super League (ESL) was a ""closed chapter"" after his side beat Aston Villa to move closer to becoming Premier League champions. City were one of 12 clubs to sign up to the breakaway ESL on Sunday, but withdrew on Tuesday after widespread criticism of the proposals, which would have seen no promotion or relegation and a split in English football. ""As a club we accept and learn and focus on the reason why we're here,"" said Guardiola, whose side need eight points from five matches to become English champions for the third time in four seasons. ""It's a chapter which is over, a closed chapter. They [the owners] don't need to apologise [to me], I know them, I know how they are."" City's win leaves them 11 points clear of Manchester United with Guardiola saying his side were ""so close"" to the title. However, they had a scare when centre-half John Stones was sent off just before the break for a knee-high challenge on Jacob Ramsey. But Villa wasted the man advantage when Matty Cash was dismissed 11 minutes into the second half following two bookings in the space of three minutes.  The hosts had earlier gone ahead after only 20 seconds as John McGinn guided a shot past Ederson following Ollie Watkins' low cross. The impressive Phil Foden finished off a fine City team move to equalise before Rodri headed what proved to be the winner following Bernardo Silva's cross. City led 2-1 when they went down to 10 men, but Villa could not capitalise on the extra player and then offered little threat when it was 10-a-side. Relive Aston Villa v Manchester City as it happened, plus reaction and analysis Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast This video can not be played 'We are so close to title' - Guardiola on Man City's win over Aston Villa Stones has been in fine form this season, making more Premier League appearances than he managed in 2019-20, with his performances earning an England recall after 16 months out of the national side. However, with Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate in the stands, it was an evening to forget for the 26-year-old. He was caught out in the first few seconds of the match when he failed to collect a long ball from England team-mate Tyrone Mings, enabling Watkins to set up McGinn for the joint quickest Premier League goal of the season. Stones was then shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge on Ramsey near the halfway line and in front of the two dugouts. After a check by the video assistant referee Jarred Gillett, on-field referee Peter Banks watched the incident on a pitchside monitor and showed the red card to Stones, although Guardiola was unhappy with the decision and remonstrated with the officials. Stones will be suspended for Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley as City, who are also in the Champions League semi-finals, aim to pick up the first of a potential three trophies this season. With a man advantage, Villa's Douglas Luiz curled a 25-yard effort straight at Ederson but the match swung back in City's favour following two Cash challenges on Foden, the second of which was a sliding challenge that wiped out the England midfielder close to the touchline. From then on City were able to dominate possession and now only need three more league wins to become English champions for the seventh time in their history. This video can not be played MOTD analysis: How ‘sensational’ Phil Foden is changing games for Man City The build-up to the match at Villa Park had been dominated by talk of the European Super League. City were one of six English teams - along with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham - to join three sides from Spain and three from Italy in the proposed new closed competition. However, Sunday's announcement, brought widespread criticism and anger from fans, managers, other clubs and politicians, with Guardiola himself saying football ""is not a sport if success is guaranteed or if it doesn't matter when you lose"". City were one of the first to announce their withdrawal from the ESL on Tuesday evening and there was no repeat of the protests that had seen angry fans demonstrating before Liverpool's match at Leeds on Monday, Chelsea's home game versus Brighton on Tuesday and Tottenham's encounter with Southampton earlier on Wednesday. This was a game that again highlighted the exciting and thrilling nature of the Premier League and City's play after going a goal behind was a joy to watch. Their equaliser started with goalkeeper Ederson knocking a fine 50-yard ball to the left wing where Olexandr Zinchenko played it to the superb Foden. The 20-year-old drilled a low pass to Riyad Mahrez and the Algerian released the overlapping Silva on the right flank and his pull-back was steered into the net by Foden. The second goal was another well-worked one as Rodri powerfully headed in from another Silva assist. Not only have City scored the most goals in the Premier League, they also have the best defensive record and successfully managed to stifle Villa in the second half to take a big step towards another title. After the match, City boss Pep Guardiola said of Foden: ""This guy is growing. His influence in our games is massive. He's becoming a serious player. ""Phil right now is becoming such an important player. His influence in the final third is so important."" Aston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""We made a great start. It was something we had spoken about. We have one of the best players in the league who can run in behind the oppositions defence in the shape of Ollie Watkins. ""We defended reasonably well. It was probably the manner of the goals we conceded that was most disappointing. Cashy will learn from that. The second [booking] was stupid and reckless. ""Some of Manchester City's play play was outstanding. They schooled us at times. ""I've been involved in professional football for 34 years and I haven't seen football come together like it has this week. That shows you how outraged people were at the [ESL] plans."" This video can not be played Aston Villa 1-2 Man City: Dean Smith says his side were 'schooled' by Manchester City Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""Not the start I dreamt of but we reacted very well, we played so good with and without the ball. Ten against 11, we reacted well, we played so good."" On John Stones' red card: ""He's late but the intention to kick him is not there, he wouldn't go there with intention, he's not aggressive with the feet, he's just late. It's tough, playing a lot of minutes, good learning for him. Even with 10 men we played good, when we had the ball we played good."" On distraction of Super League: ""After that game it doesn't look like it did distract us, we were focused, of course everyone was concerned, but the players were focused on this game. We are so close. Cup final and Champions League and then Crystal Palace."" Manchester City have won each of their last 10 Premier League away games, becoming the first team to win 10 in a row on the road in the competition on more than one occasion (won 11 in a row between May-December 2017).  Aston Villa boss Dean Smith has lost all five games against Man City during his managerial career - the most games he has managed against a single opponent losing 100% of those matches. Villa have lost nine of their last 11 Premier League games against the league leaders, with those defeats coming by an aggregate score of 24-6.  City won a Premier League game having conceded the first goal for the first time since December 2019 versus Leicester (3-1), ending a run of 10 games without a win when conceding first (drew three, lost seven). City's Bernardo Silva has provided more Premier League assists in 2021 than any other player so far in this period (six - twice as many as the Portuguese assisted throughout 2020 in the top-flight (three).  City's John Stones was been sent off for the first time in his Premier League career, in what was his 182nd appearance in the competition. It was only the sixth foul he had conceded in the league in 20 games this season. No player has scored more goals in all competitions before turning 21 for Pep Guardiola than Manchester City's Phil Foden (29 - level with Bojan).  Villa's John McGinn's goal after 20 seconds was the second quickest goal Manchester City have conceded in Premier League history, after Alan Shearer's for Newcastle United after 10 seconds in January 2003.  City play Tottenham at Wembley in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday (16:30 BST), before Villa take on West Brom in a Premier League match later that day (19:00).

Yield Spread Analysis,Three-tier Covid restrictions begin in England,2024-09-14,2020-10-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54533924,"The new three-tier system of Covid-19 restrictions has begun in England.   Most of the country is in the lowest tier - medium - but millions of people in the North and the Midlands face extra curbs on households mixing.  The Liverpool region is the only area to be under the toughest rules, with pubs and bars not serving meals closed. Government health officials are due to meet later to discuss the possibility of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and some other areas joining the top tier. Hours before the top tier rules came into force in Liverpool, police were forced to disperse large crowds in the city. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has announced an extension of the half-term holidays for schools, from Monday, alongside other new measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. And in Wales a short circuit breaker lockdown is being ""actively considered"" by the Welsh Government.   The Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, tweeted that he had not spoken with the government about the new restrictions since Friday, claiming pressure was being ""piled on via media briefings"".    A statement from Mr Burnham, his deputy and leaders of all 10 councils in the area, said the current evidence around infection rates and hospital admissions did not support the area going into Tier 3 (the top tier).  The financial package accompanying Tier 3 restrictions was ""nowhere near sufficient to prevent severe hardship, widespread job losses and business failure"", the statement added.  It comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for a two to three-week ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown in England to bring the infection rate under control.  The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert.  Areas on medium alert are subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants.  In addition to these restrictions, in areas on high alert - including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors.  Areas on very high alert face extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens.  Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area.  Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos will also close.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the system at Prime Minister's Questions, saying the regional approach aimed to ""seize this moment now to avoid the misery of a national lockdown"". But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons the measures did not go far enough - a view he said was echoed by the government's scientific advisers. And MPs in Liverpool said the city ""risks being dragged back to the 1980s"" without proper financial support alongside the new restrictions.  Parliament has approved the legislation to write a new three-tier system into law, but 42 Tory MPs rebelled in a vote to express their disapproval of the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants in England. Meanwhile, the Scottish government is to implement its own three-tier framework of restrictions later in October. In the meantime, pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, were closed on Friday until 25 October as part of a package of short-term measures. In Northern Ireland, hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services for four weeks from Friday, alongside a raft of new restrictions.  The country's First Minister, Arlene Foster, said the decisions had not been taken lightly, adding: ""I don't shy away from the fact that a lot of these decisions will have huge impacts - we're very determined this will be a time-limited intervention."" And in Wales, the Welsh Government is considering bringing in deeper lockdown measures over a short period of time, including closing pubs and restaurants during the school half-term holiday. The government sees its three-tier system of localised restrictions as striking a balance between fighting the virus and protecting the economy. However, Sir Keir Starmer's decision to back a much tougher England-wide temporary lockdown does mean there is now an alternative plan on the table. And it is a plan that came recommended by the government's own scientists.  Downing Street has not ruled out a ""circuit break"" completely - to do so, it maintains, would be irresponsible. But it has been very clear that it does not want to get there.  A senior government source accused Labour of playing politics but the move will increase the pressure on Mr Johnson to show that his alternative works - and does so quickly.  He is likely to have the backing of his own MPs - many of whom are not keen to go further for now at least. The former minister Andrew Mitchell - who has voiced criticism in recent days - said the three tier system must be given time to show results. Outlining his call for a ""circuit breaker"" at a press conference on Tuesday evening, Sir Keir said current measures to curb the spread of coronavirus were not working. He proposed that schools would remain open, with the circuit breaker taking place across half-term to ""minimise disruption"".  However he said it would mean all pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed and compensated. Non-essential retail businesses would also shut. His comments came after documents revealed government scientific advisers called for such action three weeks ago.  On Tuesday, a further 17,234 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 143 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus.  How will the new restrictions affect you?

Yield Spread Analysis,£600m on 17 players - but what is Chelsea's best XI?,2024-09-14,2023-02-10,Joe Bradshaw,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64544614,"Chelsea have already used 33 different players in all competitions this season ""The manager doesn't know his best team."" It is a regular criticism aimed at any head coach who frequently makes changes to a struggling side in search of a winning formula. It is one Chelsea boss Graham Potter, armed with a bulging roster of high-priced talent, is likely to hear a lot unless his side put together a winning run and move up the Premier League table. There were murmurs of it after the soulless 0-0 draw with Fulham on Friday that included five of Chelsea's new signings from the £300m-plus January spending spree that was sanctioned by the club's new owners. That outlay followed almost the same amount spent in the summer, with a total of 17 new players brought to Stamford Bridge through two transfer windows. However, as the dust settled on their first league game since the transfer window closed, they had mustered a mere three shots on target and no goals. When asked about his player shopping, Potter said: ""It's a team for the now and for the future.""  But, after such significant outlay, Potter has to hope Todd Boehly and the new ownership group are less trigger-happy than their notoriously impatient predecessor at Stamford Bridge. Who makes your best Blues XI? For news, analysis and fan views, head to our bespoke Chelsea page For many of the Premier League's best teams - Manchester United in 1999, Arsenal's Invincibles of 2004, Liverpool's peak Klopp years - the first-choice XI pretty much trips off the tongue. Continuity breeds consistency, right? But, given Chelsea's abundance of riches, and the number of competitive fixtures in the modern era, is having a best team really possible? Manchester City have proved over a sustained period that shuffling the starting line-up can bring emphatic success. What's more, Liverpool's reliance on a small core of players in recent years could be contributing to their collapse this season, with so many key men looking spent.  ""It's over-simplistic to pick a best team,"" says ex-Chelsea forward Pat Nevin. ""You would never play the same XI in every game unless you've got a team that is so solid and unchangeable.  ""Who you pick for an away game in the Champions League will be very different to the team you put out at home against a side in the bottom half of the table. ""Besides, Potter famously changes personnel and styles of play all the time."" So is Chelsea's strategy of splashing huge sums of money on the world's most exciting young talents the right way to go, especially given they have spread the eye-watering cost over lucrative long-term deals? ""It's massively high risk,"" concludes Nevin. ""If you buy young, unproven players on eight-year contracts, a percentage of them will fail. ""But if they've got it right, it's a fantastic way to do it, and I suspect they will be quite an enjoyable team to watch."" Potter faces the delicate task of maintaining harmony in a dressing room packed full of outstanding footballers and big egos. It's a dance Nevin says comes with the territory. ""That's what he gets paid a lot of money for,"" he argues. ""It's the biggest first world problem you're ever going to get. You should look at that as an opportunity, not as a problem.""  So who, if everyone is fit, would be in Nevin's first-choice Chelsea side?  Pat Nevin's Chelsea XI contains four players signed in January ""I think it'll change week to week but let's consider who should be playing,"" he said.  ""N'Golo Kante is the very first pick if everyone is fully fit but it's a very big 'if' for me. He'd play with Enzo Fernandez. ""I think you have to play Mykhailo Mudryk and Joao Felix. They are interchangeable in their positions, and then Mason Mount has to play. ""I'd put Kai Havertz up front for the moment but eventually I think he will drop into a deeper area and be one of the attacking three."" Nevin also likes the look of new centre-back Benoit Badashile, even if he could not fit into Chelsea's revised squad for the Champions League. ""They are so short in defence,"" he said. ""He has been exceptionally good in his first few games and I think maybe in a year or so, he will be in a back three with Wesley Fofana and Trevoh Chalobah."" ""I have to underline this does not mean that everybody else is rubbish,"" Nevin adds. ""It depends who you are playing against. ""For instance, there will be plenty of games that are made for Raheem Sterling - it's never clear-cut and simple."" Raheem Sterling has 113 Premier League goals, 26 more in the Champions League and 82 caps for England Sterling was the flagship signing last summer, a 27-year-old serial title-winner captured from champions Manchester City who appeared ready-made to spearhead Chelsea's revolution.  One goal and one assist since August is not what Boehly will have had in mind when he sanctioned a £50m purchase. His is a decorated career but, after the squad roulette of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, he may not be enjoying a similar experience in west London. The excesses of January paint the summer window in a dim light. Kalidou Koulibaly and Marc Cucurella both arrived for significant sums after the departures of Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger, but are now not guaranteed starters.  And then there's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Signed as a missing piece of the jigsaw by Potter's predecessor Thomas Tuchel, he clearly does not fit with the strategy of signing young, hungry footballers - and he appears nowhere near Chelsea's first-choice XI. Nevin, however, views last summer more positively.  ""In retrospect, they just needed bodies,"" he said. ""They lost two centre-backs so had to get one in.  ""Some call it panic buying, I think it was security buying, but not part of a big plan. ""That's the one we're seeing now.""

Yield Spread Analysis,How to revive a lost language,2024-09-14,2019-03-22,Alex Rawlings,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190320-the-man-bringing-dead-languages-back-to-life,"Ghil’ad Zuckermann has found that resurrecting lost languages may bring many benefits to indigenous populations – with knock-on effects for their health and happiness. Like many people in Australia, Professor Ghil’ad Zuckermann is a regular contributor to the fund to save the Tasmanian Devil. The Tasmanian Devil, which Zuckermann remarks is an “ugly animal”, is listed as endangered, along with much of the unique and beautiful wildlife that makes Australia such a distinctive and enigmatic place. Yet animal life is not the only thing that has struggled to keep up with the pressures of modern life down under. While Australia may be famous the world over for its biodiversity, for a linguistics professor like Zuckermann, the country has another allure: its languages. Before European colonisers arrived, Australia used to be one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, boasting around 250 different languages. Due in part to Australia’s long geographic isolation, many of these had developed unique grammatical structures and concepts that were unknown to languages in other parts of the world. One of these is a language called Guugu Yimithirr, spoken in the north of Queensland, which gave the world the word ""kangaroo"". It’s also made remarkable by the fact that unlike languages like English, it does not make use of ego-centric positioning systems such as ""left"" and ""right"". Instead, all speakers of Guugu Yimithirr have an in-built compass in their brain that allows them to always know where is north, south, east and west. Therefore, they have no need to talk about the ""left tap"" or the ""right tap"". Instead, they just refer to the ""north tap"" or the ""south tap"". But according to the 2016 Australian census, Guugu Yimithirr has just 775 native speakers alive today, with numbers on the decline. Of the 250 languages spoken before settlers arrived, today all but 13 of them are considered to be ""highly endangered"" – a fact that is often overlooked. “I believe that most people care more about animals that are endangered than about languages that are endangered,” Zuckerman explains. “The reason is that animals are tangible. You can touch a koala, even though in the wild you’d be crazy to do so because she can kill you with her claws. But koalas are cute. Languages, however, are not tangible. They are abstract. People understand the importance of biodiversity far more than that of linguistic diversity.”  Yet for Zuckermann, preserving linguistic diversity is hugely important. For indigenous communities in Australia and worldwide that are still grappling with the legacy of colonisation, being able to speak their ancestral language is about empowerment and reclaiming their identity. It may even carry significant consequences for their mental health. You might also like: Ghil’ad Zuckermann first visited Australia in 2004. He felt so overcome with love for what he describes as the most beautiful country he’d ever seen that he decided he wanted to do something to help it. As a linguistics professor from Israel, the son of a Holocaust survivor, and a specialist at the time in the analysis of the Hebrew language revival, he quickly identified an area where he could have an impact: the revival and empowerment of Aboriginal languages and cultures. Zuckermann first established the trans-disciplinary field of enquiry called “Revivalistics”, which focuses on supporting the survival, revival and reinvigoration of endangered and extinct languages all around the world. These range from languages such as Hebrew, Welsh, Cornish and Irish, to Hawaiian, North American languages like Wampanoag and Myaamia, and many others. As an Israeli, Zuckermann grew up a native speaker of Modern Hebrew, arguably the world’s most successful example of language revival to date. Hebrew was extinct for almost 2,000 years until Zionist language revivalists began to bring it back into use in the late 19th Century. They achieved this by adapting the ancient language of the Torah so that it could be suitable for modern life. It would eventually become the mother tongue of all Jews in the new state of Israel, founded in 1948. Zuckermann’s expertise and personal experience with Modern Hebrew greatly informs his work in Australia today, precisely because he takes a critical view of it. He argues that the language spoken natively by millions of people in Israel today and that they call Hebrew is not, and could not be, the same language of the Bible. “The Jews did not manage to revive the language of Isaiah. It is simply impossible to revive a language as it used to be.” Instead, Zuckermann explains that Modern Hebrew, which he controversially refers to as ""Israeli"", is a hybrid language, drawing on the influences that Jewish migrants brought with them to Israel from their native languages, such as Yiddish, Polish, Russian and Arabic. Over the course of generations, these blended together to shape the language in its modern form. According to Zuckermann, this should not be seen as a problem. These changes are a natural and necessary part of the process of reviving a language. “I take into consideration the speaker more than the language. A speaker of Yiddish could not get rid of their Yiddish Weltanschauung or mindset, even though they hated Yiddish and wanted to speak Hebrew. But the moment a person understands the importance of the native speaker at the expense of linguistic purism and authenticity of the language, that person can be a good revivalist.” Sleeping beauties Much of Zuckermann’s work in Australia has centred on Barngarla, a dead language – Zuckermann prefers the term “sleeping beauty” – that was spoken in the rural areas of southern Australia between the cities of Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Whyalla. The last native speaker, Moonie Davis, passed away in 1960. Yet when Zuckerman reached out to the Barngarla community and proposed that he help revive their language and their culture, he was amazed by their response. “We have been waiting for you for 50 years,” they told him. Zuckermann’s starting point was a dictionary written by a Lutheran missionary called Robert Schürmann in 1844. In 2011, Zuckermann began making regular trips to Barngarla country to run language revival workshops. Together, and with Zuckermann’s help and guidance, the Barngarla community built upon the knowledge stored within Schürmann’s 1844 dictionary. They pooled together what they could remember of words they’d heard their parents and grandparents saying. They also held discussions about how to devise appropriate words that could apply to modern life. Should Barngarla follow English’s precedent and refer to the computer using the metaphor of ‘computing’ something? Or should they instead look to Mandarin Chinese, whose word 电脑 (diànnǎo) literally means “electric brain”? The result is modern-day Barngarla, a language that has been revived in a form that is as close as possible to the Barngarla that was spoken before its last native speaker died out. Yet inevitably, as with the case of Modern Hebrew, it will never fully be the same. Too much time has passed, and there has been too much influence from the colonial language, in this case English, for today’s Barngarla to be a carbon copy. It too is a hybrid language, yet one that the Barngarla community can feel proud to speak once more. For Zuckermann, there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, quite the opposite: “Hybridity results in new linguistic diversity.” Linguicide “Linguicide” – the killing of language – sits amongst the 10 forms of genocide that are recognised by the United Nations. The Barngarla language did not die out in 1960 solely due to natural causes. Like many Aboriginal languages, in the early to mid-20th Century it was actively destroyed and subjected to the cruel and imperialistic policies of the Australian government at the time, who removed children from their mothers and sent them to boarding schools thousands of miles away. There, they learned English and quickly forgot their mother tongue. If they ever returned to their ancestral homelands, they found themselves unable to communicate with their own families, as they no longer shared a common language. Lavinia Richards is one of the ""stolen generation"". She remembers the trauma of being forcibly separated from her mother by the Australian authorities and forced to speak a foreign language – English. When the Barngarla community released a CD of stories and songs of Barngarla people affected by the ""stolen generation"" in June 2018, she included on it a poem that she wrote about a flower she saw that reminded her of her mother, a reminder of a life that was denied to her because she was born speaking the wrong language. For Zuckermann, there are three reasons why people should support language revival. The first is the simple ethical matter of righting the wrongs of colonial linguistic supremacy. Zuckermann states that the very fact that the Australian government at the time actively tried to destroy Australia’s unique linguistic diversity, driven perhaps by the racist notions of politicians such as Anthony Forster, who in 1843 declared “the natives would be sooner civilised if their language was extinct”, is convincing enough for him. However, Zuckermann’s second reason is utilitarian. Language revival is about far more than just communication. He argues that it is about “culture, cultural autonomy, intellectual sovereignty, spirituality, well-being, and the soul”. “When you lose your language, you lose your soul. When you revive your language, you don’t only revive its sounds, its words, its morphemes and its phonemes. You revive the whole shebang.” Over his many years of working in language revival, Zuckermann has become increasingly convinced of a clear trend. He believes that amongst Aboriginal communities that have reclaimed their ancestral language, he has observed greatly improved physical and mental health. He sees a sharp drop in incidences of suicide, alcoholism, addiction and diabetes – problems that unfortunately are rife amongst Aboriginal people across Australia. These are only anecdotal observations but in 2017, he began a five-year study to see whether he could find hard evidence to support the theory. Should he be proven right, he believes that this should give the Australian government enough cause to support language revival programmes across the country through healthcare funding from tax payers’ money. A preliminary investigation in 2007 from the University of Oxford, University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria in Canada seems to support Zuckermann’s claims. By analysing Canadian census data, the researchers discovered that youth suicide rates “effectively dropped to zero in the few communities where at least half of the members reported a conversational level of their ‘Native’ language”. “I really believe that billions of dollars in Australia have been wasted on stupid, medically approved programmes. I can prove qualitatively and quantitatively that language revival results in better health,"" Zuckermann says. “You kill the language of an Aboriginal community, you cause depression. You cause depression, you cause people to lose their will to take care of their body.” The third and final reason Zuckermann cites for supporting language revival is aesthetic. In other words, the co-existence of so many distinct and unique languages is beautiful. Australia’s multilingualism is like the human reflection of the biodiversity for which the country is so well known. Yet Zuckermann is aware that of all of his arguments, this is the one that may meet its toughest reception amongst the wider public. For Candace Kaleimamoowahinekapu Galla, a native Hawaiian and associate professor at the University of British Columbia, speaking her ancestral language and promoting its use amongst her fellow Hawaiians is about something simple, yet fundamental. It’s about pride. “But not in an egotistical way,” she is quick to clarify. “It’s a humbling pride. It’s about accessing documents, newspapers or stories from the 1800s and understanding them on a different level to just reading them through an English translation.” Galla describes the Hawaiian language as the foundation of everything distinguishing about Hawaiian culture. She believes that even the famous Hula dance, which has risen to the status of something of a global phenomenon, is impossible to truly perform without understanding Hawaiian, the lyric and the motion behind the lyric. Without an appreciation for those things, you are “just learning choreography”, according to Galla. “You can’t dance Hula without Hawaiian. You can dance, but it’s not Hula.” Looking to the future, Zuckermann has grand plans. After his decisions to found Revivalistics and to work with the Barngarla community, he says that his next step is to spread the message far and wide. Since running his first online open-access course on language revival in 2014, he has so far had more than 11,000 participants in 188 countries, including in Afghanistan, Syria, and countries where genocide and linguicide are common. “I want to reach people who are not academic. People who are language activists, but who do not go to university and do not have money to do things. People who would like to revive their language.” -- Alex Rawlings is a polyglot and writer, who in 2012 was named Britain’s Most Multilingual Student after being tested for fluency in 11 languages.

Yield Spread Analysis,Meet the watchers of the web,2024-09-14,2016-05-04,Elizabeth Garone,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160503-meet-the-people-who-see-nearly-everything-we-post-online,"As social media proliferates, a new industry has sprung up to weed out deviant content. Meet the watchers on the web. Every day, more than 350 million photographs are uploaded to Facebook. Add to that millions more videos, gifs and text posts. With each one, there is a chance that malicious or deviant content will be a part of the mix. Consider all of the sites on the web, beyond Facebook, and the number of opportunities for inappropriate or damaging content is staggering. Enter social media risk defence teams. What was once watched over by volunteer online moderators has now been taken over by professionals monitoring the web 24/7, 365 days a year. In a merging of public relations crisis management, internet security and social listening, an entire industry has been born. With the explosive growth of the internet and, specifically, user-generated content and companies’ social media presence, social defence is growing by the day. There are an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 people working as social media monitors globally and close to one million people working in online security and privacy, according to Hemanshu Nigam, former chief security officer of MySpace and founder of Los Angeles-based online safety consultancy SSP Blue. Those numbers, he said, are conservative estimates and are changing all the time. So, who are these defenders? “[It] is really the natural evolution of the online moderator [who] traditionally removed the ‘bad stuff’ and acted as part editor, part host in a community,” said Emma Monks, head of moderation, trust and security at Leeds, UK-based Crisp Thinking, a leading social risk defence firm. “Quite often it was a hobby job. They were volunteer members of the community and had a lot of autonomy in the decision making on what sort of content remained on display or was removed.” The job is no longer volunteer and now the people filling these roles respond to the findings of complex computer algorithms designed to and filter out bad content. At Crisp, these so-called social risk analysts spend their day combing through well-known clients’ websites and social media, looking for inappropriate or damaging content. At other firms, these watchers are called social defenders or content moderators. Their role “One of the beliefs at Crisp is that brands and consumers should have this worry-free social media experience, not have to worry about all the bad things,” said Adam Hildreth, Crisp’s founder and chief executive officer. “Just like in real life, [where] we have the police force to ensure that we all feel safe, we should have that online.” At only 31 years old, Hildreth is considered a veteran in the business. At age 14, he started a social network for teens called Dubit Limited, which became the most visited teen website in the UK. But, along with Dubit’s success, there was the concern over “online groomers”, paedophiles who troll the internet looking for victims, and other threats to site visitors. In 2006, Hildreth founded Crisp, “prompted by the rising threats to children, consumers, and brands online, through social media and messaging apps”, he said. From there, Crisp has grown substantially and monitors companies’ social media presences for everything from a posted bomb threat on an airline’s Facebook page to animal rights activists bombarding a designer’s site over the use of fur. Hildreth counts some 200 global brands among the company’s clients and said that the staff of analyst defenders – around 200 people spread out globally – go through “billions” of pieces of content every month. (Disclosure: BBC.com is among Crisp’s global clients.) Virtual watchmen “We’re there to be that round the clock eyes and ears,” said Hildreth, watching and listening for anyone talking about their clients’ brands on their own channels or on the rest of the Web. “If it’s a risk, then we either deal with it ourselves, removing content from [the brand’s] page, for example, or we’re getting the right person out of bed.” Sometimes, that means picking up the phone to say, “Hey, look, this celebrity just got off a plane and said they had a terrible experience with your brand.” Or, they’ve taken a photo of your product, “put it out to eight million people, and said they can’t believe how bad the product is.” At Crisp, the analysts are first taught definitions outlining types of risk online, both reputational risks for brands (lots of negative chatter about a recent ad campaign on the company website, for example) and wider risks that have safety implications for the public (someone threatening physical harm through a Facebook post, for instance). They then apply those definitions to content given to them for review from a wide range of social media platforms and classify the content into different types of risk. The analysts are also responsible for alerting clients about any risks and for taking further action to remove the content if required, such as deleting or reporting the content to the social media platform, law enforcement or other agencies, according to Monks. No experience necessary   Surprisingly, analysts don’t need to have previous experience in the field, said Monks. It is such a niche industry that it would be hard to find people with experience in it, for one, but, she added, experience isn’t necessary. “The main quality I look for is the ability to assimilate the definitions for various risk types and apply them to social media content in a consistent way,” said Monks. “Consistency is absolutely key. Not just in order to supply the client with a quality service, but also to aid that client in maintaining a community space that is healthy and engaging.” The ability to be dispassionate and objective is important. “There are times when a social risk analyst needs to review content that they have a strong opinion on, but that cannot sway their decision making,” said Monks. And, since some content can be quite unsettling – for example, beheadings or child pornography – resilience is essential, she said. Great communication, team spirit and a positive attitude also help.   For most companies, having a social risk defence isn’t optional any more, one reason the field is growing, said SSP Blue’s Nigam. There is just too much risk not having one. “You absolutely cannot exist in the online space without having this layer of protection. It really is a requirement now where it wasn’t before,” he said. “People expect it, and your experiences are impacted by it.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page, message us on Twitter or find us on LinkedIn."
Yield Spread Analysis,Lundstram 'kicked off pitch' as Rangers cut gap,2024-09-14,2023-12-19,Andy Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67247476,"John Lundstram (bottom left) was withdrawn at half-time after picking up an ankle injury Manager Philippe Clement lamented midfielder John Lundstram's injury after Rangers followed up their Viaplay Cup success by beating 10-man St Johnstone to move within two points of Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic. First-half substitute Cyriel Dessers struck to put Clement's men in front and the visitors' task was made significantly harder when Diallang Jaiyesimi was sent off for a foul on Lundstram, who was replaced at the break. The Perth side, who slip a place to ninth, restricted their hosts thereafter with goalkeeper Dimitar Mitov denying Dessers and Sam Lammers. But James Tavernier converted a late penalty after Mitov fouled Dessers. The Ibrox side, who were already without midfielders Jose Cifuentes and Ryan Jack, still have a game in hand on Celtic but will not play that match away to Hibernian until after the winter break. ""At first sight it doesn't look good so I hope I can recover him before the winter break,"" said Clement of Lundstram. ""It's another player who is kicked off the pitch, so I am really frustrated with that. It's his ankle so we will see in the next couple of days what will happen. ""It clearly wasn't a good challenge with your studs forward like that. We had an even worse one later in the game when the guy luckily hit the ball and not my player [Dan Phillips on Kieran Dowell], the intensity there was to break a leg. Those things are not good for football."" Reaction & as it happened Keep up to date with Rangers The latest St Johnstone news Rangers were limited to long-range efforts early on and, from one, Kemar Roofe had a shot blocked by Andy Considine, then had to be withdrawn. It was the latest injury setback in a hugely frustrating 18 months for the Jamaica forward. A Rangers corner opened up a chance for John Souttar, but his shot could not breach the sea of bodies in front of goal. The hosts were searching for any kind of opening and when Oludare Olufunwa could not cut out Tavernier's cross, Dessers was on hand to knock the ball through Mitov's legs. St Johnstone took another blow when Jaiyesimi saw red for catching Lundstram's ankle late, VAR upgrading the on-field decision of a yellow card. Another Dessers shot, deflected, brought Mitov into action and the goalkeeper also had to hold a fierce Kieran Dowell effort moments later, the midfielder making his first start since August. Fresh from his cup final winner against Aberdeen on Sunday, Tavernier flashed an effort wide as Saints continued to toil. Rangers continued where they left off after the break with Mitov excelling with a block on Lammers' shot from close range. Dessers tested the goalkeeper from the edge of the box, Lammers was foiled with a bouncing shot and Abdallah Sima and Tavernier were off target in quick succession. But the clincher eventually came. Substitute Scott Wright released Dessers on goal and, after he was tripped by Mitov, captain Tavernier struck confidently from 12 yards. The midfielder made a positive impact with vision and some nice touches once allowed to play higher up the pitch Losing Jaiyesimi so soon after going a goal down really limited St Johnstone's ambition and from that moment on, Rangers found the spaces they had not come across in the opening 25 minutes. Chris Kane was sent on in place of midfielder Sven Sprangler to give Saints some presence in attack and the substitute won valuable possession and the odd free-kick to take the pressure off his defensive colleagues. Rangers' third game inside seven days, with a raft of changes before and during the game, appeared to take its toll. The hosts' tempo faded against a low block and by the end there was a nervousness as the visitors occasionally moved upfield. But crucially they kept probing and eventually made the game safe. Rangers manager Philippe Clement: ""In the end it was a clear, clear dominant game where we had the ball all the time, also 11 against 11. It's not easy to break a defence of so many players in such a small space close to their goal, to break it open. We did two times and several times more but there was also a good goalkeeper. ""[Kemar Roofe is] very disappointed because he was coming back in a good way. We're going to look at that in depth."" St Johnstone manager Craig Levein: ""With us being reduced to 10 men for over an hour, to come away from here only losing two goals, the players deserve a lot of credit for that, for the work that they put in. ""[The red card] made it extremely difficult for the players out there. We were very competitive and all credit to the players for digging in and helping each other out and working so hard."" Rangers visit Motherwell on Sunday (12:00 GMT). St Johnstone's last match before Christmas is on Saturday away to Kilmarnock (15:00). BBC Sport Scottish Football SPFL"
Yield Spread Analysis,Greatest US films: Amazing facts,2024-09-14,2015-07-24,Fiona Macdonald,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150720-greatest-us-films-an-a-z-analysis,"Which Pinocchio song inspired Close Encounters of the Third Kind? And how did Buster Keaton break his neck without realising? Find out in BBC Culture’s A-Z of the stories behind the classics. A – Aliens Close Encounters of the Third Kind, number 75 Director Steven Spielberg was inspired by watching a meteor shower with his father as a child. He later recalled: “When I was a five-year-old kid in New Jersey… my dad woke me up in the middle of the night and rushed me into our car in my night clothes… He had a thermos of coffee and had brought blankets, and we drove for about half an hour. We finally pulled over to the side of the road, and there were a couple hundred people, lying on their backs in the middle of the night, looking up at the sky. My dad found a place, spread the blanket out, and we both lay down… He pointed to the sky, and there was a magnificent meteor shower.” The song When You Wish Upon a Star was a big influence on Spielberg in the film.  He referred to the score by John Williams as “When You Wish Upon a Star meets science fiction”, and wanted the song included in the closing credits. “I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me emotionally.” Star Wars, number 36 Director George Lucas was inspired to create the Wookiee character Chewbacca – a “gentle, hairy, non-English-speaking co-pilot” – after seeing his wife’s dog sitting in the passenger seat of his car. (The dog, called Indiana, provided the name for the lead character in another Lucas franchise.) The word ‘Chewbacca’ is close to the Russian word for dog, собака (sobaka). ET: The Extra-terrestrial, number 91 The film was based on Spielberg’s need for an imaginary friend after his parents’ divorce. “ET is a film that was inside me for many years,” the director has said. “ET was about the divorce of my parents, how I felt when my parents broke up. I responded by escaping into my imagination to shut down all my nerve endings crying ‘Mom, Dad, why did you break up and leave us alone?’… My wish list included having a friend who could be both the brother I never had and a father that I didn’t feel I had any more. And that’s how ET was born.” Apart from Elliott’s mother, adults are not seen from the waist up in the first half of the film, reinforcing a child’s viewpoint. B – Bombshells The icy, sophisticated blonde – personified by the stars Ingrid Bergman, Tippi Hedren and Grace Kelly – is an iconic part of the director’s style. He explained his choice in an interview with François Truffaut: “Sex on the screen should be suspenseful, I feel. If sex is too blatant or obvious, there’s no suspense. You know why I favour sophisticated blondes in my films? We’re after the drawing-room type, the real ladies, who become whores once they’re in the bedroom. Poor Marilyn Monroe had sex written all over her face.” Hitchcock favoured suspense over shock, saying: “There is no terror in the bang… only in the anticipation of it.” Vertigo, number 3 Being blonde takes on added meaning in Vertigo. When James Stewart’s character begs Kim Novak to dye her hair, she asks him: “If I let you change me, will that do it? If I let you change me … will you love me?” Psycho, number 8 Hitchcock’s penchant for blondes reveals a dark side to the director. He said in an interview: “Blondes make the best victims. They’re like virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints.” Marnie, number 47 Hitchcock wanted Grace Kelly to play the title role. The actress-turned-royal consort was forced to turn down the part after the citizens of Monaco objected to their princess playing a sexually disturbed thief: former model Tippi Hedren took her place. C – Charlie Chaplin on cocaine Modern Times, number 67 The Tramp character struggles to survive in an industrialised world – with assembly lines, factory machinery and cocaine in salt shakers. Charlie Chaplin planned Modern Times as his first ‘talkie’ but reverted to a silent format, fearing the character’s universal appeal would be damaged if he spoke. The Tramp’s voice can be heard for the first time, as he sings a song in gibberish. D – Dreams  Mulholland Drive, number 21 “The movie is a surrealist dreamscape in the form of a Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can’t stop watching it,” wrote Roger Ebert in his review of Mulholland Drive. “Nothing leads anywhere, and that’s even before the characters start to fracture and recombine like flesh caught in a kaleidoscope. Mulholland Drive isn’t like Memento, where if you watch it closely enough, you can hope to explain the mystery. There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.” Director David Lynch has said: “I don't know why people expect art to make sense when they accept the fact that life doesn't make sense.” E – Ear Blue Velvet, number 60 “Jeffrey finds an ear in a field as the clue,” Lynch told the New York Times in 1986. “I don’t know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body – a hole into something else, like a ticket to another world. The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect. Maybe a psychiatrist would have something to say about that.” F – Foreigners Casablanca, number 9 Many of the actors playing exiles were themselves refugees from war-torn Europe. According to Aljean Harmetz, who wrote The Making of Casablanca: “A dozen good actors, cast adrift, brought to a dozen small roles in Casablanca an understanding and a desperation that could never have come from Central Casting.” Just three of the credited actors were born in the US. G – Gunslingers Johnny Guitar, number 64 In his book The Films of My Life, the French New Wave director François Truffaut described how much he admired the 1954 Western. “It is dreamed, a fairytale, a hallucinatory Western… The cowboys vanish and die with the grace of ballerinas.” The Searchers, number 5 Ranked seventh in the BFI’s 2012 Sight and Sound poll, and named the greatest Western of all time by the AFI in 2008, John Ford’s epic wasn’t received as well by critics at the time. Variety’s review declared it “somewhat disappointing”. H – Hats Raiders of the Lost Ark, number 82 George Lucas created the character of Indiana Jones (originally named Indiana Smith) in 1973, but shelved the idea to work on Star Wars. Avoiding the spotlight as Star Wars opened in 1977, he went to Hawaii with Steven Spielberg, who told Vanity Fair: “I told him that I wanted to, for the second time, approach [film producer] Cubby Broccoli, who had turned me down the first time, to see if he would change his mind and hire me to do a James Bond movie. And George said, ‘I’ve got something better than that. It’s called Raiders of the Lost Ark.’ He pitched me the story, and I committed on the beach.” They based the film on the action serials of the 1930s, and made sure Indy kept his hat on in even the most hair-raising sequences. I – Idols Some Like it Hot, number 30 Marilyn Monroe’s contract stipulated that her films had to be shot in colour, but test shots of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in drag were said to be so grotesque that director Billy Wilder opted for black and white. Jerry Lewis turned down Jack Lemmon’s role, later telling Esquire: “I felt I couldn’t bring anything funny to it. The outfit was funny. I don’t need to compete with the wardrobe. So whenever Billy Wilder saw me, he said, ‘Good afternoon, schmuck, how’s it going?’ And, of course, Jack Lemmon sent me candy and roses every holiday, and the card always read: THANKS FOR BEING AN IDIOT.” North by Northwest, number 13 Cary Grant’s suit in the 1959 Hitchcock thriller was voted “the most legendary in the history of American cinema” by GQ magazine in 2006. Writer Todd McEwen even wrote a short story called Cary Grant’s Suit, telling the film from its viewpoint. J – Jungle Apocalypse Now, number 90 George Lucas was originally going to direct the 1979 war film, but turned it down after receiving the go-ahead to make Star Wars. Francis Ford Coppola stepped in, setting out to take the audience ‘through an unprecedented experience of war and have them react as much as those who had gone through the war’. The line “I love the smell of napalm in the morning” topped a 2004 poll of the best speeches in cinema history. K – Kisses It’s A Wonderful Life, number 46 This was James Stewart’s first screen kiss after returning from World War Two. To help with his nerves, director Frank Capra shot it in one take – it worked so well that Hollywood Production Code representatives demanded cuts to some of the scene, deeming it too passionate. L – Laments Sunset Boulevard, number 54 Director Billy Wilder wanted the corpse of Joe Gillis to be viewed from the pool’s bottom, but was unhappy with shots taken from a camera placed underwater in a box. In the end, the corpse’s reflection was filmed in a mirror on the bottom of the pool. M – Mobsters Mean Streets, number 93 The title was inspired by Raymond Chandler’s essay The Simple Art of Murder, which contains the line: “But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid.” N – Noir  Touch of Evil, number 51 Orson Welles’s noir won first prize at the 1958 Brussels World Fair; François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard – then critics – were on the jury. It was said to influence both – they went on to make their debut films (The 400 Blows and Breathless) in 1959 and 1960. Yet Welles had been denied the final cut, with Touch of Evil edited against his wishes. “There are scenes in the film I neither wrote nor directed, about which I know absolutely nothing,” he said in an interview for Cahiers du Cinéma. “I’ve been working since I was seventeen, I’ve directed eight films, and I’ve been able to edit only three of them myself… They always tear the film out of my hands – violently.” O – Odysseys 2001: A Space Odyssey, number 4 In a 1965 interview with Jeremy Bernstein, writer Arthur C Clarke said: “Science-fiction films have always meant monsters and sex, so we have tried to find another term for our film.” Director Stanley Kubrick argued: “About the best we have been able to come up with is a space odyssey – comparable in some ways to the Homeric Odyssey. It occurred to us that for the Greeks the vast stretches of the sea must have had the same sort of mystery and remoteness that space has for our generation.” P – Private eyes Chinatown, number 12 Director Roman Polanski was good friends with Jack Nicholson and screenwriter Robert Towne. The script for the 1974 LA noir is now considered ‘perfect’ in terms of structure, characters and dialogue. “I’ll tell you my favourite story about Roman,” said Towne in a 2009 interview. “When we started working on the re-write of Chinatown, Roman presented me with a book, a gift, called How to Write a Screenplay. He inscribed it ‘To my dear partner, with fond hope’.”  Q – QWERTY The Shining, number 62 The typewritten pages featuring ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy’ were replaced with expressions in different languages for international versions of the 1980 psychological horror. In Italian, they said ‘Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca’ – meaning ‘The morning has gold in its mouth’; in Spanish, ‘No por mucho madrugar amanece más temprano’ – ‘No matter how early you get up, you can't make the sun rise any sooner’; in French, ‘Un «Tiens» vaut mieux que deux «Tu l'auras»’ – ‘One “here you go” is worth more than two “you'll have it”’; and in German ‘Was du heute kannst besorgen, das verschiebe nicht auf morgen’ – ‘Never put off till tomorrow what may be done today’. R – Race The Birth of a Nation, number 39 The 1915 silent epic faced calls for its ban upon release, prompting a reaction from director DW Griffith. According to Roger Ebert, “stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its brutal images of blacks, Griffith tried to make amends in Intolerance (1916), which criticised prejudice. And in Broken Blossoms [1919] he told perhaps the first interracial love story in the movies – even though, to be sure, it’s an idealised love with no touching.” 12 Years a Slave, number 99 The 2013 period drama’s sweep at the Oscars meant that Steve McQueen became the first black director of a Best Picture winner. He chose a rich visual style for the film, saying: “When you think about Goya, who painted the most horrendous pictures of violence and torture and so forth, and they’re amazing, exquisite paintings, one of the reasons they’re such wonderful paintings is because what he’s saying is, ‘Look – look at this.’” S – Slapstick Sherlock Jr, number 44 Buster Keaton did most of his stunts in real time, without camera trickery: in one scene, he falls slowly from the roof of a moving train using a waterspout as counter-weight. The force of the water as the spout opened was so great that his head was knocked against a rail, giving him regular migraines. During a routine check-up years later, it emerged that he had fractured his neck doing the stunt. T – Technicolor The Wizard of Oz, number 34 “The transition from black and white (or sepia-coloured) footage for the Kansas sequences into the full Technicolor Oz scenes required some sleight of hand on set,” according to A Brief Guide to Oz. “The inside of the farmhouse was repainted in the sepia tone, and Judy Garland’s stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, went to the door, wearing a sepia version of the gingham dress. She then backed out of the frame, and Judy Garland, wearing the full-colour bright-blue dress, walked forward into the Technicolor Oz.” U – Umbrellas Singin’ in the Rain, number 7 When Gene Kelly filmed the title number, he was sick with a fever of 103 F and the director wanted to send him home. He later said: “The concept was so simple I shied away from explaining it to the brass at the studio in case I couldn't make it sound worth doing. The real work for this one was done by the technicians who had to pipe two city blocks on the backlot with overhead sprays, and the poor cameraman who had to shoot through all that water. All I had to do was dance.” V – Violins  Psycho, number 8 Composer Bernard Herrmann once told director Brian De Palma: “I remember sitting in a screening room after seeing the rough cut of Psycho. Hitch was nervously pacing back and forth, saying it was awful… ‘Wait a minute,’ I said, ‘I have some ideas. How about a score completely for strings? I used to be a violin player you know.’” According to Hitchcock’s original notes, “Through the killing, there should be the shower noise and the blows of the knife. We should hear water gurgling down the drain of the bathtub, especially when we go closer it… during the murder, the sound of the shower should be continuous and monotonous, only broken by the screams of Marion.” As Herrmann put it, “He didn't even want any music in the shower scene. Can you imagine that?” W – Weddings  The Godfather, number 2 Francis Ford Coppola took on The Godfather after 12 directors had turned it down; he described it as a ‘nightmarish experience’. “When it was all over I wasn’t at all confident … that I’d ever get another job,” he told an interviewer. X – Xanadu Citizen Kane, number 1 Orson Welles studied John Ford’s Stagecoach before he started shooting his debut film Citizen Kane. “As it turned out, the first day I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director,” he told Peter Bogdanovich in This is Orson Welles. “I’d learned whatever I knew in the projection room – from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I’d run Stagecoach… and ask questions. ‘How was this done? Why was this done?’ It was like going to school.” Y – Years with most films in the top 100: 1970s  Taxi Driver, number 19 Screenwriter Paul Schrader has revealed how his own state of mind bled into the script: “At the time I wrote it I was very enamoured of guns, I was very suicidal, I was drinking heavily, I was obsessed with pornography in the way a lonely person is, and all those elements are upfront in the script,” he says in Schrader on Schrader. “The most memorable piece of dialogue in the film is an improvisation: the ‘Are you looking at me?’ part. In the script it just says, ‘Travis speaks to himself in the mirror’. Bobby asked me what he would say and I said, well, he's a little kid playing with guns and acting tough. So De Niro used this rap that an underground New York comedian had been using at the time as the basis for his lines.” Z – Zombies Night of the Living Dead, number 85 Director George A Romero has revealed how his walking dead differed from zombies that had appeared on screen before his 1968 horror classic. “I didn’t call them zombies in Night of the Living Dead, and I didn’t think they were. Because in those films, the traditional Haitian voodoo zombie is not dead. And I thought I was doing something completely new by having the dead rise. The recently dead. They’re too weak to dig themselves out of graves. They’re too weak to eat brains, because they’ll never crack the skull. I have these sort of rules that I use, that everyone seems to have gone away from.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."

Assisted suicide will become a conventional procedure. “Everyone will be familiar with the anthropology of death and dying. ‘Our Deaths, Ourselves’ will be a bestseller.” Psychology The real roots of midlife crisis  Jonathan Rauch | Atlantic | 17 November 2014 Forty-six is the saddest age. “You look at your life and think, Is this all?” But stick around. Don’t do anything drastic. Things will improve. “About 10 years later you look at your life again and think, ‘Actually, this is pretty good’.” Life has a U-bend in the middle; and on the far side of it we learn to be happy again by accepting our limitations and setting more realistic goals for ourselves. We become wiser.

His method was not so much to solve problems as to discover what possibilities they contained: “Once you figure out how general it is, the explanation will stare you in the face”. He was “the messiah of zooming out”.

Yield Spread Analysis,Will AI speed up discovery of a coronavirus cure?,2024-09-14,2020-04-17,By Jane Wakefield,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52120747,"It feels as if a superhuman effort is needed to help ease the global pandemic killing so many. Artificial intelligence may have been hyped - but when it comes to medicine, it already has a proven track record. So can machine learning rise to this challenge of finding a cure for this terrible disease? There is no shortage of companies trying to solve the dilemma. Oxford-based Exscientia, the first to put an AI-discovered drug into human trial, is trawling through 15,000 drugs held by the Scripps research institute, in California. And Healx, a Cambridge company set up by Viagra co-inventor Dr David Brown, has repurposed its AI system developed to find drugs for rare diseases. The system is divided into three parts that: Drug discovery has traditionally been slow.  ""I have been doing this for 45 years and I have got three drugs to market,"" Dr Brown told BBC News. But AI is proving much faster. ""It has taken several weeks to gather all the data we need and we have even got new information in the last few days, so we are now at a critical mass,"" Dr Brown said. ""The algorithms ran over Easter and we will have output for the three methods in the next seven days."" Healx hopes to turn that information into a list of drug candidates by May and is already in talks with labs to take those predictions into clinical trials. For those working in the field of AI drug discovery, there are two options when it comes to coronavirus: But, Dr Brown said, it was extremely unlikely one single drug would be the answer. And for Healx, that means detailed analysis of the eight million possible pairs and 10.5 billion triple-drug combinations stemming from the 4,000 approved drugs on the market. Prof Ara Darzi, director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation, at Imperial College, told BBC News: ""AI remains one of our strongest paths to achieve a perceptible solution but there is a fundamental need for high quality, large and clean data sets. ""To date, much of this information has been siloed in individual companies such as big pharma or lost in the intellectual property and old lab space within universities. ""Now more than ever there, is a need to unify these disparate drug discovery data sources to allow AI researchers to apply their novel machine-learning techniques to generate new treatments for Covid-19 as soon as possible."" In the US, a partnership between Northeastern University's Barabasi Labs, Harvard Medical School, the Network Science Institute and biotech start-up Scipher Medicine is also on the search for drugs that can quickly be repurposed as Covid-19 treatments. Normally, just getting them all to work together would take ""a year of paperwork"", said Scipher's chief executive Alif Saleh. But a series of Zoom calls with a ""group of people with a unprecedented determination to get things done, not to mention a lot of time of their hands"", speeded things up. ""The last three weeks would normally take half a year. Everyone dropped everything,"" he said. Already, their research has yielded surprising results, including: Scipher Medicine combines AI with something it calls network medicine - a method that views a disease via the complex interactions among molecular components. ""A disease phenotype is rarely due to malfunction of one gene or protein on its own - nature is not that simple - but the result of a cascading effect in a network of interactions between several proteins,"" Mr Saleh said. Using network medicine, AI and a fusion of the two has led the consortium to identify 81 potential drugs that could help. ""AI can do a little better, not only looking at higher order correlations but little bits of independent information that traditional network medicine might miss,"" said Prof Albert-Laszlo Barabasi. But AI alone would not have worked, they needed all three approaches.  ""Different tools look at different perspectives but together are very powerful"" he added. Some AI companies are already claiming to have isolated drugs that could help. BenevolentAI has identified Baricitinib, a drug already approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as a potential treatment to prevent the virus infecting lung cells.  And it has now entered a controlled trial with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Meanwhile, scientists from South Korea and the US using deep learning to investigate the potential for commercially available antiviral drugs have suggested atazanavir, used to treat Aids, could be a good candidate. Other companies are using AI for other purposes, such as analysing scans to ease the burden on radiologists and help predict which patients are most likely to need a ventilator. Chinese technology giant Alibaba, for example, announced an algorithm it says can diagnose cases within 20 seconds, with 96% accuracy. But some experts warn AI systems are likely to have been trained on data about advanced infections, making them less effective at detecting early signs of the virus.  There needed to be a global effort from policymakers to persuade the big pharmaceutical companies to join forces with smaller drug-data stores, academics and research charities to pool data resources, Prof Darzi said. ""The time has never been more important for drug-discovery data to open up its secrets for AI to help in the battle against Covid-19,"" he said."

This video can not be played Baker inspire Rhythmic gymnastics provides one of the most finely tuned spectacles of the Olympic programme and a true demonstration of athletic prowess matched with timing and poise. Like synchronised swimming, rhythmic gymnastics is only contested by women. It uses many positions and leaps derived from classical ballet, including pliés, jetés, attitudes and arabesques. Gymnastics requires strength, mobility, endurance, flexibility, body control and coordination.  The high level of physical fitness needed to excel helps encourage a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity and eating a well-balanced diet. The wide range of movements involved works every muscle in the body and burns approximately 315 calories per hour. A University of Athens study found rhythmic gymnastics can help athletes develop strong, healthy bones and joints as it is a weight-bearing activity. This reduces the risk of developing osteoporosis later on in life.  As falling and rolling are key parts of gymnastics training, athletes learn how to spread the force of impacts across their whole body. This can help with injury prevention in sport and other situations. Gymnastics is a breathtaking sport featuring a range of disciplines such as artistic, trampoline, acrobatics, aerobics and tumbling.  It is enjoyed by an estimated four million people in the United Kingdom.  Rhythmic's combination of the flexibility of gymnastics, the technical knowledge of ballet and the expression of modern dance makes it a unique activity.

More on the British Gymnastics website, external Rhythmic gymnastics developed in eastern Europe during the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Elements from Swedish exercise routines and German muscle-building techniques were incorporated during the early days of the sport's evolution.  When it moved onto the radar of gymnastics' governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), in the middle of the 20th Century, its devotees were calling it ""modern gymnastics"". The FIG recognised rhythmic gymnastics as an official discipline in 1962 and the first World Championships were held in 1964.  That first title was won by Ludmila Savinkova of the Soviet Union. Its Olympic debut came at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles and the team event was introduced 12 years later in Atlanta, with Spain taking gold. In 1984, the venue's air conditioning played havoc with the ribbon routine, allowing rank outsider Lori Fung of Canada to win gold.

Yield Spread Analysis,Track and trace system in place from June - PM,2024-09-14,2020-05-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52741331,"The PM says England will have a ""world-beating"" tracing system from June, as he was accused of leaving a ""huge hole"" in the country's coronavirus defences. Boris Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said it was unlikely to be a ""fully-functioning perfect system"" by then. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM over the absence of a tracing system since March. Contact tracing is a system used to slow the spread of infectious diseases like coronavirus, and is already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. One method involves the infected person listing all the people with whom they have had prolonged and recent contact, to be tracked down by phone or email. Another uses a location-tracking mobile app, which identifies people the patient has been in contact with. The NHS contact tracing app - which is currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight and was initially meant to be launched across England in mid-May - will be rolled out at a later date, No 10 suggested. Northern Ireland already has a telephone contact tracing system in place, while the Scottish government is currently trialling one. The Welsh government wants its ""test, trace, protect"" programme operational by the end of May. It comes as the number of people who died after testing positive for the virus increased by 363 to 35,704, the government said on Wednesday. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir asked why there had been ""no effective"" attempt to trace the contacts of those infected with Covid-19 since 12 March ""when tracing was abandoned"". Mr Johnson replied: ""We have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place by June 1."" He added that 24,000 contact tracers had already been recruited. The 1 June deadline will also mark the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. The government's deputy chief scientific adviser Prof Dame Angela McLean previously said an effective system for tracing new coronavirus cases needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed.  Do not expect a fully-functioning perfect track-and-trace system to be up-and-running by 1 June. What will be launched will effectively be a prototype. The app may not be ready by that point, but the army of contract tracers will be available. Given where we are today (and plenty argue mistakes have been made, which means we are in a weaker position than we should be) this is perhaps understandable.  The government does not have the luxury of testing and piloting this behind the scenes for months to come. So, the system will have to evolve as it goes.  The question is whether it will be robust enough to provide a track-and-trace service that will work on a basic level and help contain local outbreaks, which of course is vital as we gradually move out of lockdown. The prime minister's assertion that it will be able to deal with 10,000 new cases a day is interesting. It sounds a lot. The daily figures suggest there are only a few thousand positive cases a day. But remember those figures have not been capturing all the infections - until this week when testing was extended to all over-fives eligibility was quite restricted. However, surveillance data provided by the Office for National Statistics suggests we may well be seeing around that number. The work that has been done so far is about to be put to the test. The PM also insisted that the UK was now testing more than ""virtually every country in Europe"", and promised that the system would be stepped up in the next fortnight. Leading scientist Prof Hugh Pennington said the pledge was ""good news"" as it was ""essential if we're going to go anywhere near getting out of lockdown, opening schools"". ""It's taken a long time. As to world-beating, well we've been beaten by quite a few other countries by having such a system running."" He added that contact tracing was ""really very labour-intensive work"". Also at PMQs, Sir Keir queried whether people were being tested in care homes, after the boss of a body representing care homes in England said on Tuesday that there were problems. Mr Johnson said 125,000 care home staff have been tested and that the government was ""absolutely confident"" it would be able to increase testing in care homes and ""across the whole of the community"".  He added: ""And thanks to the hard work of [Health Secretary Matt Hancock] and his teams, we will get up to 200,000 tests in the country by the end of this month."" It comes as the prime minister said the deaths of 181 NHS workers and 131 social care workers had reportedly involved Covid-19. In other developments: "
Yield Spread Analysis,ESL a 'closed chapter' says Guardiola after win,2024-09-14,2021-04-20,Michael Emons,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56741406,"Only Kevin De Bruyne (24) has been directly involved in more goals in all competitions for Manchester City this season than Phil Foden (23 - 14 goals, nine assists) Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said the failed European Super League (ESL) was a ""closed chapter"" after his side beat Aston Villa to move closer to becoming Premier League champions. City were one of 12 clubs to sign up to the breakaway ESL on Sunday, but withdrew on Tuesday after widespread criticism of the proposals, which would have seen no promotion or relegation and a split in English football. ""As a club we accept and learn and focus on the reason why we're here,"" said Guardiola, whose side need eight points from five matches to become English champions for the third time in four seasons. ""It's a chapter which is over, a closed chapter. They [the owners] don't need to apologise [to me], I know them, I know how they are."" City's win leaves them 11 points clear of Manchester United with Guardiola saying his side were ""so close"" to the title. However, they had a scare when centre-half John Stones was sent off just before the break for a knee-high challenge on Jacob Ramsey. But Villa wasted the man advantage when Matty Cash was dismissed 11 minutes into the second half following two bookings in the space of three minutes.  The hosts had earlier gone ahead after only 20 seconds as John McGinn guided a shot past Ederson following Ollie Watkins' low cross. The impressive Phil Foden finished off a fine City team move to equalise before Rodri headed what proved to be the winner following Bernardo Silva's cross. City led 2-1 when they went down to 10 men, but Villa could not capitalise on the extra player and then offered little threat when it was 10-a-side. Relive Aston Villa v Manchester City as it happened, plus reaction and analysis Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast This video can not be played 'We are so close to title' - Guardiola on Man City's win over Aston Villa Stones has been in fine form this season, making more Premier League appearances than he managed in 2019-20, with his performances earning an England recall after 16 months out of the national side. However, with Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate in the stands, it was an evening to forget for the 26-year-old. He was caught out in the first few seconds of the match when he failed to collect a long ball from England team-mate Tyrone Mings, enabling Watkins to set up McGinn for the joint quickest Premier League goal of the season. Stones was then shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge on Ramsey near the halfway line and in front of the two dugouts. After a check by the video assistant referee Jarred Gillett, on-field referee Peter Banks watched the incident on a pitchside monitor and showed the red card to Stones, although Guardiola was unhappy with the decision and remonstrated with the officials. Stones will be suspended for Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley as City, who are also in the Champions League semi-finals, aim to pick up the first of a potential three trophies this season. With a man advantage, Villa's Douglas Luiz curled a 25-yard effort straight at Ederson but the match swung back in City's favour following two Cash challenges on Foden, the second of which was a sliding challenge that wiped out the England midfielder close to the touchline. From then on City were able to dominate possession and now only need three more league wins to become English champions for the seventh time in their history. This video can not be played MOTD analysis: How ‘sensational’ Phil Foden is changing games for Man City The build-up to the match at Villa Park had been dominated by talk of the European Super League. City were one of six English teams - along with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham - to join three sides from Spain and three from Italy in the proposed new closed competition. However, Sunday's announcement, brought widespread criticism and anger from fans, managers, other clubs and politicians, with Guardiola himself saying football ""is not a sport if success is guaranteed or if it doesn't matter when you lose"". City were one of the first to announce their withdrawal from the ESL on Tuesday evening and there was no repeat of the protests that had seen angry fans demonstrating before Liverpool's match at Leeds on Monday, Chelsea's home game versus Brighton on Tuesday and Tottenham's encounter with Southampton earlier on Wednesday. This was a game that again highlighted the exciting and thrilling nature of the Premier League and City's play after going a goal behind was a joy to watch. Their equaliser started with goalkeeper Ederson knocking a fine 50-yard ball to the left wing where Olexandr Zinchenko played it to the superb Foden. The 20-year-old drilled a low pass to Riyad Mahrez and the Algerian released the overlapping Silva on the right flank and his pull-back was steered into the net by Foden. The second goal was another well-worked one as Rodri powerfully headed in from another Silva assist. Not only have City scored the most goals in the Premier League, they also have the best defensive record and successfully managed to stifle Villa in the second half to take a big step towards another title. After the match, City boss Pep Guardiola said of Foden: ""This guy is growing. His influence in our games is massive. He's becoming a serious player. ""Phil right now is becoming such an important player. His influence in the final third is so important."" Aston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""We made a great start. It was something we had spoken about. We have one of the best players in the league who can run in behind the oppositions defence in the shape of Ollie Watkins. ""We defended reasonably well. It was probably the manner of the goals we conceded that was most disappointing. Cashy will learn from that. The second [booking] was stupid and reckless. ""Some of Manchester City's play play was outstanding. They schooled us at times. ""I've been involved in professional football for 34 years and I haven't seen football come together like it has this week. That shows you how outraged people were at the [ESL] plans."" This video can not be played Aston Villa 1-2 Man City: Dean Smith says his side were 'schooled' by Manchester City Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""Not the start I dreamt of but we reacted very well, we played so good with and without the ball. Ten against 11, we reacted well, we played so good."" On John Stones' red card: ""He's late but the intention to kick him is not there, he wouldn't go there with intention, he's not aggressive with the feet, he's just late. It's tough, playing a lot of minutes, good learning for him. Even with 10 men we played good, when we had the ball we played good."" On distraction of Super League: ""After that game it doesn't look like it did distract us, we were focused, of course everyone was concerned, but the players were focused on this game. We are so close. Cup final and Champions League and then Crystal Palace."" Manchester City have won each of their last 10 Premier League away games, becoming the first team to win 10 in a row on the road in the competition on more than one occasion (won 11 in a row between May-December 2017).  Aston Villa boss Dean Smith has lost all five games against Man City during his managerial career - the most games he has managed against a single opponent losing 100% of those matches. Villa have lost nine of their last 11 Premier League games against the league leaders, with those defeats coming by an aggregate score of 24-6.  City won a Premier League game having conceded the first goal for the first time since December 2019 versus Leicester (3-1), ending a run of 10 games without a win when conceding first (drew three, lost seven). City's Bernardo Silva has provided more Premier League assists in 2021 than any other player so far in this period (six - twice as many as the Portuguese assisted throughout 2020 in the top-flight (three).  City's John Stones was been sent off for the first time in his Premier League career, in what was his 182nd appearance in the competition. It was only the sixth foul he had conceded in the league in 20 games this season. No player has scored more goals in all competitions before turning 21 for Pep Guardiola than Manchester City's Phil Foden (29 - level with Bojan).  Villa's John McGinn's goal after 20 seconds was the second quickest goal Manchester City have conceded in Premier League history, after Alan Shearer's for Newcastle United after 10 seconds in January 2003.

Yield Spread Analysis,How science is making chocolate taste even better,2024-09-14,2022-07-07,By Katherine Latham,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61511456,"Luisa Vicinanza-Bedi is an artisan chocolate maker in Nottingham and founder of Luisa's Vegan Chocolates. ""I've always had a love for chocolate, but when I discovered all the tastes and nuances of single-origin chocolate - the incredible flavour notes, like a fine wine - my eyes were opened,"" she says. Much of the chocolate we eat will be made from cocoa blended from a number of farms, areas, or even countries. But Ms Vicinanza-Bedi argues that using a single bean variety, from a single farm, gives the chocolate a unique flavour. ""We trade directly with our farmers and quality check the beans,"" she says. ""We do a cut test, weight test, moisture analysis, aroma test and pilot line taste."" ""If you think about wine or coffee, it's the same. The flavours come from the terrain, climate and soils from different parts of the world. They all taste mind-blowingly different."" Scientists are trying to analyse where those special flavours come from, so they can be reproduced more consistently. Prof Irene Chetschik heads up the Research Group for Food Chemistry at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW).  She is developing new technological processes that can impact cocoa flavour on a molecular level - to get the best out of each harvest and create consistent quality. ""Now there is more appreciation for the product - we know where the bean is coming from, which farm, which variety - we can experience a much wider flavour diversity,"" she says. Traditionally, cocoa beans are fermented on the farm where they were grown. The cocoa pods are harvested and split. The pulp-covered beans are piled or stored in baskets, covered with banana or plantain leaves, and left to heat up in the sun.  Microbes present in the environment degrade the pulp surrounding the beans.  Next, the beans are dried, spread out on mats in the sun.  ""Fermentation results in a lot of quality differences. Not every fermentation works out well,"" says Prof Chetschik. Poorly fermented cocoa beans develop little flavour, while over-fermented beans produce an acidic taste.  ""Moist incubation"" is a new fermenting technique, developed by Prof Chetschik and her team, in which cocoa beans are dried, then a lactic acid solution containing ethanol is applied.  ""This triggers the same reactions within the beans, but is far easier to control,"" she says. The resulting taste, she says, is sweeter, richer and fruitier. Johannes Ansgar Schlüter, PhD student at ZHAW, adds: ""The process provides a way to control key flavour attributes of cocoa. At the same time, undesirable aroma components are not formed to the same extent as during traditional fermentations."" Better understanding of the fermentation process could help struggling farmers.  About 95% of cocoa is grown on small, family-run farms, employing around six million cocoa farmers worldwide. With low yield and little power, increasing profits in the sector do not reach cocoa farmers and many farmers live in chronic poverty. ""The cocoa value chain remains unequally divided,"" says Joke Aerts, from Dutch bean-to-bar chocolate company, Tony's Chocolonely.  ""A few big companies make huge profits, while millions of smallholder cocoa farmers are underpaid."" This drives demand for cheap labour and exploitation. ""It has been over 20 years since the big chocolate companies pledged to eliminate child labour in cocoa but not much has changed,"" says Ms Aerts. ""The prioritisation of company profits over human rights needs to stop now."" Cocoa farmers are susceptible to changing weather patterns too.  According to Fairtrade International, land suitable for cocoa production will decrease significantly in the near future, as a result of climate change.  Experts say understanding the fermentation process is also vital when it comes to considering the impact of climate change on the business.  ""[We get] a lot of rain, a lot of humidity. It is not good for the plantations,"" says cocoa farmer Carmen Magali Eraso Adarme. Ms Adarme's cocoa plantation in Huila, Colombia, is set on extremely steep land. Access is difficult and dangerous, especially when carrying heavy sacks of beans on their backs. Ms Adarme is working with Luisa's Vegan Chocolates and Nottingham University on a project that aims to get a better flavour - and price - from their beans.  Using hand-held DNA sequencing devices, researchers and farmers can analyse the microbes fermenting Ms Adarme's cocoa beans.  With improved understanding of what drives the taste of premium chocolate, fermentation can be manipulated for improved flavour. Ms Vicinanza-Bedi says: ""We have used DNA sequencing to confirm exactly what is a 'good flavour' of a cocoa bean. Then, using this data, we teach farmers what they can do to maximise their cocoa for the premium market."" Ms Adarme's harvested beans were shipped to Luisa's Vegan Chocolates, where they were made into single origin bars.  The resulting increase in profits has allowed Ms Adarme to send her son to college and for her to learn English. Next, she hopes to improve the transportation part of the business - making her work easier and safer.  Dr David Goupaulchan, international research fellow at the University of Nottingham, says: ""Growing cocoa is a very risky business. Yields can vary greatly from year-to-year depending on weather conditions, pests and diseases."" More technology of business: Dr Goupaulchan has been studying the microbes present during fermentation, how the environment affects their growth dynamics, and the role they play in flavour development. His research will be highlighted in the Royal Society Summer Exhibition later this year. ""The fermentation process has a huge impact on cocoa quality and taste,"" he explains. ""However, these processes are still very uncontrolled. This results in wide variability in quality between farms."" A better understanding of the process, he explains, would result in better chocolates for consumers and better prices for farmers. ""My hope is that we can use science to modernise and rejuvenate the cocoa industry, and to create sustainable livelihoods for all,"" he says. Back in Switzerland Prof Chetschik aims to get the best out of the raw material, so that after fermentation the cocoa needs less processing or any additives. ""Cocoa is extremely flavourful. There are so many flavour-active molecules, there is no need at all to add anything,"" she says."
Yield Spread Analysis,US auction theorists win Nobel Economics Prize,2024-09-14,2020-10-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54509051,"Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson have won the 2020 Nobel Economics Prize for their work on auction theory. The Stanford University game theorists have helped in developing formats for the sale of aircraft landing slots, radio spectrums, and emissions trading. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said their work ""benefitted sellers, buyers and taxpayers"" worldwide. Game theory uses mathematics to study decision-making, conflict, and strategy in social situations. ""This year's laureates in economic sciences started out with fundamental theory and later used their results in practical applications, which have spread globally. Their discoveries are of great benefit to society,"" said Peter Fredriksson, chair of the prize committee. Prof Wilson developed a theory for auctions where the value of the object on the block is uncertain beforehand but ends up being the same for everyone - for example, the value of radio frequencies, or the volume of a mineral in a particular area. He also developed a theory as to why rational bidders tend to place maximum bids that are below what they estimate the actual value of the object to be: they are worried about the so-called ""winner's curse"" - overpaying to win the auction. Prof Milgrom put together a theory which takes into account not only auctions where the object turns out to have the same value for all the bidders, but also for auctions where the object is valued differently by different bidders. He demonstrated that the seller should get a higher revenue when bidders learn more about each other's estimated values during bidding. Most of us don't buy art or livestock. Nor do we buy our fresh fish or fruit and veg at auction.  Rather more of us might occasionally buy or sell some modestly valued furniture or ornaments that way, and perhaps more still make use of online auction sites. But the committee at the Swedish Central Bank which awards the prize says that auctions affect all of us at every level. The wholesale electricity market, radio frequencies for telecommunications, emissions allowances and much more are allocated using auctions in at least some countries. For a private seller the ideal auction is one that gets the highest price. For a public sector agency, getting revenue does matter but there can be other considerations, for example seeking to have radio frequencies allocated in a way that gives the most benefit to society as a whole. Auctions are often complicated by uncertainty - how much will you get out of an oilfield, or how much will people use a mobile phone service. The work of Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson, and many others, explores these issues with a view to designing auctions to get the best results. However, the award was criticised by one charity which said that economics was out of touch with global problems, including the impact of coronavirus. The Rethinking Economics charity, which pushes for a broader application of economics, said it was ""disappointing"" that the prize had gone to ""two white men from the global north working on auction theory"". Catriona Watson, co-director of Rethinking Economics said: ""The discipline of economics is depressingly out of touch. ""The Nobel Prize as a marker of excellence in the field needs to become reflective of our global community and address the most pressing issues of our time like the climate crisis, the pandemic or structural racial injustice -  otherwise it risks becoming increasingly irrelevant."" The prize has been won in the past by economists including Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman, and last year was won by poverty-fighting couple Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. But Ms Watson said that this year the award was ""back to business as usual"". The prize, worth 10m Swedish crowns (£887,000), is not one of the original five Nobel awards created in the 1895 will of industrialist and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, but was established by Sweden's central bank and first awarded in 1969."
Yield Spread Analysis,Ukraine seeks meeting with Russia within 48 hours,2024-09-14,2022-02-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60370541,"Ukraine has called for a meeting with Russia and other members of a key European security group over the escalating tensions on its border. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had ignored formal requests to explain the build-up of troops.  He said the next step was requesting a meeting within the next 48 hours for transparency about Russia's plans. Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine despite the build-up of some 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine's borders. But with the US saying Moscow could begin with aerial bombardments ""at any time"" more than a dozen nations have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine. Ukraine's ambassador in London, Vadym Prystaiko, has backtracked on comments he made to the BBC in which he said Ukraine was willing to be ""flexible"" on its ambition to join Nato, which would have been be a major concession to Russia.  But in a subsequent interview he said that Ukraine had a constitutional commitment to join Nato and it depended on the ""readiness of Nato itself"" whether Ukraine would be admitted.  British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the UK would support whatever Ukraine decided to do.  Ukraine has made a request via the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) for Russia to explain its build-up of troops. Under the Vienna Document, of which Russia is party to, OSCE members can ask for information on a member's military activities.  ""If Russia is serious when it talks about the indivisibility of security in the OSCE space, it must fulfil its commitment to military transparency in order to de-escalate tensions and enhance security for all,"" Mr Kuleba said.  However, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who criticised the ""panic"" that could spread from such claims, said he had seen no proof that Russia was planning an invasion in the coming days. On Sunday, he spoke for nearly an hour by phone with US President Joe Biden. The White House said President Biden had reiterated US support for Ukraine, and that both leaders had agreed on ""the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence"". Ukraine's statement of the call said its president had thanked the US for its ""unwavering support"" and that, at the end, President Zelensky had invited the US leader to come to Ukraine. There has been no comment on the invite from the White House. An hour-long call between President Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin the day before failed to yield a breakthrough.  In the latest attempt to find a diplomatic solution, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has meetings scheduled with President Zelensky in Kyiv later on Monday and with President Putin in Moscow on Tuesday.  The chancellor, who took over the leadership of Germany from Angela Merkel in December, has warned of severe economic consequences for Russia if it should launch any invasion, echoing statements by other Western nations and members of the Nato military alliance. But Berlin officials have downplayed any expectation of a breakthrough.  Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to hold fresh diplomatic talks across Europe to bring Russia ""back from the brink"" of war. In Washington, President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said an invasion could begin ""any day now"". Mr Sullivan said the US is closely monitoring for a potential ""false flag"" operation by Moscow as a pretext for a full-scale invasion so it can claim it is responding to Ukrainian aggression. Russia contends that its build-up of troops along the Ukraine border is its own concern, within its own territory. On Sunday, senior foreign policy official Yuri Ushakov characterised the US warnings of imminent invasion as ""hysteria has reached its peak""."
Yield Spread Analysis,Tokyo 2020 Olympics postponed until 2021,2024-09-14,2020-03-24,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/52020134,"The Olympic Games were due to run from 24 July to 9 August The Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games have been postponed until next year because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The event, due to begin on 24 July, will now take place ""no later than summer 2021"". ""I proposed to postpone for a year and [IOC] president Thomas Bach responded with 100% agreement,"" said Shinzo Abe, Japan's Prime Minister. The event will still be called Tokyo 2020 despite taking place in 2021. In a joint statement, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 and the IOC said: ""The unprecedented and unpredictable spread of the outbreak has seen the situation in the rest of the world deteriorating. ""On Monday, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the Covid-19 pandemic is 'accelerating'. ""There are more than 375,000 cases now recorded worldwide and in nearly every country, and their number is growing by the hour. ""In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today [Tuesday], the IOC president and the prime minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community."" 'Tokyo Olympics will be a carnival unleashed that no-one will take for granted ever again' 'Heartbreaking' but a 'relief' - how athletes reacted to Olympic delay GB Paralympians praise decision to delay Tokyo Games 'This is about protecting lives' - IOC chief says costs of Tokyo 2020 delay not discussed The Inside Track podcast: Tokyo 2020 is postponed While the Games is the biggest sporting event to be affected by the pandemic, there has been a huge impact on a host of other major tournaments and sports: In rugby union, the end of this year's Six Nations was postponed, with four outstanding fixtures to be rearranged in the men's tournament. In football, Euro 2020 was postponed and will be played in the summer of 2021, while the sport is suspended in the UK until 30 April at the earliest. The first eight grands prix of the Formula 1 season have been delayed, with the Monaco Grand Prix cancelled. County cricket in England and Wales will not be played before 28 May, while England's three-Test series against West Indies, due to start at The Oval on 4 June, is in doubt. All forms of professional tennis have been postponed until 7 June, ruling out the clay-court season, while the French Open - the year's second Grand Slam, has been rescheduled for September. Golf's Masters and PGA Championship have both been postponed, with a decision yet to be made about September's Ryder Cup. The London Marathon has been moved from 26 April to 4 October. The IOC had given itself a deadline of four weeks to consider delaying the Games but there had been mounting pressure from a host of Olympic committees and athletes demanding a quicker decision. Canada became the first major country to withdraw from both events on Sunday, while USA Track and Field, athletics' US governing body, had also called for a postponement. The Paralympics were due to start on 25 August but International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said the postponement was ""the only logical option"". He added: ""The health and wellbeing of human life must always be our number-one priority and staging a sporting event of any kind during this pandemic is simply not possible. ""Sport is not the most important thing right now, preserving human life is. It is essential, therefore, that all steps are taken to try to limit the spread of this disease. ""By taking this decision now, everyone involved in the Paralympic movement, including all Para-athletes, can fully focus on their own health and wellbeing and staying safe during this unprecedented and difficult time."" World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""The athletes have been under intolerable conditions, many of them are unable to train and many have been going through real emotional turmoil.  ""The integrity of competition would have been seriously compromised if we had tried to force the Games into the remaining part of this year."" Coe, who was chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, said World Athletics was looking at moving the 2021 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, to 2022. The Olympics have never been delayed in their 124-year modern history, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during World War One and World War Two. Major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles summer Games in 1980 and 1984. The Tokyo 2020-IOC statement continued: ""The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present. ""Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020."" British Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson said: ""It would have been unthinkable for us to continue to prepare for an Olympic Games at a time the nation and the world no less is enduring great hardship. A postponement is the right decision."" British Paralympics Association chief executive Mike Sharrock said: ""Stemming this global public health crisis and doing everything possible to safeguard the health and wellbeing of people should clearly take priority in these unprecedented times.   ""We welcome the clarity this now gives Paralympic athletes throughout the world who have had their training and qualification plans severely disrupted."" On 22 January, Olympic qualifying events in boxing and women's football that were due to be held in Wuhan, China - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - became the first to be moved or postponed. There have now been almost 400,000 recorded cases of the virus worldwide, with the number of deaths approaching 17,000. How coronavirus has impacted sporting events around the world The latest news on the coronavirus crisis Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This is arguably the biggest decision sport has seen in peacetime. It has looked inevitable for weeks, and many will ask why it has taken until now. With athletes unable to train safely, and the calendar of Olympic and Paralympic qualification events decimated amid travel restrictions and lockdowns, a postponement or cancellation emerged as the only viable options. Faced with the unenviable task of reorganising a sprawling mega-event that has already cost at least £10bn in preparations, the IOC and Japan had hoped to buy themselves some time to consider their next step. But with Olympic committees and athletes increasingly frustrated and confused at what some saw as delaying tactics, the decision was effectively taken out of the organisers' hands, and just 48 hours after the IOC said it was giving itself four weeks to mull it over, we now know the Games cannot go on as planned. The ramifications will be significant. It's a huge blow to Japan, and the country will now have to spend yet more money. Commercial contracts will have to be unpicked and the availability of venues revisited. A crowded sporting calendar will have to be flexible. And the IOC, sports federations, broadcasters, sponsors and a myriad of other related businesses will have to wait an additional year for the financial bonanza that the event generates.  The Games has had to deal with many challenges over the years, from terrorism and boycotts to war and doping. But nothing quite like this. Olympians Alistair Brownlee, double Olympic triathlon champion: ""Evidently a very tough decision for the IOC and other stakeholders to make but in my opinion the right one. Both, for the message it sends to people around the world battling with the virus and to give clarity to athletes attempting to prepare."" Jazmin Sawyers, long jumper: ""The right choice. For now we have to stay home to protect ourselves and everyone else. Look after each other, sport will be here when this is over, and we will be ready to give you all the greatest show on earth."" Callum Skinner, retired cycling team sprint Olympic champion, who fronts competitor-led movement Global Athlete: ""The right decision has been made. Tokyo 2021 presents an amazing opportunity to host a full Games celebrating the world (hopefully) entering the ""post-pandemic"" phase.""

Yield Spread Analysis,What happens after we die?,2024-09-14,2015-05-08,Moheb Costandi,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150508-what-happens-after-we-die,"The breakdown of our bodies after death can be fascinating – if you dare to delve into the details. Mo Costandi investigates. “It might take a little bit of force to break this up,” says mortician Holly Williams, lifting John’s arm and gently bending it at the fingers, elbow and wrist. “Usually, the fresher a body is, the easier it is for me to work on.” Williams speaks softly and has a happy-go-lucky demeanour that belies the nature of her work. Raised and now employed at a family-run funeral home in north Texas, she has seen and handled dead bodies on an almost daily basis since childhood. Now 28 years old, she estimates that she has worked on something like 1,000 bodies. Her work involves collecting recently deceased bodies from the Dallas–Fort Worth area and preparing them for their funeral. “Most of the people we pick up die in nursing homes,” says Williams, “but sometimes we get people who died of gunshot wounds or in a car wreck. We might get a call to pick up someone who died alone and wasn’t found for days or weeks, and they’ll already be decomposing, which makes my work much harder.” John had been dead about four hours before his body was brought into the funeral home. He had been relatively healthy for most of his life. He had worked his whole life on the Texas oil fields, a job that kept him physically active and in pretty good shape. He had stopped smoking decades earlier and drank alcohol moderately. Then, one cold January morning, he suffered a massive heart attack at home (apparently triggered by other, unknown, complications), fell to the floor, and died almost immediately. He was just 57. Now, John lay on Williams’ metal table, his body wrapped in a white linen sheet, cold and stiff to the touch, his skin purplish-grey – tell-tale signs that the early stages of decomposition were well under way. Self-digestionFar from being ‘dead’, a rotting corpse is teeming with life. A growing number of scientists view a rotting corpse as the cornerstone of a vast and complex ecosystem, which emerges soon after death and flourishes and evolves as decomposition proceeds.Decomposition begins several minutes after death with a process called autolysis, or self-digestion. Soon after the heart stops beating, cells become deprived of oxygen, and their acidity increases as the toxic by-products of chemical reactions begin to accumulate inside them. Enzymes start to digest cell membranes and then leak out as the cells break down. This usually begins in the liver, which is rich in enzymes, and in the brain, which has high water content. Eventually, though, all other tissues and organs begin to break down in this way. Damaged blood cells begin to spill out of broken vessels and, aided by gravity, settle in the capillaries and small veins, discolouring the skin.Body temperature also begins to drop, until it has acclimatised to its surroundings. Then, rigor mortis – “the stiffness of death” – sets in, starting in the eyelids, jaw and neck muscles, before working its way into the trunk and then the limbs. In life, muscle cells contract and relax due to the actions of two filamentous proteins (actin and myosin), which slide along each other. After death, the cells are depleted of their energy source and the protein filaments become locked in place. This causes the muscles to become rigid and locks the joints.

After death, the cells are depleted of their energy source and the protein filaments become locked in place. This causes the muscles to become rigid and locks the joints. During these early stages, the cadaveric ecosystem consists mostly of the bacteria that live in and on the living human body. Our bodies host huge numbers of bacteria; every one of the body’s surfaces and corners provides a habitat for a specialised microbial community. By far the largest of these communities resides in the gut, which is home to trillions of bacteria of hundreds or perhaps thousands of different species. The gut microbiome is one of the hottest research topics in biology; it’s been linked to roles in human health and a plethora of conditions and diseases, from autism and depression to irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. But we still know little about these microbial passengers while we are alive. We know even less about what happens to them when we die. Immune shutdown In August 2014, forensic scientist Gulnaz Javan of Alabama State University in Montgomery and her colleagues published the very first study of what they have called the thanatomicrobiome (from thanatos, the Greek word for ‘death’). “Many of our samples come from criminal cases,” says Javan. “Someone dies by suicide, homicide, drug overdose or traffic accident, and I collect tissue samples from the body. There are ethical issues [because] we need consent.” Most internal organs are devoid of microbes when we are alive. Soon after death, however, the immune system stops working, leaving them to spread throughout the body freely. This usually begins in the gut, at the junction between the small and large intestines. Left unchecked, our gut bacteria begin to digest the intestines – and then the surrounding tissues – from the inside out, using the chemical cocktail that leaks out of damaged cells as a food source. Then they invade the capillaries of the digestive system and lymph nodes, spreading first to the liver and spleen, then into the heart and brain. Javan and her team took samples of liver, spleen, brain, heart and blood from 11 cadavers, at between 20 and 240 hours after death. They used two different state-of-the-art DNA sequencing technologies, combined with bioinformatics, to analyse and compare the bacterial content of each sample. The samples taken from different organs in the same cadaver were very similar to each other but very different from those taken from the same organs in the other bodies. This may be due partly to differences in the composition of the microbiome of each cadaver, or it might be caused by differences in the time elapsed since death. An earlier study of decomposing mice revealed that although the microbiome changes dramatically after death, it does so in a consistent and measurable way. The researchers were able to estimate time of death to within three days of a nearly two-month period. Bacteria checklist Javan’s study suggests that this ‘microbial clock’ may be ticking within the decomposing human body, too. It showed that the bacteria reached the liver about 20 hours after death and that it took them at least 58 hours to spread to all the organs from which samples were taken. Thus, after we die, our bacteria may spread through the body in a systematic way, and the timing with which they infiltrate first one internal organ and then another may provide a new way of estimating the amount of time that has elapsed since death. “After death the composition of the bacteria changes,” says Javan. “They move into the heart, the brain and then the reproductive organs last.” In 2014, Javan and her colleagues secured a $200,000 (£131,360) grant from the National Science Foundation to investigate further. “We will do next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to see which organ is best for estimating [time of death] – that’s still unclear,” she says. One thing that does seem clear, however, is that a different composition of bacteria is associated with different stages of decomposition. But what does this process actually look like? Scattered among the pine trees in Huntsville, Texas, lie around half a dozen human cadavers in various stages of decay. The two most recently placed bodies are spread-eagled near the centre of the small enclosure with much of their loose, grey-blue mottled skin still intact, their ribcages and pelvic bones visible between slowly putrefying flesh. A few metres away lies another, fully skeletonised, with its black, hardened skin clinging to the bones, as if it were wearing a shiny latex suit and skullcap. Further still, beyond other skeletal remains scattered by vultures, lies a third body within a wood and wire cage. It is nearing the end of the death cycle, partly mummified. Several large, brown mushrooms grow from where an abdomen once was.  Natural decayFor most of us the sight of a rotting corpse is at best unsettling and at worst repulsive and frightening, the stuff of nightmares. But this is everyday for the folks at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility. Opened in 2009, the facility is located within a 247-acre area of national forest owned by Sam Houston State University (SHSU). Within it, a nine-acre plot of densely wooded land has been sealed off from the wider area and further subdivided, by 10-foot-high green wire fences topped with barbed wire. In late 2011, SHSU researchers Sibyl Bucheli and Aaron Lynne and their colleagues placed two fresh cadavers here, and left them to decay under natural conditions.Once self-digestion is under way and bacteria have started to escape from the gastrointestinal tract, putrefaction begins. This is molecular death – the breakdown of soft tissues even further, into gases, liquids and salts. It is already under way at the earlier stages of decomposition but really gets going when anaerobic bacteria get in on the act.

This is molecular death – the breakdown of soft tissues even further, into gases, liquids and salts. It is already under way at the earlier stages of decomposition but really gets going when anaerobic bacteria get in on the act. Putrefaction is associated with a marked shift from aerobic bacterial species, which require oxygen to grow, to anaerobic ones, which do not. These then feed on the body’s tissues, fermenting the sugars in them to produce gaseous by-products such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and ammonia, which accumulate within the body, inflating (or ‘bloating’) the abdomen and sometimes other body parts. This causes further discolouration of the body. As damaged blood cells continue to leak from disintegrating vessels, anaerobic bacteria convert haemoglobin molecules, which once carried oxygen around the body, into sulfhaemoglobin. The presence of this molecule in settled blood gives skin the marbled, greenish-black appearance characteristic of a body undergoing active decomposition. Specialised habitat As the gas pressure continues to build up inside the body, it causes blisters to appear all over the skin surface. This is followed by loosening, and then ‘slippage’, of large sheets of skin, which remain barely attached to the deteriorating frame underneath. Eventually, the gases and liquefied tissues purge from the body, usually leaking from the anus and other orifices and frequently also leaking from ripped skin in other parts of the body. Sometimes, the pressure is so great that the abdomen bursts open. Bloating is often used as a marker for the transition between early and later stages of decomposition, and another recent study shows that this transition is characterised by a distinct shift in the composition of cadaveric bacteria. Bucheli and Lynne took samples of bacteria from various parts of the bodies at the beginning and the end of the bloat stage. They then extracted bacterial DNA from the samples and sequenced it. As an entomologist, Bucheli is mainly interested in the insects that colonise cadavers. She regards a cadaver as a specialised habitat for various necrophagous (or ‘dead-eating’) insect species, some of which see out their entire life cycle in, on and around the body. When a decomposing body starts to purge, it becomes fully exposed to its surroundings. At this stage, the cadaveric ecosystem really comes into its own: a ‘hub’ for microbes, insects and scavengers.Maggot cycleTwo species closely linked with decomposition are blowflies and flesh flies (and their larvae). Cadavers give off a foul, sickly-sweet odour, made up of a complex cocktail of volatile compounds which changes as decomposition progresses. Blowflies detect the smell using specialised receptors on their antennae, then land on the cadaver and lay their eggs in orifices and open wounds.Each fly deposits around 250 eggs that hatch within 24 hours, giving rise to small first-stage maggots. These feed on the rotting flesh and then moult into larger maggots, which feed for several hours before moulting again. After feeding some more, these yet larger, and now fattened, maggots wriggle away from the body. They then pupate and transform into adult flies, and the cycle repeats until there’s nothing left for them to feed on.

After feeding some more, these yet larger, and now fattened, maggots wriggle away from the body. They then pupate and transform into adult flies, and the cycle repeats until there’s nothing left for them to feed on. Under the right conditions, an actively decaying body will have large numbers of stage-three maggots feeding on it. This ‘maggot mass’ generates a lot of heat, raising the inside temperature by more than 10C (18F). Like penguins huddling in the South Pole, individual maggots within the mass are constantly on the move. But whereas penguins huddle to keep warm, maggots in the mass move around to stay cool. “It’s a double-edged sword,” Bucheli explains, surrounded by large toy insects and a collection of Monster High dolls in her SHSU office. “If you’re always at the edge, you might get eaten by a bird, and if you’re always in the centre, you might get cooked. So they’re constantly moving from the centre to the edges and back.” The presence of flies attracts predators such as skin beetles, mites, ants, wasps and spiders, which then feed on the flies’ eggs and larvae. Vultures and other scavengers, as well as other large meat-eating animals, may also descend upon the body. Unique repertoire In the absence of scavengers, though, the maggots are responsible for removal of the soft tissues. As Carl Linnaeus (who devised the system by which scientists name species) noted in 1767, “three flies could consume a horse cadaver as rapidly as a lion”. Third-stage maggots will move away from a cadaver in large numbers, often following the same route. Their activity is so rigorous that their migration paths may be seen after decomposition is finished, as deep furrows in the soil emanating from the cadaver. Every species that visits a cadaver has a unique repertoire of gut microbes, and different types of soil are likely to harbour distinct bacterial communities – the composition of which is probably determined by factors such as temperature, moisture, and the soil type and texture. All these microbes mingle and mix within the cadaveric ecosystem. Flies that land on the cadaver will not only deposit their eggs on it, but will also take up some of the bacteria they find there and leave some of their own. And the liquefied tissues seeping out of the body allow the exchange of bacteria between the cadaver and the soil beneath. When they take samples from cadavers, Bucheli and Lynne detect bacteria originating from the skin on the body and from the flies and scavengers that visit it, as well as from soil. “When a body purges, the gut bacteria start to come out, and we see a greater proportion of them outside the body,” says Lynne. Thus, every dead body is likely to have a unique microbiological signature, and this signature may change with time according to the exact conditions of the death scene. A better understanding of the composition of these bacterial communities, the relationships between them and how they influence each other as decomposition proceeds could one day help forensics teams learn more about where, when and how a person died. Pieces of the puzzle For instance, detecting DNA sequences known to be unique to a particular organism or soil type in a cadaver could help crime scene investigators link the body of a murder victim to a particular geographical location or narrow down their search for clues even further, perhaps to a specific field within a given area. “There have been several court cases where forensic entomology has really stood up and provided important pieces of the puzzle,” says Bucheli, adding that she hopes bacteria might provide additional information and could become another tool to refine time-of-death estimates. “I hope that in about five years we can start using bacterial data in trials,” she says. To this end, researchers are busy cataloguing the bacterial species in and on the human body, and studying how bacterial populations differ between individuals. “I would love to have a dataset from life to death,” says Bucheli. “I would love to meet a donor who’d let me take bacterial samples while they’re alive, through their death process and while they decompose.”  “We’re looking at the purging fluid that comes out of decomposing bodies,” says Daniel Wescott, director of the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State University in San Marcos. Wescott, an anthropologist specialising in skull structure, is using a micro-CT scanner to analyse the microscopic structure of the bones brought back from the body farm. He also collaborates with entomologists and microbiologists – including Javan, who has been busy analysing samples of cadaver soil collected from the San Marcos facility – as well as computer engineers and a pilot, who operate a drone that takes aerial photographs of the facility. “I was reading an article about drones flying over crop fields, looking at which ones would be best to plant in,” he says. “They were looking at near-infrared, and organically rich soils were a darker colour than the others. I thought if they can do that, then maybe we can pick up these little circles.” Rich soil Those “little circles” are cadaver decomposition islands. A decomposing body significantly alters the chemistry of the soil beneath it, causing changes that may persist for years. Purging – the seeping of broken-down materials out of what’s left of the body – releases nutrients into the underlying soil, and maggot migration transfers much of the energy in a body to the wider environment. Eventually, the whole process creates a ‘cadaver decomposition island’, a highly concentrated area of organically rich soil. As well as releasing nutrients into the wider ecosystem, this attracts other organic materials, such as dead insects and faecal matter from larger animals. According to one estimate, an average human body consists of 50–75% water, and every kilogram of dry body mass eventually releases 32g of nitrogen, 10g of phosphorous, 4g of potassium and 1g of magnesium into the soil. Initially, it kills off some of the underlying and surrounding vegetation, possibly because of nitrogen toxicity or because of antibiotics found in the body, which are secreted by insect larvae as they feed on the flesh. Ultimately, though, decomposition is beneficial for the surrounding ecosystem. The microbial biomass within the cadaver decomposition island is greater than in other nearby areas. Nematode worms, associated with decay and drawn to the seeping nutrients, become more abundant, and plant life becomes more diverse. Further research into how decomposing bodies alter the ecology of their surroundings may provide a new way of finding murder victims whose bodies have been buried in shallow graves. Grave soil analysis may also provide another possible way of estimating time of death. A 2008 study of the biochemical changes that take place in a cadaver decomposition island showed that the soil concentration of lipid-phosphorous leaking from a cadaver peaks at around 40 days after death, whereas those of nitrogen and extractable phosphorous peak at 72 and 100 days, respectively. With a more detailed understanding of these processes, analyses of grave soil biochemistry could one day help forensic researchers to estimate how long ago a body was placed in a hidden grave.

Yield Spread Analysis,Calvert-Lewin sent off as Everton draw with Palace,2024-09-14,2024-01-04,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67884893,"This video can not be played Calvert-Lewin sent off as Everton draw with Palace Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin was controversially sent off but the 10-man Toffees held on to force an FA Cup third-round replay with Crystal Palace. Calvert-Lewin was shown a straight red card in the 79th minute after on-field referee Chris Kavanagh had been advised to review the incident on a pitchside monitor after an intervention from video assistant referee Michael Salisbury. The England forward had his studs up as he slid in to win the ball in a challenge on Nathaniel Clyne and clipped the defender's shin, although contact was minimal. Everton fans booed the decision when the incident was replayed on a big screen at Selhurst Park, with Toffees boss Sean Dyche also shaking his head, unhappy at the verdict. Calvert-Lewin, now without a goal in 12 matches, had earlier had one of the few clear-cut chances but could only shoot tamely at home goalkeeper Dean Henderson. Jefferson Lerma fired just over from 20 yards for the Eagles, but Palace could not make their extra man advantage count. Everton also suffered what looked to be a serious injury to winger Dwight McNeil, who was carried off on a stretcher with a leg injury late on. VAR testing my patience - Everton boss Dyche Crystal Palace v Everton as it happened, plus reaction and analysis How did you rate Crystal Palace's performance? Have your say here What did you make of Everton's display? Send us your views here Eberechi Eze nearly won it for the hosts in the eighth minute of nine added on at the end, but Everton goalkeeper Joao Virginia did well to push the strike around the post. Palace had gained a 3-1 Premier League win over Brentford on 30 December to end an eight-game run without a victory, but were without the injured Michael Olise, who hurt his hamstring after scoring twice in that match. Striker Jordan Ayew was also unavailable as he was with the Ghana squad before the Africa Cup of Nations, which runs from 13 January to 11 February. Brazilian winger Matheus Franca, 19, was handed his first start since his move from Flamengo in August in a £17m deal that could rise to £26m. Franca, playing on the right wing, produced one of the best moments of the first half with a purposeful run, before James Tarkowski fouled him just outside the penalty area. Eze, though, fired the free-kick over. Elsewhere, Jeffrey Schlupp had a low strike saved and Lerma shot over from 20 yards. But a draw was a fair outcome as both sides had three attempts on target and seven corners apiece.  Everton, now without a win in five matches in all competitions, went close when Arnaut Danjuma had an attempt deflected into the side-netting and also forced Henderson into a good save. Amadou Onana also headed over when well placed, but neither side could score and will have to do it again at Goodison Park later this month. Palace and Everton, 14th and 17th respectively in the Premier League, will both be in the fourth-round draw, which takes place at 19:50 GMT on Monday before Wigan Athletic host Manchester United.

Yield Spread Analysis,Antony scores as Man Utd end Arsenal's winning run,2024-09-14,2022-09-02,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62704217,"This video can not be played MOTD 2 analysis: Why 'masterful' Christian Eriksen was key to Man Utd beating Arsenal Manchester United's £82m new boy Antony scored on his debut and Marcus Rashford got two as Erik ten Hag's men ended Arsenal's 100% start to the season at Old Trafford. The Brazilian opened the scoring 10 minutes before half-time in the pulsating duel, sweeping a shot into the far corner. Rashford claimed the assist for that and then, after Bukayo Saka had levelled on the hour, the England striker profited from two clinical United counter-attacks. Bruno Fernandes was at the heart of both, splitting the Arsenal defence for Rashford's first, then sending Christian Eriksen clear as the Dane provided the striker with a tap-in. It was Rashford's first Premier League double since December 2020, helping lift them to fifth in the table. Arsenal remain top. However, after their excellent start to the season, manager Mikel Arteta will be concerned at how easily his side were opened up, although the Gunners did have a first-half Gabriel Martinelli goal ruled out by VAR. ""The game was there for the taking,"" Arteta said. ""We haven't won it because we lacked some discipline in some moments and we weren't ruthless enough in front of goal. ""If we play with more courage we win the game. It is a big lesson - if you want to win here you have to do everything so right."" This video can not be played Man Utd 3-1 Arsenal: Red Devils' spirit and mentality has ""really improved"" - Erik ten Hag Having failed to prise Antony out of Ajax at the start of the summer and with the attempt to sign Ten Hag's first choice transfer window target Frenkie de Jong stalling, United went back for the Brazilian in the wake of those awful defeats to Brighton and Brentford at the start of the season. Evidently, United were not in a strong bargaining position and the eventual price - the fourth highest sum ever paid by a Premier League club - is accepted by most to be significantly inflated. Yet it is impossible to quantify financially how a positive attitude transfers to supporters. It was clear, with his tricks and flicks and teasing of defenders, the 24-year-old is not short on confidence. Referee Paul Tierney, who played an excellent advantage for the Brazilian's goal after Bruno Fernandes had been fouled in the build-up, had to warn him about his celebration in front of the Arsenal fans with the ball up his shirt. Not long after that, Antony was upended from behind by Granit Xhaka. Had he connected with his immediate response, trying to slice Xhaka down from behind, the response from Tierney would almost certainly have been more than a ticking off. The United fans loved it all. And while he lasted less than an hour before being replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, Antony was afforded a standing ovation as he left the field.  However Antony's time at Old Trafford works out, it isn't likely to be dull. This video can not be played Man Utd 3-1 Arsenal: Gunners failed to 'kill game' after equaliser - Mikel Arteta Although they failed in their attempt to start the season with six wins in a row for the first time since 1947, it wasn't a completely disastrous day for Arsenal. In the current climate, Martin Odegaard bundling Eriksen over to win possession and start the move that led to Martinelli finding the net was always going to see the goal ruled out. However, Arteta spent a long time debating with fourth official Simon Hooper about Lisandro Martinez's penalty box lunge on Saka, where he did touch the man and not the ball. Arsenal should have equalised when Gabriel Jesus got the better of Martinez and set up Odegaard but neither the Norwegian, nor Saka as Arsenal continued to press could find the target  when well placed to do much better. David de Gea acrobatically denied Martinelli as well, so Arsenal did have the opportunities to make more of their dominance of possession. Odegaard and Xhaka were excellent in midfield and it is clear they have a more consistent goal threat with Jesus in their side. However, immediately after this month's international break, the Gunners have a five-match sequence that includes home games against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City. After these, far more will be known about this Arsenal side.

Yield Spread Analysis,Wales 'to go further' on climate target,2024-09-14,2019-06-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-48583917,"Wales has accepted a target to cut carbon emissions by 95% by 2050 - but wants to go further and reach ""net zero"", the Welsh Government has said. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) set out the recommendation in May, saying Wales could only reach a 95% reduction due to the importance of the farming industry to rural communities. A farming union said it recognised the contribution farmers needed to make.  The UK government has announced a ""net zero"" target by 2050.  Lesley Griffiths AM said the Welsh Government would bring regulations to the assembly to amend its target. Ms Griffiths, the minister for environment, energy and rural affairs, said: ""I want to go further and I am declaring our ambition to bring forward a target for Wales to achieve net zero emissions no later than 2050."" In March, the Welsh Government published its low carbon plan containing detailed sector-by-sector emissions profiles and 100 policies and proposals to achieve a low-carbon Wales.  Ms Griffiths later declared a climate emergency hoping it would trigger ""a wave of action"". The Welsh Government will bring regulations to the assembly next year to amend the existing 2050 target and budgets as necessary. Ms Griffiths also urged the UK government to ensure the costs of moving to net zero are spread across the UK and called for closer collaboration across all governments. She said: ""I have requested a meeting with my UK and Scottish counterparts to discuss how we will rise to the challenge of climate change together."" John Davies, president of the National Farmers' Union, said it had already outlined that improvements in productivity, carbon capture and renewable energy production were the most effective ways to realise such ambitions. He added that agriculture contributes 12% to Wales' overall emissions ""and we absolutely recognise the contribution we have to make in tackling climate change"". ""Our organisations are aligned: acting to tackle damaging climate change is vital."" The actual target the Welsh Government will put in law is for a 95% cut in emissions, but they say their ambition is to go even further. It has been described as ""brilliant news"" by the Committee on Climate Change, which advises them. But in its latest report, the committee warned that reaching a net-zero goal would be more challenging for Wales than the rest of the UK. It is partly because there is less space here to plant vast forests of trees to soak up carbon dioxide than in Scotland. But it is also because sheep and cattle farming is so important to rural parts of the country. To put it politely, reducing the methane emitted from either end of their digestive systems is difficult. The farming industry says it is up for the challenge though, with NFU Cymru suggesting the sector could achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. Changes to the subsidy scheme for farmers after Brexit will put more emphasis on paying them to help fight climate change too. Another hurdle is that Wales' emissions from burning fossil fuels look high, but that's because a lot of the electricity is exported to England. For instance, Wales accounts for 6% of the UK's electricity needs, but hosts 19% of its natural gas power stations. The power to change that is largely down to the UK government, which is why Welsh environment minister Lesley Griffiths has said a more ""collaborative approach"" is needed if both the UK's and Wales' targets are to be met."
Yield Spread Analysis,Sputnik V vaccine rushed out to wary Russians,2024-09-14,2020-12-08,By Sarah Rainsford,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55221785,"Its name alone speaks of Russia's ambition: Sputnik V, the country's leading vaccine against Covid-19, is meant to be a world-beater just like its cosmic namesake.  Back in August, it was the first to be registered for emergency use although it had only been tested on a few dozen people. Now doctors, teachers and social workers are being offered Sputnik V in a mass inoculation campaign ordered by President Vladimir Putin. Its timing, just ahead of a similar launch in the UK, is unlikely to be a coincidence. But Sputnik V is still in the midst of trials to check that it's safe and actually works, making some Russians wary of receiving it yet. And despite a fanfare over the vaccine's grand rollout, there are still problems scaling up production.  In a sense, this is no ""launch"" at all. Russian health workers have been getting vaccinated in tandem with the official trials for several months. Teachers have been eligible too, and VIPs including President Putin's own daughter have had the jab. The list is said to total more than 100,000 people.  ""All of the staff here have been vaccinated,"" nurse Oksana Konstantinova confirms, as she removes a tiny glass bottle of vaccine from the deep freeze at a Moscow clinic. Sputnik V has to be stored at -18C at least in its liquid form. There are plans for a more practical, powder version of the vaccine but it's not yet being made in large amounts. Why did she accept an experimental jab? ""We have to be able to say that the vaccine is safe and necessary in the current situation,"" the nurse explains. ""I was worried a bit. I am human! But I realised it was a fuss about nothing."" Sputnik's backers claim it offers 95% protection against the coronavirus, putting Russia's offering right up alongside the vaccines of teams in the US and Europe. But here, the data released so far is based on interim results only - after just 39 trial volunteers caught Covid. That haste - coupled with such bold claims - has raised eyebrows.  ""We hope the vaccine is effective, but it's difficult to trust some of the figures,"" argues Svetlana Zavidova, whose organisation monitors clinical trials in Russia. She also lists concerns that Sputnik's developers injected themselves with their own vaccine and that the product was registered for use after such limited trials. ""We don't see the point of such a rush, other than announcing how we beat the rest of the world,"" Zavidova says. ""I think there's a struggle between scientists and politicians, and the latter are winning."" Like other countries, Russia presents its trial results to an external panel of experts for analysis. ""I heard the interim reports and can say for sure that Sputnik is safe and can produce a short-term immune response,"" oncologist Dr Alexander Rumyantsev told the BBC. He had the vaccine himself in September and now boasts a large number of antibodies, though he said it was impossible to tell from the trial data how long any protection would last. ""We need more observation. I think we will only know that in spring."" Around 24% of volunteers experience side effects, the doctor said. ""They were not pronounced, and they didn't create any serious problems."" But there have been problems for Sputnik of another kind. Its developers used to boast that tens of millions of doses of their vaccine would be rolling off conveyer belts this year, but they've had to scale-back expectations. Even President Putin now expects a modest two million doses of Sputnik this month. The Russian vaccine comprises two entirely different injections - using different ""vectors"" or carriers for the coronavirus each time. Its backers insist that makes it more effective, but it also piles extra pressure on producers. ""Russia has taken on a crazy task,"" Dmitry Morozov says, arguing that biotech firms like his should have been consulted on the practicalities at the very start.   ""They basically doubled the work for us. It's like you need to make two cars to actually move forward, but they're both completely different: a Jeep and a mini bus,"" he explains. ""That's a serious challenge. It means we have a far tougher task than most other manufacturers."" Even so, Morozov is confident his firm, Biocad, can produce ""millions"" of doses of Sputnik. Its test batches are in Moscow now, waiting to be quality-cleared. Another source told the BBC that producers have struggled with the second Sputnik jab in particular. ""The first component is the most stable, we can produce more of it,"" the source said. ""The second is less so and we have to keep strict temperature controls. I think it will soon be resolved."" But even when production lines are up and running, there could be another issue to contend with.  We only saw a handful of people getting injected on the first day of ""mass"" vaccination. On Monday, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta described similar scenes at another Moscow clinic.  According to the paper, a nurse had to throw some Sputnik V away when she defrosted it and no-one turned up.   That's a worry when the country is being hit hard by Covid, reporting close to 30,000 new cases a day. But it seems many Russians may have decided to wait. ""A lot of people don't believe in the vaccine at this point,"" Svetlana Zavidova believes. ""I hope if there's real scientific data, they will change their minds."" "
Yield Spread Analysis,Epatante lands Champion Hurdle victory,2024-09-14,2020-03-10,Frank Keogh,https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/51820730,"Epantante took the lead at the last hurdle and went on to win by three lengths The favourite Epatante gave owner JP McManus a birthday to remember with victory in the Champion Hurdle on the opening day of the Cheltenham Festival. Barry Geraghty had the 2-1 shot, trained by Nicky Henderson, well-placed throughout in Tuesday's showpiece race. After jumping the last strongly, the six-year-old mare ran on up the hill to beat Sharjah into second. There was another Grade One victory for jockey Rachael Blackmore aboard Honeysuckle in the Mares' Hurdle. Henderson extended his exceptional Champion Hurdle record to eight victories, while it was a record-equalling fourth win for Geraghty. And it was a ninth success in the race for McManus, who was celebrating his 69th birthday. Just as the Festival has gone ahead after doubts caused by the coronavirus outbreak, so the big-race winner recovered from a scare. The mare had ""coughed a few times,"" her trainer had revealed 12 days before the race. ""She coughed for a couple of days and I felt I had to say something,"" said Henderson. ""She must have read the newspapers and as soon as she read the papers, she recovered."" Geraghty guided his mount to a three-length victory from Sharjah, with Darver Star third. ""JP is sourcing this talent and he supports the game at every level,"" said the jockey. ""The birthday cheer he got today reflects what people think of him because he is a top-class man."" Last year, Epatante disappointed when she finished well down the field in the Mares Novices' Hurdle, but two wins at Newbury and in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton left her at the top of the betting market coming into the Festival. Henderson was celebrating a 20-1 double after Shishkin edged out Abacadabras to win the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. Victory put him one ahead of Willie Mullins on 66 career Festival victories as the meeting's all-time leading trainer. Blackmore started the week as third favourite to be the meeting's leading jockey and demonstrated all her ability when landing the Mares' Hurdle. She slipped through on the inside on 9-4 shot Honeysuckle around the final bend and took the initiative from 4-6 favourite Benie Des Dieux, ridden by Paul Townend, following a pulsating duel. ""That was just the way it worked out,"" she said. ""It's every jockey's dream to be in the position I'm in and Cheltenham is what it's all about."" Feature: Blackmore on 'unbelievable position' Blackmore initially planned on becoming a vet before switching to be a professional jockey It was a second winner on the opening day for trainer Henry de Bromhead, who scored with 16-1 shot Put The Kettle On in the Arkle Chase. Benie Des Dieux had fallen while leading at the final flight under Ruby Walsh last year, and trainer Willie Mullins believes there may have been a ""miscommunication"" this time around. ""Maybe Robbie [Power, riding stablemate Stormy Ireland] thought that one of our horses was behind him, rather than Honeysuckle,"" explained Mullins. ""It looked like he just gave the winner a huge gap while Paul was going round the outside. Things happen. We won't want to watch that again.""  The Conditional, under Brendan Powell for David Bridgwater, won the Ultima Chase while another Gloucestershire trainer, Kim Bailey, took the Novices' Handicap Chase with Imperial Aura, ridden by David Bass. Leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd claimed a 10th Cheltenham Festival success with victory aboard Ravenhill, trained by Gordon Elliott, in the National Hunt Chase. The opening-day crowd of 60,664 was significantly down on recent years after doubts over whether the meeting would go ahead. This compares to an opening attendance of 67,934 in 2019, and was the lowest for the Tuesday for six years. ""We are very happy with the crowd considering the uncertainty of the last fortnight,"" said Cheltenham chief Ian Renton. Organisers had laid on 24 hand sanitiser banks, with the caption ""Don't Pass It On"", in a hygiene drive aimed at combating any spread of coronavirus. There were 14 extra toilet units installed, and posters with government advice on hand-washing techniques. Spectators took advantage of the hand sanitiser provided by race organisers Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent Epatante dominated the race like the very good horse she clearly is, becoming in the process a rare Champion Hurdle success by a female horse, and defying those who feared that the examining final hill might be too much for her.  She's only six, is clearly thriving and will set a decent standard for the future even if some will point to the fact that it was probably not a vintage staging.  The unbeaten Irish mare Honeysuckle might have taken her on, but went for the mares-only Hurdle and came away with a memorable success ridden by Rachael Blackmore."
Yield Spread Analysis,Australia 62-0 USA,2024-09-14,2013-11-16,Elizabeth Hudson,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/24972740,"This video can not be played Australia trounce USA to make semis Brett Morris and Jarryd Hayne scored four tries each as Australia reached the Rugby League World Cup last four with an easy victory over the USA. But the win was overshadowed by an injury to full-back Billy Slater who had to leave the field in the second half after aggravating a knee problem. Morris and Hayne are the fifth and sixth Australians to score four tries in a World Cup game. Greg Inglis added two tries and Cameron Smith and Cooper Cronk also crossed. Hayne got his side off to the perfect start within the opening three minutes. The Kangaroos played the ball across the line, and Slater and Inglis got the ball out to the centre, who made no mistake - though Johnathan Thurston missed the kick, in what was a mixed performance by his high standards.  The USA defence was under constant pressure and it was no surprise when Inglis powered over on 11 minutes.  In total control, the Kangaroos then went over for three quickfire tries.  First Morris shrugged off the attentions of the Tomahawks defence for his opener and then captain Smith got a piece of the action after Paul Gallen's neat off-load. When the Kangaroos again swept down the field, an inside pass by Slater found Morris for his second try of the game.  Morris completed his hat-trick on 35 minutes with Inglis again the provider, after the ball was spread across the field from an Australian scrum 20 metres from the line. Morris made it four just on half-time when a beautiful high looping kick from the boot of Cronk found him on the wing and he leaped above the USA's Matt Petersen.  But two minutes after the restart, Slater had to be helped off the field, when he was tackled after taking a high ball. Australia coach Tim Sheens confirmed that the 30-year-old had suffered a recurrence of a posterior cruciate ligament injury, which ruled him out for several weeks last year. Slater will undergo and MRI scan on Saturday night but Sheens has not ruled the Melbourne player out of the tournament although he will miss next Saturday's semi-final against either Fiji or Samoa. ""It's an injury to his old injury - PCL,"" said Sheens. ""It's just what damage may have been done, cartilage and other things. We're just hoping it's a bad knock but we're sending him for an MRI. ""We've still not given up the thought that he might possibly be available, probably not this week after that sort of knock, the week after if we get that far. ""I'm not going to panic just yet until we get (the results of the MRI). The issue is the knock and how much damage it's done."" The USA tried to find gaps in the Kangaroos defence but Tim Sheens' side thwarted their opponents and on the attack they continued to look dangerous.  On 50 minutes, Inglis bullied his way through the Tomahawks defence for his second try. Hayne then became the principal danger man in the latter stages with three further tries, helped by both Morris and Inglis to set up a semi-final meeting against Fiji or Samoa at Wembley next Saturday.

The chastening loss at London Stadium ensured the host nation failed to reach the final of the tournament. Bennett said his side ""self-destructed"" at times during Sunday's game. The Australian added: ""Right now, they don't believe. They just have to realise how good they can be - they don't get that part unfortunately."" England, who needed to avoid defeat to qualify for next Sunday's final at Anfield, led 6-2 after half-an-hour against the tournament favourites. But they gave away a series of needless penalties and failed to make the most of the openings they created during a frustrating afternoon for Bennett and his team. By the mid-point of the second half they trailed 28-6, and they conceded six tries in total. ""They have to recognise what is beating them,"" said Bennett. ""They have got to fix it in their daily habits and they have got 12 months before the World Cup to fix it. ""There's lots of talent, they can play, the problem is that they have to learn to compete at this level under pressure."" This video can not be played Bennett says England do not believe in themselves England lost their opening Four Nations match 17-16 against New Zealand but defeated Scotland before losing by 18 points against the Kangaroos. It was England's 11th straight defeat against Australia but, despite criticising aspects of his players' performances during the tournament, Bennett was insistent the gap between the sides is not all that big. ""I have enjoyed being with the players immensely,"" added the 66-year-old, who was taking charge of England for the first time at the Four Nations. ""They are great blokes to be around. ""It makes me more frustrated than ever, angry even in my case, because they are not showing how good they can be. ""They are not that far behind. I cannot fault them off the field, they have just got to get it right on the field. ""They are very capable and a better team than a lot of people realise. I thought there would have been a lot more issues when I took charge."" Australia will face New Zealand in the final after winning all three of their round-robin games. However, skipper Cameron Smith felt the scoreline in London flattered his team. ""It was a high-quality game and England were very good,"" said the Melbourne Storm hooker. ""We had to come up with some special plays to get points against them. The scoreline did not reflect the contest. ""The gap is not widening, it might look that way but it was fairly tight through the whole 80 minutes."" Match report: England 18-36 Australia Relive Australia's win over England England captain Sam Burgess (right) plays his club rugby in Australia Former England utility player Jon Wilkin, speaking to BBC Sport on Facebook Live:, external Australia are world class and will win the Four Nations in style against New Zealand next week. Half-back Cooper Cronk was sensational today, while the packs pretty much cancelled each other out. Was the venue an issue? There were 35,000 people in the London Stadium, and the atmosphere was OK. Maybe we can look at that and play to our strengths. I know we need to promote the game, and spread the game to the south, but we need to do what's best for the national team.  For coach Wayne Bennett, there were some real thought-provoking moments in the game. The question remains how England unlock the southern hemisphere teams. Mirror journalist Gareth Walker believes Australia possess one of the greatest ever teams Former Great Britain coach Brian Noble on BBC One: There is room for improvement for England. You have to move pieces forward, you might get beaten initially in a game of chess but you hope it starts a winning game.

Yield Spread Analysis,Ten-man Motherwell snatch late point against Dundee,2024-09-14,2023-12-02,Thomas Duncan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67528590,"Connor Wilkinson scored in the seventh minute of stoppage time Struggling 10-man Motherwell scored a dramatic goal in stoppage time to grab a much-needed point against Dundee in a Scottish Premiership thriller. Connor Wilkinson fired into the bottom corner in the seventh minute of added time for Stuart Kettlewell's side, who looked on course for an eighth defeat in 11 games after Zach Robinson's 88th-minute strike for Dundee, which came after Harry Paton's sending off. The red card for the Motherwell midfielder followed an on-field review of his tackle on Luke McCowan just four minutes after Bevis Mugabi had headed in an equaliser. It set up a frantic finish which swung from end-to-end, with Dundee eventually denied victory having themselves battled back from a goal down. Keep up to date with Motherwell The latest Dundee news After Mika Biereth smashed Motherwell in front on six minutes, Lyall Cameron latched on to Aaron Donnelly's hooked ball to nod Dundee level before the break, and just four minutes later Owen Beck showed composure to collect Zak Rudden's cross and plant the ball past goalkeeper Liam Kelly. Both sides had chances before Paton's dismissal, with Jon Obika inexplicably firing wide from close range before Mugabi's header restored parity and set up struggling Motherwell to claim at least a point. The video assistant referee's intervention seemed to have changed that after Paton was dismissed and Robinson finished a fine Dundee move. But their boss Tony Docherty will be frustrated his failed to deal with a long ball forward, which fell to Georgie Gent and then Oli Shaw, who teed up Wilkinson to snatch a brilliant point for Motherwell. Kettlewell's side are still winless in 11 league games and sit eighth but will almost feel like they won the game, while Dundee are sixth behind Hibernian on goal difference. The midfielder (right) put in an outstanding performance that included a goal After last week's draw at Celtic Park, this felt like a game Motherwell could attack and break their winless run. Biereth again showed his quality with a magnificent opener to give them the perfect start, but what came after was firmly in the script. No side has conceded more goals than Motherwell in the Premiership and they have kept just one clean sheet all season. They defended poorly again and were dominated in midfield for large spells. However, their character and recent ability to score goals at home recently cannot be questioned, having also netted in stoppage time to rescue a 3-3 draw against Ross County this season. Dundee will be frustrated they did not hold on for a win having scored a brilliant goal late on through Robinson and having played some neat football. Cameron was outstanding in the middle of the pitch alongside McCowan and Malachi Boateng. Beck is having a wonderful season on loan from Liverpool and was excellent again. It's still just one defeat in nine for Dundee so there is plenty to be pleased about for Docherty and the club's fans. Motherwell manager Stuart Kettlewell: ""Dundee manage to get the third goal, but it doesn't surprise me we show character to come back. Even though there is a lot of doubt and people us with the run we're on. ""But I said to the players the first goal should be massive in the Premiership but it wasn't for us today. It had the opposite effect."" Dundee manager Tony Docherty: ""Hugely disappointed to draw a game in which we were so dominant and the level of performance was so high. ""I thought we were outstanding and I should be talking about how good my team were. But we don't manage the last 90 seconds of the game properly and we end up dropping two points."" Motherwell travel to Dingwall to take on Ross County on Tuesday (19:45 GMT), while Dundee do not play until next Saturday, when they face Rangers at Ibrox (15:00). BBC Sport Scottish Football SPFL"
Yield Spread Analysis,Brentford beat Luton after second-half goal spree,2024-09-14,2023-12-01,Bobbie Jackson,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67528610,"Ben Mee scored his first goal in the Premier League this season Brentford returned to winning ways with a deserved victory against Premier League strugglers Luton. Neal Maupay put the Bees in front early in the second half when he prodded in from close range after Ben Mee scuffed a shot. Mee did not have to wait long to get his name on the scoresheet, as his header just seven minutes later put Brentford firmly in the driving seat. Jacob Brown gave Luton hope by halving the hosts' lead, but Shandon Baptiste calmed Brentford's nerves by restoring the two-goal cushion. In almost an exact repeat of Luton's meeting with Crystal Palace last Saturday, there was a distinct lack of goalmouth action early on at both ends of the field at Gtech Community Stadium. Tha drabness was summed up by the fact Hatters goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski was shown a yellow card for time-wasting in the 38th minute. Brentford's Yegor Yarmolyuk went closest to scoring for either side before the break when his low shot was deflected narrowly wide by Luton's Carlton Morris. But the Bees, who dominated possession without creating enough in the first period, came out with more purpose in the second period and were given an extra boost as Luton captain Tom Lockyer failed to re-emerge after sustaining an injury. Luton had to wait until the 61st-minute to register their first attempt on or off target in the game, substitute Brown firing a speculative effort wide of goal. Brown showed greater accuracy 15 minutes later with his second shot, Luton's first on target, when he latched on to a beautiful defence-splitting ball from Ross Barkley before driving low past Mark Flekken. Brentford's Baptiste, scoring his first goal since December 2021, wrapped up the points with just under 10 minutes remaining when he reacted quickest to convert after Keane Lewis-Potter's shot was parried into his path. This video can not be played Brentford 3-1 Luton Town: Brentford boss Frank applauds team spirit following injuries After successive losses in the Premier League against Arsenal and Liverpool, Brentford would have been relishing the chance to get back on track against relegation candidates Luton. They might have had one or two pre-match concerns, with the Hatters showing last weekend they can cause problems when they ran out 2-1 winners against Crystal Palace, albeit at home. But the campaign so far has been a struggle for Luton on their travels, and this result means they have won one, drawn one and lost five away from Kenilworth Road in the league. Brentford, who were hit by an injury to Kristoffer Ajer in the warm-up, initially struggled to break down a well organised outfit, enjoying plenty of possession but failing to turn that into anything meaningful. With little to get the home fans excited about on a chilly afternoon in West London during the opening 45 minutes, Brentford came out of the traps quickly after the restart and Luton were unable to continue keeping them at arm's length. It is worth noting that Brentford boss Thomas Frank is also dealing with a lengthy injury list, with eight players - including Ajer - sitting out with issues, while Ivan Toney remains suspended for breaking Football Association betting rules. Despite being far from full strength, Brentford showed enough to get through a testing encounter and confidence levels will be starting to creep back up in the right direction as they prepare for a trip to Brighton on Wednesday. Manager Frank told BBC Match of the Day: ""Very deserved, it was a very good performance in many ways. We had a plan for the Arsenal game a week ago and it was a different plan for Luton today. ""Until their goal, we were very dominant. With the amount of injuries we have - basically we have our four full-backs out - it was great. ""When you are dominating a game, if you keep the tempo and intensity, that is difficult to defend against and we did that very well."" This video can not be played Brentford 3-1 Luton Town: Rob Edwards admits Luton weren't good enough Luton's tally of 57 goals was the lowest of any club to finish in the top six of the Championship last season, while only one club scored fewer in the top 10. It appears manager Rob Edwards has not been able to solve those scoring issues since leading the club to a surprise promotion to the Premier League. Only Sheffield United (11) have netted fewer goals than Luton (13) after 14 fixtures in the top-flight this term. The Hatters looked uninterested in trying to attack during the first half, slowing the game down at every opportunity, and Anthony Taylor rightly dished out a yellow card to goalkeeper Kaminski after several complaints over his antics. If Brentford had not managed to get two early quickfire goals in the second half, Luton may have continued to sit deep with every intention of holding out for a draw. Morris, their top scorer this term with three, had no service throughout and the absence of attack-minded wing-back Alfie Doughty, who missed out with a hip injury, was a major blow. Luton manager Edwards told BBC Sport: ""The better side won today. We struggled to find rhythm with the ball and we weren't able to keep it as well as we wanted to. We've been doing that better recently. ""We lost our captain at half-time and that change was big for us. We were a little bit makeshift at the back and Brentford getting those goals made it tough. ""We kept going, the lads always do; we found a way to get back into the game at 2-1, but in truth we didn't deserve anything today. Brentford were good and deserved the win. We needed to be better with the ball."" The glimpse of what Luton could be capable of came when substitute Brown raced through to score, but similar moments were few and far between. By the looks of the fixture list, this campaign will get no easier for the Hatters any time soon. They host leaders Arsenal on Tuesday before welcoming Manchester City to Kenilworth Road on Sunday.

This video can not be played Baker inspire Rhythmic gymnastics provides one of the most finely tuned spectacles of the Olympic programme and a true demonstration of athletic prowess matched with timing and poise. Like synchronised swimming, rhythmic gymnastics is only contested by women. It uses many positions and leaps derived from classical ballet, including pliés, jetés, attitudes and arabesques. Gymnastics requires strength, mobility, endurance, flexibility, body control and coordination.  The high level of physical fitness needed to excel helps encourage a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity and eating a well-balanced diet. The wide range of movements involved works every muscle in the body and burns approximately 315 calories per hour. A University of Athens study found rhythmic gymnastics can help athletes develop strong, healthy bones and joints as it is a weight-bearing activity. This reduces the risk of developing osteoporosis later on in life.  As falling and rolling are key parts of gymnastics training, athletes learn how to spread the force of impacts across their whole body. This can help with injury prevention in sport and other situations. Gymnastics is a breathtaking sport featuring a range of disciplines such as artistic, trampoline, acrobatics, aerobics and tumbling.  It is enjoyed by an estimated four million people in the United Kingdom.  Rhythmic's combination of the flexibility of gymnastics, the technical knowledge of ballet and the expression of modern dance makes it a unique activity. There are more than 1,600 gymnastic clubs in the country and you can find the one closest to you by using the British Gymnastics club finder., external You only need to buy your own sports kit as the different apparatus and equipment can be found in clubs. An extensive range of training programmes for people of all abilities and ages are available in sport centres, gyms, schools, universities and colleges.

More on the British Gymnastics website, external Rhythmic gymnastics developed in eastern Europe during the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Elements from Swedish exercise routines and German muscle-building techniques were incorporated during the early days of the sport's evolution.  When it moved onto the radar of gymnastics' governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), in the middle of the 20th Century, its devotees were calling it ""modern gymnastics"". The FIG recognised rhythmic gymnastics as an official discipline in 1962 and the first World Championships were held in 1964.  That first title was won by Ludmila Savinkova of the Soviet Union. Its Olympic debut came at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles and the team event was introduced 12 years later in Atlanta, with Spain taking gold. In 1984, the venue's air conditioning played havoc with the ribbon routine, allowing rank outsider Lori Fung of Canada to win gold.

The event, due to begin on 24 July, will now take place ""no later than summer 2021"". ""I proposed to postpone for a year and [IOC] president Thomas Bach responded with 100% agreement,"" said Shinzo Abe, Japan's Prime Minister. The event will still be called Tokyo 2020 despite taking place in 2021. In a joint statement, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 and the IOC said: ""The unprecedented and unpredictable spread of the outbreak has seen the situation in the rest of the world deteriorating. ""On Monday, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the Covid-19 pandemic is 'accelerating'. ""There are more than 375,000 cases now recorded worldwide and in nearly every country, and their number is growing by the hour. ""In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today [Tuesday], the IOC president and the prime minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community."" 'Tokyo Olympics will be a carnival unleashed that no-one will take for granted ever again' 'Heartbreaking' but a 'relief' - how athletes reacted to Olympic delay GB Paralympians praise decision to delay Tokyo Games 'This is about protecting lives' - IOC chief says costs of Tokyo 2020 delay not discussed The Inside Track podcast: Tokyo 2020 is postponed While the Games is the biggest sporting event to be affected by the pandemic, there has been a huge impact on a host of other major tournaments and sports: In rugby union, the end of this year's Six Nations was postponed, with four outstanding fixtures to be rearranged in the men's tournament. In football, Euro 2020 was postponed and will be played in the summer of 2021, while the sport is suspended in the UK until 30 April at the earliest. The first eight grands prix of the Formula 1 season have been delayed, with the Monaco Grand Prix cancelled. County cricket in England and Wales will not be played before 28 May, while England's three-Test series against West Indies, due to start at The Oval on 4 June, is in doubt. All forms of professional tennis have been postponed until 7 June, ruling out the clay-court season, while the French Open - the year's second Grand Slam, has been rescheduled for September. Golf's Masters and PGA Championship have both been postponed, with a decision yet to be made about September's Ryder Cup. The London Marathon has been moved from 26 April to 4 October. The IOC had given itself a deadline of four weeks to consider delaying the Games but there had been mounting pressure from a host of Olympic committees and athletes demanding a quicker decision. Canada became the first major country to withdraw from both events on Sunday, while USA Track and Field, athletics' US governing body, had also called for a postponement. The Paralympics were due to start on 25 August but International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said the postponement was ""the only logical option"". He added: ""The health and wellbeing of human life must always be our number-one priority and staging a sporting event of any kind during this pandemic is simply not possible. ""Sport is not the most important thing right now, preserving human life is. It is essential, therefore, that all steps are taken to try to limit the spread of this disease. ""By taking this decision now, everyone involved in the Paralympic movement, including all Para-athletes, can fully focus on their own health and wellbeing and staying safe during this unprecedented and difficult time."" World Athletics president Lord Coe said: ""The athletes have been under intolerable conditions, many of them are unable to train and many have been going through real emotional turmoil.  ""The integrity of competition would have been seriously compromised if we had tried to force the Games into the remaining part of this year."" Coe, who was chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, said World Athletics was looking at moving the 2021 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, to 2022. The Olympics have never been delayed in their 124-year modern history, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during World War One and World War Two. Major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles summer Games in 1980 and 1984. The Tokyo 2020-IOC statement continued: ""The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present. ""Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020."" British Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson said: ""It would have been unthinkable for us to continue to prepare for an Olympic Games at a time the nation and the world no less is enduring great hardship. A postponement is the right decision."" British Paralympics Association chief executive Mike Sharrock said: ""Stemming this global public health crisis and doing everything possible to safeguard the health and wellbeing of people should clearly take priority in these unprecedented times.   ""We welcome the clarity this now gives Paralympic athletes throughout the world who have had their training and qualification plans severely disrupted."" On 22 January, Olympic qualifying events in boxing and women's football that were due to be held in Wuhan, China - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - became the first to be moved or postponed. There have now been almost 400,000 recorded cases of the virus worldwide, with the number of deaths approaching 17,000. How coronavirus has impacted sporting events around the world The latest news on the coronavirus crisis Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This is arguably the biggest decision sport has seen in peacetime. It has looked inevitable for weeks, and many will ask why it has taken until now. With athletes unable to train safely, and the calendar of Olympic and Paralympic qualification events decimated amid travel restrictions and lockdowns, a postponement or cancellation emerged as the only viable options. Faced with the unenviable task of reorganising a sprawling mega-event that has already cost at least £10bn in preparations, the IOC and Japan had hoped to buy themselves some time to consider their next step. But with Olympic committees and athletes increasingly frustrated and confused at what some saw as delaying tactics, the decision was effectively taken out of the organisers' hands, and just 48 hours after the IOC said it was giving itself four weeks to mull it over, we now know the Games cannot go on as planned. The ramifications will be significant. It's a huge blow to Japan, and the country will now have to spend yet more money. Commercial contracts will have to be unpicked and the availability of venues revisited. A crowded sporting calendar will have to be flexible. And the IOC, sports federations, broadcasters, sponsors and a myriad of other related businesses will have to wait an additional year for the financial bonanza that the event generates.  The Games has had to deal with many challenges over the years, from terrorism and boycotts to war and doping. But nothing quite like this. Olympians Alistair Brownlee, double Olympic triathlon champion: ""Evidently a very tough decision for the IOC and other stakeholders to make but in my opinion the right one. Both, for the message it sends to people around the world battling with the virus and to give clarity to athletes attempting to prepare."" Jazmin Sawyers, long jumper: ""The right choice. For now we have to stay home to protect ourselves and everyone else. Look after each other, sport will be here when this is over, and we will be ready to give you all the greatest show on earth."" Callum Skinner, retired cycling team sprint Olympic champion, who fronts competitor-led movement Global Athlete: ""The right decision has been made. Tokyo 2021 presents an amazing opportunity to host a full Games celebrating the world (hopefully) entering the ""post-pandemic"" phase.""

Yield Spread Analysis,'Fantastic' Dundee snatch derby win over St Johnstone,2024-09-14,2024-02-11,Andrew Petrie,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67821044,"Dundee had attempted 22 shots before Luke McCowan finally struck Manager Tony Docherty said Dundee's ""bravery was rewarded"" as they came from behind to score an 89th-minute winner against St Johnstone in a superb Tayside derby at Dens Park. St Johnstone scored against the run of play after nine minutes when Matty Smith curled in from the edge of the box. Dundee's dominance finally brought a leveller 15 minutes from time when Luke McCowan converted a controversial VAR penalty award after Liam Gordon was judged to have fouled Amadou Bakayoko. Dundee pushed for the winner and it was Jordan McGhee who nodded in Owen Beck's cross to send the home crowd into raptures and secure three Scottish Premiership points. ""My team were fantastic today,"" Docherty said. ""The level of performance, the bravery in a derby game. ""There was a real intensity about their play. The stats will show that everything we wanted to do, we did. ""We got our just rewards. We went 1-0 down against the run of play. A lot of teams would have given up. But the character of the squad, the bravery, the intensity, was rewarded."" Dundee remain sixth, but go three points clear of seventh-placed Hibernian, while St Johnstone stay 10th, five points above Ross County having played two games more. Reaction & as it happened Keep up to date with Dundee The latest St Johnstone news Despite the differing narratives between these two sides this season, just two points separated them at kick-off. From the outset, Dundee set about terrorising the visiting defence through McCowan, Scott Tiffoney and Lyall Cameron, but they could not find a route to goal. St Johnstone's opener after only eight minutes was a surprise to all apart from Smith, who teed himself up nicely before picking out the bottom corner from 20 yards. Dundee reacted well. Bakayoko hit the post when he closed down goalkeeper Dimitar Mitov's clearance, while Joe Shaughnessy and Aaron Donnelly both had headers go close. St Johnstone did have chances to double their lead. Benjamin Kimpioka and Adama Sidibeh were denied by fine Trevor Carson saves, but the visitors could not take advantage of their pace on the counter. Dundee continued to press in the second half, swinging in cross after cross but lacking the final touch. They needed a helping hand and got one when Gordon dragged his hand across Bakayoko's face when a corner came in. The VAR, Don Robertson, spotted it and called David Munro to the screen. Penalty given, and McCowan duly struck it in off the post to bring Dundee level.  The hosts, now with with wind in their sails, searched for a winner and found it quickly when McGhee powered a header past Mitov. There was plenty of added time after Michael Mellon's serious-looking head injury, but Dundee were able to hold on for a vital win - just their third in 13 games. So good they signed him twice. So creative and dangerous from left-back, so full of energy. Not dissimilar to another young left-back who played up the street about a decade ago When managers talk about turning performances into results, you usually take it with a pinch of salt. This time though, Docherty was spot on. When Dundee come forward, it's like watching young boys play. Bags of energy and tricks, desperate to beat a man and have a shot - they just need to find that clinical edge. You wonder if they'd have been able to rescue anything had they not been gifted a penalty. It was just the confidence boost they needed. As for St Johnstone, for a large part of this afternoon, they were up into the top six. Despite coming in for criticism from some quarters, Craig Levein and Andy Kirk have done a decent job. The Perth team were clinical, scoring with their first chance, and threatened without creating a large amount. However, they'll be furious they threw this away.

Yield Spread Analysis,'I used to be convinced I didn't have a future',2024-09-14,2024-02-08,India Bourke,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240206-hannah-ritchie-sustainability-data-spreads-hope-not-doomism,"Data scientist Hannah Ritchie argues that planetary damage could be about to peak – but that the US election result could be ""pivotal"". In a global survey of young people's feelings about climate change, half recently told researchers that they believe ""humanity is doomed"". In other words, they don't believe that the needs of the current generation can be met without undermining the next. They worry that life as we know it is not sustainable. Data scientist Hannah Ritchie once believed likewise. As a teenager, she feared that humanity's ravaging of the planet – via everything from climate change to deforestation and overfishing – presented a series of unsolvable problems. Her undergraduate degree, begun at Edinburgh University aged just 16, only seemed to confirm these concerns. ""I used to be convinced I didn't have a future left to live for,"" the now 30-year-old writes in her first book, Not the End of the World. Today, however, Ritchie feels differently. While she's still worried about the trajectory the world is on, she believes there's hope humanity can turn things around. As deputy editor at Our World In Data and a senior researcher at the University of Oxford, she points to developments and statistics that tell a more optimistic story, from improving air quality to rising EV sales. Ritchie speaks to BBC Future Planet about what shifted her mindset, why the world might be reaching overall ""peak pollution"" – and ways that a more sustainable future could be secured. What prompted you to change your mind about humanity's future? And why do you now think that ""doomist"" predictions do not inspire action? Climate change has always been part of my life and I've always been quite worried, even as a kid. That got worse when I went to university, because I was studying environmental science and all the trends were very much going in the wrong direction. At the time I felt very anxious, hopeless, and like these problems were completely unsolvable. A key turning point for me was discovering the work of the Swedish physician and statistician Hans Rosling. When I was studying, I'd assumed that all of the human wellbeing metrics – such as global poverty, mortality and hunger – were also getting worse alongside the environmental ones. But Rosling would do TED talks where he'd show, using data, how the world had changed over the last few centuries for the better. So, I started asking: can we do both things at the same time? Can we continue to improve human wellbeing while also reducing our environmental impact? And, over the last 10 years or so, according to the environmental data, there have been signs for cautious optimism. It's not inevitable that we get there, but I think there's the opportunity for us to do so. The problem with doomism is not people thinking that climate change is a really serious problem – because that's also what I think. It is the idea that it's too late to do anything about it. I think the science is very clear that it's never too late; the impacts of climate change are on a spectrum and where we land on that spectrum depends on what we do today. The more action we take, the more climate damage we limit. The feeling of ""it's too late"" just leads to inaction and paralysis. And I know, from feeling that way in the past, that it didn't actually make me very effective in driving solutions forward. Air pollution, climate change, forests, food, biodiversity, ocean plastic and overfishing: all pose vast threats to human and planetary health. But your data analysis has given you hope that a greener future is possible. So what do you think has been the most powerful instance yet of humanity's ability to change for the better? The ozone layer was the climate change problem of its day, and we don't talk about it anymore because it's a problem that we solved. We have reduced the emissions of ozone depleting gasses by more than 99%. It's easy for us to look back now and say that was inevitable. But I think people working on this at the time, faced really strong pushback from governments, as well as from industry, who denied that it was a problem. You see lots of parallels between that and climate change today. Another example is acid rain. This was a big environmental problem that, especially across Europe and North America, we've done a really good job of tackling.

This email is currently available to non-UK readers. In the UK? Sign up for newsletters here. On air pollution more broadly, while it is still a massive health problem, we have seen progress. In rich countries in particular, public policy has been very effective at driving down local air pollution. And China has managed to dramatically reduce levels in many of its cities in a very short period of time.  Your book gives numerous examples of the green transition already underway around the world. There's the possibility we could be approaching peak deaths from air pollution, with rates falling even as the number of people in the world continues to rise. There's your optimism that total emissions will peak in the 2020s, with global per capita CO2 emissions already having done so. There's the passing of peak deforestation. The passing of peak agricultural land. And the reaching of peak petrol car sales. In light of such trends, would you say that the planet has already reached overall ""peak pollution""? That requires aggregating across many different metrics. I'm going to say we're very close to peak pollution. We're very close to peak CO2 emissions: we've been on a plateau for a number of years and I hope we peak and decline soon. On air pollution, we could be very, very close to the peak. And we've passed the peak on some air pollutants already – such as sulphur dioxide, which causes acid rain. We've also peaked on small but significant things like the global sale of combustion-engine cars. So, there are a range of smaller peaks that then build up to get a macro-level peak of pollution. You speak a lot about the positive power of new technology and technological progress. For example, the fact that solar power has gone from the most to the least expensive energy source in just 10 years. What is most helping humanity to unlock peak pollution? The falling cost of low carbon energy – in particular solar, wind and batteries – is essential for us to peak and reduce CO2 emissions. To make progress, these technologies need to be competitive with or cost less than fossil fuels. Without doing that, our hopes of tackling climate change would be really low. So it is good news that many are already cost competitive. What is the biggest barrier to reaching peak pollution? A major factor limiting progress is the lack of investment in the energy transition and clean technologies by fossil fuel companies. They generate extremely large profits that they could re-invest in forward-looking solutions, but they are failing to do so. That doesn't mean ending fossil fuels tomorrow, but it does mean investing in a clean energy future. Another challenge in reaching peak pollution – in terms of both CO2 emissions and air pollution – is the levels of energy poverty in the world. In rich countries, pollution is falling, but it is still rising in low and middle-income nations. That's because you've got billions of people who, quite rightly, want a higher standard of living. For these countries, the priority is not necessarily how to keep pollution low, but how to supply energy quickly and cheaply. Meat-heavy diets pose a particular challenge to passing peak overall pollution – whether that's seen in terms of deforestation or emissions. What would you say to politicians who are wary of telling people what to do when it comes to their diet? I'm much more optimistic on energy transition, and less so on the food system side. Many individuals don't really care where their energy comes from. They might protest the building of a wind or solar farm, but most people don't mind as long as energy is cheap and reliable. Whereas diet is a very personal thing. It's strongly tied to our identity and individual behavioural changes are harder to make than technological ones. I'm sceptical we'll see a long term and large-scale shift to plant-based diets without quite significant technological advances – which can provide people with meat-like products. In general, I'm also very cautious of telling people what they should do. Prescription is ineffective – especially on what people eat but also more broadly. So, for politicians, it's a very fine line to tread. How do you show people the impacts, and the alternatives, but without forcing it on people? Other figures who, like you, emphasise the importance of technology and possibility of continued economic growth, have been termed ""ecomodernists"". And some of the high-tech solutions that this group advocate – from nuclear power to agricultural intensification and cultured meat – have sparked concerns. Is ecomodernism a phrase you identify with? And what would you say to those who warn that sometimes relying on new technology can accelerate environmental decline? There's probably a range of definitions of what an ecomodernist is. For me, technology is just a really strong lever. I don't think technology on its own will save us, but when you're trying to scale solutions for 8 billion people, you need it. Often people try to reach for solutions from the past. They might have worked for a small population of millions, but they don't scale to a population of billions. In agriculture, for example, you can't feed eight billion people without strong technological changes and without increases in crop yield - which we've seen from technological innovations. I'd also push back on nuclear being a new technology: it's been around much longer than solar and wind. You might also like:  If you were to argue that we need to massively shrink individual demand on the planet's resources by changing our behaviours, you would still need a strong technological component. Even if energy demand is lower, for instance, you will still need a lot of solar, wind and batteries. And you'll still probably need nuclear or geothermal or hydro to provide a balance on the grid. So, I think there's often a false dichotomy. Even in a world where you must reduce demand, you still need really strong technological developments. Both businessman Bill Gates and American journalist David-Wallace Wells have hailed you as the ""Hans Rosling"" of the environmental movement, based on your optimism about the world's potential for positive development. Others however, have cautioned that figures like Rosling go too far in their optimism, and that averages can obscure underlying inequalities between and within nations. How mindful are you of these risks? We can't just look at global averages. In our work at Our World in Data, we show data metrics across countries, not just the global average. This often reveals that, while there are still really large inequalities, on the human-side things are getting better. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 0g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. And finally, you also emphasise that individual behaviour change is no good without systematic change in our wider politics and economies. How hopeful are you, at the start of 2024 with a year of elections ahead, that the world will keep up its positive trajectory on peak-pollution? I think it's a decisive year. I'm quite worried about a few elections: the US [result] will be pivotal. It could significantly slow down the nation's transition – and how other countries respond – if it steps back from climate action. So, it is important that the economic incentives for the energy transition are there. When such incentives exist, this stuff can start to happen even without strong political support. We need to build solutions and setups that can withstand swings from one political side to the other. What makes you most hopeful? The number of amazing people from so many disciplines all working on these problems. I felt very helpless when I felt like I was alone and others weren't working on this. Yet now the picture has changed dramatically. That's what makes me most optimistic we can get there. -- Sign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and hopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman.

Yield Spread Analysis,Johnson: I will repay the trust of voters,2024-09-14,2019-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50776671,"Boris Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit and repay the trust of voters after he led the Conservatives to an ""historic"" general election win. The PM, who has met the Queen to ask to form a new government, has a majority of 80 in the House of Commons - the party's largest since 1987. He said he would work ""flat out"" and lead a ""people's government"". Jeremy Corbyn said he would not fight another election as Labour leader, amid recriminations over the party's defeat.  He said he was ""very sad"" about the result, adding that he had received ""more personal abuse"" from the media during the campaign than any previous prime ministerial candidate. Labour was swept aside by the Conservatives in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and north-eastern England, and lost six seats in Wales.  The Conservatives' victory in the 650th and final contest of the election - the seat of St Ives, in Cornwall - took their total number of MPs up to 365 MPs. Labour finished on 203, the SNP 48, Liberal Democrats 11 and the DUP eight. Sinn Fein has seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four and the SDLP has two. The Green Party and Alliance Party have one each. The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats. The Conservative Party's Commons majority is its largest since Margaret Thatcher won a third term in 1987. Mr Johnson has returned to Downing Street, having visited Buckingham Palace, and is expected to make a statement outside Number 10 this afternoon. In his victory speech earlier, he told activists the election result represented a ""new dawn"" for the country. He thanked Labour voters, many of whom, he said, had backed the Conservatives for the first time, vowing to fulfil the ""sacred trust"" placed in him.  ""You may intend to return to Labour next time round, and if that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me, and I will never take your support for granted,"" he said. Mr Johnson said the Conservatives' victory had ""smashed the roadblock"" in Parliament over Brexit and put an end to the ""miserable threats"" of another referendum on Europe. He said: ""We will get Brexit done on time by 31 January - no ifs, no buts, not maybe."" Johnson's gamble pays off The same prime minister. But a new map.  A victory bigger than the Tories, haunted by 2017, had dreamt of. As the hours ticked by, red flipped to blue, familiar faces forced out of their seats.  Boris Johnson gambled that he could win an election with support from towns and communities where voting Conservative might almost have seemed a sin.  And he won.  The Conservatives' majority will have an almost immediate effect on the country - unless something strange happens we will leave the European Union next month because behind him on the green benches will be new Tory MPs who will vote through his Brexit bill, his position strong enough to subdue any opposition.  At 33%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by former leader Neil Kinnock in 1992. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or, in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley, for the first time since the seat was created. Mr Corbyn said his party had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" but ""Brexit has so polarised debate it has overridden so much of normal political debate"". Some within Labour have blamed the party's support for another Brexit referendum and the long-running anti-Semitism row for the election result. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, regarded as one of the frontrunners to succeed Mr Corbyn, said the result was ""devastating"" and the process of rebuilding the party was a ""very big task"".  Jo Swinson has quit as Liberal Democrat leader after losing her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes.  While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics.  In other developments: Scottish National Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it had been an ""exceptional"" result for her party. She said Scotland had sent a ""very clear message"" that it did not want a Boris Johnson Conservative government and the prime minister did not have a mandate to take Scotland out of the EU.  It was also a ""strong endorsement"" for Scotland having a choice over its own future in another independence referendum, she added. US President Donald Trump congratulated Mr Johnson on a ""great win"" and the EU's top official, Charles Michel said he hoped Parliament would approve the Brexit withdrawal treaty agreed in October as ""soon as possible"".  The legislation paving the way for Brexit on 31 January is due to come before the new Parliament for the first time next Friday. There is expected to be a minor cabinet reshuffle on Monday, to fill vacant positions such as Welsh and culture secretaries. A more thorough reshaping is likely to be put on hold until February, after the UK has left the EU, with a Budget statement in March. What is your question about the election results?

Yield Spread Analysis,Late Gibbs-White goal earns Forest win over Man Utd,2024-09-14,2023-12-29,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67809573,"Gibbs-White has scored two Premier League goals for Forest this season Morgan Gibbs-White scored an 82nd-minute winner as Nottingham Forest recorded their first Premier League victory over Manchester United in 29 years to bring 2023 to a miserable end for Erik ten Hag's side. It looked as if Marcus Rashford had rescued a point for the visitors when he capitalised on a blunder from Forest keeper Matt Turner 12 minutes from time and end his wait of more than six hours for a Premier League goal. But after Turner had redeemed himself with a fine save to deny Christian Eriksen, Forest counter-attacked and Gibbs-White struck the decisive blow from a neat cut-back from former United forward Anthony Elanga. After a tepid first half, Nicolas Dominguez opened the scoring as new manager Nuno Espirito Santo steered Forest to back-to-back victories for only the second time since being promoted back to the top flight. This video can not be played MOTD analysis: How Nottingham Forest punished Manchester United ""What we are trying to do is to create an idea. The talent is there, so it's the confidence to play,"" said Forest manager Nuno, who replaced Steve Cooper earlier this month.  ""It's our responsibility in how we defend. But they have to believe in the idea. The spaces were there and it's a credit to the players because we have only been here for 10 days and they are the ones really working very hard."" It was another desperate night for Ten Hag, and it was in front of Sir Dave Brailsford, who will have a significant say in United's on-field operations following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25% purchase of the club. It was United's 14th defeat of a dreadful campaign, their highest number of losses before the end of a year since 1930-31.  United have been beaten four times in December alone and could end this round of matches in ninth spot, just three points in front of Chelsea. ‘Inconsistent’ & ‘awful’ Man Utd are ‘back to worst’ Reaction to Nottingham Forest v Manchester United Man Utd fans, send your thoughts This video can not be played Man Utd's recent results below our standards - Ten Hag Ten Hag told Brailsford he did not want to speak to him yet because of the packed Christmas programme but has said he feels Ineos are looking forward to working with him. Those talks are bound to happen in January, when United only have a single Premier League game, although whether Ten Hag will want to disrupt preparations before a potentially perilous FA Cup third-round tie at League One Wigan on 8 January is open to debate. It is clear one of the issues Brailsford and fellow Ineos representative Jean Claude-Blanc need to sort out as a matter of priority is recruitment - and there is no greater evidence of where United have gone wrong in that department than Brazil winger Antony. It is 16 months since Ten Hag pushed to sign Antony, United eventually paying £81m for the winger, making him their second most expensive signing after Paul Pogba. Sat together in the directors' box, neither Brailsford nor Sir Alex Ferguson could possibly have been thinking his latest performance made the fee look value for money. The winger's supporters say he does not shirk work and can be trusted to track back.  That may well be true, but it ignores the point there is little end product from him. Towards the end of the first half, Rashford presented him with a shooting opportunity inside the penalty area but before he could decide how to manipulate the position into a chance, Forest defenders surrounded him and the chance disappeared. A few moments later, he shaped as if he was going to take his opponent on at the touchline but, stuck between going down the line or cutting inside as he prefers, he did nothing and the ball ended up going out for a throw.  When he was replaced by Amad Diallo after 54 minutes it meant Antony had failed to score or set up a goal in 21 consecutive appearances.  Amad cost £19m and did not do much to justify that smaller fee either - but the Ivory Coast youngster has only just returned from a serious knee injury, so judgement on him should be reserved. Forest fans, tell us what you think of the victory against Man Utd This video can not be played Forest 'controlled' Manchester United - Nuno Espirito Santo The relief on the face of Forest keeper Turner at the final whistle was clear for all to see. The United States international had a shaky start to the game, with a couple of wayward passes putting the hosts in trouble as he attempted to follow Nuno's demand to play out from the back. His propensity to misplace passes ultimately proved costly as Rashford celebrated an equaliser where the blame lay squarely at his door. An attempt to play out of his area was intercepted by the alert Alejandro Garnacho, who found Rashford and he applied a superb first-time finish. Anguish soon turned to relief for the former Arsenal man, though. His save from Eriksen allowed him to start a counter that ended with Gibbs-White driving home his second goal of the season. ""At half-time the manager said we needed to be more aggressive with and without the ball,"" Gibbs-White told BBC Sport. ""I am delighted to help the boys get the three points. I saw the space was there, stayed composed, breathed, and picked my spot. Thankfully it went in. I believe this club is really creating history.  ""The only way now is forward, especially with the manager coming and the players believing and trusting in him."" As Gibbs-White raced to celebrate with the Trent End faithful, at the other end of the field Turner was repeatedly punching the air. He still had one more bit of work to do, repelling a deflected Bruno Fernandes effort as United pushed forward in desperation - and the ruffle of hair from Moussa Niakhate underlined he had earned a memorable reprieve.  ""We had Morgan Gibbs-White [at Wolves] when he was 16 but now he is a different man and the credit must go to Steve Cooper, because I have found a different player,"" added Nuno.  ""He is mature. What we want from him is to be this guy we can rely on and to give him the ball because he is so talented."""
Yield Spread Analysis,'Root will flourish for years to come',2024-09-14,2013-07-20,Jonathan Agnew,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/23392524,"People talk about luck in sport. Joe Root certainly had that when, on just eight on Friday evening, he edged straight between wicketkeeper and first slip. That should have been the end of it. That he ended Saturday with a fine century to his name, batting England into an impregnable position in this second Test, was because he grabbed his opportunity with both hands and made the absolute maximum he could from it. It rather sums Root up. He looks angelic, but he is as hard as nails and as competitive as anyone in the side. In becoming the youngest Englishman to score an Ashes century at Lord's, he made Australia pay for just one of the many errors they have made in this increasingly one-sided series. The way Root bats, he will score stacks of runs against both this demoralised opposition and other bowling attacks he comes up against in the forthcoming years. I love his style at the crease. He plays with a very straight bat, consolidates when he has to and accelerates when he can. There is little flamboyance about him but a huge amount to admire. The joy of the scenario at Lord's this Saturday was that he was never rushed. With England's lead already past 260 when play began, there were no time pressures on him. He could play himself in against some accurate, testing bowling in the morning session and then pick up the pace when the field spread and the bowlers tired. In terms of the issue of whether he should be opening the batting, he has nailed that one for a long, long time. You could argue that it turned on a very fine margin. Had he gone in single figures, perhaps we would all be asking if he had been moved up from five too soon. But that is what international sport is about. You seize the moment. You ram it home. Injuries permitting, this England opening partnership of Root and Alastair Cook could be together for five, six, seven years. They have youth, they have talent, they have the application. Form can always change, of course, and players hit slumps. But this England set-up sticks with its good players. It does not drop them after a few bad innings, as regimes of the past once did. It is brilliant for the team. Successfully integrating new young players into established teams is a difficult thing. The great Australia team of the past decade could not manage to do it, which is one of the reasons the current incarnation is struggling so much today. With their openers, England seem to have done that, just as they did when Andrew Strauss joined Marcus Trescothick, and then when Strauss was joined by Cook. Great teams are founded on great opening pairs. At the moment, all that is for the future. This England team is not yet a great one; they are a very good team playing well, and they still have some issues to deal with. One of those, for me, is Jonny Bairstow. I'm not convinced he has dealt with his technical flaws. In the first innings here he again looked to me far from entirely convincing. England will be able to persevere with him because they are beating Australia, and beating them so comfortably. There is no pressure on them to make changes. They can afford to give Bairstow the chance to play a similar innings to Root did here. The team with all the issues are the tourists. And one of those is the form of young left-arm spinner Ashton Agar. As well as he batted in that first innings at Trent Bridge, and for all the romance of his back-story - 19 years old, plucked from a spell playing with Henley CC - he is in this team to bowl, and at the moment he is not good enough. It was summed up for me when Root was on 99. Skipper Michael Clarke brought his field up to cut off the single and apply pressure; Agar instead served up a wide long hop, and Root was able to thump it away for the easiest of fours. England were able to bat on, and on, and on. I wasn't surprised that they didn't declare before the close, even with the lead well past 500.  Australia won't score 500 here. But England batted on to put more wear in the pitch, to rub more salt in raw wounds, and because they have two full days in good weather to bowl them out. I expect Cook to captain positively in the field. And I expect England, at some point in the next 48 hours, to go 2-0 up.

Yield Spread Analysis,Robson backs Aberdeen for third despite draw at Saints,2024-09-14,2024-01-24,Thomas Duncan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67937421,"David Kjeltens scored on his St Johnstone debut to earn a draw Aberdeen manager Barry Robson says he still believes his team can finish third in the Scottish Premiership despite a draw at St Johnstone leaving them 16 points adrift of Hearts. Bojan Miovski's second-half penalty - awarded after an on-field review by referee John Beaton found Liam Gordon had kicked Slobodan Rubezic - put Aberdeen in front at McDiarmid Park but they could not hold on for victory. Instead, St Johnstone got their reward for persevering when Graham Carey's cross found debutant David Keltjens, who beat stranded Aberdeen goalkeeper Kelle Roos to the ball and nodded into an empty net. That made up for Carey's brilliant volley being disallowed at 0-0, after a trip to the screen by Beaton found another foul by Saints captain Gordon, this time on Jamie McGrath. The draw nudges Aberdeen above Dundee and into seventh but they are still well behind third-place Hearts, who they face on Saturday at Tynecastle, albeit with three games in hand. ""We've got to believe that, and I believe that [Aberdeen can catch Hearts],"" Robson told BBC Scotland. ""We need to go and try our best to do that. We've still got a few games in hand on them. ""We want to go on a run and perform well. We did it last year. It's going to be a big ask. But we believe and we've got to fight for every point. ""There tonight we had to make sure we got over the line to pick up the three points. That's a learning curve. But we just have to go and win games and get it right in both boxes."" Craig Levein's St Johnstone stay in 10th place, eight points clear of bottom club Livingston having played the same number of matches. All the latest St Johnstone news & analysis Everything you need to know about Aberdeen Daniel Phillips was good again for St Johnstone, but Carey is their creator in chief. He provided the equaliser and had a goal ruled out, creating three chances overall St Johnstone needed a reaction from Saturday's shock cup exit at Airdrieonians, and manager Levein did get it eventually. The first half was poor from both sides, a non-event. However, after the break it was Saints who created the better chances. The foul by Gordon that ended in Carey's goal being chalked off seemed soft, and then to concede a penalty in the same fashion was frustrating. But the hosts bounced back well, with Diallang Jaiyesimi missing two opportunities, and Max Kucheraviyi hitting the frame of the goal. They are still winless in five and have only managed 14 goals in 21 games, but it was a solid home performance. Aberdeen have now played half of their league games and it is unclear what their identity or style of play is. Manager Barry Robson has played a back five for most of the season, but it did not bring solidity or results and drew criticism about an overly direct style. A switch to a back four since the turn of the year has allowed a more possession-based approach, but Aberdeen move the ball too slowly and play with no natural wide players. At McDiarmid it meant they were narrow, slow and predictable, until the end of the match when things became stretched, and Miovski and substitute Ester Sokler had headed chances. When Miovksi stroked in his 17th goal of the season from the spot, Aberdeen reverted to the back five to try to see things out with half an hour to play, but still looked vulnerable and conceded. Saturday's meeting with Hearts is now huge for the Aberdeen manager. Lose and hopes of third spot will fade away, and there is little time to come up with solutions to the team's problems. St Johnstone manager Craig Levein: ""The most pleasing thing for the match tonight was we redeemed ourselves [from Saturday]. Much more unity and togetherness. We have a goal chopped off and a penalty against us. I thought we deserved at least a point. ""The boys are saying the penalty was a penalty. They've been great in every single bar match bar Saturday and for 20 minutes against Kilmarnock. They've been really enthusiastic."" Aberdeen manager Barry Robson: ""We never penetrated or passed it through them enough. Second half the game became a bit basketball.  It does [feel like a missed opportunity].""

Yield Spread Analysis,"South African navy joins search for missing girl, 6",2024-09-14,2024-03-04,By Kyle Zeeman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68468091,"South Africa's navy has joined the search for a six-year-old girl which has transfixed the country. Joslin Smith disappeared from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, two weeks ago. The 300 naval officers join rescuers from the City of Cape Town, a dog unit and drones in the desperate search. Many are asking why she still hasn't been located. A child goes missing every five hours in South Africa, but most are found. Investigators are confident of a breakthrough after bloodied clothing was found in an open field nearby. The items, discovered on Saturday, have been sent to a forensic laboratory for further analysis. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa told the BBC the naval officers were dispatched on Monday to help follow any leads.  It is not common for the navy to assist with civilian searches but they can do so if asked by police.  Saldanha Bay mayor André Truter predicted it would be a ""big day"" for search operations. ""I stood in amazement when I saw how many people from so many different organizations, led by SAPS [South African Police Service], focused on getting the job done! It gave me new hope for finding little Joslin,"" Mr Truter said. Frantic community members searched sewers and pits across the area in the days following the girl's disappearance, with an angry mob also taking to searching homes and accosting neighbours, said Mr Truter. A 100,000 rand ($5,200; £4,100) reward has been offered to anyone with information on her whereabouts, with social media filled with hopes and prayers that Joslin will be found alive. She was left in the care of her mother's boyfriend, Jacquin Appollis, in an informal settlement, when she went missing.  He could not account for her whereabouts, police said.  However, he has denied any involvement in her disappearance. Joslin's mother told local publication The Daily Voice she was not giving up hope.  ""My motherly instincts are telling me my daughter is still alive and in this area. We will find her, I will walk on foot to find her. I will look in every little shack, I'm going to do it by myself if I have to."" The couple have been accused by some community members of having a hand in their daughter's disappearance, a charge they have both denied. They have since been moved to a safehouse for their own safety. Brig Potelwa said the public should not spread false information about Joslin's disappearance or share recordings from the search operations. ""This may adversely impact the investigation. The primary focus of the coordinated efforts should be to find Joslin or what happened to her."""
Yield Spread Analysis,'Root will flourish for years to come',2024-09-14,2013-07-20,Jonathan Agnew,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/23392524,"People talk about luck in sport. Joe Root certainly had that when, on just eight on Friday evening, he edged straight between wicketkeeper and first slip. That should have been the end of it. That he ended Saturday with a fine century to his name, batting England into an impregnable position in this second Test, was because he grabbed his opportunity with both hands and made the absolute maximum he could from it. It rather sums Root up. He looks angelic, but he is as hard as nails and as competitive as anyone in the side. In becoming the youngest Englishman to score an Ashes century at Lord's, he made Australia pay for just one of the many errors they have made in this increasingly one-sided series. The way Root bats, he will score stacks of runs against both this demoralised opposition and other bowling attacks he comes up against in the forthcoming years. I love his style at the crease. He plays with a very straight bat, consolidates when he has to and accelerates when he can. There is little flamboyance about him but a huge amount to admire. The joy of the scenario at Lord's this Saturday was that he was never rushed. With England's lead already past 260 when play began, there were no time pressures on him. He could play himself in against some accurate, testing bowling in the morning session and then pick up the pace when the field spread and the bowlers tired. In terms of the issue of whether he should be opening the batting, he has nailed that one for a long, long time. You could argue that it turned on a very fine margin. Had he gone in single figures, perhaps we would all be asking if he had been moved up from five too soon. But that is what international sport is about. You seize the moment. You ram it home. Injuries permitting, this England opening partnership of Root and Alastair Cook could be together for five, six, seven years. They have youth, they have talent, they have the application. Form can always change, of course, and players hit slumps. But this England set-up sticks with its good players. It does not drop them after a few bad innings, as regimes of the past once did. It is brilliant for the team. Successfully integrating new young players into established teams is a difficult thing. The great Australia team of the past decade could not manage to do it, which is one of the reasons the current incarnation is struggling so much today. With their openers, England seem to have done that, just as they did when Andrew Strauss joined Marcus Trescothick, and then when Strauss was joined by Cook. Great teams are founded on great opening pairs. At the moment, all that is for the future. This England team is not yet a great one; they are a very good team playing well, and they still have some issues to deal with. One of those, for me, is Jonny Bairstow. I'm not convinced he has dealt with his technical flaws. In the first innings here he again looked to me far from entirely convincing. England will be able to persevere with him because they are beating Australia, and beating them so comfortably. There is no pressure on them to make changes. They can afford to give Bairstow the chance to play a similar innings to Root did here. The team with all the issues are the tourists. And one of those is the form of young left-arm spinner Ashton Agar. As well as he batted in that first innings at Trent Bridge, and for all the romance of his back-story - 19 years old, plucked from a spell playing with Henley CC - he is in this team to bowl, and at the moment he is not good enough. It was summed up for me when Root was on 99. Skipper Michael Clarke brought his field up to cut off the single and apply pressure; Agar instead served up a wide long hop, and Root was able to thump it away for the easiest of fours. England were able to bat on, and on, and on. I wasn't surprised that they didn't declare before the close, even with the lead well past 500.  Australia won't score 500 here. But England batted on to put more wear in the pitch, to rub more salt in raw wounds, and because they have two full days in good weather to bowl them out. I expect Cook to captain positively in the field. And I expect England, at some point in the next 48 hours, to go 2-0 up.

Yield Spread Analysis,'I used to be convinced I didn't have a future',2024-09-14,2024-02-08,India Bourke,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240206-hannah-ritchie-sustainability-data-spreads-hope-not-doomism,"Data scientist Hannah Ritchie argues that planetary damage could be about to peak – but that the US election result could be ""pivotal"". In a global survey of young people's feelings about climate change, half recently told researchers that they believe ""humanity is doomed"". In other words, they don't believe that the needs of the current generation can be met without undermining the next. They worry that life as we know it is not sustainable. Data scientist Hannah Ritchie once believed likewise. As a teenager, she feared that humanity's ravaging of the planet – via everything from climate change to deforestation and overfishing – presented a series of unsolvable problems. Her undergraduate degree, begun at Edinburgh University aged just 16, only seemed to confirm these concerns. ""I used to be convinced I didn't have a future left to live for,"" the now 30-year-old writes in her first book, Not the End of the World. Today, however, Ritchie feels differently. While she's still worried about the trajectory the world is on, she believes there's hope humanity can turn things around. As deputy editor at Our World In Data and a senior researcher at the University of Oxford, she points to developments and statistics that tell a more optimistic story, from improving air quality to rising EV sales. Ritchie speaks to BBC Future Planet about what shifted her mindset, why the world might be reaching overall ""peak pollution"" – and ways that a more sustainable future could be secured. What prompted you to change your mind about humanity's future? And why do you now think that ""doomist"" predictions do not inspire action? Climate change has always been part of my life and I've always been quite worried, even as a kid. That got worse when I went to university, because I was studying environmental science and all the trends were very much going in the wrong direction. At the time I felt very anxious, hopeless, and like these problems were completely unsolvable. A key turning point for me was discovering the work of the Swedish physician and statistician Hans Rosling. When I was studying, I'd assumed that all of the human wellbeing metrics – such as global poverty, mortality and hunger – were also getting worse alongside the environmental ones. But Rosling would do TED talks where he'd show, using data, how the world had changed over the last few centuries for the better. So, I started asking: can we do both things at the same time? Can we continue to improve human wellbeing while also reducing our environmental impact? And, over the last 10 years or so, according to the environmental data, there have been signs for cautious optimism. It's not inevitable that we get there, but I think there's the opportunity for us to do so. The problem with doomism is not people thinking that climate change is a really serious problem – because that's also what I think. It is the idea that it's too late to do anything about it. I think the science is very clear that it's never too late; the impacts of climate change are on a spectrum and where we land on that spectrum depends on what we do today. The more action we take, the more climate damage we limit. The feeling of ""it's too late"" just leads to inaction and paralysis. And I know, from feeling that way in the past, that it didn't actually make me very effective in driving solutions forward. Air pollution, climate change, forests, food, biodiversity, ocean plastic and overfishing: all pose vast threats to human and planetary health. But your data analysis has given you hope that a greener future is possible. So what do you think has been the most powerful instance yet of humanity's ability to change for the better? The ozone layer was the climate change problem of its day, and we don't talk about it anymore because it's a problem that we solved. We have reduced the emissions of ozone depleting gasses by more than 99%. It's easy for us to look back now and say that was inevitable. But I think people working on this at the time, faced really strong pushback from governments, as well as from industry, who denied that it was a problem. You see lots of parallels between that and climate change today. Another example is acid rain. This was a big environmental problem that, especially across Europe and North America, we've done a really good job of tackling.

This email is currently available to non-UK readers. In the UK? Sign up for newsletters here. On air pollution more broadly, while it is still a massive health problem, we have seen progress. In rich countries in particular, public policy has been very effective at driving down local air pollution. And China has managed to dramatically reduce levels in many of its cities in a very short period of time.  Your book gives numerous examples of the green transition already underway around the world. There's the possibility we could be approaching peak deaths from air pollution, with rates falling even as the number of people in the world continues to rise. There's your optimism that total emissions will peak in the 2020s, with global per capita CO2 emissions already having done so. There's the passing of peak deforestation. The passing of peak agricultural land. And the reaching of peak petrol car sales. In light of such trends, would you say that the planet has already reached overall ""peak pollution""? That requires aggregating across many different metrics. I'm going to say we're very close to peak pollution. We're very close to peak CO2 emissions: we've been on a plateau for a number of years and I hope we peak and decline soon. On air pollution, we could be very, very close to the peak. And we've passed the peak on some air pollutants already – such as sulphur dioxide, which causes acid rain. We've also peaked on small but significant things like the global sale of combustion-engine cars. So, there are a range of smaller peaks that then build up to get a macro-level peak of pollution. You speak a lot about the positive power of new technology and technological progress. For example, the fact that solar power has gone from the most to the least expensive energy source in just 10 years. What is most helping humanity to unlock peak pollution? The falling cost of low carbon energy – in particular solar, wind and batteries – is essential for us to peak and reduce CO2 emissions. To make progress, these technologies need to be competitive with or cost less than fossil fuels. Without doing that, our hopes of tackling climate change would be really low. So it is good news that many are already cost competitive. What is the biggest barrier to reaching peak pollution? A major factor limiting progress is the lack of investment in the energy transition and clean technologies by fossil fuel companies. They generate extremely large profits that they could re-invest in forward-looking solutions, but they are failing to do so. That doesn't mean ending fossil fuels tomorrow, but it does mean investing in a clean energy future. Another challenge in reaching peak pollution – in terms of both CO2 emissions and air pollution – is the levels of energy poverty in the world. In rich countries, pollution is falling, but it is still rising in low and middle-income nations. That's because you've got billions of people who, quite rightly, want a higher standard of living. For these countries, the priority is not necessarily how to keep pollution low, but how to supply energy quickly and cheaply. Meat-heavy diets pose a particular challenge to passing peak overall pollution – whether that's seen in terms of deforestation or emissions. What would you say to politicians who are wary of telling people what to do when it comes to their diet? I'm much more optimistic on energy transition, and less so on the food system side. Many individuals don't really care where their energy comes from. They might protest the building of a wind or solar farm, but most people don't mind as long as energy is cheap and reliable. Whereas diet is a very personal thing. It's strongly tied to our identity and individual behavioural changes are harder to make than technological ones. I'm sceptical we'll see a long term and large-scale shift to plant-based diets without quite significant technological advances – which can provide people with meat-like products. In general, I'm also very cautious of telling people what they should do. Prescription is ineffective – especially on what people eat but also more broadly. So, for politicians, it's a very fine line to tread. How do you show people the impacts, and the alternatives, but without forcing it on people? Other figures who, like you, emphasise the importance of technology and possibility of continued economic growth, have been termed ""ecomodernists"". And some of the high-tech solutions that this group advocate – from nuclear power to agricultural intensification and cultured meat – have sparked concerns. Is ecomodernism a phrase you identify with? And what would you say to those who warn that sometimes relying on new technology can accelerate environmental decline? There's probably a range of definitions of what an ecomodernist is. For me, technology is just a really strong lever. I don't think technology on its own will save us, but when you're trying to scale solutions for 8 billion people, you need it. Often people try to reach for solutions from the past. They might have worked for a small population of millions, but they don't scale to a population of billions. In agriculture, for example, you can't feed eight billion people without strong technological changes and without increases in crop yield - which we've seen from technological innovations. I'd also push back on nuclear being a new technology: it's been around much longer than solar and wind. You might also like:  If you were to argue that we need to massively shrink individual demand on the planet's resources by changing our behaviours, you would still need a strong technological component. Even if energy demand is lower, for instance, you will still need a lot of solar, wind and batteries. And you'll still probably need nuclear or geothermal or hydro to provide a balance on the grid. So, I think there's often a false dichotomy. Even in a world where you must reduce demand, you still need really strong technological developments. Both businessman Bill Gates and American journalist David-Wallace Wells have hailed you as the ""Hans Rosling"" of the environmental movement, based on your optimism about the world's potential for positive development. Others however, have cautioned that figures like Rosling go too far in their optimism, and that averages can obscure underlying inequalities between and within nations. How mindful are you of these risks? We can't just look at global averages. In our work at Our World in Data, we show data metrics across countries, not just the global average. This often reveals that, while there are still really large inequalities, on the human-side things are getting better. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 0g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. And finally, you also emphasise that individual behaviour change is no good without systematic change in our wider politics and economies. How hopeful are you, at the start of 2024 with a year of elections ahead, that the world will keep up its positive trajectory on peak-pollution? I think it's a decisive year. I'm quite worried about a few elections: the US [result] will be pivotal. It could significantly slow down the nation's transition – and how other countries respond – if it steps back from climate action. So, it is important that the economic incentives for the energy transition are there. When such incentives exist, this stuff can start to happen even without strong political support. We need to build solutions and setups that can withstand swings from one political side to the other. What makes you most hopeful? The number of amazing people from so many disciplines all working on these problems. I felt very helpless when I felt like I was alone and others weren't working on this. Yet now the picture has changed dramatically. That's what makes me most optimistic we can get there. -- Sign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and hopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman.

Yield Spread Analysis,Johnson: I will repay the trust of voters,2024-09-14,2019-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50776671,"Boris Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit and repay the trust of voters after he led the Conservatives to an ""historic"" general election win. The PM, who has met the Queen to ask to form a new government, has a majority of 80 in the House of Commons - the party's largest since 1987. He said he would work ""flat out"" and lead a ""people's government"". Jeremy Corbyn said he would not fight another election as Labour leader, amid recriminations over the party's defeat.  He said he was ""very sad"" about the result, adding that he had received ""more personal abuse"" from the media during the campaign than any previous prime ministerial candidate. Labour was swept aside by the Conservatives in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and north-eastern England, and lost six seats in Wales.  The Conservatives' victory in the 650th and final contest of the election - the seat of St Ives, in Cornwall - took their total number of MPs up to 365 MPs. Labour finished on 203, the SNP 48, Liberal Democrats 11 and the DUP eight. Sinn Fein has seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four and the SDLP has two. The Green Party and Alliance Party have one each. The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats. The Conservative Party's Commons majority is its largest since Margaret Thatcher won a third term in 1987. Mr Johnson has returned to Downing Street, having visited Buckingham Palace, and is expected to make a statement outside Number 10 this afternoon. In his victory speech earlier, he told activists the election result represented a ""new dawn"" for the country. He thanked Labour voters, many of whom, he said, had backed the Conservatives for the first time, vowing to fulfil the ""sacred trust"" placed in him.  ""You may intend to return to Labour next time round, and if that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me, and I will never take your support for granted,"" he said. Mr Johnson said the Conservatives' victory had ""smashed the roadblock"" in Parliament over Brexit and put an end to the ""miserable threats"" of another referendum on Europe. He said: ""We will get Brexit done on time by 31 January - no ifs, no buts, not maybe."" Johnson's gamble pays off The same prime minister. But a new map.  A victory bigger than the Tories, haunted by 2017, had dreamt of. As the hours ticked by, red flipped to blue, familiar faces forced out of their seats.  Boris Johnson gambled that he could win an election with support from towns and communities where voting Conservative might almost have seemed a sin.  And he won.  The Conservatives' majority will have an almost immediate effect on the country - unless something strange happens we will leave the European Union next month because behind him on the green benches will be new Tory MPs who will vote through his Brexit bill, his position strong enough to subdue any opposition.  At 33%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by former leader Neil Kinnock in 1992. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or, in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley, for the first time since the seat was created. Mr Corbyn said his party had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" but ""Brexit has so polarised debate it has overridden so much of normal political debate"". Some within Labour have blamed the party's support for another Brexit referendum and the long-running anti-Semitism row for the election result. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, regarded as one of the frontrunners to succeed Mr Corbyn, said the result was ""devastating"" and the process of rebuilding the party was a ""very big task"".  Jo Swinson has quit as Liberal Democrat leader after losing her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes.  While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics.  In other developments: Scottish National Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it had been an ""exceptional"" result for her party. She said Scotland had sent a ""very clear message"" that it did not want a Boris Johnson Conservative government and the prime minister did not have a mandate to take Scotland out of the EU.  It was also a ""strong endorsement"" for Scotland having a choice over its own future in another independence referendum, she added. US President Donald Trump congratulated Mr Johnson on a ""great win"" and the EU's top official, Charles Michel said he hoped Parliament would approve the Brexit withdrawal treaty agreed in October as ""soon as possible"".  The legislation paving the way for Brexit on 31 January is due to come before the new Parliament for the first time next Friday. There is expected to be a minor cabinet reshuffle on Monday, to fill vacant positions such as Welsh and culture secretaries. A more thorough reshaping is likely to be put on hold until February, after the UK has left the EU, with a Budget statement in March. What is your question about the election results?

Yield Spread Analysis,How to spot a manipulated image,2024-09-14,2024-03-11,Richard Gray,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240311-how-to-spot-a-manipulated-image,"Amid allegations that an official photograph of the Princess of Wales had been ""manipulated"", here are some clues that can help you identify if an image has been altered or faked. In a world where pictures can be digitally altered with just a few clicks or even generated entirely from scratch by artificial intelligence (AI), it is becoming ever harder to trust what our eyes see. The techniques used to manipulate images are so sophisticated that we have entered the era of the hyper-realistic fake. Such images can lead to the spread of misinformation and could even influence public opinion in important events such as elections. With a picture of the Princess of Wales and her children being withdrawn by news agencies amid concerns it had been ""manipulated"", the issue has been thrown into the spotlight like never before. The Princess of Wales later apologised for making the changes to the image, stating that ""like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing"". (Learn more about how Kate's photo may have been altered in this analysis from BBC Verify.) But is there anything we can do to spot an image that might have been altered or AI generated? Abnormal lighting is often a giveaway that a photograph has been altered. Check the points of light in people's eyes, for example; the source of light will often be reflected in their eyes. If the size and colour don't match with the location, or if they look different between the eyes, then you might have cause to be suspicious. The way subjects and objects appear in reflective surfaces in an image can also provide clues. Shadows of objects in the image may not line up if it has been pieced together from multiple pictures, although bear in mind that some pictures can be taken with multiple lighting sources. It's worth looking at the way light plays across a subject's face. If the Sun is behind them, for example, their ears might look red. Artificial intelligence can also produce incongruent lighting and shadows, but as algorithms improve, AI-generated faces are often perceived as being more real than human faces. Another tell-tale approach is to look for features that are hard to replicate. AI is currently poor at rendering hands and ears, mangling their shapes, proportions and even the number of fingers. These are the same features that often trouble artists, but as other aspects of AI-generated images of people become hyper-real, these inaccuracies create an uncanny valley that looks unnatural to our eyes. You might also like: Look out for unusual or unnatural positioning of limbs or clothing in an image, which can be a sign that a portion of it has been copied or manipulated in some way. But also remember that the flattening of the three dimensional world into a two dimensional image can make things look a little out of place at times too. One test to apply is to look at other elements of the image in the same field of focus and position. Do they look blurry compared to other features nearby in the same depth in the photograph, or are they being ruffled by a breeze in the same way? Hidden within the code of digital images are nuggets of information that can help to pinpoint a fake. Every time a digital camera snaps an image, metadata is written into the image file. Timestamps, for example, led to questions about whether President Donald Trump was in fact at work in the White House the day after revealing he had caught Covid-19 in October 2020. Every digital camera sensor features tiny manufacturing faults that lead to unique errors that leave a kind of ""fingerprint"" on pictures. This is then associated with a specific camera and can help to identify areas of a photograph that have been manipulated. The grain of an AI-generated image can also look peculiar. Internet companies such as Google have launched image verification tools that can help people to spot AI-generated images. Facebook and Instagram have started labelling AI-generated images that come from Meta's own systems and is planning to do the same for pictures generated by other companies' AI tools. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

Yield Spread Analysis,Managerless Aberdeen end winless run at Motherwell,2024-09-14,2024-03-16,Nick McPheat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68519702,"This video can not be played 'Absolutely ridiculous' to disallow Motherwell goal Managerless Aberdeen eased concerns over their Scottish Premiership future by ending an 11-game winless league run with a hard-fought victory at Motherwell. The Pittodrie side remain just three points above the relegation play-off spot, but a resolute performance at Fir Park will provide encouragement to a fanbase who were beginning fear the worst. Leighton Clarkson's 25th-minute goal, leathered in on the rebound after Bojan Miovski struck the left-hand post, was more than deserved and proved to be decisive. Motherwell thought they had levelled when Lennon Miller's strike ricocheted in off Aberdeen defender Angus MacDonald, but referee Willie Collum ruled it out when an on-field review showed the ball hitting Theo Bair's hand before it reached his team-mate. More polished finishing and better decision-making may have had the visitors sitting on an increased lead, but failure to add a second made for some nervy moments against a home side who also spurned their own openings. Just a second league win of the year sends Aberdeen up to ninth and moves them within two points of eighth-placed Motherwell, who are now looking over their shoulder again. Keep up to date with Motherwell Latest Aberdeen news, views & analysis ""I'm delighted with the win, performance and clean sheet,"" Aberdeen caretaker manager Peter Leven told BBC Scotland. ""We were brave on the ball. That was the best way to get the result and we did that. ""We had to dig deep, we knew they were going to throw everything at us, but Kelle [Roos] was superb. The backline and midfield were brilliant as well."" Two potential goal-saving blocks from an inspired away defence denied Bair and Dan Casey a first-half goal, as did the impressive Kelle Roos when he thwarted Sam Nicholson. Roos was on hand again to foil Bair after the break, twice in a matter of seconds at his front post, before the Canada striker glanced a header just wide. Last-ditch stops from defence and goalkeeper also denied Aberdeen, with Casey's face getting in the way of Jamie McGrath's strike after Liam Kelly had tipped over a fierce effort from Miovski, who was much-improved despite failing to score for an eighth straight game. A source of criticism recently, the Aberdeen goalkeeper made crucial saves at crucial moments to bail out a gutsy defence ""We're in trouble"" was the message from Leven after a feeble defeat at Dundee on Wednesday. But this victory will send Aberdeen into the international break in a far better frame of mind, with the appointment of a new manager expected by the time they return to action. The away side's mentality has been fragile of late, but they withstood spells of pressure in Lanarkshire and posed far more of a threat in comparison to recent league games. Stuart Kettlewell felt hard done by watching on in the home dugout, with the handball of Bair ruling out an equaliser and an incident he thought was similar on Graeme Shinnie in the Aberdeen box going unpunished. The Motherwell manager will perhaps also look back on his team selection with regret. The decision to start Paul McGinn and Stephen O'Donnell, who both played so well at Ibrox a fortnight ago, did not give the hosts enough drive in wide areas. And Miller was often left isolated in midfield, with the more attack-minded duo of Blair Spittal and Sam Nicholson playing either side of the teenager.  The half-time introductions of Georgie Gent and Andy Halliday - who sliced a golden close-range opportunity into the hands of Roos - changed that, but going with the pair from the off may have resulted in a different outcome. This video can not be played 'No level of consistency' with VAR, says Kettlewell Motherwell manager Stuart Kettlewell: ""I said to the players we take ownership for our performance, but that doesn't stop me from looking at some of the incidents in this game and how silly this is all becoming. ""We had an incident earlier in the season against Ross County. We were told unequivocally at that point because it wasn't the guy who scored the goal who handballed it, that stands and that counts. ""I would love someone to tell me what the difference is today. We're not getting any level of consistency [with VAR]."" Aberdeen caretaker manager Peter Leven: ""At times we could've scored more, but I'm delighted with the three points. We can't look at other teams around us. It's all about us and what we can do. ""I don't look at what happened elsewhere. We can't affect what happens elsewhere and the boys just need to keep getting results and keep climbing the table.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Markets drop as tech slowdown fears grow,2024-09-14,2018-11-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46272632,"A sell-off on Wall Street continued on Tuesday, amid steep declines in oil prices and losses among technology shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 550 points to close 2.2% lower, weighed down by Apple, whose share price plunged by nearly 5%. The broader S&P 500 dropped 1.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 1.7% to its lowest level since February. Meanwhile, benchmark oil prices sank nearly 7%, close to one-year lows. Connor Campbell at Spreadex described the sell-off as a ""macro-car crash, with Brexit fears, the post-Apec pre-G20 US-China trade war flare-up and the continuation of a nasty US tech sell-off resulting in absolute carnage"". It also reflects underlying concerns about slowing global growth, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. In the US, a robust economy had so far largely shielded stock markets from some of those worries. However, Mr Behravesh said investors now expect a boost from tax cuts and increased government spending to fade. ""This stimulus will wear off by late 2019 and early 2020, and the US economy will join the others in seeing a significant loss of speed,"" he said.  US retailers were punished for weak results and forecasts, with shares in Target sinking 10%, while Kohl's tumbled 9% and Walmart was dragged almost 3% lower. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their price target for Apple shares from $209 to $182, blaming very weak demand from China in the late summer as well as a stronger US dollar. Michael O'Rouke at Jonestrading said retailers as well as big technology firms such as Amazon and Facebook had pushed the market higher for most of this year.  ""Now that's fading, so people are more apt to take profit and de-risk going into the year-end. There are the headwinds of the trade war out there. The fiscal stimulus from tax cuts is starting to fade ... we don't have many positive catalysts,"" he said. By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent  The balloons will soon be inflated for the Thanksgiving Day parade just as the air seems to be coming out of the US markets. Tuesday's sell-off seemed to be sparked by disappointing earnings from several retailers. Aside from that, Wall Street traders offered up several reasons for the recent volatility. One was President Trump's trade war with China. Any escalation could hurt US and Chinese companies by raising production costs and the price for consumers. Another was the prospect that America's central bank could raise interest rates to combat inflation and stop the economy from overheating. This makes it more expensive for companies to borrow and invest. Whatever is behind the latest stock market gyrations, it's worth remembering that the current bull market is the oldest in history.  For months some have warned that the US market is overvalued. In which case what you may be witnessing is a shift as investors move from chasing yield - financial jargon for the return on their investment - to managing risk. The US market falls extended declines in Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 index slipped back below 7,000 points. The DAX index in Frankfurt fell 1.5%, while in Paris, the CAC 40 was 1.2% lower.  IHS Markit said the market swings are starting to hurt business sentiment and capital spending. But analysts at Oxford Economics said they think the effect on consumer spending - the biggest economic driver in the US - is likely to be relatively muted. The firm wrote: ""This doesn't mean the economy is insulated from stock market movements, but rather that so long as those movements don't excessively weigh on confidence, employment and income, consumers can be expected to continue spending.""  Since market turmoil emerged in earnest in October, all three major US indexes have largely given up the gains made earlier in 2018. Oil prices for the major benchmarks are also down about 30% since last month. On Tuesday, Brent crude fell by 6.5% to $62.58 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate shed 6.8% to $53.41 a barrel.  Hans Redeker at Morgan Stanley commented: ""For the US equity market to stabilise, either the rest of the world will have to show better growth or the Fed will have to moderate its stance."""
Yield Spread Analysis,Major jobs announcement at investment summit,2024-09-14,2023-09-13,By Clodagh Rice & Niall Glynn,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-66789881,"Professional services firm EY is creating 1,000 jobs in Northern Ireland over the next five years in areas like cyber security and data analytics. The new jobs - paying an average of £33,000 a year - will be based in Belfast and at a new hub in the north west. They have been supported by Invest NI and the Department for the Economy.  They were announced at the Northern Ireland Investment Summit in Belfast on Wednesday. More than 100 global investors and businesses were in Belfast for the investment summit, essentially a big sales pitch for Northern Ireland. Secretary of State for Business and Trade Kemi Badenoch told the summit that Northern Ireland had a unique trading position with a ""seamless land border within the single market and within an internal UK market"". ""When you back this country, you're joining a growing list of businesses and investors who also recognise these opportunities,"" she said. She added: ""It is our responsibility to promote all parts of Northern Ireland, especially the north-west, not just this great city of Belfast where we meet today."" ""That is something the government is trying to ensure, that we are levelling up across the UK but also across Northern Ireland.  ""I'm convinced that Northern Ireland has an amazing future."" The summit has been organised by the UK Department for Business and Trade and the Northern Ireland Office, together with Northern Ireland's inward investment agency Invest NI. The government said about 120 investors and businesses from around the globe attended. Addressing the summit on Wednesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said those who doubted the importance of the Good Friday Agreement should ""just take a look around you"". ""During the Troubles an event like this would have been impossible,"" he said, referencing the peace accord which helped to end the decades-long conflict. Mr Heaton-Harris said he had hoped the Northern Ireland Executive would have been up and running for the summit so its ministers could have discussed ideas with investors, but ""sadly this has proven not to be the case"". Stormont's second-largest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), walked out of power-sharing in February 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland. ""My team and I have worked intensively with the DUP and indeed all the main Northern Ireland political parties throughout the summer and I am genuinely hopeful that progress will be unlocked very, very soon,"" said Mr Heaton-Harris. EY's investment announcement will bring the company's Northern Ireland workforce to 1,900. The firm's Northern Ireland managing partner, Rob Heron, said there had been increased demand across the firm's business areas in recent years.  EY Northern Ireland will be running an Assured Skills Academy Programme alongside the Department for the Economy (DFE) to deliver a pipeline of talent in areas like cyber security and data analytics. It will focus on individuals such as those seeking to return to work following a career break, those wishing to change career, or recent graduates looking for an alternative route into professional services.   DfE Permanent Secretary Mike Brennan said his department's Assured Skills Academies would help to fill more than 350 jobs across a range of roles and skills areas. These include data and analytics, cyber security, procurement and commercial contract management and project and programme management. The Windsor Framework, like its predecessor the Northern Ireland Protocol, keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That is primarily to prevent the hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But it also means Northern Ireland manufacturers have better access to the EU than companies in other parts of the UK. Northern Ireland companies do not face new post-Brexit bureaucracy when exporting goods to the EU. Additionally, there are no checks and controls on Northern Ireland goods being sold to the rest of UK. That means that if an American manufacturer wanted to serve both the UK and EU markets it could set up in Northern Ireland to minimise customs and regulatory bureaucracy on exports. The jobs being announced today by EY are in services rather than manufacturing, so the Windsor Framework has no bearing on them. The chief executive of Invest NI told the BBC that over the next 12 months he anticipates ""more and more announcements as people begin to understand how the framework will work in practice"". There are currently more than 230 US businesses in Northern Ireland which employ more than 30,000 people, said the US special envoy, Joe Kennedy.  ""The peace dividend, in order for Northern Ireland to wholly reach its potential, that has to be felt more broadly, it has to be spread more widely across society,"" he said. ""And so there's obviously a role and responsibility there, or an opportunity there, for business."" Members of the NI Business Alliance welcomed the chance to showcase local talent. A partnership between CBI NI, the Centre for Competitiveness, the Institute of Directors NI and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, the Business Alliance said Northern Ireland was ""uniquely positioned as a gateway to two of the world's largest markets"". ""Unfettered and flexible access to the EU and UK makes this the only jurisdiction in the world from which business can sell into GB and the EU free of customs and regulatory barriers,"" it said. The Business Alliance said investors and businesses alike valued certainty and it remains ""optimistic about the prospect of more positive discussions around the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive"".

Yield Spread Analysis,Aberdeen's home streak continues in win over Hibs,2024-09-14,2022-11-04,Jack Herrall,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63422251,"Bojan Miovski nods in his side's second to put Aberdeen in firm control Aberdeen kept up their rampant home form to leapfrog Hibernian into third place in the Scottish Premiership with an absorbing win at Pittodrie. Bojan Miovski slotted home a retaken penalty at the end of the first half after some protracted discussions with VAR, and nodded home his second the other side of the interval. Ylber Ramadani and Leighton Clarkson scored impressive strikes either side of Mykola Kukharevych's tap in for Hibs, which was awarded after a lengthy VAR intervention. It means Jim Goodwin's side have now scored four goals in five of their last seven home matches in all competitions, with Hibs having lost four of their last five games. Reaction & as it happened Get all your Aberdeen news Visit our dedicated Hibs page With the controversy surrounding the reverse fixture between these sides still very much at the forefront of pre-match chat, many anticipated some early fireworks. They weren't disappointed.  Both sides showed good attacking impetus in the opening stages as Luis Lopes and Joe Newell had chances for either team but failed to convert.  Hibs' Kukharevych fired an edge-of-the-area free-kick before Lopes managed to get in behind the away side's high line, but his angled shot was stopped a few yards from cross the line. Ewan Henderson then had a header expertly saved by Kelle Roos. As a fairly end-to-end 45 minutes were coming to an end, Jayden Richardson slipped in Lopes, who appeared to trip on the hand of David Marshall as he dived for the ball. A penalty was given, then saved, then retaken as the Hibs captain was not properly on his line as he sprung to save the initial shot. At the second time of asking Miovski slotted home with a brief rammy ensuing in the following moments.  The drama continued after the interval as Hibs, who had been marginally the first half's better side, found themselves two goals down when Clarkson's cross found the unmarked Miovski who leapt, unchallenged, and nodded in his second of the match. It was soon three as Ramadani lashed home his first goal for the club with a fine volley that skipped up off of the turf before VAR allowed Kukharevych's goal to stand despite an initial on-field decision of offside. The hosts didn't settle however, with Clarkson reaching a low Marley Watkins cross to emphatically backheel in. The 21-year-old looked like a seasoned pro in the middle of the park. A goal, an assist, his side's highest passes and entries into the final third. Immense. An open encounter, as this was, will always have goals in it, but Aberdeen's defensive strength was impressive throughout, too. Whereas Hibs were easily carved open, the home side often stood firm with Anthony Stewart and Liam Scales both looking formidable.   For Hibs, it may be a bit of a head scratcher. Seventeen shots, six on target, and 1.44xG to Aberdeen's 1.93, but three goals fewer. They dominated the ball with 61% possession, but failed to create enough in the way of goal-scoring opportunities. A common theme of late for Lee Johnson's side. Aberdeen manager Jim Goodwin: ""I didn't think there was much between these teams pre-match, the scoreline may suggest we were well on top and gave Hibs a tough time but people at the game will realise it was a lot closer than the scoreline would suggest. ""All in all you've got to be pleased. I'd have taken a scrappy 1-0 before the game so the fact we've been able to entertain the fans and score four goals, I don't know the exact number but I know we've scored a considerable amount here, I'm delighted to go and entertain the fans again tonight."" Hibernian head coach Lee Johnson: ""Anger and frustration [are my overriding emotions]. We came here with good intentions to play forward, to win the game, to counter well and I thought we did that really well for 45 minutes until the injury time that led to the penalty. ""It was difficult for me as I didn't feel like it was absolutely clear and obvious. It took an age to get through and if it takes that long then it's probably not. I suppose I'm bad in that sense.  It's a club with prestige, it's a club that expects to be up there and those soft underbelly tones are not good enough.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Germany 'winner' Popp conquering Euros heartache,2024-09-14,2022-07-30,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62333465,"This video can not be played 'You could not make this up!' - Popp heads Germany back into lead When England face Germany in the European Championship final on Sunday, one player in particular will feel relief at just being at the Wembley showpiece. In the lead up to the event, veteran German captain Alexandra Popp, 31, almost saw her wretched injury curse strike again. The Wolfsburg striker's Euro 2013 dream was wrecked because of ankle ligament damage and she had to watch from the sidelines as her team-mates lifted the trophy. She missed the tournament again four years later with a knee problem. Then, last April, she suffered a serious knee injury which kept her out for 11 months, only returning in March, and she would have missed the tournament once more had it not been postponed because of the pandemic. But she has returned to action stronger than ever - even testing positive for Covid three weeks before the start could not keep her out of the team this time. England-Germany final will be 'a football feast' How to watch the final on the BBC This video can not be played 'Popp is a threat' - Bright relishes facing Germany forward While she has a fearsome reputation on the pitch, off it the striker is a relaxed presence around the team. Wolfsburg team-mate Pia-Sophie Wolter told BBC Sport ""Poppi"" - as she is affectionately known - is someone who is ""very open"" with everybody and is ""always joking around"". Wolter said: ""As we were doing rehab together she would spread her good mood and put on Disney songs in our gym every Friday. Singing along to all of them - a great talent of hers. ""The same goes for her mentality, somebody who is throwing herself in every ball, really giving 100%. The team is always at the forefront. ""When you are standing on the pitch with her, she is a player who lifts you up, keeps you going and is an absolute leader. She is someone you really enjoy playing in the same team with."" Alexandra Popp helped Wolfsburg win the DFB Cup final in May after returning from injury Popp has seen it all - winners' medals from the Champions League, Bundesliga, U20 World Cup and Olympic Games are all stacked in her trophy cabinet. However, triumphing at the Euros remains elusive but she looks determined to make up for lost time this year. The 31-year-old didn't start the opener against Denmark, but came off the bench to net an 86th-minute goal in the 4-0 thrashing of Denmark. She has been undroppable since, with further strikes against Spain and Finland in the group stages, against Austria in the quarter-finals and a double in the semi-final with France. Former France defender Laura Georges said on BBC One: ""You can see that every time she scores, everyone is around her because they know she has been struggling. ""She is such an important player on and off the field and people are so happy to see her score. She is lifting this team."" Former England international Fara Williams added: ""Alex Popp was waiting for her moment in this tournament. ""She wasn't even in the starting XI in the opening game. It came down to an injury and a substitution. She came on, scored that fourth goal and took her chance. ""That is what players that are hungry do, that is what winners do and Popp is a winner, she has been renowned for that over the years."" This video can not be played Analysis: Alexandra Popp's goals from Germany's semi-final win over France Two people who know all about Popp's qualities having faced her as an opponent are Scotland defender Jen Beattie and former England international Anita Asante. Playing for Swedish side FC Rosengard, Asante was part of a team which conceded two goals to Popp during a Champions League quarter-final with Wolfsburg.  ""That still haunts me to this day,"" Asante told Radio 5 Live's Daily Euros podcast. ""When you see her on the pitch, she is an intimidating figure. ""She's lethal in the air. I don't know if many people really can understand how good she is in the air. Her aerial ability, the power, the leap that she has, and her ability to use her physicality - that's one of her super strengths."" Former England defender Anita Asante didn't enjoy her meeting with Alexandra Popp in the Champions League quarter-finals Beattie, who has faced Popp as an Arsenal player, picked out the German's clever movement as one of her key assets. ""Popp doesn't necessarily run you down for 90 minutes, but she'll pick those intelligent moments to do it. She sniffs out that moment when you're hesitant."" Popp put in a match-winning performance against France to take Germany through to their ninth Euros final, while also becoming the first player ever to score in five consecutive games at the tournament by netting twice in the 2-1 victory. Her first goal was a sublime volley, outmuscling French right-back Eve Perisset, before scoring the winner with a thumping header, rising above the towering centre-half Wendie Renard to power home. However, German football journalist Annika Becker says she offers more than just her goal threat. ""She's very important for the team as a team player. She's got great vision, with her passing and build-up play. That's not mentioned enough about her."" And for Popp it's all about the team prize this Sunday, despite her being tied in the race for the Golden Boot, along with England's Beth Mead on six goals apiece. ""The Golden Boot is not my priority - my priority is to win the Euros. If I have the chance to crown the title with that achievement, it would be nice. But if it doesn't happen, then I'll still be happy.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Germany beat France to set up final with England,2024-09-14,2022-07-26,Michael Emons,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62301014,"This video can not be played Highlights - Germany beat France 2-1 to reach final Eight-time European champions Germany will play England in the Euro 2022 final at Wembley on Sunday after they beat France in a dramatic semi-final in Milton Keynes. After a quiet opening 40 minutes, Alexandra Popp put Germany ahead with a volley from Svenja Huth's cross from the right side of the penalty area for her fifth goal in five games. However, their lead only lasted four minutes before Kadidiatou Diani broke free and shot from outside the penalty area, with her effort hitting the post and bouncing in off unfortunate goalkeeper Merle Frohms. The Germany goalkeeper made three vital saves to keep it at 1-1 before Popp headed in her sixth goal of the tournament, taking her level with England's Beth Mead as joint leading scorer, for what proved to be the winner. Sunday's final takes place at a sold out Wembley, which will have a capacity of 87,200, and the match could set a new attendance record for a match in a European Championship, either male or female. England, looking to win the tournament for the first time, thrashed Sweden, the highest-ranked European side, 4-0 at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane on Tuesday. Germany v France as it happened, plus reaction and analysis England-Germany final will be a 'football feast' There had been fears that the national rail strike, which saw a reduced service at Milton Keynes Central and with no trains after 18:30 BST, would severely affect the attendance at Stadium MK. But that was not the case as a crowd of 27,445 - the ninth highest in the history of the tournament - produced a great atmosphere for the match between two of the top five ranked teams in the world. However, both sides struggled to create chances in the opening 40 minutes, with Popp's 25-yard free-kick that was pushed wide by France goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin the only notable effort. That changed when Popp became the first player in the competition to ever score in five consecutive games, continuing a remarkable tournament for the Wolfsburg striker, who returned to action in March after 10 months out because of a serious knee injury. Before that goal the crowd had produced a Mexican Wave, generally seen as a sign that things could be better on the pitch, but that Popp volley, in which she showed great technique, sparked the game into life. Four minutes later Diani was instrumental in the equaliser as her shot struck the post, hit the back of Frohms and went into the net for the first goal Germany have conceded in their fifth match of the tournament. But France, playing in their first European semi-final, had three chances in a three-minute spell midway through the second half as they pushed to take the lead. First off, Diani did excellently to get to the byeline, and her pullback found substitute Selma Bacha, who spun and shot but saw it parried by Frohms. Then from the resulting corner, France captain Wendie Renard nearly got her first goal of the tournament, rising superbly at the back post and heading at goal, only for Frohms to save it with her legs. Frohms then saved again from Diani and for a rare moment in this tournament, Germany were looking vulnerable. But, just when they needed inspiration, it came from captain Popp as she powered a header into the net from another Huth pass as her side retook the lead. France, who also lost in the semi-finals of both the 2011 World Cup and 2012 London Olympics, pushed forwards in search of an equaliser that would have taken it to extra time. But they could not level for a second time as Germany held on to set up a Wembley showdown with Sarina Wiegman's England on Sunday. This video can not be played 'You could not make this up!' - Popp heads Germany back into lead Germany coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg: ""I feel pure pride for this achievement and these players from numbers one to 23.  ""We have worked so hard and have become such a tight-knit bunch who support each other on the field. We totally deserved to win. ""France made a change for the second half after only having one shot on goal before the break. We knew that they could do more offensively and hurt us.  ""It was a terrific team effort to [contain them]; that's what we wanted. It worked out in the end but it was super-exciting and super-exhausting."" France boss Corinne Diacre: ""We saw that some of the French players were not on par with their normal level of fitness but we didn't give up or throw in the towel.  ""Maybe if we had an extra 48 hours [to rest] the game would've been different but I don't think we should take this win away from Germany. ""We came up against a very strong and beautifully athletic team. The disappointment is quite heavy in the air right now and we need to stick together. ""Obviously disappointment is the overriding feeling right now because we have lost this match, but we have got foundations to build on and we just need a bit of time.

""Alex Popp was waiting for her moment in this tournament. She wasn't even in the starting 11 in the opening game.  ""It came down to an injury and a substitution.

Yield Spread Analysis,Wales in danger of World Cup exit after Iran loss,2024-09-14,2022-11-24,Dafydd Pritchard,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63603418,"This video can not be played World Cup 2022: Wayne Hennessey sees red as Wales lose 2-0 to Iran Wales' first World Cup for 64 years looks set to end at the first hurdle after a gut-wrenching - but deserved - last-ditch defeat by Iran in Qatar. Substitute Roozbeh Cheshmi struck from 20 yards nine minutes into stoppage time, before Ramin Rezaeian finished off a counter-attack to seal victory for a revitalised Iran side, who have renewed hope of reaching the knockout stages for the first time in their history. Those were decisive blows to Welsh prospects of victory, which had all but vanished when goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey was sent off with four minutes of normal time remaining, following a video assistant referee check, for a reckless challenge on Medhi Taremi. As they did in their opening draw with the United States, Wales started poorly and had the video assistant referee (VAR) to thank for disallowing a goal from Iran's Ali Gholizadeh for offside. Wales' magic moments run out for Bale and Ramsey What do England and Wales need to do to qualify for last 16? 'It's gutting - there's no other way to say it' - Bale admits reaching last 16 'will be difficult' for Wales In one of the most highly charged atmospheres of this World Cup, Iran's players sang their national anthem this time - having declined to do so before their opening loss to England in an apparent show of support for anti-government protests in their country - but their own fans booed the anthem and some could be seen crying in the stands. Roared on by the fervent and almost entirely Iranian crowd, Carlos Queiroz's side were extremely unlucky not to score early in the second half as Sardar Azmoun and Gholizadeh both struck the post within the space of a few seconds. Wales were utterly ragged and, as they pushed forward in search of the late winning goal they desperately needed, a long ball over the top left the defence exposed and the onrushing Hennessey brought down Taremi. Hennessey was initially shown a yellow card, but it was changed to a red after the referee was advised to check on the pitchside monitor, with the 35-year-old becoming only the third keeper to be sent off at a World Cup. This video can not be played World Cup 2022: Wayne Hennessey sent off for reckless challenge on Mehdi Taremi That set the seal on Wales' fate for this match and, in all likelihood, their hopes of reaching the second round. While Robert Page's men were just as disjointed as they were against the USA, Iran were unrecognisable from the team thrashed 6-2 by England in their first match and fully deserved this win. Wales now face the formidable challenge of needing to win their final group match on Tuesday against England, who take on the United States later on Friday. It is not impossible but, based on how the Group B teams have fared so far in Qatar, Wales' first World Cup for 64 years looks like it is in serious danger of ending at the earliest stage. Bale voted your worst player in Wales' loss to Iran How Wales 0-2 Iran unfolded Having been absent from World Cups since 1958, Wales marked their emotional and long-awaited return to football's grandest stage with a 1-1 draw against the United States at the same stadium on Monday. They seemed overawed by the magnitude of that occasion during a first half in which they were overrun and outplayed by the USA, but were much improved after the half-time introduction of Kieffer Moore. The Bournemouth striker started this time and, while his presence gave Wales an added dimension in attack, they were still as worryingly porous in midfield, as they had been against the US. Iran sensed that weakness and pressed their opponents high up the pitch, prompting panic among Wales' midfielders and defenders, particularly on the break. Despite their vulnerability through the middle, where Page had stuck with the same selection, Wales looked more dangerous when they played with width, and it was Moore who stood to benefit. Connor Roberts found the 6ft 5in forward with a fine cross from the right in the 13th minute and, although Moore stretched to connect with a volley, it was straight at goalkeeper Hossein Hosseini. Roberts' next involvement three minutes later was less distinguished, as his cross-field pass was cut out near his own penalty area, allowing Sardar Azmoun to tee up Gholizadeh, who finished into an empty net. There was no flag at first but, after a swift VAR check, the goal was disallowed for offside. Azmoun headed the next chance over as Wales struggled to get a hold of the game. Fortunately for them, as energetic and well-drilled as Iran were, they did not create much in the way of genuine scoring opportunities. This video can not be played World Cup 2022: Iran hit post twice as Wales struggle to hold on Despite the clear issues his side faced in the first half, Page made no changes at half-time. Just as his inability to heed the lessons from the USA game invited Iranian pressure in the first half, Page's inaction on this occasion forced Wales on to the back foot during the second half. They were extremely fortunate not to fall behind five minutes after the restart when Iran hit the post twice in the space of a few seconds. First, Azmoun struck a right-footed effort which cannoned off the woodwork and fell to Gholizadeh, whose curling left-footed shot hit the other post. Azmoun was the first to react, but his rebound was smothered by Hennessey. Wales were a mess at this point, their defence harassed and given next to no protection from the players in front of them. Those struggles made it impossible to attack with any cohesion, rendering Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey almost obsolete. It was a dispiriting sight for Wales fans to watch these two greats - heroes of the past two European Championships - reduced to peripheral figures on this occasion. Wales still threw themselves forward in the vague hope of forcing a late winner, but that desperation was their undoing when Hennessey caught Taremi with a high boot. The day belonged to Iran, who left it late to secure the victory they richly deserved. Given too much time by Wales' tiring bodies, Cheshmi unleasehd a superb strike from 20 yards which whistled into the bottom corner to prompt wild celebrations. It was the World Cup's 42nd goal, but the first from outside the box. Then with Wales even more exposed, it was left to Rezaeian to apply a delicate finishing touch as Iran surged to victory, knowing another against the USA will secure their passage to the second round for the first time.

Yield Spread Analysis,How soon can we expect a working vaccine?,2024-09-14,2020-09-10,By Dominic Bailey,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54027269,"If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox -  and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of immune response in patients and has rolled out the vaccine for public use while late-stage trials continue. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans.  Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech say preliminary analysis shows their vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. They plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful.  There are dozens of other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved.  The UK government, for example, has signed deals for undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations"". This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries.   In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr Mariângela Simão, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check.  ""The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more."" The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 94 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine plan known as Covax, which aims to raise $2bn (£1.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get ""rapid, fair and equitable access"" to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. ""With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,"" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. ""If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe."" While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (£24 to £28).  AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine ""at cost"" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic.  The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (£2.28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. ""Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,"" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers. As more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups.  After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. ""The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,"" says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount.  Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, ""to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access"". A lot depends on which vaccine is successful. The ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly. The WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called ""cold chain"" facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field. But adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment. Vaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C.  That's not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an ""immense task"" where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable. ""Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges' countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,"" MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC. ""You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them."" AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2C and 8C. But at present it looks like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would need ultra-cold chain - storage at -80C before being distributed. Welcoming the Pfizer announcement, Dr Richard Hatchett, of Cepi acknowledged that would ""remain a challenge for use in some settings"". ""This is something which will have to be addressed if the vaccine is to be made broadly available,"" he said. But the Ebola vaccine also needed very low temperatures, so it is not impossible. ""To keep the Ebola vaccine at -60°C or colder we had to use a special cold chain equipment to store and transport them, plus we had to train staff to use all this new equipment,"" said Barbara Saitta. There is also the question of the target population. Vaccination programmes usually target children, so agencies will have to plan how to reach people that normally are not part of the immunization program. As the world waits for the scientists to do their bit, many more challenges await. And vaccines are not the only weapon against coronavirus. ""Vaccines are not the only solution,"" Says Dr Simao, of the WHO. ""You need to have diagnostics. You need to have a way to decrease mortality, so you need therapeutics, and you need a vaccine. ""Besides that, you need everything else - social distancing, avoiding crowded places and so on."""
Yield Spread Analysis,The UK company spreading Russian fake news to millions,2024-09-14,2023-04-04,By Hannah Gelbart,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-65150030,"The BBC's Disinformation Team can reveal that a UK-registered media company is spreading Russian state disinformation to millions of people in the Arab-speaking world. Yala News claims to offer impartial news, but BBC analysis has shown most of its content directly mirrors stories on Russian state-backed media sites - and that it actually operates out of Syria. Yala Group, the parent company of Yala News, has a strong social presence. It's 20 or so Facebook pages are glossy and well-produced. Slick videos are uploaded every couple of hours, focusing on stories likely to be of interest to its three million Arabic-speaking followers: celebrity interviews, comedy sketches, and global politics. The reviews on Yala News state its impartial, independent credentials. But look closely and there's a theme: stories with a distinctly pro-Russian angle, many virtually identical to those seen on Russian state media the same day.  Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its posts began to gain traction. Here's an example: on 10 March 2022, Russian state TV aired a bizarre, and completely fictitious, story claiming the US was using birds as bioweapons, to distribute deadly diseases as they flew into Russia. That afternoon, the story was translated and published on Russian state-backed networks Sputnik Arabic and Russia Today (RT) Arabic. Two hours later, it was posted as a video on Yala News's Facebook page - with some of the wording identical. The bio-bird story is just one. Working with disinformation specialists over the course of a year, the BBC monitored Yala News's most-viewed videos and found that nearly all of its stories could be traced back to Kremlin-owned and pro-Kremlin news sites. These include fake stories claiming the Bucha massacre was staged, President Zelensky was 'drunk' in a video addressing Ukraine, and Ukrainian soldiers have been fleeing the frontline. All of these originated in Russian state media, followed a few hours later by videos of the same stories on Yala News. 'Information laundering' Belén Carrasco Rodríguez, who researches Russian influence operations for the Centre for Information Resilience in the UK, says Yala News is acting as a ""Kremlin loudspeaker"" in the Middle East. She says the timeframe and similarities in their stories suggest Yala could be ""information laundering"" for Russia: pumping out propaganda through a third party so it doesn't look like it's from the Kremlin. It's something Russia's been known to do in the past. ""Because of Yala's popularity [with] Arabic audiences, Kremlin-affiliated sources might be using it to spread their interests,"" she says. Ruarigh Thornton, from cyber security firm Protection Group International, says information laundering is becoming increasingly common, as people are more aware of Russian state-sponsored media.  ""The idea is to 'wash' slightly inauthentic narratives into the mainstream. By hiring something like a digital marketing firm to produce this type of content for them, the information appears to be totally disconnected from Russia, and can then move organically in the real world,"" he says. Fake reviews Yala News is part of Yala Group, which describes itself as a ""company working in the field of visual production on social networking sites"". But the rest of the operation doesn't appear as slick as its social sites. Yala Group's website consists mainly of dummy text and stock photos. Most of its five star reviews on Facebook look fake, written on the same dates by the same accounts from south east Asia, where paid-for Facebook reviews are known to be big business. Two typical reviews describe Yala News as ""neutral, objective and professional"" and ""a wonderful, honest, transparent and purposeful news platform"". Moustafa Ayad, from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, disagrees: ""It reeks of well-coordinated behaviour,"" he says. He believes the fact that Yala News publishes so many bespoke videos every day, each following the same format, could cost tens of thousands of dollars. Yala Group is registered in the UK. Its address in Bloomsbury, central London, is shared with more than 65,000 other companies, 12,000 of which are active. But the company has no staff or physical offices there. We suspected Yala was operating out of Syria, a country devastated by civil conflict, whose ruler Bashar al-Assad is a long-time ally of Russia. Russia has provided arms for pro-Assad forces during 12 years of civil war. Using local knowledge and geolocation techniques, we sourced Facebook photos showing the team and its offices to a leafy Damascus suburb. Most of their social profiles say they're based in the Syrian capital. A former employee confirmed it. Yala's clients include pro-regime Syrian celebrities and journalists. This picture shows state TV reporter Shadi Halwi, a client of Yala Group, posing with sanctioned Syrian businessmen, the Katerji brothers. Mr Halwi owns a radio station which is funded by the Katerjis. Another Yala client is Sham FM, a pro-regime radio station that has aired programmes made by Sputnik Arabic, part of Russia's state radio network. Syrian media experts at BBC Monitoring say pro-government, private media outlets are ""often owned by business figures with close links to the political and military establishment."" Experts suggest the UK registration could be to avoid Yala being seen as run from a sanctioned country, which would allow it to build business relationships with platforms like Facebook's parent company Meta.  In fact, the owner of one of Yala Group's Facebook pages recently posted about becoming an official Meta 'Business Partner', meaning its social media marketing services come recommended.  When we approached Meta, they denied this. They said they requested that Yala remove all references to being a Meta 'Business Partner'. So, who is behind Yala News? We tracked down Yala's CEO Ahmad Moemna, a Syrian businessman living in Dubai.  ""Yala Group is a UK-based company,"" he told the BBC. ""We have more than 500 clients including public figures, artists and talent. We do not have employees in London yet, but we could in the near future."" We asked him about the pro-Kremlin videos on Yala News. He said: ""Yala News content is not biased. Whether Syria or Russia or anything else, we respect impartiality."" Then, we asked if his business received funding from the Russian or Syrian governments.  ""I am the only funder and founder of Yala and no-one can influence me,"" he said. We asked Companies House about the UK registration. A spokesperson said they ""don't comment on individual companies"" and have ""no legal powers to verify or validate the information which is delivered."" A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, said it works with third-party fact-checkers to fight the spread of misinformation on its platforms.  We also contacted the Russian and Syrian governments to ask if they had a relationship with Yala News, but did not receive a response to our allegations.

Yield Spread Analysis,BBC 100 Women 2021: Who is on the list?,2024-09-14,2021-12-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59514598,"The BBC has revealed its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2021. This year 100 Women is highlighting those who are hitting ""reset"" - women playing their part to reinvent our society, our culture and our world. Among them are Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Samoa's first female prime minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa, Professor Heidi J Larson, who heads The Vaccine Confidence Project, and acclaimed author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.  Women from Afghanistan make up half of this year's list, some of whom appear under pseudonyms and without photos for their own safety. The resurgence of the Taliban in August 2021 has changed the lives of millions of Afghans - with girls banned from receiving secondary education, the ministry for women's affairs being disbanded, and women in many cases told not to return to work. This year's list recognises the scope of their bravery and their achievements as they are forced to reset their lives. Click here, if you can't see the list of 100 women. The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - women who are hitting ""reset"", playing their part to reinvent our world after the global pandemic has forced so many of us to reassess the way we live. It was also measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final names were chosen. This year BBC 100 Women made the unprecedented decision to devote half of the list to women from one country - Afghanistan.  Recent events in the country have made headlines and left millions of Afghans questioning their future, as rights groups have spoken up in fear that women's freedoms could be eroded for the foreseeable future under the Taliban. By dedicating half of the list to women who are from or work in the country, we wanted to highlight how many of them have been forced to disappear from areas of public life, as well as to share the voices of those who are being increasingly silenced or who are part of a new Afghan diaspora.  On 3 December, the Taliban did issue a decree in the name of their supreme leader instructing ministries ""to take serious action"" on women's rights. The decree sets out the rules governing marriage and property for women, stating that women should not be forced into marriage and should not be seen as ""property"". But this declaration has been criticised by human rights organisations and observers as it fails to mention girls' secondary education and women's curtailed rights to employment.  Some of the Afghan women on the list are anonymous to protect them and their families, with their consent and following all BBC Editorial Policy and safety guidelines.

Yield Spread Analysis,Shankland & Halliday earn Hearts win at Ross County,2024-09-14,2022-10-30,Andrew Petrie,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63362213,"This video can not be played 'It's incredulous he hasn't scored' - Sportscene on Ross County miss Lawrence Shankland and Andy Halliday combined again to earn Hearts a second win in a row and send Ross County back to the bottom of the Scottish Premiership. Jordan White bundled in to give Malky Mackay's side an early lead before Hearts responded with two goals in five minutes by the same players who netted in Thursday's win against RFS in the European Conference League. County return to the bottom of the division - behind Dundee United - on goal difference, while Hearts go sixth. Everything you need to know about Ross County All the Hearts news and analysis Podcast: All the reaction to Sunday's action The final game of a busy weekend was arguably the best that the Premiership had to offer.  County came out the blocks quickly, with a Jordy Hiwula goal ruled out for offside in the build-up. Owura Edwards was the offender, infringing before his scoop into the box. There was nothing wrong with their next attack, though. Breaking down the right, the creative Yan Dhanda whipped an inviting low ball in that White thighed beyond a scrambling Craig Gordon. That was the kick Hearts needed. Just four minutes later they had their equaliser when Shankland was quickest to react to his own blocked shot, lashing in with his weaker foot from the penalty spot. Another four minutes passed, and Hearts had the lead. An inviting cross from Robert Snodgrass was met by Halliday, and the left-back did superbly to bend his header into the far post. For all their potency up top, Hearts still looked fragile at the back and Gordon had to be alert to deny Owura when the winger lashed a low effort at goal from the edge of the box. The second half didn't quite have the same vim and vigour as the first, but County did their utmost to force an equaliser as the rain battered down. Their best chance came from a Jack Baldwin cross that Hearts let bounce in the area, allowing Connor Johnson a free header but he planted over from all of six yards. Another goal was rightfully chalked off for offside after Shankland's deflected shot looped high over Ross Laidlaw and bounced in - once again, linesman Calum Spence had his decision confirmed by a VAR review. Baldwin was perhaps lucky to stay on the field after an extremely robust challenge on Barrie McKay. The defender was booked, but VAR Andrew Dallas did not invite David Dickinson to review his decision. Towards the end, Gordon was at his spritely best as County threw everything at goal for a late equaliser, sprawling to his left to deny Dominic Samuel's spinning shot. The 27-year-old is every inch the striker Hearts have been crying out for since the days of John Robertson. A cut above. Without a win in their past four visits to Dingwall, and off the back of an energy-sapping win over RFS, there were mixed emotions as Robbie Neilson's side headed north. For the first 10 minutes, a continental hangover seemed to be in full effect as the visitors started lethargically. However, White's goal proved to be the hair of the dog that Hearts needed and they turned in a decently threatening performance. Yet, for their occasional potency up top, they still looked fragile at the back and were maybe let off by County's profligacy. But consecutive wins for only the second time this season will buoy the spirits. As for the hosts, they slip bottom but produced another display that made one wonder what they were doing mired at the foot of the division. Ross County manager Malky Mackay: ""﻿It was hard to take. I was really proud of the players and the way they went about it, the pressure we put Hearts under. But I know that we have to turn those chances into goals. ""The way we've played the last few weeks has given me cause for hope. The way we're playing, the chances we're creating. We were in a similar situation last year, we've just got to start taking our chances and getting points on the board."" Hearts manager Robbie Neilson: ""We're down to the bare bones, but the guys that were here have given everything for the club. This has been a tough period for us, we've got so many games. ""It's about everyone being together - the players, the staff, the fanbase. We're in a position where if we win our game in hand we go third place in the league, which is massive."" County host to St Mirren next Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Hearts are in European action on Thursday as they travel to Istanbul Basaksehir (15:30) before welcoming Motherwell next Sunday (15:00).

Yield Spread Analysis,Kane scores two as Spurs thrash Everton,2024-09-14,2022-03-06,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60551040,"Harry Kane's 176 Premier League goals for Tottenham have come in 270 appearances Tottenham increased Everton's growing relegation fears and maintained their own top-four aspirations as Frank Lampard's side were outclassed and humiliated.  On an embarrassing night for Lampard and his players, Spurs ran riot as Everton capitulated in a fashion that raises genuine doubts about their ability to maintain Premier League status.  Everton defender Michael Keane set the tone for the night by firing Ryan Sessegnon's into his own net after 14 minutes while goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was at fault for Son Heung-min's second three minutes later.  Matt Doherty set Harry Kane free to put the game out of sight eight minutes before half-time, while any slim hopes of an Everton revival were snuffed out when substitute Sergio Reguilon scored with his first touch at the far post seconds after the restart.  As Everton simply fell apart, Kane added the fifth after 55 minutes, meeting Doherty's perfect cross with a crisp left-footed volley.  Everton are just one point and one place above the relegation zone with a game in hand on Burnley below them. Tottenham stay seventh, just three points behind fourth-placed Arsenal in the last of the Champions League qualifying spots. Tottenham v Everton as it happened, plus reaction and analysis Visit our Everton page Go straight to all the best Tottenham content Last month, following a 2-0 loss against Wolves, Spurs boss Antonio Conte insisted it was ""impossible"" for his side to finish in the top four but after Monday's win said his ""expectations have become higher"". ""A top-four race for sure and we want to be involved - we're becoming stronger in many aspects,"" added the Italian. ""We have to take the responsibility now. We have to fight to reach the best possible position and to fight for a place in the Champions League. ""For sure it won't be easy. We need to have ambition and I think we can do this, I think we're ready to do this. ""Since my arrival in Tottenham I didn't know if it could be realistic but now after months of hard work I think the two [new] players [Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur] complete our squad."" This video can not be played Spurs will fight for best possible position - Conte Everton were last relegated from the top flight in 1951 and have had two last-day escapes in 1993-94 and 1997-98, but after this they should brace themselves for another cliffhanger this season.  Years of mismanagement on and off the field have led to the acquisition of a mix-and-match bunch of individuals who appear to have neither the heart nor stomach for a fight, especially away from home.  As so often this season, Everton collapsed at the first sign of adversity and once Keane, who is having a nightmare campaign, hammered emphatically into his own net early on, this was only going one way.  What will concern Lampard most - and it should be remembered he inherited this mess rather than created it - was the heartless fashion in which Everton appeared to throw in the towel once Spurs hit them with two quick goals.  It was an abysmal performance, with Everton's midfield non-existent and their defence horribly vulnerable, easy prey to the likes of Kane and Son.  Given their abject form on their travels, Everton will now be reliant on home for to keep their heads above water, especially as two of those away games are trips to relegation rivals Watford and Burnley.  They have two crucial home games coming up against Wolves and then fast-improving Newcastle United. Defeat in either is unthinkable but a genuine possibility such was the sheer incompetence on show here.  This video can not be played Crucial mistakes cost Everton - Lampard Spurs are the great unpredictable of the Premier League, with losses at Burnley and Middlesbrough in the FA Cup mixed in with a 4-0 win at Leeds United and this very convincing performance.  Everton made it very easy for Conte's side but they took full advantage of those weaknesses to put themselves just three points behind north London rivals Arsenal, although they have played a game more.  They will have few easier games than this but there is no doubt there is the talent in this side to challenge for the top four and a place in next season's Champions League if they can find a measure of consistency.  Kane looks on top of his game and produced two comprehensive finishes, and with the England captain in this sort of form Spurs can always be a threat.  Spurs were even able to ease up and conserve energy, such was their dominance over this awful Everton side.

Yield Spread Analysis,'Too early to say' what Christmas rules will be,2024-09-14,2020-10-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54713802,"""It's too early to say"" what Covid rules will be in place by Christmas, the environment secretary has said.  George Eustice warned people ""may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would"".  Opposition parties have called for coronavirus rules to be the same across all four UK nations this Christmas. Meanwhile Sage member Sir Mark Walport has said there is ""little to feel reassured about"", adding: ""There are still many people that are vulnerable."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the former chief scientific adviser said it's ""certainly not unrealistic"" to think there could be 25,000 people in hospital with Covid by the end of next month.  He said that ""we are better"" at treating coronavirus but that the country is ""still relatively early in the second wave"" and there is a ""significant lag"" between getting the infection and potentially dying.  The government announced 24,701 confirmed cases on Wednesday, and 310 deaths. The total number of cases in the UK is now put at 942,275. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has responsibility for health policy - including social distancing, the size of gatherings and other Covid-19 restrictions - in England. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill each oversee the rules in their respective nations. This means different restrictions are in place across the UK, which, it is argued, could cause confusion when people move between the different nations during the holidays. Mr Eustice said: ""We want people to have a Christmas that is as close to normal as possible. ""There will undoubtedly be frustrations about the restrictions but people also understand we have to control the spread of the virus."" Scotland is due to move to a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November; while Wales has started a national lockdown, or circuit-breaker, meaning most non-essential businesses are closed and people are only able to leave home for limited reasons, until 9 November. Northern Ireland has also introduced additional restrictions, including an extended two-week half term for schools. By the end of the week, eight million people in England will be living under the tier three restrictions meaning households are not allowed to mix indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. Predicting what happens next is, of course, very difficult. Talk of 25,000 patients in hospital with Covid or a sustained period of 500 deaths a day - as has been reported in some newspapers - are certainly possible scenarios given the current trajectories. What we are seeing is a gradual, but sustained rise during this second wave.  Whereas in the spring there was a rapid surge, followed by a marked fall following lockdown. Now, with the government trying to keep society functioning to a certain extent, the wave will certainly be longer. But will it be lower? Something still needs to happen if it is not to reach the peaks seen in the spring as the cases continue to grow. Some say extra restrictions are needed to reduce social contacts between people, although equally the public may reduce the amount of contact themselves in response to rising rates. At the moment ministers in England are adamant they will be sticking to their regional tiered approach, rather than introducing a national lockdown.  But, if the NHS starts to seriously struggle, their hand could be forced. A letter - signed by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, as well as Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds and Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry - asks the national leaders to ""accept the inevitability"" that people will travel, including between nations, and work together to ensure people can travel safely. And it calls for a four-nation summit ""to co-operate on students' return, to agree uniform guidance on the number of people who can gather, and to explore how best to expand travel options to allow social distancing"". Sir Ed said: ""No one country can manage this challenge in isolation. The fractured rules across the UK have already been incredibly difficult to piece together."" Speaking to the BBC, he said there had been ""too much point-scoring between different governments across the UK"" and that co-ordination between the four nations need to be ""stepped up"". ""Millions of people normally travel across the UK to see their families and they need clear guidance - they are trying to plan Christmas now."" He also said there should be a co-ordinated plan to manage travel movements during Diwalli.  Earlier this year, many Muslims had to cancel plans to celebrate the religious holiday of Eid when pandemic restrictions were introduced in parts of northern England.  In non-pandemic years, millions of people move around the UK at Christmas time to see friends or families, packing out trains and clogging up motorways. If household gatherings continue to be limited in number, many of the usual larger gatherings would be illegal this year. On Tuesday, BBC Presenter Victoria Derbyshire apologised after saying she would break the rule of six so her family could celebrate Christmas together. She told the Radio Times her family of seven knew the risks and would be ""sensible"" but ""we have to be together at Christmas"". She later said her comments had been ""wrong"" and ""hypothetical"". Asked about his Christmas plans, actor Danny Dyer told the BBC, the idea of potentially not being able to sit round the table with his daughter and in-laws was ""crazy talk to me"".  Senior Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said the government should consider putting people who need to self isolate up in hotels, claiming it would be cheaper than shutting down the rest of the economy. Sir Bernard, who chairs the Commons Liaison Committee, told BBC Look East: ""It would be far cheaper to spend the money on tracking and tracing [people with the virus] and then, being extremely nice and understanding to them, and possibly putting them up in a nice hotel, and helping them sort out their business or family life so that they can isolate. ""If we got that sorted, and we've seen this operating in other countries, then the rest of us could much more easily go about our daily lives unmolested.""   A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The PM has been clear of his ambition to ensure that people may celebrate Christmas as a family this year.  ""That's why we have introduced a range of measures in order to control the spread of the virus, reduce the R rate and save lives."" A Scottish government spokesperson said people would ""naturally be anxious"" about what celebrations are possible this December, and that the rules would be ""guided by the latest available scientific and clinical evidence"". Mr Drakeford has said the current ""firebreak"" restrictions in Wales should give a pathway to a less restricted Christmas. A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Executive Office said: ""This will be an issue we would expect to be discussed as part of ongoing dialogue."" And Mrs Foster has promised festivities ""will not be cancelled"" in Northern Ireland, adding that she is ""very much looking forward"" to them. Labour's shadow Scotland secretary Ian Murray said the UK and Scottish governments should ""put their differences aside"" and come up with ""an urgent plan... to ensure a co-ordinated approach across the entire UK this Christmas""."
Yield Spread Analysis,Science advisers urged short lockdown weeks ago,2024-09-14,2020-10-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54518002,"The government's scientific advisers called for a short lockdown in England to halt the spread of Covid-19 last month, newly released documents show. The experts said an immediate ""circuit breaker"" was the best way to control cases, at a meeting on 21 September. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick insisted the government had taken ""robust action"" that ""balanced"" the impact on the economy. But Labour has described the documents as ""alarming"".  It comes as the Liverpool region prepares to enter a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of a new three-tier system for coronavirus restrictions in England.  Every area will be classified as being on medium, high or very high alert under the system. It is not clear what the specific criteria is for each alert level.  Most parts of England are the lowest tier, but Essex has asked to be moved to ""high"" level restrictions. Shielding is not being reintroduced in England yet, but people who were on the list will receive a letter with updated advice to avoid getting Covid. Meanwhile, the latest Office for National Statistics figures showed there were 343 deaths involving coronavirus registered in the week to 2 October - a figure that has been doubling every fortnight over the last month. At a press conference on Monday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the alert system for England could succeed in driving cases down if it was implemented ""very effectively"", and he rejected the ""extreme route"" of a full nationwide lockdown ""right now"". But at the same briefing, England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, voiced concerns over the impact of the new rules, saying he was not confident the ""base measures"" in the highest tier ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus.  ""That is why there's a lot of flexibility for local authorities [...] to do significantly more,"" he said. Released shortly after Monday's press conference, minutes from the meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - which feeds into UK government decision-making - stated the advisers had called for the immediate introduction of a short national lockdown three weeks ago. The papers also showed the scientists suggested: Of all the measures proposed by the advisory group, just one - advising those who can work from home to do so - was implemented by the government at the time. In the documents, Sage warned that ""not acting now to reduce cases will result in a very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences"".  Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Jenrick said the government had introduced measures such as the rule of six at the time, and stressed the Sage papers had contributed to the measures the PM announced on Monday.  He said they had taken ""balanced judgements"" that weighed up the effect on the economy and ""all the other unintended consequences"" of measures, such as the impact on mental health and delayed surgeries.  On the new three-tiered system, he said: ""We are now able to have a very clear and consistent framework across the whole country, so people will be able to understand approximately what the rate of infections is in their own area and what the rules are accordingly."" He later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there were no plans for other parts of the country to go into the highest tier this week, but plans would be ""kept under review"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Breakfast he was ""alarmed"" by the Sage papers, and called for ministers to explain why the advice was ""rejected"". He also insisted the government was going to have to go further than the latest measures, saying things were getting ""really serious"" as winter approaches. Cases are increasing across the whole of the country and the number of people in hospital is now higher than before the full lockdown in March. We are at a critical stage in the epidemic. It is at this moment the gulf between the official scientific advice and the decisions made by government has been laid bare. It is the case that ""advisers advise and ministers decide"". When considering new measures to stop Covid, government must also take into account the harms they cause to our health and the economy. But there is some concern the government is doing too little, too late.  And that we can either choose the terms for controlling the virus now, or wait and the virus will force our hand as it did with lockdown in March. Read more from James. The newly released Sage documents also showed advisers said NHS Test and Trace was only having a ""marginal impact"" and this would ""likely decline further"" unless the system expanded to keep up with the rise in cases and people were given support to enable them to self-isolate.  A separate document from 17 September stated that Sage believed curfews in bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants were also ""likely to have a marginal impact"".  A 22:00 closing time was introduced for all hospitality venues in England from 24 September.  A Sage document from 21 September warned that ""single interventions by themselves are unlikely to be able to bring the R below one"" and both local and national measures are needed.  However, a document examining measures including a two to three week ""circuit-breaker"" - a short period of tightened restrictions - said this step, if it was ""as strict and well-adhered to as the restrictions in late May"", could ""put the epidemic back by approximately 28 days or more"".  ""Multiple circuit-breaks might be necessary to maintain low levels of incidence,"" it added.  Most areas in England are in the medium alert level - meaning current restrictions continue, including the 10pm hospitality curfew and the rule of six. Areas already under additional local restrictions are automatically in the high alert level - meaning bans on household mixing indoors are extended to include hospitality venues. The city of Nottingham, which has the highest rate in the country, will start in this category alongside the rest of Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak, as well as Greater Manchester, parts of South Yorkshire, and north-east England. Around 4.4 million people will be in high alert areas. The Liverpool City Region - home to 1.5 million people - becomes the first area to enter the very high alert level, which - at a minimum - sees pubs and bars close if they do not serve ""substantial meals"", almost all household contacts banned and advice against travel. The rule of six will continue to apply in outdoor public spaces such as parks. Areas in the highest tier are able to impose further restrictions, and in the Liverpool City Region this will mean the closure of betting shops, gyms, leisure centres and casinos.  Mr Johnson said he had agreed some of the measures with the region's Labour Mayor Steve Rotheram - but Mr Rotheram said that was ""totally false"" and that the new measures had been ""dictated to us by the government"".  The government has issued details of the full restrictions for each alert level. Meanwhile, the Scottish government is drawing up its own three-tier framework of restrictions to be implemented later this month.  In Wales, a second national lockdown is being considered and First Minister Mark Drakeford has threatened a travel ban on people from English Covid hotspots if the prime minister does not impose his own.  Ministers in Northern Ireland's devolved government are meeting later to decide on further coronavirus restrictions.  A further 13,972 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported across the UK on Monday, with 50 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Virus testing rolled out for frontline NHS staff,2024-09-14,2020-03-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52072568,"Frontline hospital staff in England are starting to be tested to see whether they have coronavirus. Workers with symptoms and those who live with people who have symptoms will be checked - starting with hundreds of critical care doctors and nurses.  Tests for A&E staff, paramedics and GPs are expected to follow, and later social care staff will be tested.  It comes as the number of people who have died with the virus in the UK rose by 260 to 1,019 on Saturday.  Latest government figures show there are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK. In Wales and Scotland, health workers are already being tested, while Northern Ireland's testing begins on Monday. Until now, only patients in English hospitals with flu-like symptoms were being routinely tested but this had led to concerns that without testing, many health and care workers would not know whether they were safe to return to work.  Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack is the latest politician to announce he is self-isolating after showing mild symptoms.   Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty are all self-isolating after testing positive for the virus. Mr Jack spoke in the Commons on Wednesday, sitting near to the PM and Mr Hancock, although they appeared to follow social distancing rules with spaces between them on the benches. Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell said politicians needed to ""obey their own rules much more strictly"" on social distancing. ""They do need to learn a lesson from this,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme when asked about pictures from the House of Commons earlier this week which showed several members of the cabinet crowded near the Speaker's chair. The Mayor of Greater Manchester and former Health Secretary Andy Burnham expressed concern about the safety of politicians, saying it was ""very hard"" for people working in Westminster to maintain safe distances. Currently, about 6,000 people are tested daily, which the government wants to increase to 10,000 a day by the end of March and 25,000 a day by mid-April. In Wales, frontline NHS staff are already being screened for the virus, while Scotland said it was already testing some NHS staff but would increase tests.  Testing in Northern Ireland is limited to patients and some health care workers, but it plans to increase testing to 1,000 a day from next week.  The British Medical Association said the move towards testing NHS staff in England was ""long overdue"".  ""For every healthy member of staff at home self-isolating needlessly when they do not have the virus, the NHS is short of someone who could be providing vital care to patients on the front line,"" the BMA's chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. There are two main types of coronavirus test that are useful in fighting the epidemic:  The antigen or ""have I got coronavirus now?"" test will tell you if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. That's the one that is being used to check very ill patients in hospitals and will now be rolled out to NHS staff too.  The antibody or ""have I recently had coronavirus"" test is not available to the public yet but Public Health England is ordering it in the millions and will distribute it as soon as they are confident about its accuracy. That would help tell us how many people got coronavirus with no or only mild symptoms.   Both are vital to get a better handle on how to stop the spread of this deadly disease.  The first of three new testing laboratories is expected to start operating over the weekend, initially processing around 800 samples, the government said, with the others opening soon. Samples will be taken around the country, initially focusing on coronavirus hotspots such as London. Dozens of universities, research institutes and companies are lending equipment for the labs.  Analysis suggests the rate of infection in the UK has been doubling every three to four days, the government said on Friday. Experts predict further increases over the next two to three weeks, before the effects of social distancing measures and restrictions on everyday life begin to have an impact.  It came as the government updated its guidance on leaving the house to exercise ahead of the weekend, urging people to use ""open spaces"" near their home where possible and to not travel unnecessarily.  Meanwhile, guidance for health workers on personal protective equipment is expected to be updated within days, following calls for greater clarity. Mike Adams, from the Royal College of Nursing, said he was ""still getting inundated with messages"" from staff who were finding PPE was not available or in short supply or saying there was inconsistent messaging around when to use it.

Yield Spread Analysis,Hibs up to third with emphatic win over St Mirren,2024-09-14,2022-10-29,Thomas Duncan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63354886,"Mykola Kukharevych scored Hibs' second goal Hibernian ended a three-game losing streak and moved up to third in the Scottish Premiership with an emphatic victory at home against St Mirren. Martin Boyle's penalty in first-half stoppage time put them in front, after Mykola's Kukharevych's early strike was ruled out for offside after a VAR check. Kukharevych finished a fantastic Hibs move after the break, and then Ewan Henderson's beautiful strike killed the game as St Mirren struggled. Stephen Robinson's side drop to fifth, but are only a point behind Hibs with a game in hand. Reaction & as it happened Follow all the latest Hibs news All you need to know about St Mirren Only Celtic and Rangers have won more Premiership games in 2022 than St Mirren, a side who have been quietly consistent this season and arrived at Easter Road with six wins in their last nine. But after an end-to-end opening in which Jonah Ayunga and Curtis Main forced good saves from David Marshall, they struggled to seriously test Hibs, and did not show their usual defensive discipline. Instead it was Hibs, under pressure after three straight losses, who played some eye-catching football. They were unlucky when Kukharevych's effort was ruled out after Joe Newell's defence-splitting pass to Marijan Cabraja set the wheels in motion on a fine move. But a lengthy check spotted the Croatian had made his run too early. But VAR ruled in Hibs favour before the first half was up, when referee Don Robertson penalised Richard Tait for handball after an on-field review. Boyle stuck the penalty away for his first goal for five league games, but worryingly for Hibs had to depart in the second-half after picking up an injury. That did not derail them, though, as they clinched the second goal they craved. A lovely one-touch combination put Kukharevych in behind, and the Ukrainian outmuscled Alex Gogic before curling into the far corner. Henderson added the final flourish by caressing a beautiful shot into the top corner after substitute Elias Melkersen's cross was blocked into his path on the edge of the box. The Ukranian youngster was a nuisance to St Mirren throughout, managing 10 touches in their box and a fantastic goal Hibs manager Johnson spoke about ""positive signs"" with his team pre-match, which was a bold statement given they came into this game on the back of three straight defeats. But this was the most convincing his side have been all season as they played some lovely one-touch football, and crucially were able to find the back of the net in style. Kukharevych looks a real find as he added his second goal in as many games, having torn around the pitch all game. The strength and poise for his goal was mightily impressive.  Henderson has been used sparingly of late but was good in midfield alongside Newell. Overall, there is plenty to build on. As for St Mirren, Robinson will be disappointed with their defensive efforts. He preached discipline and focus before the match, but his side were strangely open. It might have played in their favour had Main or Ayunga made sure they got the first goal, but when it went to Hibs there was not much sense of a comeback. Still, the Paisely side have started well and put this one down as a bad day at the office. Hibernian manager Lee Johnson: ""I was really pleased. And there's relief because I don't think the last three performances deserved three losses.  ""I thought there were some outstanding performances today. Within the 11 and team structure."" St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: ""W﻿e got caught in two stools today. We didn't know whether we were playing short or going longer and ended up doing neither. We were below par throughout. ""W﻿e collectively take the blame for that, I take the blame for that. It's now reset, know what we're good at and get back to doing that next week."" Hibs are away to Aberdeen in a dose of Friday night football (19:30 GMT), while St Mirren are away to Ross County the next day (15:00). BBC Sport Scottish Football SPFL"
Yield Spread Analysis,York moves into higher Tier 2 Covid restrictions,2024-09-14,2020-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-54552897,"People in York will face tougher Covid restrictions as the city is moved from the lowest alert level into Tier 2. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was being bumped up from Tier 1 because cases had more than doubled in less than a fortnight. It means from Saturday households are barred from mixing indoors and also in pubs and restaurants.  Meanwhile, City of York Council has announced it is setting up its own test and trace system from next week. Under the change, businesses in the city can still remain open and people are allowed to meet outdoors in groups of up to six.  The three-tier system was brought in by the government earlier this week in response to a rising number of coronavirus cases, with York initially being placed in the medium Tier 1 category. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Hancock confirmed York, along with parts of London, Essex, Cumbria, Derbyshire and Surrey, would move from medium into high alert restrictions. The decision comes as the city's cases continue to rise, with the rate per 100,000 people in the week to 11 October standing at 258.3, an increase from 195.6 the week before. Reacting to the announcement, Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central, questioned why York was only moving to Tier 2, despite having a higher infection rate than some areas in Tier 3. She said: ""I do not believe the measures in Tier 2 are going to be sufficient to stop the spread of the virus in our city which, as he will know, is rising incredibly sharply and in the older population as well. ""York experiences real challenges every single winter because of the capacity issues at our hospital, and without taking more acute action now I am concerned we're going to be in serious difficulty in just a few weeks time."" By Gemma Dillon, BBC Radio York political reporter With West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire already placed in the high risk Tier 2 there was a degree of inevitability that York would soon follow - quite how soon has come as a bit of a surprise to some. Local officials are broadly supportive of the move but are questioning why York wasn't placed in the higher tier on Monday given the number of coronavirus cases in the city is way above the national average From Saturday, people living and working in the city will be living under a new set of rules.  There is a hope though that the new restrictions will help stem the rise in transmission of the virus - and experts say the city is a ""long way off"" needing to be placed in the very high risk top tier.  Sharon Stoltz, the city's director of public health, said the new restrictions would ""make life more difficult"", but added: ""Following them is our best chance to slow the virus and have them removed as quickly as possible."" She said: ""We continue to closely monitor the data to track and trace the spread of the virus as quickly as possible.  ""We're seeing the virus spread mainly through social contact and households mixing indoors and not social distancing."" Meanwhile, York's test and trace system is expected to be up and running by the end of next week. Ms Stoltz said it would ""work in partnership with the national service"" with local contact tracers chasing up anyone who the national system was unable to reach.  More details about the localised service will be sent out in the coming days, she added. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Gelhardt earns Leeds dramatic late win,2024-09-14,2022-03-11,Luke Reddy,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60635699,"Gelhardt had been on the field for less than two minutes when he scored in injury time Leeds landed a first victory under manager Jesse Marsch in stunning fashion as Joe Gelhardt struck in injury time to beat relegation rivals Norwich and send Elland Road into raptures. The 19-year-old substitute - on the pitch for less than two minutes - turned into an empty net from Raphinha's assist, serving a brutal blow to Norwich after they had finally levelled through Kenny McLean at the start of injury time. The thrilling finale served up scenes of contrast as Leeds' fans jubilantly sang along to Kaiser Chiefs' 'I predict a riot' while Norwich players sat dejected on the turf. Rodrigo's first-half goal had looked set be enough to see Leeds end a run of six games without a win but on a day where Raphinha twice struck the bar and where the impressive Daniel James went close, they almost paid for not taking their chances. This video can not be played MOTD2 analysis: Could Patrick Bamford be the difference for Leeds? Norwich may point to Patrick Bamford appearing to be offside in the build-up to Rodrigo's opener and they also saw a penalty award overturned shortly before they equalised when referee Stuart Attwell visited the pitch-side monitor. Ultimately they found a way to level, stunning the Leeds support, but Gelhardt's contribution moves Marsch's side four points above the relegation zone while Norwich stay bottom - five points from safety. Marsch summed the finish up as ""very frantic"", adding: ""I'd heard a lot about the magic of Elland Road and we felt that today."" This video can not be played Leeds 2-1 Norwich: Marsch says points are big but the moment is even bigger Gelhardt said his decisive goal delivered an ""unbelievable feeling"", while team-mate Stuart Dallas said ""this is why you play football, for moments like this"". Dean Smith's Norwich players wore a look of how key this remarkable finish may prove to their survival hopes. Norwich's hopes of survival have been hindered greatly by what is now a six-game losing run, but none of them are likely to sting as much as this. In the final moments Smith sent goalkeeper Tim Krul forward for a corner in search of another equaliser and striker Teemu Pukki forced a vital save from Illan Meslier in the kind of frenetic ending that pointed to what was at stake. Marsch deserves credit for his role in the late mayhem as he moved to introduce Gelhardt for Mateusz Klich at a point where the life had been sucked out of the stadium. When Raphinha rounded Krul the Brazilian was able to give Gelhardt a simple task to lift the gloom that had set in after a 3-0 midweek defeat to Aston Villa. Against Villa, Leeds suffered the blow of losing four top-flight games in a row without scoring for the first time since March 1982. It prompted Marsch to state ""this is a business for men"" and that the way out of relegation trouble would be paved with ""courage and belief"". They showed plenty early on as Rodrigo drilled home via a deflection, Raphinha volleyed against the bar and Pascal Struijk turned over from close range after seeing an initial header saved. This video can not be played Leeds 2-1 Norwich: Smith says his side can't keep giving halves of football away Rodrigo's goal did not come without controversy as a long ball in the build-up was pursued by Bamford, who appeared offside. The striker - making his first start since September - was chasing the ball but did not make a challenge, as a poor headed clearance allowed the energetic James to tee up Rodrigo. James whipped an effort at goal after the break to prompt a superb save and Raphinha's sublime free-kick hit the bar before Norwich started their late push. Milot Rashica went down in the box under the challenge of Luke Ayling but the penalty awarded was overturned when replays showed the Norwich player had stood on Ayling's leg.  To their credit, Norwich refused to let the blow slow their momentum and their leveller was beautifully worked, with Pukki getting on the end of a fine long diagonal pass to fire a cross into the six-yard box for McLean to turn home. A draw might have been harsh on Leeds, who showed more energy than their visitors in the final third and ultimately created the better chances. Norwich are now increasingly staring at the prospect of relegation. Smith put three games without defeat together when he was appointed in November and another three-game run of form helped their cause in January. They will need to show character and find more than a pocket of good form after this harsh ending. Leeds, by contrast, will surely be filled with survival optimism.

Yield Spread Analysis,'Brilliant' Fernandes leads perfect Man Utd response,2024-09-14,2023-03-08,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64893700,"This video can not be played Bruno Fernandes 'best player' in Europa League tie, says Erik ten Hag Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag hailed goalscoring skipper Bruno Fernandes as the star man in his side's Europa League last-16 first-leg victory against Real Betis. Fernandes had taken the brunt of huge criticism heaped on United following Sunday's record 7-0 Premier League humiliation at Liverpool. But Ten Hag confirmed in the build-up the Portuguese would remain captain if Harry Maguire was not on the field - and Fernandes repaid that faith with an outstanding contribution to a much-needed win. It included his eighth goal of the season as he headed home Luke Shaw's 58th-minute corner. ""He was the best player on the pitch,"" said Ten Hag. ""He played a little deeper role and he was brilliant, making the game from the back position, with a lot of good passes in between the lines. From there we created a lot of chances."" Reaction from Old Trafford and Thursday's European action Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views Get Man Utd news notifications Ten Hag accepted Fernandes was not perfect. A late tackle on Betis' former Manchester City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo brought the midfielder a yellow card and did not look good. But the United boss admitted it is a fine line Fernandes has to tread. ""His passion is his strength,"" added Ten Hag. ""But sometimes he has to control that because when it's too much, it becomes a weakness. He knows that, but there are always small margins."" Fernandes ran away to celebrate his goal with his hands to his ears as the home fans chanted 'Bruno, Bruno' in his honour, showing they are behind him as well. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Wout Weghorst were also on the scoresheet as United put themselves in a strong position to reach the last eight when the tie is concluded in Seville next week. But Ten Hag knows one win alone will not banish the memory of Sunday's annihilation at Anfield, especially as he had been irritated by some of his side's performances preceding it, including the Carabao Cup final victory against Newcastle. ""We don't ignore it,"" he said. ""We made mistakes and we got hammered. We showed complacency and you can never do that in top football. ""In the weeks before, I was not happy against Newcastle and the performance against Leicester in the first half, but sometimes you have to get the bad result where everyone opens their eyes."" In his programme notes, Ten Hag described the Anfield debacle as 'unacceptable' and said he had left his players in no doubt such performances would not be tolerated. And, in a move that smacked of the Dutchman applying collective responsibility for the loss rather than singling out individuals for blame, he named an unchanged line-up. For half an hour, all went well. The hosts dominated as Rashford drove home his 26th goal of a magnificent season in the sixth minute after Fernandes' cross had been diverted into his path. Further chances were created - the issue was none of them went in. Bravo twice denied Rashford, Fernandes had a shot blocked and Weghorst's near-post effort was deflected wide even though he didn't get a corner. Betis' form in La Liga, where they are fifth, suggested they were not as poor as it appeared and Ayoze Perez proved it when he drilled home a low shot from the angle of the penalty area. Had the on-loan Leicester City forward got a second after he was set up by Juanmi - gifted possession by David de Gea, who rolled a pass straight to him from inside his six-yard box - anxiety might have spread through home ranks. As it was, Perez's deflected shot bounced back off a post and United survived - although question marks remain over keeper De Gea, whose contract expires in the summer. Even Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini, who barely said anything noteworthy to the media during his three years as Manchester City boss, couldn't resist a pre-match dig at United after their seven-goal defeat at Liverpool. As the weeks pass, it will be interesting to see if any individual does pay a price for what unfolded in what many view as the Premier League's greatest rivalry. For now though, it can be claimed normal service has resumed.  Antony's superb curling shot restored the home side's advantage seven minutes after the restart and Weghorst found the net with a first-time strike eight minutes from time. The key element of that late effort though was the contribution of Facundo Pellistri. Good enough to play all three games for Uruguay in Qatar at the World Cup, the 21-year-old was only making his fifth United appearance, all off the bench. But Pellistri's role in Weghorst's second United goal suggests he will be called upon more often as the campaign reaches its crucial phase. Ignoring the safety-first option of a pass back to halfway, he took off on a run past the Betis defence to the byeline where he sent a cross back to Scott McTominay, whose effort was blocked and bounced kindly for Weghorst to finish.

Yield Spread Analysis,Spanish study casts doubt on herd immunity option,2024-09-14,2020-07-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53315983,"A Spanish study has cast doubt on the feasibility of herd immunity as a way of tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The study of more than 60,000 people estimates that around just 5% of the Spanish population has developed antibodies, the medical journal the Lancet reported. Herd immunity is achieved when enough people become immune to a virus to stop its spread. Around 70% to 90% of a population needs to be immune to protect the uninfected. The prevalence of Covid-19 antibodies was below 3% in coastal regions, but higher in areas of Spain with widespread outbreaks, the report said. ""Despite the high impact of Covid-19 in Spain, prevalence estimates remain low and are clearly insufficient to provide herd immunity,"" the study's authors said in the report.  ""This cannot be achieved without accepting the collateral damage of many deaths in the susceptible population and overburdening of health systems. ""In this situation, social distance measures and efforts to identify and isolate new cases and their contacts are imperative for future epidemic control.""  The study is thought to be the largest of its kind on the coronavirus in Europe. There have been studies of a similar kind in China and the US and ""the key finding from these representative cohorts is that most of the population appears to have remained unexposed"" to the coronavirus, ""even in areas with widespread virus circulation,"" the Lancet article said.  Prof Danny Altmann, British Society for Immunology spokesperson and Professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, described the study as ""sobering"". ""Findings such as this reinforce the idea that faced with a lethal infection that induces rather short-lived immunity, the challenge is to identify the best vaccine strategies able to overcome these problems and stimulate a large, sustained, optimal, immune response in the way the virus failed to do,"" Prof Altmann said. The country has recorded more than a quarter of a million cases and at least 28,385 deaths. But daily fatalities have been in the single figures for most of the past three weeks. However, officials in the north-western region of Galicia have re-imposed restrictions on an area of 70,000 people following an outbreak. Officials linked local outbreaks to bars in the area. Capacity in bars and restaurants have been limited to 50%. There are now 258 cases of Covid-19 in Galicia, including 117 in Lugo province, authorities say. On Saturday the autonomous government of Catalonia re-imposed controls on an area of 210,000 residents after a sharp rise in infections there. Catalan President Quim Torra said no-one would be allowed to enter or leave Segrià, a district west of Barcelona that includes the city of Lleida. Herd immunity can be reached either by widespread vaccination or if enough of the population is exposed to an infection and recovers. If enough people are immune to a disease, it is unlikely to keep spreading from person to person. Letting the coronavirus infection run and risking lots of people getting very sick with it is not an option - it would put too many lives in danger. And currently, there is no vaccine for coronavirus - even though hundreds are in development. The challenge is to make a jab that provides enough protection. It needs to train the body's immune system to learn and remember how to make antibodies that can fight off coronavirus.  Scientists are concerned that this ""memory"" might be too short-lived though, given the nature of the disease. While some people who catch coronavirus develop protective antibodies, experts do not yet know how long these last.  Common colds are caused by similar viruses and the body's immune response fades quickly to those. "
Yield Spread Analysis,No proof of racism by Cala - La Liga,2024-09-14,2021-04-09,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56689861,"Mouctar Diakhaby did not return to the field after Valencia walked off followed the alleged racial abuse La Liga says it has found no evidence that Cadiz defender Juan Cala racially abused Valencia's Mouctar Diakhaby during Sunday's match. Defender Diakhaby reacted furiously after a first-half clash with Cala and spoke with the referee. Valencia walked off the pitch in protest after the alleged racist comment was made. They later returning to complete the match - without the substituted Diakhaby - which they lost 2-1. In a statement, La Liga said: ""After an analysis of all the elements, it was concluded that in none of the available media was found any proof that the player Juan Torres Ruiz [Juan Cala] insulted Mouctar Diakhaby using the alleged terms. ""All available audiovisual and digital files were analysed, including the images broadcast and spread on different social networks.  ""To be able to complete the case, a specialised company was contracted to do lip-reading analysis of the conversations and study the behaviour of the players Juan Torres Ruiz and Mouctar Diakhaby."" The league also reiterated its ""condemnation of racism in all its forms"". On Tuesday, Diakhaby posted a video on social media saying he was ""very hurt"" by what Cala said to him and wanted La Liga to punish the Cadiz man. Cala held a virtual news conference later in the day, during which he denied racially abusing Diakhaby and said he had been caught in a ""media circus"". Valencia said the outcome of La Liga's investigation had ""by no means changed our opinion"" on what happened. ""The fact that no proof has been found does not mean that the matter did not occur,"" the club said. ""The club have by no means changed our opinion on what occurred in the game, and maintain our full support for Diakhaby.  ""Having reached this point, it is necessary to continue working with La Liga, the institutions and the rest of the clubs to ensure that these types of racist incidents are never repeated."" An investigation by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) is still ongoing."

Yield Spread Analysis,Brexit: Better or worse off?,2024-09-14,2019-10-31,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-50254631,"Boris Johnson's Brexit deal will cost everyone in Scotland £1,600 per year. That's the charge, being led by Mike Russell, the Scottish government's Brexit minister. Expect to hear it again over the election weeks and beyond. And again after that.   So where does it come from, and how does it stack up? It's in a new document, providing the Scottish government's assessment of the Brexit deal negotiated by Boris Johnson, which secured a majority - in principle - in the House of Commons, and will form a core part of the Conservative Party's election campaign. The figures are derived from a Scottish government analysis published in January 2018. Behind it are a lot of assumptions about what might happen if there were to be a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between post-Brexit Britain and the European Union. The analysis looks at other outcomes of the talks, long before Theresa May got to her deal with the EU, let alone Boris Johnson re-negotiating it. One was to remain within the European Economic Area, something like Norway - inside the single market, but in Norway's case, outside the customs union. The alternative was the most bracing for the economy - known as WTO, referring to World Trade Organisation rules. That is the baseline for countries that don't have trade deals, where many goods have no tariffs applied (taxes on imports) but quite a few do, and where there is little done to converge and standardise countries' internal market rules. The FTA version points to the total output of the economy, in 2030, being 6% below the level it would have reached if the UK economy remained on the growth trajectory it has had as a member of the EU. That equates to £9.1bn per year, at 2016 prices. Divide that by the population, and you get to £1,610 per head. By rounding down £10, that's where Mike Russell's number comes from. No, though that is how it can be made to look. The SNP put out a press release on Wednesday, claiming: ""New analysis from the Scottish government has found that Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal would leave people in Scotland £1,600 per head worse off by 2030."" That's misleading, firstly because that appears to relate to average pay. It does not. It is a notional share per head of total national output, and part of that share goes to wages, part to profits, including some paid to foreign owners of assets in Scotland. The assessment also points to Scots being worse off than they might otherwise have been - not worse off than they are. A common feature of this type of economic modelling is that it measures how much slower the economy would grow, when compared with the trend growth within the European Union. Growth would be lower, but would remain positive. If the UK were to be in the European Economic Area, like Norway, then it would see a smaller dip according to this economic model - of 2.7% of total national output, or £688. For it to leave the EU without any deal, and use WTO rules for trading, the calculation is a drop of 8.5% of output by 2030, or £2,263 per head.   In the latter case, the separate reckoning of the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University is that Scotland would become worse off, for a while. It recently forecast a contraction in the economy during next year, before returning to weak growth from 2021. Almost all economic models reckon that any Brexit outcome would leave the UK worse off than it would be if it continued within the European Union, at least until its economy and businesses adapt to the shock, and find new trading arrangements with Europe and beyond. That includes the Treasury modelling. The Johnson administration has been pressed to produce estimates of the economic impact of the deal struck with the European Union, but it has chosen not to do so. It matters how long a transition to new, stable trading relations would take. Boris Johnson would like to get to that deal before the end of next year, when the transition period is due to end. However, trade negotiations usually take several years to reach an agreement. In recent times, several have been abandoned before getting to a deal, such as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), being negotiated between the pre-Brexit referendum European Commission and the pre-Trump United States. Britain would want to get to a deal as fast as possible, while its negotiating partners would have less pressure to do so. That puts Britain in a weaker negotiating position. The post-Brexit outcome of a Free Trade Agreement with the EU is assumed to mean a cut in the share of exports within the EU of 29%, and no increase in tariffs. Productivity is expected to fall below the levels that should be achievable within the EU, by 3.5% - the same as the Treasury assumption for the whole UK. That is partly explained by the reduction in inward investment. Foreign companies clearly tend to bring in more productive ways of working, which spread through the economy. Without easy access to EU markets, Britain could be less appealing to them. The fall in foreign investment is assumed to be 17.5%. The population would grow at 2.8% below that assumed through the free movement of EU citizens, drawing on work done by the Office for Budget Responsibility. And remember the Leave campaign claims of billions of pounds made available by not handing money to Brussels? That would help the economy a little - around a third of one per cent of total output. Looking at similar attempts to calculate this - from the Treasury to the OECD richer countries' club and the Fraser of Allander Institute - a similar set of assumption is made.  All such figures can be rubbished, according to taste and prejudice. There were, indeed, wild warnings about a Leave vote's immediate impact. The economy has not been in recession, and the labour market remains uncommonly strong. However, the effect of slower growth than the economy would otherwise have achieved is not obvious unless you refer to your EU neighbours and see how they have been pulling ahead. For those who travel in the eurozone, it is clear that British pound's buying power has declined. For those who don't travel overseas, the weaker pound has led to food price inflation, but not to an alarming extent. So, while the UK and Scotland have not become worse off than they were, they have become worse off than they would otherwise have been. The Fraser of Allander Institute recently published its estimate of how much Scotland has already fallen behind the position it might otherwise have been in - during the 40 months since the referendum. It said that Brexit uncertainty ""continues to act as a drag on Scotland's economy with output around 2% smaller (or £3bn) as a result of the weaker performance post-referendum"". And remember that the £1,600 figure, as with the others, is an average. If it were to be correct, some could be much better off because of Brexit: others much worse off. There is a new concern that the different arrangements for Northern Ireland threaten to put it at an advantage over Scottish businesses, in having easier access to the European single market. The extent of that divergence would depend on the nature of a Free Trade Agreement, so it is hard to quantify until that deal is done. The concerns of the food and drink sector, and particularly seafood, are to the fore in the ministers' analysis. And services are seen as a potential victim of being overlooked in favour of goods trade. Immigration, the decline of the working population and access to EU higher education funding, of which Scotland gets a large share, are also raised. In common with other opposition parties in the House of Commons, Scottish ministers are concerned at the apparent weakening of previous commitments to labour, environmental and human rights protections. These can still be found, but no longer in the Withdrawal Agreement. They are in the non-binding outline of the long-term UK-EU relationship, and could be negotiable in trade negotiations with other countries, including the USA. Theresa May's deal focused on a UK relationship with the EU which would be ""as close as possible"". Boris Johnson's replaces this with an ""ambitious"" relationship. In the final, pre-election Question Time joust between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the intention of a deregulated deal with the USA, potentially opening the National Health Service to far more private sector influence, was the main thrust of the Labour leader's campaign message."
Yield Spread Analysis,Italians protest against Covid measures,2024-09-14,2020-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54701042,"Protests took place across Italy on Monday over new restrictions to curb the country's second wave of Covid. Clashes were reported in the northern cities such as Turin, where petrol bombs were thrown at officers. In Milan tear gas was used to disperse protesters, and thousands of people gathered in the centre of Naples. The demonstrations began soon after the national government's order to close restaurants, bars, gyms and cinemas came into effect at 18:00 local time. Many regions have also imposed night-time curfews - including Lombardy, where Milan is, and Piedmont, where Turin is. The violence was blamed on extremist agitators and police said 28 people had been arrested in Milan alone. Protests took place in about a dozen other cities, including Rome, Genoa, Palermo and Trieste. Taxi drivers occupied a central square in Turin while restaurant owners beat pots and pans in the centre of Cremona. In Naples, a big crowd gathered in the central Piazza del Plebiscito, many calling on the regional governor to resign. While an initial national lockdown earlier this year was complied with little resistance, the announcement of renewed measures has been met with immediate pushback. Small businesses argue that they are still recovering from that first lockdown, and that more restrictions could bankrupt them. The days of clapping for medical staff and of rainbow banners reading ""everything will be alright"" seem a distant memory. The virus may be back - but the near-total support for the anti-Covid fight that Italians showed in the first wave is breaking. The protests so far are not huge. The vast majority of Italians still seem to understand the need to tighten measures, fearful that cases are again spiralling out of control. But the world's first national lockdown - and one of its longest - has taken its toll, with an economy forecast to shrink by 10% this year.  Some on the streets are peaceful: an agonised call for help by restaurateurs or gym-owners. But a mix of far-right and far-left agitators, organised crime groups and bored football hooligans have sensed an opening, looting shops and clashing with police. The interior minister warns of ""an autumn of social tension"". This is a risky moment for the government. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has pledged quick financial help. The president has stressed that ""the enemy is the virus."" But the mood of a nation scared into compliance in March is beginning to turn.  A number of luxury stores in central Turin, including a Gucci boutique, were ransacked by crowds that spilled into the streets after the rules came into force. Demonstrators let off firecrackers and lit flares, while police in riot gear responded with tear gas. In Milan, crowds chanted ""Freedom, freedom, freedom!"" as they clashed with police in the city centre. The city is the capital of Lombardy, which has been particularly hard hit by the virus. Restaurants, bars and cafes must stop table service at 18:00 and offer only take-away until midnight. Contact sports are prohibited but shops and most businesses will remain open. The new restrictions, which are in force until 24 November, will also see 75% of classes at Italy's high schools and universities conducted online instead of in a classroom. Regional governments had asked for all classes to be conducted via distance learning, Italian media reported, but the move was opposed by Education Minister Lucia Azzolina. The government is also urging people not to travel outside their home towns or cities unless absolutely necessary and to avoid using public transport if possible. ""We think that we will suffer a bit this month but by gritting our teeth with these restrictions, we'll be able to breathe again in December,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told a news conference on Sunday. Gyms and pools have also closed in the Belgian capital Brussels, and shops must shut at 20:00. Masks are now compulsory in public spaces. These rules will remain in force until 19 November. Meanwhile doctors in the Belgian city of Liège have been asked to keep working, even if they have coronavirus. The head of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions told the BBC they had no choice if they were to prevent the hospital system collapsing within days.  In the UK, people aged 16 to 25 are more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job during the pandemic, BBC Panorama has found.  Research seen by the programme also suggests the education gap between privileged and disadvantaged young people has widened further.  In France, health experts have warned that the number of new Covid-19 cases per day could be about 100,000 - twice the official figure. Prof Jean-François Delfraissy, the head of France's scientific council which advises the government on the pandemic, said the estimated figure included undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases. He told RTL radio he was surprised by the ""brutality"" of the second wave which he expected to be much worse than the first, adding: ""Many of our fellow citizens have not yet realised what awaits us."" France has already imposed night-time curfews on major cities, including Paris. The country has recorded more than 1.1 million cases in total and 34,780 deaths. The Czech Republic has also introduced a night-time curfew, which came into effect on Tuesday at midnight for a week. Nobody will be allowed to leave their homes between 21:00 and 04:59 each night except to travel to and from work, for medical reasons or a few other exceptions. All shops will be shut on Sundays and will close at 20:00 on other days. Spain has declared a national state of emergency and imposed a night-time curfew amid a new spike in Covid-19 infections. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the curfew, which came into force on Sunday night, would be in place between the hours of 23:00 and 06:00. Under the measures, local authorities can also ban travel between regions. Spain has seen more than one million cases and 34,750 deaths. Russia has registered a record 17,347 new daily coronavirus cases, officials said on Monday. Total reported cases have surpassed 1.5 million - but the mayor of the worst-hit city, Moscow, said that while ""there is still growth... it is slower""."
Yield Spread Analysis,Gueye refused to wear PSG shirt with rainbow symbol,2024-09-14,2022-05-18,John Bennett,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61492696,"Kouyate (right) and Gueye were both part of the Senegal side that won the country's first African Cup of Nations title in February Paris St-Germain's Idrissa Gueye refused to play in a match to avoid wearing a rainbow symbol in support of LGBTQ+ rights, BBC Sport understands. The 32-year-old former Aston Villa and Everton midfielder was absent from Saturday's 4-0 win over Montpellier. PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino said only that Senagalese Gueye missed the game for ""personal reasons"". The French Football Federation (FFF) has reportedly written to Gueye to clarify why he was absent. BBC Sport has approached Gueye's representatives for comment. Crystal Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate and Watford's Ismaila Sarr have posted on social media in apparent support of their Senegal team-mate's stance. Kouyate posted a picture of himself alongside Gueye on Instagram, with a caption calling Gueye ""a real man"". Watford winger Sarr posted a picture of him and Gueye accompanied by three heart emojis and the caption ""100%"". In response to Sarr's post, Watford reiterated their commitment to equality and diversity, adding ""this includes the willingness to offer further education and support to any of its employees"". At a news conference on Wednesday, Crystal Palace boss Patrick Vieira said if his player had posted in relation to Gueye, he would speak to them. ""It's going to be an in-house conversation,"" he added.  Homosexuality is illegal in Senegal and punishable by prison sentences of up to five years. It is also illegal in Qatar, where PSG's owners hail from and where the men's 2022 World Cup will be staged later this year. The top Twitter trend in the world on Wednesday was #WeareallIdrissa with tweets sent to support Gueye's stance. Gueye's stance is in contrast to the overwhelmingly positive response from football towards Blackpool's 17-year-old forward Jake Daniels coming out as gay on Monday - the first openly gay men's professional footballer in Britain since Justin Fashanu 30 years ago.

In addition to missing Saturday's win over Montpellier, Gueye, who arrived at PSG for £30m in July 2019, missed last year's show of solidarity citing gastroenteritis, according to Le Parisien newspaper, who first reported the reason for his absence., external The AFP news agency said on Wednesday it had seen a letter from the FFF's ethics board calling on Gueye to explain why he missed Saturday's game. The letter, says AFP, calls for him to ""issue a public apology"" or to say that the rumours he refused to play are ""unfounded"". The letter reportedly adds if he did refuse to play he would be ""validating discriminatory behaviour"". PSG said on Wednesday that they were ""very proud to wear this shirt"".  ""The biggest stars of world football were on the field on Saturday and expressed the club's commitment to the fight against homophobia and all forms of discrimination,"" it added. Gueye's stance has been supported by prominent politicians in Senegal. The country's president Macky Sall wrote on Twitter, external that Gueye's Muslim beliefs must be respected, while sport minister Matar Ba wrote that Gueye was backed by his country's people, alongside a picture of the midfielder on pilgrimage to Mecca., external Babacar Diarra, BBC Africa From his team-mates with the national team like PSG's Abdou Diallo or Crystal Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate to the president Macky Sall or even the novelist Boubacar Boris Diop, Idrissa Gana Gueye was widely backed on social medias across Senegal and the diaspora. It followed speculation he didn't want to wear the PSG jersey on Saturday as part of Ligue 1's anti-homophobic campaign. President Sall has always been vocal in his interviews with international media to confirm that he will not decriminalise homosexuality. He confirmed this position when he tweeted Tuesday that Gueye's ""religious beliefs should be respected"", a day after the sports minister Matar Ba told local media that the government was giving their support to the African champion. The president of the federation Augustin Senghor said the vice-captain of the Teranga Lions didn't ""violate his contract with PSG and just needs others to respect his faith"" which is why he called him to express his support. On Twitter, the hashtag #jesuisidrissaganagueye (""I am Idrissa Gana Gueye"" in French) spread since Sunday with the Senegalese community and even people from other countries criticizing the player's treatment in the foreign media."
Yield Spread Analysis,Titan sub implosion: How did it happen?,2024-09-14,2023-06-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65934887,"US authorities say a debris field located in the North Atlantic leads to a conclusion that OceanGate's Titan submersible suffered a ""catastrophic implosion"" (a violent collapse inwards), instantly killing all five passengers on board. The US Navy says it detected sounds ""consistent with an implosion"" shortly after the sub lost contact on Sunday during a descent to the Titanic wreck at 3,800m (12,467ft) below sea level - but this information was only made public on Thursday. The loss of the deep-water vessel was finally confirmed after a huge search mission in the area off Canada's Newfoundland province. Titan's hull is believed to have collapsed on Sunday as a result of enormous water pressure.  The sub was built to withstand such pressure - and experts will now be trying to determine what exactly went wrong. Analysis of the debris may help to establish this.  Titan is believed to have been 3,500m below sea level when contact was lost. The vessel was so deep that the amount of water on it would have been equivalent to the weight of the Eiffel Tower, tens of thousands of tonnes.  If there were a rupture to the structure, the pressure outside would be much greater than the one inside the hull, compressing the vessel. When a submarine hull collapses, it moves inward at about 1,500mph (2,414km/h) - that's 2,200ft (671m) per second, says Dave Corley, a former US nuclear submarine officer.  The time required for complete collapse is about one millisecond, or one thousandth of a second. A human brain responds instinctually to a stimulus at about 25 milliseconds, Mr Corley says. Human rational response - from sensing to acting - is believed to be at best 150 milliseconds. The air inside a sub has a fairly high concentration of hydrocarbon vapours.  When the hull collapses, the air auto-ignites and an explosion follows the initial rapid implosion, Mr Corley says. Human bodies incinerate and are turned to ash and dust instantly. Any investigation is sure to focus on the carbon fibre mid-section of the Titan sub.  The pressure vessels of deep vehicles like this are normally constructed from a robust metal such as titanium and are shaped in a sphere, to spread the immense pressure equally around the passenger compartment.  But to fit more people inside, the OceanGate sub adopted a cylindrical shape, with a carbon fibre tube inserted between to titanium end caps. Carbon fibre is very tough - they use it to build aeroplane wings and racing cars.  Titanic Sub Search Jessica Parker explores how the search for the Titan submersible unfolded and its devastating outcome.  Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) But did that immense pressure at depth - more than 300 times the atmosphere at the sea surface - play on the material to expose flaws in the original fabrication or to introduce and then worsen instabilities over repeated dives? Any investigation would want to know about the practice non-destructive testing.  Aircraft are subjected to regular, very fine-scale inspections to ensure their materials are not developing cracks or that their layers are not starting to separate.  Photographing the Titan debris found on the ocean floor and bringing them back to the surface for study in a forensic lab may allow engineers to identify where on the sub structural integrity was lost, initiating the catastrophic implosion.

Yield Spread Analysis,So what DID China do when outbreak emerged?,2024-09-14,2020-05-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52573137,"The US and other countries have raised questions about whether China was fully transparent when the virus first emerged there. So what do we know about what happened in China, and what did it say and do about the outbreak? Here's our timeline: 1 December - The first onset of symptoms are observed, according to the Lancet medical journal.   However, it's believed the virus first appeared some time in November.   27 December - Chinese authorities are told about a Sars-like disease by a doctor in a provincial hospital in Hubei province.  By this point, cases are multiplying. 30 December - The health commission in Wuhan notifies local hospitals of a ""pneumonia of unclear cause"", and asks them to report any related information of suspicious cases in the past week.  Ai Fen, a leading doctor at Wuhan Central hospital, receives medical results from a patient with a suspected coronavirus.  Dr Ai takes a photo of the results and sends it to another doctor in the area. It circulates among the medical community in Wuhan.  Another doctor at Wuhan Central hospital, Dr Li Wenliang, sends a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them about the outbreak and advising they wear protective clothing to avoid infection. Dr Li is later summoned to the Public Security Bureau and accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order"". Reports spread on Chinese social media platform Weibo of a ""mysterious pneumonia"", raising fears of a deadly virus.  31 December - Chinese officials confirm they are investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia and dispatch a team of health experts to the region.  Authorities say seven are in a critical condition yet no human-to-human transmission has been identified.  The authorities alert the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 January - A hospital in Wuhan posts on the Chinese social media platform WeChat that they are ""fighting a mysterious pneumonia"".   Dr Ai Fen says she is reprimanded by a hospital disciplinary committee for ""spreading rumours"".  The Wuhan Public Security Bureau detains eight people for spreading rumours about the virus, reporting it on a Chinese news programme, Xinwen Lianbo, a show watched by millions.   The WHO puts itself on an emergency footing to deal with a potential outbreak.  Chinese authorities shut down Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, the location of a number of cases and a potential source of the virus.  3 January - Various allegations gain traction on Chinese social media, such as local health authorities silencing hospital staff from speaking out about the virus. (We are unable to independently verify these posts and many were removed by Chinese authorities which heavily censor the internet.)  Wuhan health authorities say it is investigating the cause of the outbreak. Its statement says there has been no human-to-human transmission.  7 January - Chinese top leaders, including President Xi Jinping, discuss the outbreak at a meeting of the standing committee of the politburo, indicating they knew about the virus from an early date. 8 January - A team of experts from the National Health Committee identifies a new coronavirus as the cause of the epidemic. 9 January - China makes public the genome of the coronavirus, proving its link to Sars and Mers viruses. Scientists are now able to develop tests for the virus.  11-17 January - The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts its important annual political meetings for Hubei province. There are no reports of increases in cases during this period.  13 January - The first case outside China is confirmed. The WHO says a traveller from Wuhan was identified by officials in Thailand on 8 January and taken to hospital the same day. 14 January - The WHO posts on Twitter that ""preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission."" However, there are reports that local hospitals suspect otherwise due to the number of patients.  15 January - A patient returns to the US from Wuhan and becomes the first known US case of Covid-19.  20 January - A group of health experts at China's National Health Commission confirm human-to-human transmission of the virus, as cases are identified elsewhere in the country. The first case in South Korea is announced.  20 - 21 January - The WHO sends a delegation to conduct field research in Wuhan. They say evidence suggests human-to-human transmission is taking place but more analysis is needed. 21 January - China's flagship state-run newspaper, People's Daily, refers to coronavirus for the first time and what President Xi is doing to tackle it. Up until then, state media is either ignoring or underplaying the outbreak, choosing to concentrate on plans for the Lunar New Year. Chinese state media confirms 291 cases of coronavirus. Responding to international pressure about a potential cover-up, Beijing's top political body responsible for law and order says: ""Anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of [virus] cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity."" The WHO discuss if they should announce that the outbreak is an international health emergency.  23 January - Wuhan (and nearby cities) are put under lockdown.  The WHO decides not to declare an international health emergency.  23-25 January - Construction workers in China start building two new hospitals from scratch.  24-30 January - China celebrates the Lunar New Year holiday, when millions of people travel across the country.  25 January - Chinese officials request all travellers leaving the country to declare their health status. 26 January: The Chinese government imposes a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals throughout the country, which is later made permanent. 28 January - Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, meets President Xi to discuss the outbreak, highlighting it as the institution's top priority.  30 January - The WHO declares Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency of Global Concern - this follows 82 confirmed cases outside China.  Update 10 May: The post about the ban on trade in wild animals was changed to reflect the two-stage process."
Yield Spread Analysis,Managerless Hibs stun Aberdeen for first win,2024-09-14,2023-09-03,Andy Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66631546,"Adam Le Fondre (far right) volleyed Hibs in front Managerless Hibernian secured their first Scottish Premiership win of the season after substitutes Adam Le Fondre and Christian Doidge sunk Aberdeen. Le Fondre lashed a left-foot shot home with 15 minutes to play and Doidge soon nodded a second. Elie Youan and Martin Boyle had tested home goalkeeper Kelle Roos before the break, while Joe Newell could not bend his effort on target at a second-half Hibs corner. Visiting goalkeeper David Marshall did well to save a deflected James McGarry shot when the game was goalless. Barry Robson's Aberdeen, now second bottom, remain without a league win this campaign and have two points to Hibs' three after four games. Reaction & as it happened Keep up to date with Aberdeen The latest Hibernian news Hibs' approach attempted to capitalise on pace in wide areas, with Boyle and Youan both forcing Roos into action. Aberdeen were largely restricted to shots from outside the box in the opening period with Graeme Shinnie and Bojan Miovski testing Marshall. Miovski had another effort from closer range blocked by an attentive Hibs defence. Newell's strike on a bouncing ball curved wide, while Luis 'Duk' Lopes then went down in the Hibs box with Lewis Miller in close quarters. No penalty was awarded, nor a booking for simulation. In an increasingly scrappy game, McGarry tried to force an effort after Hibs cleared a corner, but Marshall leapt to his right to make the save. And it proved to be crucial as Doidge chased a lost cause on the right, crossed for Newell who teed up Le Fondre to convert on the volley. Doidge then headed Newell's corner off the crossbar, but Lewis Miller and Paul Hanlon's headers kept the chance alive and Doidge got his goal in the end. He may only have been on the field for around 20 minutes but the striker played a crucial role in both goals With Europe now behind them, Hibs can fully focus on domestic matters and victory at Pittodrie was just the tonic they needed after conceding eight goals to Aston Villa and losing their first three league games of the campaign. Until the introductions of Le Fondre and Doidge, neither side showed the necessary leadership in attack to really take control. The experienced pair's presence and guile reset the game and put Hibs on course for victory. Exactly who manages Hibs into the autumn may become clearer during the international break with former captain David Gray taking interim charge again after Lee Johnson's departure last week. Europe too has been an early-season distraction for Aberdeen and they have a Europa Conference League campaign to come after a midweek Europa League play-off loss to BK Hacken. The Dons need to find their best formula sooner or later or risk the domestic inconsistency of last season's Europa Conference League entrants, Hearts. New defenders are still being integrated into Barry Robson's team but the forwards must offer more - only three of their 10 efforts hit the target and only one caused Marshall real bother. Aberdeen manager Barry Robson: ""That's not how we want to play. That was the frustrating part. We are building a new team. We've got all these players that have just come in the door. They've hardly introduced themselves to each other. ""We will be fine. We've got real speed, we've got a good group, we've got some really good players and once we get going, we'll be fine. I'm really relaxed about that."" Hibernian interim manager David Gray: ""It's a fantastic team performance, right through the team. We've been conceded too many goals, we're aware of that. We were fully deserving of the win. ""David Marshall makes a great save at 0-0. It was such a team performance. I'm delighted with the two boys coming on and getting goals but, to a man, they were absolutely outstanding."" Aberdeen return to action after the international break with a Premiership visit to Hearts on Saturday, 16 September, when Hibernian are at Kilmarnock (both 15:00 BST).

Yield Spread Analysis,Coronavirus field hospital could open in two weeks,2024-09-14,2020-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52092082,"The Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow could be in operation as a temporary hospital within two weeks, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The emergency facility will be run by the NHS and could have capacity for more than 1,000 patients. The first minister confirmed that six more people with Covid-19 have died in Scotland, bringing the total to 47. A total of 1,563 people were confirmed as having been diagnosed with the virus - up from 1,384 on Sunday. Meanwhile screening programmes for bowel, breast and cervical cancer have been put on hold in a bid to free up capacity in the health services. And 10,000 people have come forward to volunteer to help support services and vulnerable people inside the first four hours of the new Scotland Cares campaign. Exploratory work had been carried out by the army to see if the SEC could be used as a temporary hospital, similar to those being set up in London, Birmingham and Manchester. Ms Sturgeon said work had begun to initially create capacity for 300 extra beds, but that figure could ultimately rise to over 1,000. Ms Sturgeon stressed that ""we might not need to use the exhibition centre"", with 3,000 of the 13,000 hospital beds across Scotland's NHS hospitals currently being kept available for coronavirus patients. However she said it ""makes sense for us to act now to increase hospital capacity further"", with the SEC the ""best option"" for doing this given its proximity to other facilities and transport links. She said the extra beds there would ""initially be for use by those who have been through hospital treatment and are recovering from their symptoms"". Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the emergency facility would be a hospital staffed by and run by the NHS, ""with full clinical and medical infection control standards"". SEC chief executive Peter Duthie said he was ""proud to be in a position to help our NHS"", adding: ""Our teams will support the NHS in the build, security and safe operation of the resource, and continue to express our sincere gratitude for all that they are doing to fight Covid-19."" Work is also ongoing to quadruple the number of intensive care beds in Scotland to 700 - Ms Sturgeon said there were now 108 patients with the virus in intensive care, up 13 from the weekend. Other measures are also being taken to free up capacity in the NHS, with treatments such as knee and hip operations being put off. Ms Sturgeon said ministers had now taken the ""very difficult"" decision to suspend screening programmes for breast, cervical and bowel cancer. Hundreds of thousands of people take part in these screenings each year, but the first minister said it was important to ""maximise"" the ability of the health services to deal with the virus over the coming weeks. The government has also encouraged medical students and retired healthcare staff to volunteer their services to ""plug gaps"" in frontline services. Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood said up to 20% of the health workforce could ultimately have to take time off due to illness. Ms Sturgeon said about 5,000 students or former workers have expressed an interest in filling posts, and said ""many will be offered fixed-term employment"". Two weeks before the expected peak in the virus, NHS Scotland is getting ready. They are freeing up staff for the frontline. That lies behind today's decision to suspend screening programmes.  This will be worrying for some patients and it's a difficult balancing act. Contact with health professionals could spread the disease further but could also store up problems for the future. The decision to announce the SEC in Glasgow as the site of a temporary hospital is also getting more capacity into the system to deal with the coming peak in infections. It's a complex exercise as it's important to keep Covid-19 patients away from others to prevent cross-infection. Within a fortnight the new hospital could be providing 300 extra beds and this could eventually reach 1,000 beds.  The Scottish government say they are making the decision now to act now, even while hoping they won't need to use it. Meanwhile police in Scotland have handed out 25 fixed penalty notices to people who were not complying with social distancing rules. Ms Sturgeon said ""the vast majority of people are doing the right thing to protect themselves and the wider community"", saying that ""by staying at home we can all help slow the spread of this virus and ultimately save lives"". Warning that strict measures could be in place for a long period of time, she added: ""I don't want people to have to comply with these measures for a single day longer than is necessary. ""I want to get back to normal in this country as soon as possible. But we need to keep the measures in place for as long as we judge, based on expert advice, and I and others have to ask the public to stick with them."""
Yield Spread Analysis,Coronavirus lockdowns reduced human 'rumble',2024-09-14,2020-07-23,By Jonathan Amos,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53518751,"The rumble generated by humanity took a big dive during the Covid lockdowns. Everything we do - from driving our cars to operating our factories - produces ground motions that can be detected by seismometers.   An international team of researchers says this noise fell by up to half when coronavirus restrictions were enforced.  The period March-May represents ""the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction on record"", they tell Science journal. The group obtained their motion data from a global network of 268 seismic stations in 117 countries. Many of the stations were citizen science efforts incorporating Raspberry-Pi mini-computers.  These instruments were sensitive to all types of vibrations but also that band of frequencies, in the region of 4-14 Hertz, where human activities show up. Their information reveals how the quieting started in January in China, the origin of the Covid crisis, and then spread like a wave to the rest of the globe. As people were ordered home, travel restrictions were imposed, and places of work came to a halt - the usual vibrations put into the ground were abruptly dialled down.   The biggest reductions were recorded in the most densely populated areas, like Singapore and New York City, but drops were also observed in remote areas like Germany's Black Forest and Rundu in Namibia. And the phenomenon wasn't confined just to the surface; the quieting was evident even at stations placed in boreholes hundreds of metres underground. Seismometers have long recognised a drop in this shaking at nights, at weekends and during holiday periods - but this lull was far more pronounced and prolonged. ""I think one of the most interesting things for me is that this is really our first look at what actually contributes to the human-caused field of noise,"" observed co-author Dr Steve Hicks from Imperial College London, UK.  ""And as populations get bigger, and as cities get bigger - particularly those in geologically hazardous areas - we need to work out how we're going to monitor those hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides. Because as time goes on, more and more important signals that tell us about these kinds of events are going to get concealed."" Dr Hicks highlighted a shallow, Magnitude 5 earthquake that occurred in Mexico during its lockdown.  The location meant that its signal would not normally be detected in urban areas without special processing of the data. On this occasion, however, the ""filtering"" wasn't necessary because the human vibrations that would otherwise smother the natural signal were reduced by 40%. Dr Hicks says a better understanding of human seismic noise could therefore improve the detection and interpretation of delicate signals that might give warning of potentially harmful events, such as a volcanic eruption. The team says it saw very strong correlations with the mobility trends compiled by the likes of Google and Apple. These trends are derived from the locations and movements of cell phones. Governments used this information to gauge how well populations were following lockdown rules. Dr Hicks says if we go back into wide-scale restrictions then the seismic data offers an alternative form of monitoring that may carry fewer privacy concerns. ""I guess people worry that their mobile phone is tracking them, even though this information should be anonymised. But the very strong correlations with the mobile phone data mean the seismic noise can also be used to monitor mobility, from a more general point of view on, for example, the city scale; or in those places where the phone data simply isn't available. We weren't able to access any data like that for China, for example.""  The scientific collaboration that examined the seismic data involved 76 authors from 66 institutions in 27 countries. The group was led by Dr Thomas Lecocq from the Royal Observatory of Belgium.  Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
Yield Spread Analysis,US vows strongest ever Iran sanctions,2024-09-14,2018-05-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44200621,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the US is imposing the ""strongest sanctions in history"" on Iran. In a speech in Washington, America's top diplomat said Iran would be ""battling to keep its economy alive"" after the sanctions took effect. His Iranian counterpart said the US was a prisoner of its ""failed policies"" and would suffer the consequences. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump took the US out of the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Mr Pompeo had not demonstrated in his speech how abandoning the deal made the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation. US sanctions lifted after the 2015 deal will be re-imposed, Mr Pompeo said, and those and new measures will together constitute ""unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime"". The older American sanctions prohibited almost all trade with Iran, making some exceptions only for activity ""intended to benefit the Iranian people"" such as the export of medical and agricultural equipment. The secretary of state did not say what new measures Washington was contemplating but he described sanctions imposed last week on the head of Iran's central bank as ""just the beginning"".  Some of Europe's biggest firms who rushed to do business with Iran after the nuclear deal now find themselves forced to choose between investing there or trading with the US. Some of the biggest contracts at risk include: Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, and the export of oil and gas is worth billions of dollars each year. Both the country's oil output and its GDP fell noticeably under international sanctions. The sanctions will not be re-imposed on Tehran immediately but are subject to three-month and six-month wind-down periods. ""Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East,"" Mr Pompeo said. Javad Zarif said America was ""regressing to old habits"". Iran, he added, was working with the other partners of the nuclear deal to find a solution. Ms Mogherini said there was ""no alternative"" to the JCPOA. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent This then is the US ""Plan B"" for Iran - to step up the sanctions pressure, to force the Tehran government into a new diplomatic deal.  It would need to accept broader constraints not just on its nuclear activities but also on its missile programme and wider behaviour in the region.  It is certainly tough but may be totally unrealistic. For sanctions to work they must be comprehensive. The pressure that brought about the JCPOA deal that President Trump has now abandoned was long-standing and widely supported. Now Washington's European allies want to stick with the existing deal. Russia, China and India are unlikely to bow to US pressure. Compelling allies and other countries to abandon trade with Iran risks damaging a whole series of wider diplomatic relationships. Critics may charge that this ""policy"" is impossible - a diplomatic smokescreen intended to cloak a policy whose fundamental goal is regime change in Iran. Read Jonathan's analysis in full Mr Pompeo laid out 12 conditions for any ""new deal"" with Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Others include Tehran: It has spread its influence across parts of the Middle East where there are large communities of fellow Shia Muslims, from Iraq to Lebanon. Its support for Lebanon's Hezbollah movement is particularly alarming for Israel while Saudi Arabia, another bitter enemy, accuses the Iranians of equipping rebels in Yemen. In the Syrian civil war, it is one of President Bashar al-Assad's few outside allies, sending thousands of fighters and military advisers.  Israel praised the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the pact but the move was roundly criticised by fellow signatories, including France, Germany, the UK and Russia. All of the above signatories pledged to honour their commitments under the deal. Mr Pompeo has made clear he expects the backing of his allies in Europe but also called for support from ""Australia, Bahrain, Egypt, India, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea [and] the UAE"". ""We welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation and the brutality of a regime at peace with inflicting chaos on innocent people,"" he said. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted. The deal was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the IAEA."

The Daily Mail, the Sun and the Daily Telegraph all use the same image on their front pages - of an injured man, holding his head and being helped by police officers. The Mail calls it a ""massacre of holiday families"" and the paper has eyewitness accounts from Britons who had to run for their lives as a van sped through crowds in Las Ramblas. It describes abandoned prams, toys and tourists' selfie sticks among the carnage. Pictures on a double-page spread inside the paper capture the fear and panic on people's faces. The word ""massacre"" also appears in the Daily Mirror headline. Its front page shows people lying in the street, with some of them pixelated because the images are too graphic. Inside the paper it calls Las Ramblas ""the street of blood and tears"", and carries more powerful photos of people caught up in the violence and armed police sweeping the streets. The Sun devotes two pages to a Moroccan suspect named by Spanish police as the man who hired the van. The paper calls Driss Oubakir a Muslim ""party boy"" who likes ""dope, rap and booze"" - but adds that he has denied any involvement. The Telegraph's report includes a claim that the CIA warned Spanish authorities two months ago that the tourist area in Barcelona was a potential terrorist target. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Thursday's A-level results also get widespread coverage. The news that boys got more top marks than girls for the first time in 17 years prompts the Mirror's headline ""alpha males"". The Times notes that fewer pupils are choosing English and History in favour of science subjects. The paper's analysis says the results are the first product of ""sweeping changes"" by former Education Secretary Michael Gove and it broadly believes they are working to help restore the prestige of the A-level exam. The Mail's editorial suggests that reforms to prevent ""rampant grade inflation"" have been undermined as pass marks are lowered. The Guardian argues that the government has given a low priority to alternatives to university education which is failing to meet the needs of the economy. It concludes that Mr Gove's focus on the academic was ""misdirected"". The Times and the Telegraph both feature the discovery of an 18th Century Dutch merchant ship off the Kent coast along with its lost crew. The Times explains how the vessel, thought to have been carrying silver coins, was first located 20 years ago on Goodwin Sands but is now being excavated after concerns that it was being destroyed by shifting currents. The Telegraph says the discovery of human remains will yield clues as to how the crew lived and died. Marine archaeologist Mark Dunkley tells the paper: ""It's so rare to find a crew on a shipwreck. It's like an underwater Pompeii"". Scotland has a new species of indigenous butterfly, according to the Guardian. It reports that the endangered white-letter hairstreak has been spotted in Berwickshire, just 100m from the English border. It is apparently the first time it has been sighted in Scotland since 1884 - and it is thought that climate change may have helped it to become the 34th species to live and breed in the country. Paul Kirkland, of Butterfly Conservation Scotland, tells the Guardian: ""Climate change is a double-edged sword but it's an exciting time to be in the Scottish borders.

""The dream is the Champions League - it would be fantastic to follow this dream. It's a step in the career of everyone. ""We're in the fight but you need to sacrifice until the end. There's more pressure because we're in the fight for Europe, we want to be there and we've worked really hard to be there. ""This is our step and our target. We have to step up a bit, there's more to sacrifice. ""If I look at the table I'm really happy because the position is good but it's not the end of the season and we have to fight."" West Brom had been the better team in the first half at The Hawthorns but England keeper Jordan Pickford made an excellent save to keep out Mbaye Diagne's second-minute header. Diagne thought he had grabbed a 93rd-minute equaliser when he controlled a pass and shot into the net, but he was denied because he was narrowly offside, with the video assistant referee (VAR) confirming the on-field decision. West Brom are 19th, in the relegation zone and nine points behind 17th-placed Newcastle United, who they host on Sunday. West Brom v Everton as it happened, plus reaction, analysis and the rest of Thursday's Premier League action Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Lawro's predictions v DJ & producer Majestic Everton have been English champions on nine occasions but since the launch of the Premier League for the 1992-93 season, have only finished in the top four once - in 2004-05. Indeed, they have never played in the group stage of the Champions League, missing out in 2005-06 after a 4-2 aggregate loss to Spanish side Villarreal in the third qualifying round. However, with 12 league games to go, Ancelotti's team have a great chance to be playing alongside the continent's elite next season. Thursday's win continues a remarkable turnaround for the Toffees, who were in the Premier League relegation zone under Marco Silva in December 2019, before he was sacked and caretaker boss Duncan Ferguson lifted them out of the bottom three, with Ancelotti then continuing that progress. Instrumental in Everton's revival has been Dominic Calvert-Lewin and the England striker, who scored a hat-trick in the Toffees' 5-2 win over West Brom at Goodison Park in September, had their best chance of the first half. A fortunate deflection took the ball into his path but he shot against goalkeeper Sam Johnstone's legs from 12 yards with only the keeper to beat. Richarlison also had a first-half chance but a superb challenge from Darnell Furlong denied the Brazilian, as the deflection took the shot narrowly over the top. But the forward was not to be denied later on when he got in front of Johnstone to meet Sigurdsson's cross from the left and powerfully head home from close range. The result also continues Everton's fine away record - they have now won nine of 13 league games on the road this season. This video can not be played West Brom 0-1 Everton: Baggies should have been awarded penalty, says Sam Allardyce West Brom had come into this game on an unbeaten run of three games, with clean sheets in their past two, and they will surely feel they deserved something from this game. They thought they had got a point in injury time, when Diagne superbly controlled the ball and fired past Pickford - but the assistant referee raised his flag and the VAR footage showed he was offside by under a foot. Manager Sam Allardyce has managed seven other clubs in the Premier League - including Everton - but never been relegated from the top flight, although this will surely be one of the best achievements of his career if he can keep the Baggies up. He replaced the sacked Slaven Bilic after West Brom had picked up seven points from their opening 13 games, but they have now only gained an additional 10 points in Allardyce's 14 matches in charge. West Brom have only scored three times in their past six games However, he should be pleased with his side's performance on Thursday. Diagne was their main threat but he was denied by Pickford in the second minute, then later shot over on the turn and also headed just off target following Furlong's long throw. Those missed chances proved costly as Richarlison's goal proved the difference and gave Everton the three points. Allardyce was unhappy a penalty was not awarded for Mason Holgate's challenge on Diagne, a decision which referee Darren England was not asked to review on the pitchside monitor. ""I've seen 50 or 60 penalties given for less than that and I don't know why it wasn't given,"" Allardyce told BBC Match of the Day. ""Holgate went straight across his standing leg and when you slow it down it looks even worse. ""Why [video assistant referee] Michael Oliver has not asked him to have a look at it and just dismissed it, I don't know."" This was Everton's fifth Premier League double over West Brom - more than they have managed against any other side. The Toffees have won nine away league games this season, their joint-most on the road in a campaign in the competition (also 2008-09). Everton have scored more headed goals than any other Premier League side this season, with Richarlison's winner their 11th. No team has failed to score in more different home Premier League games this season than West Brom (eight), with the Baggies also conceding a league-high 33 goals in home games. Richarlison scored in his fourth consecutive Premier League game for Everton, becoming the first Brazilian player to score in four matches in a row in the competition. West Brom manager Allardyce, speaking to Match of the Day, said: ""When you start well and play as well as we did, we only have ourselves to blame. ""We got a good finish at the end but it was probably two millimetres offside. ""I thought we had the better opportunities and am very satisfied with the performance, but it does not mean a lot when you don't get the points. ""You have to defend crosses and Richarlison made it his own. I would've been satisfied with a point - but that's the best 90 minutes since I've been here."" This video can not be played West Brom 0-1 Everton: Match-winner Richarlison hitting 'top' form says Carlo Ancelotti Everton boss Ancelotti told Match of the Day: ""It was really hard, really difficult, but the Premier League is like this. West Brom has a lot of strength, fight, long balls and a lot of spirit. We needed to be ready and we were ready. ""Defensively we are strong and we have quality at set-pieces and on the counter-attack. ""We're doing well and now we're in the fight at the top of the table. The season is still long but we are there and pleased to be there. ""I would like to say the season has been a fantastic one at the end of the season."" West Brom face a big match next as they entertain 17th-placed Newcastle on Sunday (12:00 GMT) before an away game at Crystal Palace on Saturday, 13 March (15:00).

Yield Spread Analysis,NFL clubs to be fined if players kneel,2024-09-14,2018-05-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44230772,"NFL teams will be fined if players kneel for the US national anthem under a new policy. The American football league said players who do not stand for the Star-Spangled Banner can stay in the locker room until it has been performed. The NFL also vowed to ""impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem"".​ Players said the protests were against police brutality of African Americans. ""It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic,"" said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in a statement accompanying Wednesday's new policy. ""This is not and was never the case. This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.""  NFL players were previously required to be on the field for the anthem, but there was no firm directive to stand during the song. The policy includes the provision that clubs can develop their own rules - so long as they abide by the league's directive - to handle players who do not wish to stand. It does not state how much clubs will be fined should their athletes protest on the field, but gives them the option to impose penalties on any player who breaks the new rules. The statement comes a day after NFL teams pledged $90m (£67m) towards social justice initiatives, under an agreement reached with all 32 teams in the league. The debate over the kneeling protests began in 2016, when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem. Similar demonstrations spread across the league, where most players are African American. Some kneeled, as Mr Kaepernick had done, while others linked arms to show solidarity for the movement. President Donald Trump was highly critical of the protests, calling them ""disgraceful"" and unpatriotic. He also urged the players to be fired. US Vice-President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game because players from Mr Kaepernick's team knelt during the anthem. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Donald Trump started a staring contest with the NFL, and the NFL just blinked.  What began as a few unscripted presidential comments at an Alabama campaign rally escalated into a public relations nightmare for America's most popular sports league, which saw its patriotism questioned from the White House bully pulpit.  Within a matter of weeks the NFL's popularity plummeted among conservatives and its financial bottom line was threatened - stark proof that Mr Trump can drive the opinions of his supporters even when his target is a national juggernaut that has spent years branding itself as a shared American cultural experience.  Now protesting athletes, who always insisted they were kneeling to draw attention to the abused and ignored victims in American society, will have to save their demonstrations for the solitude of the pre-game locker room.  On the field, expressed love of anthem and flag will be mandatory.  The NFL Players Association (NFLPA) issued a statement following the policy announcement saying they were not consulted. ""NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about,"" the statement reads. ""The vote by NFL club CEOs today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the NFL's Management Council John Mara about the principles, values and patriotism of our League."" The NFLPA also said it will be reviewing the policy and will challenge aspects that are inconsistent with the agreement in place between the league and the union. Jed York, owner of the San Francisco 49ers team, abstained from voting on the new policy. ""I think there are a lot of reasons, and I'm not going to get into all of those reasons,"" Mr York told reporters, according to ESPN.  ""But I think the gist of it is really that we want to make sure that everything that we're doing is to promote progress. And I think we've done a good piece of that so far."" New York Jets CEO and chairman Christopher Johnson said he prefers that players stand for the national anthem but will not make them pay any fines. Mr Johnson told Newsday: ""I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players"". He said the Jets would pay any fines associated with kneeling during the anthem and he would work with players on social justice issues. On Twitter, Mr Pence voiced his support of the change with a succinct tweet that said: ""#Winning."" NFL player Dominique Hamilton called the policy a step ""backwards"" for the league. President Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for a ratings slide in the NFL. Last year the league saw a nearly 10% drop in viewership, according to Nielsen data. In 2016, there was an 8% decline. Though some fans appeared to tune out over the national anthem protests, other factors have also been cited. Some analysts blame the 2017 decline on the proliferation of games added through the expansion of Thursday Night Football.  The 2016 presidential election siphoned viewers while the league's domestic abuse scandal also played a role, according to a JD Power and Associates survey.   League viewership figures were also declining even before the ""take a knee"" protests as more viewers dumped cable subscriptions. But NFL games are still among the biggest television attractions. In 2017, NFL games accounted for 37 of the 50 most-watched programmes of the year, according to Nielsen. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Minister quits over Cummings' lockdown actions,2024-09-14,2020-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52806086,"Junior minister Douglas Ross has resigned after Dominic Cummings' defence of his trip to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. The Scotland Office minister said the senior aide's view of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"".  No 10 said the prime minister regretted Mr Ross's decision to stand down.  It comes as more than 35 Tory MPs have called on Mr Cummings to resign. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive 260 miles from his London home to his parents' farm with his child and ill wife - which he explained on Monday was for childcare purposes - dominated the government's daily coronavirus press briefing. Asked by a member of the public whether ministers would review penalty fines imposed on families who travel for childcare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I will have to talk to my Treasury colleagues before I can answer [that] in full and we will look at it."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, citing a government source, said Mr Hancock did ""not announce a review"" but would pass the concern on to his colleagues. Rev Martin Poole, a vicar from Brighton, said he asked the question of Mr Hancock because ""people feel a bit cheated"" and many feel a sense of ""unfairness"" about the story, adding: ""We want to all be treated on a level playing field."" During the No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock said he understood the ""anger that some people feel"" over Mr Cummings' actions, but added: ""My view is that what he did was within the guidelines."" Mr Ross, who remains Conservative MP for Moray, said Mr Cummings' ""intentions may have been well meaning"" - but that he could not tell constituents who had been unable to visit sick relatives during lockdown that ""they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right"". Mr Ross' decision was praised by Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who called it the ""decent thing"" and a ""difficult decision"" respectively. At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Mr Cummings said he did not regret his actions and believed he acted reasonably and legally.  Asked why, once in County Durham, he drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed coronavirus symptoms himself - Mr Cummings said he had experienced vision problems during his illness and was testing his eyesight to see if he could drive back to London.  The drip drip of Conservative MPs calling on Dominic Cummings to go has continued on Tuesday.  Now surpassing 35, it is around 10% of the parliamentary party.  However, what's notable is that there are those who, even if they're not calling on Mr Cummings to go, have felt it necessary to write long open letters explaining their thinking to constituents. Public anger, it seems, has not been put to bed by Monday's extraordinary rose garden press conference. The prime minister's chief aide does, of course, have his backers; people who believe he did what was right in difficult circumstances. And one government minister suggested to me that the story has been ""whipped up"" by those who simply do not like Mr Cummings, either politically or as a person. But this saga is now into its fourth day, in a week when the prime minister wishes to communicate crucial messages about his plans for easing the lockdown. It is - another minister conceded - a ""problem"" and ""distraction"". And on Tuesday, as yesterday, the question remains, how much political capital is Boris Johnson ready to expend on keeping his chief aide? Boris Johnson's spokesman reiterated the prime minister's support for Mr Cummings on Tuesday, saying the adviser had ""answered questions extensively"", while Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said his account was ""exhaustive, detailed and verifiable"". Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw told the BBC Mr Cummings should resign as the row is ""distracting attention"" from efforts to combat the coronavirus. Among the Tory MPs calling for Mr Cummings' resignation is former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who said combating the coronavirus was ""more important than the position of any individual in Downing Street"". He is joined by William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove, who said it was ""humiliating"" to see ministers defending Mr Cummings, and Sir Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, who said the adviser had sent out a ""dangerous message"". Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told his South West Surrey constituents that Mr Cummings' actions were ""a clear breach of the lockdown rules"" - but they were ""mistakes"" and he would not call for his resignation. Six opposition leaders have said in a letter to the prime minister that removing Mr Cummings from his post ""without further delay"" is the only way to restore trust in public health advice. The leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, SDLP, Green Party and Alliance Party said the issue ""transcends politics"". ""It has united people of every party and political persuasion, who believe strongly that it is now your responsibility as prime minister to return clarity and trust in public health messaging,"" the letter read. Meanwhile, the retired chemistry teacher who recognised Mr Cummings in County Durham on 12 April told BBC Radio Newcastle he has some regrets about his involvement. Robin Lees said he had had a ""difficult few days"" after his account of the encounter was initially rejected by Downing Street, but that he felt ""vindicated"" by the subsequent admission. Latest government figures show the number of people to die with coronavirus in the UK rose by 134 to 37,048 on Tuesday. There were no Covid-19 related deaths reported in Northern Ireland for the first time since 18 March. In other developments: "
Yield Spread Analysis,Trump hopes US will shake off pandemic by Easter,2024-09-14,2020-03-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52029546,"US President Donald Trump has said he hopes the US will shake off coronavirus by Easter, even as New York's governor sounded the alarm that the illness is spreading faster than ""a bullet train"". The president told a White House news briefing reopening the US early next month would be ""a beautiful timeline"". Hours later, the Senate agreed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) economic rescue plan with the White House. The deal will be passed later on Wednesday by the Senate. ""At last, we have a deal,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, citing the massive ""wartime level of investment into our nation"". The package includes tax rebates, loans, money for hospitals and rescue packages for businesses. The House of Representatives still needs to pass the legislation before it is sent to Mr Trump for his signature. The US has recorded almost 55,000 cases and nearly 800 deaths from coronavirus. Globally there have been more than 420,000 cases confirmed and approaching 19,000 deaths. On Tuesday, he told Fox News he hoped the country could get back to normal by Easter, which is on the weekend of 12 April. Mr Trump, a Republican, said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" He added in a subsequent interview: ""Easter is a very special day for me... and you'll have packed churches all over our country."" Mr Trump also warned that unless the country reopened for business it could suffer ""a massive recession or depression"". The president said: ""You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen. You're going to have instability.""   Speaking at a White House briefing later, Mr Trump said he was beginning ""to see the light at the end of the tunnel"", though he said ""our decision will be based on hard facts and data"". Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told the same press briefing: ""No-one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City."" With more than 25,000 coronavirus cases by Tuesday morning, the Empire state accounted for half of all US infections. Dr Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said on Tuesday the New York City metro area is the source of 60% of all new cases in the US.  She advised anyone leaving the region to self-quarantine for two weeks. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told another news conference on Tuesday: ""The [infection] forecaster said to me, 'We were looking at a freight train coming across the country.' ""'We're now looking at a bullet train.'"" He added: ""New York is the canary in the coal mine, New York is happening first, what is happening to New York will happen to California and Illinois, it is just a matter of time.""   The governor said New York's hospital system will soon reach breaking point unless the US Federal Emergency Management Agency urgently sends more healthcare supplies.  ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,"" Mr Cuomo said. New York currently has 7,000 medical ventilators - machines used to keep patients breathing - but needs 30,000, the governor said.  On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump sat in the verdant White House grounds for a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" and said he hoped to get US businesses reopened by Easter, in just over two weeks. ""A great American resurrection,"" the Fox host suggested. A few hours earlier, Governor Cuomo held a much more sombre press conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. The building, which three years ago hosted Hillary Clinton's ill-fated election-night party, is now a makeshift field hospital. The president and the governor - two New Yorkers with a long history - clashed over the state's shortage of ventilators to treat the most serious cases.  Mr Trump blamed Mr Cuomo for not purchasing more in 2015, citing a conspiracy-mongering website. Mr Cuomo said the administration should use its emergency powers to order more machines manufactured. When it comes to easing the recent shelter-in-place orders, governors like Mr Cuomo, not the president, will have the final say.  If there's disagreement, however, the American public could be left wondering what to believe. The US is more than halfway through a 15-day attempt to slow the spread of the virus through social distancing. The voluntary guidelines were issued by a government public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  But while the president has been talking of easing restrictions, state and local leaders nationwide have been rapidly ratcheting up controls to contain the infection. On Tuesday, Wisconsin, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Mexico, West Virginia and Indiana introduced stay-at-home orders, bringing the total number of US states under such lockdowns to 17.

Yield Spread Analysis,Champions Celtic rescue point at home to St Mirren,2024-09-14,2023-05-20,Clive Lindsay,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65579866,"Callum McGregor scored his fifth Celtic goal this season Champions Celtic avoided a repeat of St Mirren's 2-1 win in January 2021 as they extended their unbeaten domestic home run to 51 games thanks to captain Callum McGregor's late equaliser.  The visitors were the last Scottish side to win at Celtic Park and it looked like they might be in for a repeat when Curtis Main scored with foot and head either side of Kyogo Furuhashi's thunderous finish. But McGregor's low, 18-yard drive found the bottom corner to salvage a draw as Celtic go a rare two successive games without a win since retaining the Scottish title. Meanwhile, the point leaves St Mirren two points behind fifth-top Hibernian, who host Rangers on Sunday, as they look to qualify for European football for the first time since 1987. Read the latest Celtic updates Sign up for the latest about St Mirren Reaction & as it happened Celtic's players will have taken the field with a mixture of emotions - celebratory with it being their first home game since retaining the title and with determination to atone for last weekend's defeat by Rangers. There was no surprise that Ange Postecoglou brought back stalwarts Kyogo, Daizen Maeda and Greg Taylor, but starting on-loan Yokohama F Marinos midfielder Tomoki Iwata at centre-back in place of Yuki Kobayashi raised a few eyebrows. Postecoglou pointed out post-match that Iwata had played there before, but he looked rusty in the role as he and Anthony Ralston hesitated going for a long punt from goalkeeper Trevor Carson. Main, St Mirren's only fit striker, drove into the home penalty box, turned inside Ralston and sent a low drive through the legs of Iwata and goalkeeper Joe Hart. Normality seemed to be restored when Reo Hatate threaded a neat ball into the path of Kyogo and the striker thundered his drive into the top far corner past goalkeeper Carson for his 31st goal of the season. Carson saved twice from Matt O'Riley at the near post and Hatate fired just over, but St Mirren should have already restored the lead as Ryan Strain shot wide from a couple of yards out before Main pounced again. A VAR check ruled that McGregor was just playing the English striker onside as he headed past Hart from 12 yards. Main was terrorising the Celtic defence and the striker headed just off target twice as he looked to complete a hat-trick and give St Mirren a two-goal cushion after the break. Maeda half-volleyed into the side-netting from point-blank range, Main fired against the outside of the far post and Celtic substitute Oh Hyeon-gyu followed suit. However, McGregor was to have the final say and, instead of another famous win at Celtic Park, St Mirren go five games - and seven on the road - without a victory. Curtis was the Main man for St Mirren, scoring twice, coming close to a hat-trick and even putting in a couple of vital stops at the other end Postecoglou was disappointed with last week's defeat by Rangers and will be concerned that his side have dipped, not only in terms of results but also performances, since clinching the league title. He will point out that the rest of the season is hardly meaningless - a domestic treble is within touching distance and Scottish Cup final starting places still up for grabs. The Celtic manager will therefore be concerned that he has not nailed down who will partner Carl Starfelt in central defence following injury to Cameron Carter-Vickers. Kobayashi dropped back to the bench after defeat at Ibrox, while his fellow Japanese, Iwata, did not impress as his replacement. St Mirren were as ""brave"" and positive as manager Stephen Robinson had asked and will count themselves unlucky to find themselves rank outsiders in the race for Europe. They now have their highest points tally in a single top-flight campaign in the 21st century.  And, having lost three in a row against Celtic, losing 14 goals and scoring twice, since September's 2-0 win in Paisley can point to a draw in Glasgow as a further sign of improvement. Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou: ""It was a tough game. St Mirren worked hard as they have all year and that's why they are what they are. ""We've gone off it a little bit the last couple of weeks, particularly the defensive side of the game, and when you do that, it's very hard then for us to play the football we want to.  ""I guarantee 1000% it's not one player. It's got nothing to do Cameron Carter-Vickers. We've missed Cameron Carter-Vickers before."" St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: ""It's not often you come to Celtic Park and say you're disappointed with a point. It shows we've come a long way. ""We had some great opportunities and limited Celtic to half chances, which they are always going to create with their quality.  ""We are still in the race for Europe with two games to go, which is a fantastic achievement for everybody at this football club.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Could these beautiful islands help stop killer diseases?,2024-09-14,2018-11-14,By Prof James Logan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46077299,"Travellers to the remote African islands of Bijagos can expect to find a tropical paradise of pristine beaches and lush rainforest. But the islands are not just beautiful. They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases. A collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions. They also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot. But these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower. Malaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems. However, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them.  Medical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands. The reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness.  While this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease. The islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites.  On the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect. An island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made. While there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments.  There are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness. Trachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation.  The disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease.  Dr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission.  Inner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present.  This might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination.  If the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community. The results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it.  Not only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world.  Trachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled. Our current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.   Given the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease.  Worryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides.  This means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed.  More like this A new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites. Past treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan. In this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the ""intervention"" islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the ""control"" islands, will not.  A team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria.  They have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands.  Whether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen.  Either way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands.  Every study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research.  On the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population.  The LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere.

Yield Spread Analysis,Queen: 'We will succeed' in fight against virus,2024-09-14,2020-04-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52176222,"The Queen has said the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, in a rallying message to the nation. In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those ""coming together to help others"". She also thanked key workers, saying ""every hour"" of work ""brings us closer to a return to more normal times"". It comes as the number of people to die with the virus in the UK reached 4,934. Speaking from Windsor Castle, the Queen said: ""While we have faced challenges before, this one is different."" ""This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us. ""We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again."" The Queen, 93, also said the ""painful sense of separation from their loved ones"" that social distancing was causing for people reminded her of the experience child evacuees had during the Second World War. ""Now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do,"" she said. An hour after the Queen's broadcast, Downing Street announced that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been taken to hospital following his coronavirus diagnosis. Mr Johnson has been self-isolating since he tested positive for the virus on 27 March. In her address, the Queen said everyone who was following guidance to stay at home was ""helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones"".  ""Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,"" she added. She also stressed the value of self-discipline and resolve - and said she hopes that, in the future, everyone would ""be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge"". There have been difficult royal speeches and addresses in the past - times when the wrong word or the wrong phrase could have undermined the message or let slip a critical opportunity. The broadcast after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 for example, or the speech the Queen gave on her visit to Ireland in 2011. The Palace could have played it safe, stressed unity and given thanks. It would have served.   This was a different and much more ambitious broadcast, designed to reassure and to inspire. But most of all to recast this crisis as a defining moment in a nation which will forever remember its collective effort to save the lives of its vulnerable.  Read more here. The pre-recorded message, written by the Queen with her private secretary Sir Edward Young, was filmed by a single cameraman wearing protective equipment. All other technical staff were in another room. It was broadcast on TV, radio and social media channels. The decision to deliver the address was made ""in close consultation with Downing Street"", BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said. Nightingale Hospital  - the first temporary field hospital to open to treat coronavirus patients - shared photos on Twitter of staff listening to the speech, and thanked the monarch for recognising the hard work of frontline NHS staff. The UK government's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Queen's address was ""striking and important"". The new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the monarch spoke for the whole country ""and our determination to defeat the coronavirus"". The Queen's address came less than a week after her son, the Prince of Wales, came out of self-isolation, following his coronavirus diagnosis. Prince Charles, 71, spent seven days self-isolating in Scotland after testing positive and displaying mild symptoms. It is only the fifth time the monarch has given such a speech in her 68-year reign. While her Christmas Day message is an annual event, only rarely has the Queen made rallying speeches at key moments in the life of the nation: Read more here. On Sunday Mr Hancock urged the public to follow social distancing rules over a sunny weekend to protect the NHS and slow the spread of the virus. The Department of Health said on Sunday there had been 621 more coronavirus-related deaths in the UK in the past day. The latest deaths include 12 more in Wales, seven in Northern Ireland and two in Scotland. As of 09:00 BST on Sunday, 47,806 people had tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health said."
Yield Spread Analysis,"UK unready as wildfires surge, warn firefighters",2024-09-14,2023-09-29,By Malcolm Prior,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66948836,"The UK is ""woefully underprepared"" to tackle wildfires as climate change makes them more likely, a new report by the Fire Brigades Union warns. There were more than 44,000 wildfires last year - an increase of 72% on the previous year, according to government figures out this month. Union chiefs say the government and the National Fire Chiefs Council have failed to develop a national strategy. The government said it was ensuring services have the resources needed. A spokesperson for the NFCC said it ""has consistently made clear to government and fire service partners that the impact of climate change will continue to put huge pressure on fire and rescue services in the years ahead"". Climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. Extreme and long-lasting heat like that seen in the UK in the summer of 2022 draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) report found understaffing meant fire services tackling recent wildfires have had to leave fire engines sitting idle in stations and call in off-duty staff to work extra shifts, while firefighters at the scene were ""worked to exhaustion"".  It estimates that 12,000 firefighter jobs have been lost since 2010. Matt Wrack, the FBU's general secretary, said: ""We need urgent climate action. If we are to properly protect life and property from wildfires, the fire and rescue service needs significant investment. ""This means more firefighters, better equipped and trained, along with better planning, research and coordination."" The latest government report on the number of fires last year found an ""exceptional increase"" in outdoor blazes that ""can be linked to the hot, dry summer"". In July 2022, there were 21,246 outdoor fires - nearly trebling the previous July's figure. Wildfires included a number on the ""urban-rural interface"", where the countryside meets homes, the report said. It has also been estimated that, on and around 19 July 2022, around 95 buildings were destroyed including 16 homes in Wennington, in the London borough of Havering. A major incident review released this July, after a Freedom of Information request by the BBC, found firefighter shortages meant 39 fire engines were not available to attend wildfires that burnt across London that day. The FBU is now calling for a UK-wide wildfire strategy for fire and rescue services that sets national standards.  It said that, at present, there is a ""postcode lottery of wildfire response"".  Better recruitment and retention of retained firefighters in rural areas is needed, it added, and greater central government investment in training, crew numbers and PPE - including the introduction of body-worn physiological monitors for firefighters and specialist respiratory protection. The Home Office said that overall, fire and rescue authorities are receiving £2.6bn during 2023/24 and it was down to each authority how that money was spent. Every authority also has to have a plan in place which sets out how they intend to respond to foreseeable risks in their area, including wildfires. A spokeswoman said the department was working closely with both the NFCC and the England and Wales Wildfire Forum, a multi-agency body, to ""continue to improve our response to wildfires and reduce their impact"". The NFCC said it was ""extremely proud of the fantastic, professional response of UK firefighters and 999 control staff in tackling wildfires and protecting local communities"". It said it would continue to ensure all future funding decisions are ""fully informed by, and reflect, the current and future risks that fire services face, including the growing effects of climate change and the impact of wildfires, flooding and other events""."
Yield Spread Analysis,Chelsea see off AC Milan after Tomori red card,2024-09-14,2022-10-10,Emma Smith,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63208848,"Jorginho (left) has scored seven of his eight Champions League penalties Chelsea enjoyed a comfortable victory at AC Milan after former Blues defender Fikayo Tomori received an early red card. Tomori was sent off for pulling back Mason Mount in the area, with Jorginho converting the penalty. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doubled the lead with a confident strike against his former club. But Chelsea and England suffered a blow in the second half when right-back Reece James limped off. The win continues Graham Potter's unbeaten start as Chelsea manager, with four wins in his first five games. It moves Chelsea top of Group E with seven points from four matches, but it remains extremely tight with Red Bull Salzburg on six points and both Milan and Dinamo Zagreb on four. Visit our Chelsea page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views in one place You can now get Chelsea news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out more Tomori has not enjoyed his reunion with his boyhood club over the past couple of games - after Milan were beaten comprehensively at Stamford Bridge last week, the Chelsea youth product lasted just 18 minutes on Tuesday. What looked like being a tight game was blown open when Tomori put his arm on the shoulder of England team-mate Mount, putting the midfielder off balance enough to send him tumbling to the floor. Referee Daniel Siebert, who was central to the drama throughout to the ire of the home support, deemed it enough contact to be a penalty and that Tomori had not attempted to play the ball, thus overriding the double jeopardy rule and causing him to show the red card. The decision was debated long and hard by Tomori and Milan's players, but eventually he had to leave the field and after a lengthy delay Jorginho calmly slotted the penalty away. ""I definitely don't think the referee has had one of his better evenings,"" said Milan boss Stefano Pioli. He added: ""The penalty and red card changed everything.Chelsea didn't need to play with a numerical superiority. ""I don't want to review the episode, it seems too obvious. I don't want to comment. I told the referee what I think, I don't speak English very well but I think he understood."" Mount was excellent for the first 45 minutes before being substituted for Conor Gallagher at half-time, having picked up a booking for arguing with Olivier Giroud in the aftermath of the penalty. Potter decided to remove Mount from the firing line of both the irate home fans and the card-happy Siebert - but not before the England midfielder caused Milan endless problems and showed why he is so admired by his managers for club and country. While his form is a boost for Gareth Southgate, the sight of James hobbling off minutes after jarring his knee in the turf while making a challenge is worrying, with the World Cup less than six weeks away. Having been so well stocked at right-back previously, Southgate is now sweating on the fitness of James as well as Kyle Walker and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who have all suffered injuries in recent weeks. Only two players have started all five of Potter's games in charge of Chelsea so far - goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and Mount. The latter was central to the second goal too. He was played the ball on the edge of the Milan area by Jorginho, and cleverly laid it off first time. Both Raheem Sterling and Aubameyang were running on, and the former smartly moved out of the way for the latter to plant the ball beyond Ciprian Tatarusanu at his near post. From then on it was fairly straightforward for Chelsea to earn only their second competitive win on Italian soil from 15 attempts, the last being a 4-0 victory for Claudio Ranieri's side at Roberto Mancini's Lazio in November 2003. They came the closer of the two sides to scoring in the second half, with Gallagher hitting the side-netting after rounding Tatarusanu. It is a fourth successive win for Potter, with Chelsea continuing an impressive turnaround by rising to the top of Group E after four games, having been bottom after matchday two.

Yield Spread Analysis,UK interest rates cut to lowest level in history,2024-09-14,2020-03-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51962982,"The Bank of England has cut interest rates again in an emergency move as it tries to support the UK economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the second cut in interest rates in just over a week, bringing them down to 0.1% from 0.25%. Interest rates are now at the lowest ever in the Bank's 325-year history. The Bank said it would also increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by £200bn with an effort to lower the cost of borrowing.  It's a dramatic move by Andrew Bailey, who only took over from Mark Carney as Bank of England governor on Monday. Last week, the Bank announced a 0.5% cut in rates to 0.25% and a package of measures to help businesses and individuals cope with the economic damage caused by the virus. The move coincided with additional measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Budget. However, the Bank said the measures it had taken so far were not going to be enough, and believed ""a further package of measures was warranted"". ""The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but should be temporary,"" it added. The move comes as international investors are trying to secure more cash, in particular dollars. This means they're ditching assets such as UK government gilts, which are the ""IOU"" notes the government hands over to private investors willing to lend it money.  As the gilts are sold, the price drops and the yield - the effective interest rate compared to the price - rises. What that means is the cost of borrowing to private investors as well as to the government rises - just when the Bank of England wants it to fall and the government is about to borrow huge sums.  The Bank of England's plan to buy £200bn more bonds is aimed at fighting that effect.  The fresh rate cut takes interest rates to the lowest they can feasibly go, said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group.  ""Lower rates and additional quantitative easing can keep markets satisfied and borrowing costs for both businesses and the government down but unless money is forced into the hands of small businesses soon, then it will be for nothing; they are the ones laying off staff due to a liquidity shock,"" he added. Karen Ward, chief European market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: The support to the economy and health system will require vastly higher government borrowing. The central bank showing willing to buy government debt will ensure the market can absorb this additional issuance without undue stress."" The Bank of England Governor has said today's second emergency rate cut in just over a week occurred after financial markets became ""borderline disorderly"", with fears about coronavirus leading to a rush into the US dollar away from sterling and lending to the UK government. ""We've seen very sharp moves in financial markets in the last few days, which is the pace of which frankly, was increasing very rapidly. And we were moving into conditions that were if not disorderly, frankly, bordering on disorderly let me put it that way,"" Andrew Bailey told journalists.  The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee had an emergency call this morning so that rate cuts and further ""quantitative easing"" could be agreed and announced, with the Bank needing to be ""on the offensive"" because: ""We can't wait for the hard economic data it will be too late by then"", he said.  He said he had seen a range of private forecasts about the economic impact of the current crisis: ""We don't have a precise forecast - every picture we look at has a very sharp V in it"". The governor also partly blamed rumours that appeared to emerge from Westminster of a shutdown to London for adding to the volatility in markets that saw sterling fall 5% against the dollar. Such a shutdown would be likely to impact on the functioning of the City. He said: ""I do have to say that, you know, there were rumours going on the market this time yesterday that there was going to be a lockdown in London. And I'd observe that did cause market prices to start moving around at that point. But I think the government has been clear, and it's clear that that is not the intention at the moment."" The governor also said that he had already intervened to try to get loans to businesses to keep people in employment, and he said the Bank had its thinking cap on as regards further monetary boosts it can make.  He reiterated his lack of enthusiasm for zero or negative interest rates because of their impact on the banking system's capacity to lend, and suggested that was the reason for limiting the cut to an unusual 0.15% (rather than the usual 0.25% or 0.5%) to a record low of 0.1%.  The key Monetary Policy Committee will meet again next week."
Yield Spread Analysis,Sri Lanka inflation rate jumps above 70%,2024-09-14,2022-09-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62990385,"Sri Lanka's annual inflation rate surged to more than 70% in August as it struggles with its worst economic crisis in over seven decades. Official data also showed food prices rose by 84.6% compared to a year ago. The South Asian nation of 22m people was plunged into financial and political chaos this year as it faced a shortage of foreign currencies. The country has been unable to afford key imports - including fuel, fertiliser and medicine. Last month, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka said it expected inflation to ease, as the country's economy slowed, after peaking at about 70%. Official figures released last week showed that the economy had contracted by 8.4% in the three months to the end of August. Before the pandemic, Sri Lanka was heavily reliant on tourism for foreign currencies, including the US dollar. However, border closures aimed to slow the spread of Covid-19 kept tourists away and took a major toll on the country's economy. That, along with years of financial mismanagement, led to Sri Lanka defaulting on its debts earlier this year. Sri Lanka has faced political upheaval in recent months, with the country's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing abroad before resigning in July. That came as hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets, in protests that often turned violent, over a sharp increase in food and fuel prices.  Many Sri Lankans blamed Mr Rajapaksa's administration for mishandling the crisis. Earlier this month, Sri Lanka reached a preliminary deal with the International Monetary Fund for a $2.9bn (£2.6bn) loan. However, the agreement hinges on the country also receiving funds from private creditors. On Tuesday, India said it had started talks with Sri Lanka on restructuring its debt and said it would also offer long-term investments. India previously provided almost $4bn in financial aid to its smaller neighbour. India also deferred payment on Sri Lankan imports of about $1.2bn and offered a credit line of $55m for fertiliser imports. Sri Lankan government officials are due to meet creditors on Friday, to discuss the extent of the country's economic problems and a proposal to restructure its debts. Analysis by Arunoday Mukharji, India business correspondent Sri Lanka is among the 10 countries around the world with the highest food inflation. Experts have warned that rising food prices mean that economic woes for Sri Lankans will continue for some time to come. Food security remains a huge concern for the country, especially because fertiliser shortages - due to a lack of foreign currencies - have significantly affected agricultural production. According to some estimates food production has nearly halved. The country's shrinking reserves of foreign exchange also means that buying large amounts of food from abroad is also not an option. Earlier this week, the UN's World Food Programme said: ""the situation could deteriorate further in the coming months without urgent assistance"". As part of its programme to help Sri Lanka, the first batch of 600 tonnes of rice worth $15m has arrived from Australia. It is part of a larger consignment of rice, pulses and cooking oil which is due to reach the country soon. The aim is to help around 3.4m people who are worst affected in the country of the 22m."
Yield Spread Analysis,Brexit: Better or worse off?,2024-09-14,2019-10-31,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-50254631,"Boris Johnson's Brexit deal will cost everyone in Scotland £1,600 per year. That's the charge, being led by Mike Russell, the Scottish government's Brexit minister. Expect to hear it again over the election weeks and beyond. And again after that.   So where does it come from, and how does it stack up? It's in a new document, providing the Scottish government's assessment of the Brexit deal negotiated by Boris Johnson, which secured a majority - in principle - in the House of Commons, and will form a core part of the Conservative Party's election campaign. The figures are derived from a Scottish government analysis published in January 2018. Behind it are a lot of assumptions about what might happen if there were to be a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between post-Brexit Britain and the European Union. The analysis looks at other outcomes of the talks, long before Theresa May got to her deal with the EU, let alone Boris Johnson re-negotiating it. One was to remain within the European Economic Area, something like Norway - inside the single market, but in Norway's case, outside the customs union. The alternative was the most bracing for the economy - known as WTO, referring to World Trade Organisation rules. That is the baseline for countries that don't have trade deals, where many goods have no tariffs applied (taxes on imports) but quite a few do, and where there is little done to converge and standardise countries' internal market rules. The FTA version points to the total output of the economy, in 2030, being 6% below the level it would have reached if the UK economy remained on the growth trajectory it has had as a member of the EU. That equates to £9.1bn per year, at 2016 prices. Divide that by the population, and you get to £1,610 per head. By rounding down £10, that's where Mike Russell's number comes from. No, though that is how it can be made to look. The SNP put out a press release on Wednesday, claiming: ""New analysis from the Scottish government has found that Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal would leave people in Scotland £1,600 per head worse off by 2030."" That's misleading, firstly because that appears to relate to average pay. It does not. It is a notional share per head of total national output, and part of that share goes to wages, part to profits, including some paid to foreign owners of assets in Scotland. The assessment also points to Scots being worse off than they might otherwise have been - not worse off than they are. A common feature of this type of economic modelling is that it measures how much slower the economy would grow, when compared with the trend growth within the European Union. Growth would be lower, but would remain positive. If the UK were to be in the European Economic Area, like Norway, then it would see a smaller dip according to this economic model - of 2.7% of total national output, or £688. For it to leave the EU without any deal, and use WTO rules for trading, the calculation is a drop of 8.5% of output by 2030, or £2,263 per head.   In the latter case, the separate reckoning of the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University is that Scotland would become worse off, for a while. It recently forecast a contraction in the economy during next year, before returning to weak growth from 2021. Almost all economic models reckon that any Brexit outcome would leave the UK worse off than it would be if it continued within the European Union, at least until its economy and businesses adapt to the shock, and find new trading arrangements with Europe and beyond. That includes the Treasury modelling. The Johnson administration has been pressed to produce estimates of the economic impact of the deal struck with the European Union, but it has chosen not to do so. It matters how long a transition to new, stable trading relations would take. Boris Johnson would like to get to that deal before the end of next year, when the transition period is due to end. However, trade negotiations usually take several years to reach an agreement. In recent times, several have been abandoned before getting to a deal, such as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), being negotiated between the pre-Brexit referendum European Commission and the pre-Trump United States. Britain would want to get to a deal as fast as possible, while its negotiating partners would have less pressure to do so. That puts Britain in a weaker negotiating position. The post-Brexit outcome of a Free Trade Agreement with the EU is assumed to mean a cut in the share of exports within the EU of 29%, and no increase in tariffs. Productivity is expected to fall below the levels that should be achievable within the EU, by 3.5% - the same as the Treasury assumption for the whole UK. That is partly explained by the reduction in inward investment. Foreign companies clearly tend to bring in more productive ways of working, which spread through the economy. Without easy access to EU markets, Britain could be less appealing to them. The fall in foreign investment is assumed to be 17.5%. The population would grow at 2.8% below that assumed through the free movement of EU citizens, drawing on work done by the Office for Budget Responsibility. And remember the Leave campaign claims of billions of pounds made available by not handing money to Brussels? That would help the economy a little - around a third of one per cent of total output. Looking at similar attempts to calculate this - from the Treasury to the OECD richer countries' club and the Fraser of Allander Institute - a similar set of assumption is made.  All such figures can be rubbished, according to taste and prejudice. There were, indeed, wild warnings about a Leave vote's immediate impact. The economy has not been in recession, and the labour market remains uncommonly strong. However, the effect of slower growth than the economy would otherwise have achieved is not obvious unless you refer to your EU neighbours and see how they have been pulling ahead. For those who travel in the eurozone, it is clear that British pound's buying power has declined. For those who don't travel overseas, the weaker pound has led to food price inflation, but not to an alarming extent. So, while the UK and Scotland have not become worse off than they were, they have become worse off than they would otherwise have been. The Fraser of Allander Institute recently published its estimate of how much Scotland has already fallen behind the position it might otherwise have been in - during the 40 months since the referendum. It said that Brexit uncertainty ""continues to act as a drag on Scotland's economy with output around 2% smaller (or £3bn) as a result of the weaker performance post-referendum"". And remember that the £1,600 figure, as with the others, is an average. If it were to be correct, some could be much better off because of Brexit: others much worse off. There is a new concern that the different arrangements for Northern Ireland threaten to put it at an advantage over Scottish businesses, in having easier access to the European single market. The extent of that divergence would depend on the nature of a Free Trade Agreement, so it is hard to quantify until that deal is done. The concerns of the food and drink sector, and particularly seafood, are to the fore in the ministers' analysis. And services are seen as a potential victim of being overlooked in favour of goods trade. Immigration, the decline of the working population and access to EU higher education funding, of which Scotland gets a large share, are also raised. In common with other opposition parties in the House of Commons, Scottish ministers are concerned at the apparent weakening of previous commitments to labour, environmental and human rights protections. These can still be found, but no longer in the Withdrawal Agreement. They are in the non-binding outline of the long-term UK-EU relationship, and could be negotiable in trade negotiations with other countries, including the USA. Theresa May's deal focused on a UK relationship with the EU which would be ""as close as possible"". Boris Johnson's replaces this with an ""ambitious"" relationship. In the final, pre-election Question Time joust between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the intention of a deregulated deal with the USA, potentially opening the National Health Service to far more private sector influence, was the main thrust of the Labour leader's campaign message."
Yield Spread Analysis,Italians protest against Covid measures,2024-09-14,2020-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54701042,"Protests took place across Italy on Monday over new restrictions to curb the country's second wave of Covid. Clashes were reported in the northern cities such as Turin, where petrol bombs were thrown at officers. In Milan tear gas was used to disperse protesters, and thousands of people gathered in the centre of Naples. The demonstrations began soon after the national government's order to close restaurants, bars, gyms and cinemas came into effect at 18:00 local time. Many regions have also imposed night-time curfews - including Lombardy, where Milan is, and Piedmont, where Turin is. The violence was blamed on extremist agitators and police said 28 people had been arrested in Milan alone. Protests took place in about a dozen other cities, including Rome, Genoa, Palermo and Trieste. Taxi drivers occupied a central square in Turin while restaurant owners beat pots and pans in the centre of Cremona. In Naples, a big crowd gathered in the central Piazza del Plebiscito, many calling on the regional governor to resign. While an initial national lockdown earlier this year was complied with little resistance, the announcement of renewed measures has been met with immediate pushback. Small businesses argue that they are still recovering from that first lockdown, and that more restrictions could bankrupt them. The days of clapping for medical staff and of rainbow banners reading ""everything will be alright"" seem a distant memory. The virus may be back - but the near-total support for the anti-Covid fight that Italians showed in the first wave is breaking. The protests so far are not huge. The vast majority of Italians still seem to understand the need to tighten measures, fearful that cases are again spiralling out of control. But the world's first national lockdown - and one of its longest - has taken its toll, with an economy forecast to shrink by 10% this year.  Some on the streets are peaceful: an agonised call for help by restaurateurs or gym-owners. But a mix of far-right and far-left agitators, organised crime groups and bored football hooligans have sensed an opening, looting shops and clashing with police. The interior minister warns of ""an autumn of social tension"". This is a risky moment for the government. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has pledged quick financial help. The president has stressed that ""the enemy is the virus."" But the mood of a nation scared into compliance in March is beginning to turn.  A number of luxury stores in central Turin, including a Gucci boutique, were ransacked by crowds that spilled into the streets after the rules came into force. Demonstrators let off firecrackers and lit flares, while police in riot gear responded with tear gas. In Milan, crowds chanted ""Freedom, freedom, freedom!"" as they clashed with police in the city centre. The city is the capital of Lombardy, which has been particularly hard hit by the virus. Restaurants, bars and cafes must stop table service at 18:00 and offer only take-away until midnight. Contact sports are prohibited but shops and most businesses will remain open. The new restrictions, which are in force until 24 November, will also see 75% of classes at Italy's high schools and universities conducted online instead of in a classroom. Regional governments had asked for all classes to be conducted via distance learning, Italian media reported, but the move was opposed by Education Minister Lucia Azzolina. The government is also urging people not to travel outside their home towns or cities unless absolutely necessary and to avoid using public transport if possible. ""We think that we will suffer a bit this month but by gritting our teeth with these restrictions, we'll be able to breathe again in December,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told a news conference on Sunday. Gyms and pools have also closed in the Belgian capital Brussels, and shops must shut at 20:00. Masks are now compulsory in public spaces. These rules will remain in force until 19 November. Meanwhile doctors in the Belgian city of Liège have been asked to keep working, even if they have coronavirus. The head of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions told the BBC they had no choice if they were to prevent the hospital system collapsing within days.  In the UK, people aged 16 to 25 are more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job during the pandemic, BBC Panorama has found.  Research seen by the programme also suggests the education gap between privileged and disadvantaged young people has widened further.  In France, health experts have warned that the number of new Covid-19 cases per day could be about 100,000 - twice the official figure. Prof Jean-François Delfraissy, the head of France's scientific council which advises the government on the pandemic, said the estimated figure included undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases. He told RTL radio he was surprised by the ""brutality"" of the second wave which he expected to be much worse than the first, adding: ""Many of our fellow citizens have not yet realised what awaits us."" France has already imposed night-time curfews on major cities, including Paris. The country has recorded more than 1.1 million cases in total and 34,780 deaths. The Czech Republic has also introduced a night-time curfew, which came into effect on Tuesday at midnight for a week. Nobody will be allowed to leave their homes between 21:00 and 04:59 each night except to travel to and from work, for medical reasons or a few other exceptions. All shops will be shut on Sundays and will close at 20:00 on other days. Spain has declared a national state of emergency and imposed a night-time curfew amid a new spike in Covid-19 infections. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the curfew, which came into force on Sunday night, would be in place between the hours of 23:00 and 06:00. Under the measures, local authorities can also ban travel between regions. Spain has seen more than one million cases and 34,750 deaths. Russia has registered a record 17,347 new daily coronavirus cases, officials said on Monday. Total reported cases have surpassed 1.5 million - but the mayor of the worst-hit city, Moscow, said that while ""there is still growth... it is slower""."
Yield Spread Analysis,Gueye refused to wear PSG shirt with rainbow symbol,2024-09-14,2022-05-18,John Bennett,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61492696,"Kouyate (right) and Gueye were both part of the Senegal side that won the country's first African Cup of Nations title in February Paris St-Germain's Idrissa Gueye refused to play in a match to avoid wearing a rainbow symbol in support of LGBTQ+ rights, BBC Sport understands. The 32-year-old former Aston Villa and Everton midfielder was absent from Saturday's 4-0 win over Montpellier. PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino said only that Senagalese Gueye missed the game for ""personal reasons"". The French Football Federation (FFF) has reportedly written to Gueye to clarify why he was absent. BBC Sport has approached Gueye's representatives for comment.

Kouyate posted a picture of himself alongside Gueye on Instagram, with a caption calling Gueye ""a real man"". Watford winger Sarr posted a picture of him and Gueye accompanied by three heart emojis and the caption ""100%"". In response to Sarr's post, Watford reiterated their commitment to equality and diversity, adding ""this includes the willingness to offer further education and support to any of its employees"". At a news conference on Wednesday, Crystal Palace boss Patrick Vieira said if his player had posted in relation to Gueye, he would speak to them.

It is also illegal in Qatar, where PSG's owners hail from and where the men's 2022 World Cup will be staged later this year. The top Twitter trend in the world on Wednesday was #WeareallIdrissa with tweets sent to support Gueye's stance. Gueye's stance is in contrast to the overwhelmingly positive response from football towards Blackpool's 17-year-old forward Jake Daniels coming out as gay on Monday - the first openly gay men's professional footballer in Britain since Justin Fashanu 30 years ago.

It followed speculation he didn't want to wear the PSG jersey on Saturday as part of Ligue 1's anti-homophobic campaign. President Sall has always been vocal in his interviews with international media to confirm that he will not decriminalise homosexuality. He confirmed this position when he tweeted Tuesday that Gueye's ""religious beliefs should be respected"", a day after the sports minister Matar Ba told local media that the government was giving their support to the African champion. The president of the federation Augustin Senghor said the vice-captain of the Teranga Lions didn't ""violate his contract with PSG and just needs others to respect his faith"" which is why he called him to express his support.

Yield Spread Analysis,What now for Wagner after Prigozhin's death?,2024-09-14,2023-08-24,By Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66604261,"Yevgeny Prigozhin spent almost a decade building the Wagner paramilitary group. It became central to Russia's war effort in Ukraine and Prigozhin's troops helped to spread Russian influence across the globe, propping up allies of President Vladimir Putin in Africa and Syria.  Now his death has sparked a flurry of speculation about the group's future.  Western security officials are wondering who will take his place and what will happen to the mercenaries he once led.  Dr Joana de Deus Pereira, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told the BBC's World Tonight programme that Prigozhin's death would likely lead to ""a certain revamping"" of the group.  But she said that overall Wagner's operations would probably continue in much the same way as it had under Prigozhin's leadership.  ""The organisation will persist in the future probably with another name, but it has already proved it has the capacity to adapt and to morph,"" she said.  ""We have to look at Wagner not only as a single man but as an ecosystem, as a hydra with many many heads and many diverse interests in Africa.""  Ruslan Trad, a security analyst with the Atlantic Council, agreed. He told the BBC that Prigozhin's death would likely see someone with connections to Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, installed to lead the group in his place. But he suggested that the main challenge for Mr Putin may be finding someone with deep enough pockets to fund the paramilitary's operations, while not posing a direct challenge to his regime.  ""They will try to find a new financier because Prigozhin was the main person with money there,"" Mr Trad said.  ""I think it will be more difficult to find a new financier because [Wagner] have good commanders, but money is important here. Maybe they will [install] someone from the close circle around Putin.""  Benoît Bringer, a journalist whose documentary The Rise of Wagner charted the paramilitary's rise, told the BBC that one of the leading contenders is GRU General Andrey Averyanov.  ""It is likely that Putin needed time to secretly organise the transition. This would explain why he waited two months before getting rid of Prigozhin,"" he added.  Emily Ferris of Rusi observed that Moscow ""will have likely learned its lesson that personalities like Prigozhin with their own dangerous ambitions are a wildcard,"" adding that ""any new [Wagner] leader would likely be someone handpicked by the Kremlin"".  For much of the past year Wagner was Russia's most effective fighting force in Ukraine, with its troops successfully taking the eastern cities of Soledar and Bakhmut after bloody battles.  But Ms Ferris said Prigozhin's death was unlikely to seriously impact the course of the war.  ""Wagner troops have been out of action in Ukraine since the rebellion, and their troops stationed either in Belarus, or absorbed back in to the Ministry of Defence, so the impact immediately on the Ukraine war, where the Russian forces are still holding back the Ukrainian counter-offensive, is likely to be minimal for now,"" she observed.  She added that it appeared unlikely that Wagner troops would return to the battlefield in Ukraine, at least in the short term.  Thousands of Wagner fighters followed Prigozhin to Russia's western neighbour, Belarus, following an aborted armed revolt against Russia's top military brass in June.  On Friday, Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko said up to 10,000 Wagner fighters would ""in the next few days"" be in the group's main camp in Osipovichi, south-east of Minsk. ""Wagner lived, Wagner is alive, and Wagner will live in Belarus, no matter if someone would not like it,"" he was quoted as saying by Belarus' state-run Belta news agency. He was speaking shortly after satellite images analysed by BBC Verify had shown that several of the tents at the camp were being dismantled. The photos were taken by the US-based Planet Labs company. It is not clear exactly when the work began and whether occupants of the tents are housed elsewhere in Belarus or have left the country. The US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty media group reported on Thursday that as many as 101 of 273 tents in the camp had already been taken down. Addressing the issue, Mr Lukashenko said only ""extra tents"" were being removed as there was no need to have so many of them. Still, the future of Wagner fighters is unclear, as many Belarusian, Russian and Western experts argue that Mr Lukashenko is de facto President Putin's puppet, obeying his orders. At the same time, some reports on social media suggest that several Wagner fighters have already made explicit threats against Mr Putin for what they allege is his role in Prigozhin's death.  Equally unclear is the future of Wagner's troops abroad. The group has become a key pillar of Russian foreign policy, with its forces helping to prop up governments in Syria, Mali, the Central African Republic and Libya in exchange for lucrative mining rights. In recent days Prigozhin is believed to have been present in West Africa, where Western analysts fear the group was seeking to widen its reach into other countries, including Niger where a coup has just taken place. Some had speculated that the decapitation of the group's leadership could force Russia to re-evaluate its attempts to seek influence in the region, but many experts believe the group's decentralised command on the continent should allow it to continue its operations unhindered by Prigozhin's death. Following June's mutiny, Russian officials were reported to have flown to Libya to meet Khalifa Haftar, the renegade general challenging the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, and assured him of the Wagner Group's continued support, regardless of Prigozhin's fate.  Mr Trad told the BBC that he believed Wagner was so heavily integrated in the defence infrastructure of African countries that their operations would be untroubled by Prigozhin's death.  ""The commanders stationed in Syria, or Central African Republic or Mali, they already have very good models in place there and they have the freedom to act,"" he said.  ""Local commanders are not impacted because the operations are separately operational, they have different resources for this and even now they are recruiting for Syria and Africa operations.""  And he said the group's arms length relationship with Russian intelligence would remain a valuable tool for Moscow, allowing it to operate in the ""grey zone"" where it could pursue Russia's interests, but allowing officials to deny involvement.  Mr Bringer told the BBC that Wagner was ""essential in Africa"" in terms of promoting Russian interests. ""The structure will certainly continue to exist there, perhaps no longer under the name of Wagner, but with a new head loyal to the Kremlin,"" he said.  Anton Mardasov, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute's Syria Program, said even in the wake of Prigozhin's failed uprising in Russia, Wagner commanders abroad largely escaped Kremlin reprisals to avoid ""weakening Moscow's overall position"".  But he said other mercenary companies were increasingly rivalling Wagner's role in Syria. After June's mutiny Mr Mardasov said that a number of Wagner troops had been offered a transfer to a competing company called PMC Redut.  ""Redut has been working in Syria in parallel with Wagner for a long time,"" Mr Mardasov told the BBC. ""It is on the Redut that the military is betting in Syria, but they were afraid of fast steps.""  In the medium-term, therefore, it seems unlikely that Wagner's operations will be significantly impacted by its benefactor's death. But in the longer term Wagner's operations look set to reform into something new, Emily Ferris of Rusi said.  ""Most likely is that Wagner will splinter into two, with the remaining leaderless groupings in Belarus disbanded, and the other faction active abroad morphing into something else that can be a tool of Russian foreign policy,"" she told the BBC.  As for Prigozhin's legacy, Mr Bringer told the BBC that Wagner had ""demonstrated to the Kremlin how a private shadowy army, capable of operating totally out of the law, could be useful in its hybrid wars, as well as to gain influence abroad.""  ""The name of Wagner may disappear, but not the mercenaries in the field and the method he created."""
Yield Spread Analysis,Scotland start Euro campaign with win over Cyprus,2024-09-14,2023-03-24,Martin Dowden,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64997970,"Scott McTominay's goal turned a nervy win into a comfortable one at a tense Hampden Scott McTominay's late double secured Scotland a comfortable winning start to their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign at home to Cyprus. John McGinn's close-range finish - the Aston Villa midfielder's 16th goal for his country - was reward for a dominant first-half display. Substitute McTominay eased increased nervousness around Hampden with a clinical 87th-minute finish.  And the Manchester United midfielder added his second moments later. Steve Clarke had billed it as a must-win game against Group A's lowest seeds, who ended the game with 10 men after a late red card for Nicholas Ioannou, and it was job done in that sense. But the Scotland head coach will know that, despite their first winning start to a Euro qualifying campaign since 2006, improvement will be needed as top seeds Spain visit on Tuesday. Lessons as Scots and Spain start with 3-0 wins Joselu debut double helps down Norway Reaction and as it happened The dawn of new qualifying campaign brought the Tartan Army to Hampden full of optimism.  They were rewarded with a dominant first-half performance during which they were rarely under threat and probed at the Cypriot defensive wall with consistency and determination.  All that was lacking was a little more cutting edge in the vital area - directly in front of goal. That was a theme until late on, with the result still uncertain until McTominay stepped up. Scotland's intent was clear. Get at Cyprus down the flanks, particularly the left. That pattern was fairly consistent, but the first real threat came down the other side when Aaron Hickey danced into the box and, from the tightest of angles, forced goalkeeper Demetris Demetriou into a low save at his post.  Clarke's side were cruising, comfortable on the ball and showing an impressive level of composure.  The left flank proved the route to the crucial opening goal as Stuart Armstrong fed Andy Robertson, who timed his run perfectly to stay marginally onside and cross first time. The ball deflected perfectly into McGinn's path as he instinctively raced to meet it and finish from close range to take his Scotland tally to one more than the talismanic James McFadden.  Che Adams came close after super interplay with McGinn, but his shot was tipped over and the unfortunate striker left the field early in the second half with a worrying looking injury.  The second half show dipped significantly and the creeping doubt began to emerge that Cyprus might just nick something. Finally, though, Scotland got there - thanks to three of their own substitutes. Ryan Christie did superbly to win possession and fire in a cross ,Lyndon Dykes nodded it on and McTominay raced onto it to half-volley home.  An enormous cheer and accompanying sigh of relief engulfed Hampden before McTominay capitalised again when Robertson laid the ball into his path and he calmly dispatched it home with ease. Who else but John McGinn? Scott McTominay's late intervention was emphatic, but McGinn was exactly where it counts at the right time to make the vital breakthrough. The 3-0 scoreline adds significant and welcome gloss to the occasion. Clarke will be delighted with that but equally happy to get through this unscathed.  It became something of a struggle until very late on, but the players stayed calm and avoided a calamity. The initial signs were very positive in the first period, with Scotland in complete control.  They were perhaps a touch cautious in getting into dangerous areas directly in front of goal, but the performance was strong and promised more as the game wore on. That said, Cyprus were very well organised and proved sticky opposition. The concern will be how standards seemed to slip. There was little composure in the final pass or deliveries from wide areas, but the substitutes made a significant impact to get Scotland over the line. This video can not be played Clarke wants to 'focus on positive headlines' but things to improve before Spain Scotland head coach Steve Clarke: ""We spoke a lot about getting off to a good start and I thought we started the game really well. The movement, the rotation of the players, the creation of space was good. We deserved the lead at that time. ""I thought up until 30 minutes we were good and I don't know whether we went a bit casual, we switched off a little bit and Cyprus made it difficult for us. Second-half was a slightly difficult game and we slowed the game too much, but it is nice to look at the bench and bring on Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie."" Cyprus head coach Temuri Ketsbaia: ""I believe we lost to the better team. Scotland deserved to win the game, well done to them. Congratulations.  ""I'm disappointed that we didn't give our best. We tried to change our formation, we tried to put more offensive players. It cost us because we conceded two easy goals."" Hampden will be rocking now as Spain visit Hampden on Tuesday (19:45 GMT), while Cyprus visit Armenia in a friendly."
Yield Spread Analysis,Paradise islands poisoned by pesticide,2024-09-14,2019-10-24,By Laurence Peter,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50144261,"The French Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique thrive on their image as idyllic sun, sea and sand destinations for tourists.  But few visitors are aware that these lush, tropical islands have a chronic pollution problem.  A pesticide linked to cancer - chlordecone - was sprayed on banana crops on the islands for two decades and now nearly all the adult local residents have traces of it in their blood. French President Emmanuel Macron has called it an ""environmental scandal"" and said the state ""must take responsibility"". He visited Martinique last year and was briefed on the crisis on the islands, known in France as the Antilles. The French parliament is holding a public inquiry which will report its findings in December.  ""We found anger and anxiety in the Antilles - the population feel abandoned by the republic,"" said Guadeloupe MP Justine Benin, who is in charge of the inquiry's report. ""They are resilient people, they've been hit by hurricanes before, but their trust needs to be restored,"" she told the BBC. Large tracts of soil are contaminated, as are rivers and coastal waters. The authorities are trying to keep the chemical out of the food chain, but it is difficult, as much produce comes from smallholders, often sold at the roadside. Drinking water is considered safe, as carbon filters are used to remove contaminants.  In the US a factory producing chlordecone - sold commercially as kepone - was shut down in 1975 after workers fell seriously ill there. But Antilles banana growers continued to use the pesticide. It is a chlorinated chemical similar to DDT, and an endocrine disruptor - meaning it can interfere with hormones and cause disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes it as ""potentially carcinogenic"". It causes liver tumours in lab mice. Banana plantations in the Antilles used it to eradicate root borers - weevils that attack banana plants.  Chlordecone was already recognised as hazardous in 1972. It was banned in the US as kepone after several hundred workers were contaminated at a factory in Hopewell, Virginia, in 1975. Their symptoms included nervous tremors, slurred speech, short-term memory loss and low sperm counts. As French agriculture minister in 1972 Jacques Chirac, who later became president, authorised chlordecone as a pesticide.  It was not banned in the Antilles until 1993 - a delay attributed to lobbying pressure from banana growers. The chemical is very slow to break down in the environment: contamination can persist for centuries, experts say. It was restricted globally under the Stockholm Convention in 2016, along with 25 other ""Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)"".  Read more on pesticide risks: ""The economic impact is enormous,"" says Prof Luc Multigner, head of research at Inserm, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. Prof Multigner has investigated the chlordecone crisis and says Antilles residents are very anxious and feel the French state is not doing enough.  ""The authorities have banned fishing near the coast, but small-scale fishermen get by from day to day, so they are out of work,"" he told the BBC. ""One-third of coastal waters are contaminated, all the rivers are - fishing is banned there. Agricultural land is 30-50% contaminated, so some cultivation has to stop.""  However, he notes that the chemical does not contaminate bananas. Last year the official unemployment rate in Guadeloupe was 23% and in Martinique 18%, compared with 9% in mainland France. The Antilles rely heavily on French state subsidies. Serge Letchimy, a Martinique MP leading the French parliamentary inquiry, said half of the island's 24,000 hectares (59,305 acres) of agricultural land had some chlordecone contamination, and 4,000 ha of that was totally polluted. Ms Benin said compensation claims would follow the inquiry, but ""the priority is more research, we need soil analysis and impact assessments for the affected farmers"".  Determining responsibility was proving hard because the pesticide's licensing and distribution was complicated, she said.  ""The kepone licence was resold several times,"" she said, adding that so far the inquiry had been unable to speak to the producers. A study in 2013-2014 found that among adults in Martinique, 95% had chlordecone in their blood, while the figure for Guadeloupe was 93%. That corresponds to about 750,000 people. In 2010 Prof Multigner and colleagues found a link between higher chlordecone concentrations in the blood and prostate cancer. Their conclusion was based on a study of 623 men in Guadeloupe with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and a control group of 671.  The World Cancer Research Fund reports that prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. In 2018, the highest rates in the world were in Guadeloupe (189 per 100,000) and Martinique (158 per 100,000). The rate for mainland France was 99.  ""Chlordecone contributes to the higher rate [in the Antilles], but it is not the only factor,"" Prof Multigner said. Ethnicity and lifestyle are also factors in hormone-dependent cancers.  Prostate cancer is more common among Afro-Caribbean and Afro-American men than among white Europeans or Asians. But testicular cancer rates are higher among white European men. Inserm's research also found a link between chlordecone exposure and ""adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills development in infants"".  Another scientific study in the Antilles suggested that the chemical was a factor in premature births.  Since 2008 France has conducted public awareness campaigns in the Antilles, warning of the chlordecone risk.  The islands' authorities are monitoring local fruit and vegetables, as well as meat and fish.  The French ministers of health, overseas territories, research and agriculture have been questioned at the parliamentary inquiry. But MP Serge Letchimy said just 16% of the polluted land had been mapped and ""the measures adopted to deal with this drama bear no relation to its gravity"". "
Yield Spread Analysis,Coronavirus lockdowns reduced human 'rumble',2024-09-14,2020-07-23,By Jonathan Amos,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53518751,"The rumble generated by humanity took a big dive during the Covid lockdowns. Everything we do - from driving our cars to operating our factories - produces ground motions that can be detected by seismometers.   An international team of researchers says this noise fell by up to half when coronavirus restrictions were enforced.  The period March-May represents ""the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction on record"", they tell Science journal. The group obtained their motion data from a global network of 268 seismic stations in 117 countries. Many of the stations were citizen science efforts incorporating Raspberry-Pi mini-computers.  These instruments were sensitive to all types of vibrations but also that band of frequencies, in the region of 4-14 Hertz, where human activities show up. Their information reveals how the quieting started in January in China, the origin of the Covid crisis, and then spread like a wave to the rest of the globe. As people were ordered home, travel restrictions were imposed, and places of work came to a halt - the usual vibrations put into the ground were abruptly dialled down.   The biggest reductions were recorded in the most densely populated areas, like Singapore and New York City, but drops were also observed in remote areas like Germany's Black Forest and Rundu in Namibia. And the phenomenon wasn't confined just to the surface; the quieting was evident even at stations placed in boreholes hundreds of metres underground. Seismometers have long recognised a drop in this shaking at nights, at weekends and during holiday periods - but this lull was far more pronounced and prolonged. ""I think one of the most interesting things for me is that this is really our first look at what actually contributes to the human-caused field of noise,"" observed co-author Dr Steve Hicks from Imperial College London, UK.  ""And as populations get bigger, and as cities get bigger - particularly those in geologically hazardous areas - we need to work out how we're going to monitor those hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides. Because as time goes on, more and more important signals that tell us about these kinds of events are going to get concealed."" Dr Hicks highlighted a shallow, Magnitude 5 earthquake that occurred in Mexico during its lockdown.  The location meant that its signal would not normally be detected in urban areas without special processing of the data. On this occasion, however, the ""filtering"" wasn't necessary because the human vibrations that would otherwise smother the natural signal were reduced by 40%. Dr Hicks says a better understanding of human seismic noise could therefore improve the detection and interpretation of delicate signals that might give warning of potentially harmful events, such as a volcanic eruption. The team says it saw very strong correlations with the mobility trends compiled by the likes of Google and Apple. These trends are derived from the locations and movements of cell phones. Governments used this information to gauge how well populations were following lockdown rules. Dr Hicks says if we go back into wide-scale restrictions then the seismic data offers an alternative form of monitoring that may carry fewer privacy concerns. ""I guess people worry that their mobile phone is tracking them, even though this information should be anonymised. But the very strong correlations with the mobile phone data mean the seismic noise can also be used to monitor mobility, from a more general point of view on, for example, the city scale; or in those places where the phone data simply isn't available. We weren't able to access any data like that for China, for example.""  The scientific collaboration that examined the seismic data involved 76 authors from 66 institutions in 27 countries. The group was led by Dr Thomas Lecocq from the Royal Observatory of Belgium.  Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"

Buttler shared 98 for the ninth wicket with Stuart Broad, who hung around for 98 minutes for his 38.  With Buttler also adding another 20 in the company of James Anderson, England turned their overnight 198-7 into 332 all out.  At 70-1, India were making comfortable progress until Sam Curran produced a beauty to bowl KL Rahul.  Anderson delivered a wonderful spell to remove both Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, and was also unfortunate not to have India captain Virat Kohli lbw.  Kohli moved to an ominous 49, only for Ben Stokes to induce edges from both the skipper and Rishabh Pant that left India 174-6, 158 behind. Anderson's two wickets took him to 561 in Test cricket, three away from overtaking Australia's Glenn McGrath as the most successful fast bowler in the history of the game.

What has been so impressive is the way he has adapted his game to suit the circumstances. Here, he was patient, trusting of his lower-order partners and happy to take the runs India offered until the arrival of Anderson signalled some of Buttler's trademark hitting.  Buttler had overturned being given out lbw on the first evening and on Saturday morning extended his eighth-wicket stand with Adil Rashid to 33.  After Rashid was leg before to Jasprit Bumrah, India spread the field for Buttler in the hope of restricting his scoring and bowling more deliveries at Broad.  Instead, Broad was solid and Buttler mixed milking singles with the occasional cover drive until Broad was brilliantly caught at long-on by a diving Rahul off the spin of Ravindra Jadeja.  With Anderson for company, Buttler hoiked then hooked Bumrah for two sixes in an over before he was caught at slip to give Jadeja his fourth wicket.  This video can not be played 'Significant moment in the game' - Stokes dismisses Kohli India, the world number one side, have lost this series despite having wonderful opportunities to win the first and fourth Tests, both of which eventually went England's way.  Still, they showed no signs of being disheartened on the first day and a superb bowling effort looked to have given them a real chance of winning two Tests on a tour of England for the first time since 1986.  Instead, they once again failed to finish off England thanks to some lacklustre bowling and curious tactics. The plan to drop the field to Buttler simply did not work and left skipper Kohli with nowhere to turn. Not only could the tourists not find a way past Broad, but Buttler was gifted runs.  It was another example of how the lower-orders have affected the outcome of this series - England's partnerships for the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth wickets have outperformed India's.  And, when India came to bat, a promising start ended in the top order crumbling around Kohli.  Though Shikhar Dhawan fell cheaply to Broad, the aggressive Rahul and watchful Pujara were making comfortable progress against an England attack that struggled to find the movement enjoyed by India on day one.  Curran made the breakthrough with a wonderful delivery; one that shaped in and then nipped off the pitch to take Rahul's off stump.

Anderson was immaculate and was only denied an lbw against Kohli when the review showed the tightest 'umpire's call'. Anderson's reaction resulted in words from umpire Kumar Dharmasena.  Anderson did have Pujara caught behind and Rahane held at first slip, while debutant Hanuma Vihari was fortunate with two lbw shouts from Broad. One, given not out, would have been overturned had England opted to review, another that was given out was successfully reversed by the batsman.  The reprieved Vihari went on to 25 not out, adding 51 with Kohli, who looked imperious in nearing 600 runs for the series.  Stokes, though, arrived to swing the ball, with Kohli flashing to second slip and Pant prodding to first slip, leaving England in a dominant position. Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS: ""India had the better of day one, their seamers were outstanding and their intensity was fantastic. ""But this morning they looked like a side that were just letting the game drift. Virat Kohli sent the message from the first ball of the day, spreading the field to Jos Buttler. The initiative was lost."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: ""Jos Buttler is showing that he can play both types of innings for England down the order. He can dig in and help rebuild or capitalise on a good position. ""It was a brave call by Ed Smith to recall him on Twenty20 form but it's certainly worked and you have to credit Smith for that.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Trump hopes US will shake off pandemic by Easter,2024-09-14,2020-03-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52029546,"US President Donald Trump has said he hopes the US will shake off coronavirus by Easter, even as New York's governor sounded the alarm that the illness is spreading faster than ""a bullet train"". The president told a White House news briefing reopening the US early next month would be ""a beautiful timeline"". Hours later, the Senate agreed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) economic rescue plan with the White House. The deal will be passed later on Wednesday by the Senate. ""At last, we have a deal,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, citing the massive ""wartime level of investment into our nation"". The package includes tax rebates, loans, money for hospitals and rescue packages for businesses. The House of Representatives still needs to pass the legislation before it is sent to Mr Trump for his signature. The US has recorded almost 55,000 cases and nearly 800 deaths from coronavirus. Globally there have been more than 420,000 cases confirmed and approaching 19,000 deaths. On Tuesday, he told Fox News he hoped the country could get back to normal by Easter, which is on the weekend of 12 April. Mr Trump, a Republican, said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" He added in a subsequent interview: ""Easter is a very special day for me... and you'll have packed churches all over our country."" Mr Trump also warned that unless the country reopened for business it could suffer ""a massive recession or depression"". The president said: ""You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen. You're going to have instability.""   Speaking at a White House briefing later, Mr Trump said he was beginning ""to see the light at the end of the tunnel"", though he said ""our decision will be based on hard facts and data"". Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told the same press briefing: ""No-one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City."" With more than 25,000 coronavirus cases by Tuesday morning, the Empire state accounted for half of all US infections. Dr Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said on Tuesday the New York City metro area is the source of 60% of all new cases in the US.  She advised anyone leaving the region to self-quarantine for two weeks. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told another news conference on Tuesday: ""The [infection] forecaster said to me, 'We were looking at a freight train coming across the country.' ""'We're now looking at a bullet train.'"" He added: ""New York is the canary in the coal mine, New York is happening first, what is happening to New York will happen to California and Illinois, it is just a matter of time.""   The governor said New York's hospital system will soon reach breaking point unless the US Federal Emergency Management Agency urgently sends more healthcare supplies.  ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,"" Mr Cuomo said. New York currently has 7,000 medical ventilators - machines used to keep patients breathing - but needs 30,000, the governor said.  On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump sat in the verdant White House grounds for a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" and said he hoped to get US businesses reopened by Easter, in just over two weeks. ""A great American resurrection,"" the Fox host suggested. A few hours earlier, Governor Cuomo held a much more sombre press conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. The building, which three years ago hosted Hillary Clinton's ill-fated election-night party, is now a makeshift field hospital. The president and the governor - two New Yorkers with a long history - clashed over the state's shortage of ventilators to treat the most serious cases.  Mr Trump blamed Mr Cuomo for not purchasing more in 2015, citing a conspiracy-mongering website. Mr Cuomo said the administration should use its emergency powers to order more machines manufactured. When it comes to easing the recent shelter-in-place orders, governors like Mr Cuomo, not the president, will have the final say.  If there's disagreement, however, the American public could be left wondering what to believe. The US is more than halfway through a 15-day attempt to slow the spread of the virus through social distancing. The voluntary guidelines were issued by a government public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  But while the president has been talking of easing restrictions, state and local leaders nationwide have been rapidly ratcheting up controls to contain the infection. On Tuesday, Wisconsin, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Mexico, West Virginia and Indiana introduced stay-at-home orders, bringing the total number of US states under such lockdowns to 17.

Yield Spread Analysis,Champions Celtic rescue point at home to St Mirren,2024-09-14,2023-05-20,Clive Lindsay,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65579866,"Callum McGregor scored his fifth Celtic goal this season Champions Celtic avoided a repeat of St Mirren's 2-1 win in January 2021 as they extended their unbeaten domestic home run to 51 games thanks to captain Callum McGregor's late equaliser.  The visitors were the last Scottish side to win at Celtic Park and it looked like they might be in for a repeat when Curtis Main scored with foot and head either side of Kyogo Furuhashi's thunderous finish. But McGregor's low, 18-yard drive found the bottom corner to salvage a draw as Celtic go a rare two successive games without a win since retaining the Scottish title. Meanwhile, the point leaves St Mirren two points behind fifth-top Hibernian, who host Rangers on Sunday, as they look to qualify for European football for the first time since 1987. Read the latest Celtic updates Sign up for the latest about St Mirren Reaction & as it happened Celtic's players will have taken the field with a mixture of emotions - celebratory with it being their first home game since retaining the title and with determination to atone for last weekend's defeat by Rangers. There was no surprise that Ange Postecoglou brought back stalwarts Kyogo, Daizen Maeda and Greg Taylor, but starting on-loan Yokohama F Marinos midfielder Tomoki Iwata at centre-back in place of Yuki Kobayashi raised a few eyebrows. Postecoglou pointed out post-match that Iwata had played there before, but he looked rusty in the role as he and Anthony Ralston hesitated going for a long punt from goalkeeper Trevor Carson. Main, St Mirren's only fit striker, drove into the home penalty box, turned inside Ralston and sent a low drive through the legs of Iwata and goalkeeper Joe Hart. Normality seemed to be restored when Reo Hatate threaded a neat ball into the path of Kyogo and the striker thundered his drive into the top far corner past goalkeeper Carson for his 31st goal of the season. Carson saved twice from Matt O'Riley at the near post and Hatate fired just over, but St Mirren should have already restored the lead as Ryan Strain shot wide from a couple of yards out before Main pounced again. A VAR check ruled that McGregor was just playing the English striker onside as he headed past Hart from 12 yards. Main was terrorising the Celtic defence and the striker headed just off target twice as he looked to complete a hat-trick and give St Mirren a two-goal cushion after the break. Maeda half-volleyed into the side-netting from point-blank range, Main fired against the outside of the far post and Celtic substitute Oh Hyeon-gyu followed suit. However, McGregor was to have the final say and, instead of another famous win at Celtic Park, St Mirren go five games - and seven on the road - without a victory. Curtis was the Main man for St Mirren, scoring twice, coming close to a hat-trick and even putting in a couple of vital stops at the other end Postecoglou was disappointed with last week's defeat by Rangers and will be concerned that his side have dipped, not only in terms of results but also performances, since clinching the league title. He will point out that the rest of the season is hardly meaningless - a domestic treble is within touching distance and Scottish Cup final starting places still up for grabs. The Celtic manager will therefore be concerned that he has not nailed down who will partner Carl Starfelt in central defence following injury to Cameron Carter-Vickers. Kobayashi dropped back to the bench after defeat at Ibrox, while his fellow Japanese, Iwata, did not impress as his replacement. St Mirren were as ""brave"" and positive as manager Stephen Robinson had asked and will count themselves unlucky to find themselves rank outsiders in the race for Europe. They now have their highest points tally in a single top-flight campaign in the 21st century.  And, having lost three in a row against Celtic, losing 14 goals and scoring twice, since September's 2-0 win in Paisley can point to a draw in Glasgow as a further sign of improvement. Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou: ""It was a tough game. St Mirren worked hard as they have all year and that's why they are what they are. ""We've gone off it a little bit the last couple of weeks, particularly the defensive side of the game, and when you do that, it's very hard then for us to play the football we want to.  ""I guarantee 1000% it's not one player. It's got nothing to do Cameron Carter-Vickers. We've missed Cameron Carter-Vickers before."" St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: ""It's not often you come to Celtic Park and say you're disappointed with a point. It shows we've come a long way. ""We had some great opportunities and limited Celtic to half chances, which they are always going to create with their quality.  ""We are still in the race for Europe with two games to go, which is a fantastic achievement for everybody at this football club.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Chris Sutton's Premier League predictions v Liam Fray of The Courteneers,2024-09-14,2023-01-19,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64283241,"Arsenal's only Premier League defeat this season came at the hands of Manchester United, so how will the Gunners get on when they play Erik ten Hag's side again on Sunday? ""United were quite fortunate when they beat Arsenal at Old Trafford in September,"" BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton said. ""I think Erik ten Hag's team are good enough to win this game too, just by playing on the counter-attack at Emirates Stadium. ""But Arsenal are full of confidence, and their goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale is playing extremely well too - they have to be the favourites."" Sutton is making predictions for every top-flight game this season, against a variety of guests. For this weekend's fixtures, he is up against The Courteeners frontman Liam Fray. The Courteeners released the 15th anniversary reissue of their debut album, St Jude, on 13 January. They play a hometown celebration gig on 9 June at Manchester's Heaton Park.  St Jude was originally released in April 2008. It reached number four in the UK album charts and won the inaugural Guardian First Album Award. The band have released five more albums since, and all of them have made the top six Liam is a Manchester United fan who is on a high after his side's Manchester derby win last weekend, and feels Ten Hag deserves all the credit for their resurgence. ""It had been a while since we'd been on a level playing field with City going into a derby,"" Liam told BBC Sport. ""We believed we could win it… and we did. Our form and performances have been great. You can see the signs on and off the pitch that it's not just a temporary thing. The manager has transformed everything."" United made a slow start under Ten Hag, losing their first two league games, but they have flown up the table in recent weeks and only a late Crystal Palace leveller on Wednesday stopped him claiming a 10th successive win in all competitions. ""I don't think anyone expected us to be doing so well, so soon,"" Liam added. ""I knew how well Ten Hag had done at Ajax domestically and in Europe but I had no idea how he would fare in the Premier League.  ""It's a different beast and, as can happen with some players, people don't always adapt well when they come here.  ""It's still early days but after six months he's already shown that he can be as influential and successful as Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, and hopefully even more so.  ""Whatever he's doing on the training pitch is working wonders and his attitude and disciplinary skills are a breath of fresh air after the obvious dressing room issues that have reared their head over the last few years.   ""Ten Hag has come in with a great attitude and approach and it feels like the start of a long-term project for him rather than a quick fix. ""You can see how infectious his work has been across the whole club with the success of the men's, women's and youth teams. It's a really exciting time to be a United fan."" United played iconic Courteeners track 'Not Nineteen Forever' at Old Trafford when they won their 20th league title in 2013. Title number 21 is taking a while to arrive so they could always play another Courteeners song, 'What Took You So Long?', when it does, but Liam says his pick would be 'No One Will Ever Replace Us' The below fixture grid includes Manchester City's game with Tottenham on Thursday, which was rearranged from week seven, when Asking Alexandria guitarist Ben Bruce was the guest. Premier League predictions - week 20 Result Sutton Liam THURSDAY, 19 JAN Man City v Tottenham 4-2 3-1 2-1* (Ben) SATURDAY, 21 JAN Liverpool v Chelsea 0-0 1-1 1-1 Bournemouth v Nott'm Forest 1-1 0-1 0-1 Leicester v Brighton 2-2 1-2 1-2 Southampton v Aston Villa 0-1 1-1 1-1 West Ham v Everton 2-0 0-0 2-0 Crystal Palace v Newcastle 0-0 1-1 0-2 SUNDAY, 22 JAN Leeds v Brentford 0-0 2-2 2-2 Man City v Wolves 3-0 2-0 3-0 Arsenal v Man Utd 3-2 3-1 1-2 MONDAY, 23 JAN Fulham v Tottenham 0-1 2-1 1-1 * Ben Bruce's prediction from week seven. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. Visit your Premier League club's page with all the latest news, analysis and fan views, and sign up for notifications Games kick off at 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated I originally went for a 3-3 draw when this game was meant to be played, in September, but I am definitely not saying that now. I know Manchester City have not been at their fluent best recently but they should still have too much for a Tottenham team who have put some in some really disappointing performances. I think it's fair to say that Spurs boss Antonio Conte cuts an unhappy figure at the moment, and you could extend that kind of mood to the entire club - it is not a happy camp. Tottenham beat City home and away last season, but that was when they were playing well. Conte's preferred style of play, to defend deep and break quickly, suits this game very well but, even if they get some joy and Harry Kane scores, City will still win. The defending champions are playing catch-up to Arsenal now, but we are only halfway through the season and things can change very quickly - I still think City will win the title. Sutton's prediction: 3-1 Ben Bruce's prediction: 2-1 Match report I've been unconvinced by Liverpool for a while now, because of their lack of energy and legs in midfield, and their defeat at Brighton last weekend was not even that big a surprise. I know the Reds then went and beat Wolves in the FA Cup, but I've not seen anything that makes me think they are going to bounce back and clinch their first league win of 2023. It is a similar story with Chelsea, because we don't know which Blues team will turn up at Anfield. They got an important win over Crystal Palace last time out but they needed some big saves from Kepa Arrizabalaga to get over the line. A win would be a huge boost in confidence for both teams, but it is hard to make a case for either of them to take the three points.How on earth can you call this game? Both sides have been incredibly inconsistent this season, and it is impossible to know what they will do next. Sutton's prediction: 1-1 Liam's prediction: 1-1 Match report Bournemouth boss Gary O'Neil has lost all six games since being appointed on a permanent basis, including four league defeats where the Cherries have not even scored. Their confidence must be rock bottom, whereas Nottingham Forest must be feeling completely the opposite - they come into this game on a real high after climbing away from the bottom three. Forest keep strengthening their squad, signing Brazilian duo Danilo and Gustavo Scarpa this month, and it looks like Newcastle striker Chris Wood is also on his way soon. Steve Cooper's side have only won one away league game all season, against Southampton at the start of January, but I am backing them to get a repeat result on their return to the south coast. Sutton's prediction: 0-1 Liam's prediction: 0-1 Match report It is four league defeats in a row for Leicester now. They seem to have lost their way since the World Cup because they were in great form before the season paused in November. In contrast, Brighton are not just winning games, they are doing so in style. I think everyone is enjoying watching the Seagulls under Roberto de Zerbi - it seems a long time since they were struggling to turn their good play into goals under Graham Potter, because they are free-scoring now. Sutton's prediction: 1-2 Liam's prediction: 1-2 Match report Southampton look like they have turned a corner, with a huge win at Everton coming off the back of their progress in both domestic cups. Saints are still bottom of the table but they have something to build on now. It has been interesting to watch James Ward-Prowse play as a number 10, and it seems like a smart move from their manager Nathan Jones. Villa have only played two away league games under Unai Emery, against Brighton and Tottenham, and have won them both. This game smells like a draw to me though. Sutton's prediction: 1-1 Liam's prediction: 1-1 Match report Is it possible for me to make a prediction where both teams lose? Both managers are under a lot of pressure, and neither side seems able to score many goals. West Ham boss David Moyes didn't get the result he needed when his side lost to Wolves last weekend, but their performance was even worse. While there has been lots of criticism of Everton's owner and the club's board, Frank Lampard's record of only one win and 10 defeats in their past 13 games does not stand up to much scrutiny either. Are either of these teams really capable of taking the game to the other one? I am not sure, and I cannot bring myself to back either of them. It's difficult to say they are both suited to doing anything, to be honest, but they are both marginally better on the counter-attack, and will be hoping they can nick something from what will probably be a very nervy - and possibly quite boring - game. Sutton's prediction: 0-0 Liam's prediction: 2-0 Match report Newcastle were a bit fortunate on Sunday, when Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic slipped to mis-kick his penalty with the score at 0-0 before the Magpies nicked it late on. It is things like that which make you think it is going to be their season, in terms of a top-four finish, especially when you consider how strong they are defensively. This is another tough test for them, though. As I keep saying, Palace are impossible to predict - but they are generally a bit better when they take on the teams at the top of the table. Newcastle will be without injured midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, who has been such a star for them, and they might have to settle for a point this time. Sutton's prediction: 1-1 Liam's prediction: 0-2 Match report Leeds' 5-2 defeat at Brentford in September was a real low point for their boss Jesse Marsch, who is still under pressure now. Marsch is always bullish, win or lose, to talk his side's performances up and he is a manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. He could do with a home win - Leeds thumped Cardiff in the FA Cup on Wednesday but they haven't managed a league victory since 5 November. Brentford are dangerous though, especially on the counter-attack, and they are streetwise from set-pieces too. I don't see them losing here. Sutton's prediction: 2-2 Liam's prediction: 2-2 Match report People are looking for things that are wrong with City at the moment but they have still had a very good start to the season in terms of points. According to some reports I've read, Erling Haaland is the problem - which is just ridiculous. I looked into where their goals have come from in the past couple of seasons and of course they were spread around more, but his scoring record is amazing. According to some people, we are at the stage where he shouldn't play, which is a ridiculous call to make. Wolves will be awkward opponents but I still don't think they score enough goals, and I don't see City slipping up again. Sutton's prediction: 2-0 Liam's prediction: 3-0 Match report I always have a sneaky feeling for Manchester United in games like this, with Marcus Rashford so good on the counter-attack and Bruno Fernandes and Christian Eriksen having the eye for the pass that would put him through. On the flip side, I just wonder how much Wednesday's draw against Palace will have taken out of Erik ten Hag's side, who will be missing the suspended Casemiro in midfield too. As I said on the Monday Night Club on Radio 5 Live, United's biggest issue at present is managing expectation, because after winning nine games in a row some of their fans started to think they are title contenders again. Yes, they have found some consistency with their performance levels but it is Arsenal who have set the standard this season, with 15 wins and only one defeat in their first 18 league games. This will be a great game to watch because of United's threat on the break, but Arsenal are at home and they are playing like they believe they can beat anyone at the moment. Sutton's prediction: 3-1 Liam's prediction: 1-2 Match report Tottenham boss Antonio Conte said his side had to take more risks in the second half against Arsenal last weekend, when Spurs were behind and chasing the game. But the way Spurs have been starting so many games this season so badly, surely they need to take more risks from the off? Fulham will definitely be playing on the front foot. They were unlucky not to get anything against Newcastle last week, and they will go for it again here. I can see them beating Spurs, and cranking up the pressure on Conte even more. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Liam's prediction: 1-1 Match report Chris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. From the last set of Premier League fixtures, Sutton got seven correct results from 10 matches, with two exact scores, giving him a total of 130 points - his highest score of the season. He beat singer-songwriter Gaz Coombes, who got six correct results, with two exact scores, for a total of 120 points - enough to send him top of the guest leaderboard, despite his defeat. The Fulham versus Chelsea game counts towards week seven, when that game was meant to take place. Neither Sutton or his guest, Asking Alexandria guitarist Ben Bruce, scored any points from that fixture. Manchester United's game at Crystal Palace on Wednesday also counted towards that set of results. Chris went for a 1-0 United win, while Bruce went for a 1-1 draw and got 40 points, meaning he leads 40-0 with two of the 10 games played. Their scores will be updated when the remaining eight matches from that set of games take place.

Yield Spread Analysis,White House plans to disband virus task force,2024-09-14,2020-05-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52553829,"US President Donald Trump has confirmed the White House coronavirus task force will be winding down, with Vice-President Mike Pence suggesting it could be disbanded within weeks. ""We are bringing our country back,"" Mr Trump said during a visit to a mask-manufacturing factory in Arizona.  New confirmed infections per day in the US currently top 20,000, and daily deaths exceed 1,000. US health officials warn the virus may spread as businesses begin to reopen. The US currently has 1.2 million confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 70,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which is tracking the pandemic. During a visit to the plant in Phoenix after weeks holed up at the White House, Mr Trump told journalists: ""Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening. And we'll have a different group probably set up for that."" The president - who wore safety goggles but no face mask during his tour of the facility - was asked if it was ""mission accomplished"", and he said: ""No, not at all. The mission accomplished is when it's over."" Critics have accused the president of sacrificing Americans' public health in his eagerness to reopen the US economy ahead of his re-election battle in November. In Arizona on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that Democrats were hoping his coronavirus policy would fail ""so they can win the election"". Acknowledging a human cost to the plans, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I'm not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes.  ""Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon."" However, it will be up to individual states to determine how they reopen.  Some Democratic governors in badly hit states have been cautious, calling for more testing and other safeguards before easing lockdowns. Other states, many led by Republicans in the south and mid-west, have already begun lifting restrictions. The task force was set up on 29 January. Mr Pence became its chairman four weeks later and its members include more than 20 experts and leading administration officials. The White House said the task force's duty was to ""lead the administration's efforts to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus"" and provide the public with information. Mr Trump's once-daily task force briefings became increasingly scarce after he was widely condemned by the medical community for pondering at the podium last month whether injecting bleach into people might kill the virus. Dr Deborah Birx has been the task force's response co-ordinator. The president was asked on Tuesday whether she and another high-profile member, Dr Anthony Fauci, would still be involved in efforts to address the coronavirus. ""They will be and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field,"" the president said. Mr Pence earlier on Tuesday told reporters in a briefing that the task force could soon be disbanded. He said the Trump administration was ""starting to look at the Memorial Day [late May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage, begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner"". He said it was ""a reflection of the tremendous progress we've made as a country"". Mr Pence has led the task force, which reports to the president and co-ordinates with medical institutes, political staff and state governors. The group also consulted medical experts to formulate national guidelines on social distancing. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later tweeted that the president ""will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening"". The White House's shift in focus from the public health aspect of the coronavirus pandemic to its economic impact continues.  For more than a month, the task force had been the public face of the administration's response to the crisis, even though President Trump sometimes veered far from the topic at hand during its press briefings. When the president wasn't talking, however, government public health officials led the conversation. Now, it appears, the officials setting the agenda will be ones more concerned with jobs, businesses and the fiscal health of the nation - even though the number of cases of the virus throughout the US continues to increase.  There is growing frustration among the president's core supporters, however, with government shelter-in-place orders. Several states, encouraged by the president, have already begun to ease restrictions, even though they have not met White House guidelines for when to do so. Those recommendations were set by the current coronavirus task force, of course. And the ""different group"" in a ""different form"" that replaces it, as the president describes, may have other ideas. Not yet. Besides New York, which is still the US epicentre despite an ongoing drop in new cases, the level of infection continues to climb across much of the country. Many states that have allowed some business to resume - including Texas, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana - are seeing more new cases reported daily. While some cities such as New York, New Orleans and Detroit have shown improvement, others like Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago are seeing the caseload rise every day. According to a report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), more than 3,000 people may be killed by the virus each day by next month. The White House has dismissed the report as inaccurate, with Mr Trump saying it describes a scenario in which Americans make no effort to mitigate the spread of the infection. On Sunday, the president increased his forecast for the number of US pandemic deaths to 100,000, after saying two weeks earlier that it would be fewer than 60,000.

Yield Spread Analysis,Man City thump Liverpool to keep pressure on Arsenal,2024-09-14,2023-03-31,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65073200,"Manchester City winger Jack Grealish has more Premier League goal involvements against Liverpool than he does any other opponent (7 - 3 goals, 4 assists) Manchester City maintained the pressure on Premier League leaders Arsenal by shrugging off the absence of the injured Erling Haaland to outclass Liverpool with a magnificent display at Etihad Stadium.  City's 42-goal striker was ruled out with a groin injury, but Pep Guardiola's reigning champions demonstrated their all-round strength by coming from a goal down against a Liverpool side who have made life so difficult for them in the past, to run out convincing winners.  Liverpool caught City with a counter-attack after 17 minutes to take the lead, Diogo Jota making the break before Mohamed Salah applied a thumping finish.  City responded in devastating fashion with the outstanding Jack Grealish, who made a crucial intervention on Salah when Liverpool had the chance to double their lead, crossing for Julian Alvarez to equalise after 27 minutes.  Alvarez was the creator as City went ahead 53 seconds after the break, his raking pass finding Riyad Mahrez, who crossed for Kevin de Bruyne to slide home from close range.  John Stones delivered a masterclass in an unaccustomed role which saw him advance into midfield but also drop back into defence when required, and with City in total control Ilkay Gundogan added the third after a goalmouth skirmish.  Grealish deserved a goal and it duly arrived in the 74th minute when he timed his arrival perfectly to turn in De Bruyne's cross as Liverpool ended beaten and bedraggled.  Liverpool bus damage totally unacceptable - Man City 'Gap between Man City and Liverpool now a chasm' Go straight to all the best Manchester City content Visit our Liverpool page This video can not be played Match of the Day analysis: Why Jack Grealish was 'best player on the park' When Grealish was substituted to a standing ovation late on, he fully deserved the accolade after a performance of the highest class.  The 27-year-old England winger tormented Trent Alexander-Arnold, delivered an equaliser on a plate for Alvarez and then scored the fourth goal that gave the scoreline a more accurate reflection of City's supremacy over Liverpool.  Among all of his contributions, the lung-busting run to chase back and block Salah as the Egyptian raced clear with the option of setting up Jota was vital. Seconds later he was playing in Alavarez and City were level.  Grealish has grown into his role at Manchester City and clearly has the faith of his manager, who embraced him in a bear hug as he left the field.  Even stripped of Haaland, City were scintillating and gave a graphic demonstration of the gap that has opened up between them and Liverpool, who have been the only side to provide them with serious opposition in the title race in recent years.  The stylish performance of Stones, spending time breaking up attacks and spraying passes around in midfield to show what a naturally gifted footballer he is, showed that Guardiola's side have many strings to their bow and this was a huge reminder to Arsenal that they will not give up their title without a fight.  This video can not be played Man City 4-1 Liverpool: Pep Guardiola hails 'almost perfect performance' Liverpool have been the shadow on Manchester City's shoulder in the title races of recent times - now they are simply a shadow of the side that chased a historic quadruple last season.  Jurgen Klopp's team may occasionally show their former selves, like in the 7-0 demolition of Manchester United, but too often this season they have been mediocre and now they face a fight to finish in the top four.  The midfield pairing of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho look tired and vulnerable and Virgil van Dijk has lost much of his old authority at the heart of the defence.  Alexander-Arnold had another dismal 90 minutes and Andrew Robertson, his full-back partner on the other side, did not fare much better. Both were left exposed and City took full toll. Much is made of Liverpool's pursuit of Jude Bellingham but even if they are successful against opposition from many of Europe's elite, the idea that the brilliant teenager will cure all their ills is a delusion.  Klopp looked, in turns, furious and bemused at Liverpool's rank bad defending, lack of intensity and the manner in which they were over-powered - but given their previous form this season, he should not have been that surprised.

Yield Spread Analysis,Celtic's Oh can 'kick on' after quelling 10-man Hibs,2024-09-14,2023-03-18,Martin Watt,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64923678,"This video can not be played Was Youan's second yellow for Hibs the right call? Oh Hyeon-gyu will be a ""fantastic player"" for Celtic, said manager Ange Postecoglou, after the striker came off the bench to avert a shock slip-up against 10-man Hibernian. Despite Elie Youan's dismissal - after a dubious second yellow - the visitors led through a Josh Campbell penalty and gamely frustrated Celtic after Jota's leveller from the spot. But Oh crashed in a header late on and Sead Haksabanovic added a third in injury time as the hosts restored their nine-point Scottish Premiership lead. Oh, 21, has started just once in 10 appearances for Postecoglou's side since his January move from Suwon Samsung Bluewings, netting three times. ""It's an important goal for him,"" said Postecoglou. ""He'll take a lot from that and hopefully kick on. ""We're slowing integrating him into things on and off the field but every day in training he's such a physical presence, has good quality as well and is hungry to succeed."" Hibs drop one spot to fifth after a second successive defeat, but their deficit on third-place Hearts remains five points. All the latest Celtic news Everything you need to know about Hibs Celtic have now won their opening 15 home games of a league season for just the second time in their history, but only after a fraught afternoon that seemed to look straightforward when Youan was sent off just 24 minutes in.  The French forward's first yellow, for clattering Carl Starfelt, was clear cut. His second was far more contentious, with Youan falling backwards and grappling with Cameron Carter-Vickers when he stuck out a boot to the defender's lowered head. Having shipped 10 goals in two meetings with Celtic this season - including a 6-1 shellacking on their previous visit to Glasgow's east end - Hibs may well have feared the worst a man down. Yet they silenced the expectant home support when Starfelt needlessly grabbed a handful of Paul Hanlon's shirt at a corner despite the defender going away from goal.  VAR intervened, referee Steven McLean awarded the spot-kick after checking the pitchside monitor, and Campbell did the rest by sending Joe Hart the wrong way. Starfelt had earlier thudded the bar with a header, while David Marshall brilliantly denied Kygo Furuhashi at 0-0, and Celtic lost Reo Hatate to injury in an incident-packed first half. More drama soon followed. Having profited from a shirt pull at the other end, Hanlon turned culprit as he held back Carter-Vickers at a Celtic corner and the defender tumbled. This time McLean gave the award without the need of VAR, and Jota's weak penalty squirmed under the body of Marshall, who will be disappointed not to have saved it. Celtic set up camp in the Hibs half as they sought the second, but Oh sent a free header too high and CJ-Egan Riley made a brilliant goalline clearance after Kyogo beat Marshall to a through ball. The pressure finally told as Oh rose to meet David Turnbull's corner with a header that flashed past Marshall, with the striker ripping off his shirt in frenzied celebrations to earn a booking. Celtic had a penalty awarded and then rescinded after Liel Abada ran clear and collided with Marshall, but Haksabanovic came up with a curling finish to make sure of his side's 14th consecutive win in all competitions. The winger got on the scoresheet and was a constant threat. His three shots on target was a joint high with Kyogo and his 18 touches in the box was twice was many as any teammate For the third league game in a row Celtic conceded first and had to battle back for victory. They were increasingly annoyed by Hibs' attempts to slow the game and only in spells did Ange Postecoglou's men find their usual fluency. The delirium that greeted Oh's winner shows how much this win meant to the players and support. And it nudges them closer to a second successive title, which will effectively be guaranteed with six more wins from the remaining nine games. Hatate's injury tempers the mood, though, and Celtic will be anxiously hoping the midfielder will be available as the chase for the treble hits the home straight. Hibs' momentum has been stalled after running into both halves of the Old Firm. But while the 4-1 thumping by Rangers was pockmarked by errors and poor defending, Lee Johnson's side thrived after the adversity of Youan's sending off at Celtic Park. Hibs put up a wall of defiance and defended stoutly under siege to foil Celtic's search for a winner until the closing stages. Johnson's men can console themselves that, thanks to city rivals Hearts' defeat at Aberdeen, they haven't lost ground in the fight for third. Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou: ""There was a fair bit going on the whole game and we couldn't really get into any sort of rhythm or flow. ""In the first half losing Reo [Hatate] as well was further disruption and we couldn't impose ourselves. ""After half-time the lads cleared their heads and understood what we needed to do, trying to make it about the football and do what we've been doing all season. They got their rewards."" Hibs boss Lee Johnson: It's difficult enough at Celtic Park and then to be restricted in the way we want to play by a really poor decision puts more demands on the players. ""They were outstanding from start to finish. We tried to play as well but had to defend for our lives. We looked disciplined, organised, and showed how far we've come since the previous time we played here."" After a two-week international break, Celtic resume Premiership action on Sunday, 2 April at Ross County (12:00 BST), while Hibs host Motherwell the previous day (15:00).

Yield Spread Analysis,Queen: 'We will succeed' in fight against virus,2024-09-14,2020-04-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52176222,"The Queen has said the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, in a rallying message to the nation. In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those ""coming together to help others"". She also thanked key workers, saying ""every hour"" of work ""brings us closer to a return to more normal times"". It comes as the number of people to die with the virus in the UK reached 4,934. Speaking from Windsor Castle, the Queen said: ""While we have faced challenges before, this one is different."" ""This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us. ""We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again."" The Queen, 93, also said the ""painful sense of separation from their loved ones"" that social distancing was causing for people reminded her of the experience child evacuees had during the Second World War. ""Now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do,"" she said. An hour after the Queen's broadcast, Downing Street announced that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been taken to hospital following his coronavirus diagnosis. Mr Johnson has been self-isolating since he tested positive for the virus on 27 March. In her address, the Queen said everyone who was following guidance to stay at home was ""helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones"".  ""Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,"" she added. She also stressed the value of self-discipline and resolve - and said she hopes that, in the future, everyone would ""be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge"". There have been difficult royal speeches and addresses in the past - times when the wrong word or the wrong phrase could have undermined the message or let slip a critical opportunity. The broadcast after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 for example, or the speech the Queen gave on her visit to Ireland in 2011. The Palace could have played it safe, stressed unity and given thanks. It would have served.   This was a different and much more ambitious broadcast, designed to reassure and to inspire. But most of all to recast this crisis as a defining moment in a nation which will forever remember its collective effort to save the lives of its vulnerable.  Read more here. The pre-recorded message, written by the Queen with her private secretary Sir Edward Young, was filmed by a single cameraman wearing protective equipment. All other technical staff were in another room. It was broadcast on TV, radio and social media channels. The decision to deliver the address was made ""in close consultation with Downing Street"", BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said. Nightingale Hospital  - the first temporary field hospital to open to treat coronavirus patients - shared photos on Twitter of staff listening to the speech, and thanked the monarch for recognising the hard work of frontline NHS staff. The UK government's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Queen's address was ""striking and important"". The new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the monarch spoke for the whole country ""and our determination to defeat the coronavirus"". The Queen's address came less than a week after her son, the Prince of Wales, came out of self-isolation, following his coronavirus diagnosis. Prince Charles, 71, spent seven days self-isolating in Scotland after testing positive and displaying mild symptoms. It is only the fifth time the monarch has given such a speech in her 68-year reign. While her Christmas Day message is an annual event, only rarely has the Queen made rallying speeches at key moments in the life of the nation: Read more here. On Sunday Mr Hancock urged the public to follow social distancing rules over a sunny weekend to protect the NHS and slow the spread of the virus. The Department of Health said on Sunday there had been 621 more coronavirus-related deaths in the UK in the past day. The latest deaths include 12 more in Wales, seven in Northern Ireland and two in Scotland. As of 09:00 BST on Sunday, 47,806 people had tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health said."
Yield Spread Analysis,Parasite 'resistant to malaria drug' in Africa,2024-09-14,2020-08-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53676702,"A drug-resistant strain of the parasite that causes malaria has been identified by scientists in Rwanda. The study, published in Nature, found the parasites were able to resist treatment by artemisinin - a frontline drug in the fight against the disease. This is the first time scientists have observed the resistance to the drug artemisinin in Africa.  The researchers warns that this ""would pose a major public health threat"" in the continent. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Program in Rwanda (Rwanda Biomedical Center), the World Health Organization (WHO), Cochin Hospital and Columbia University (New York, USA) analysed blood samples from patients in Rwanda.  They found one particular mutation of the parasite, resistant to artemisinin, in 19 of 257 - or 7.4% - of patients at one of the health centres they monitored.  In the journal article the scientists warned that malaria parasites that developed a resistance to previous drugs are ""suspected to have contributed to millions of additional malaria deaths in young African children in the 1980s"". When the first malaria drug, chloroquine, was developed, researchers thought that the disease would be eradicated within years. But since the 1950s the parasites have evolved to develop resistance to successive drugs.  This is a deeply worrying and highly significant moment. Today marks a setback in the fight against the malaria. Resistance to artemisinin is not new as it has been in parts of South East Asia for more than a decade.  In some regions there, 80% of patients are now infected with malaria parasites that resist treatment.  But Africa has always been the biggest concern - it is where more than nine in 10 cases of the disease are. It appears as though the resistance evolved in malaria parasites in Africa rather than spreading from South East Asia to the continent. The result, however, is the same - malaria is getting harder to treat. Malaria infection is now commonly treated with a combination of two drugs - artemisinin and piperaquine. But then malaria parasites started developing a resistance to artemisinin as well - this was first recorded in 2008 in South East Asia.  At the time scientists they feared that resistance to artemisinin could also occur in Africa and have devastating consequences The research indicates that these fears may have been realised. In 2018, African countries accounted for over 90% of the more than 400,000 deaths from malaria recorded. You may also be interested in... Professor Lang Linfu, who was one of the scientists involved in its discovery of artemisinin, explains how he made the breakthrough."
Yield Spread Analysis,How soon can we expect a working vaccine?,2024-09-14,2020-09-10,By Dominic Bailey,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54027269,"If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox -  and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of immune response in patients and has rolled out the vaccine for public use while late-stage trials continue. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans.  Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech say preliminary analysis shows their vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. They plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful.  There are dozens of other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved.  The UK government, for example, has signed deals for undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations"". This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries.   In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr Mariângela Simão, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check.  ""The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more."" The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 94 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine plan known as Covax, which aims to raise $2bn (£1.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get ""rapid, fair and equitable access"" to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. ""With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,"" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. ""If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe."" While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (£24 to £28).  AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine ""at cost"" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic.  The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (£2.28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. ""Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,"" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers. As more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups.  After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. ""The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,"" says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount.  Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, ""to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access"". A lot depends on which vaccine is successful. The ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly. The WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called ""cold chain"" facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field. But adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment. Vaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C.  That's not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an ""immense task"" where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable. ""Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges' countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,"" MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC. ""You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them."" AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2C and 8C. But at present it looks like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would need ultra-cold chain - storage at -80C before being distributed. Welcoming the Pfizer announcement, Dr Richard Hatchett, of Cepi acknowledged that would ""remain a challenge for use in some settings"". ""This is something which will have to be addressed if the vaccine is to be made broadly available,"" he said. But the Ebola vaccine also needed very low temperatures, so it is not impossible. ""To keep the Ebola vaccine at -60°C or colder we had to use a special cold chain equipment to store and transport them, plus we had to train staff to use all this new equipment,"" said Barbara Saitta. There is also the question of the target population. Vaccination programmes usually target children, so agencies will have to plan how to reach people that normally are not part of the immunization program. As the world waits for the scientists to do their bit, many more challenges await. And vaccines are not the only weapon against coronavirus. ""Vaccines are not the only solution,"" Says Dr Simao, of the WHO. ""You need to have diagnostics. You need to have a way to decrease mortality, so you need therapeutics, and you need a vaccine. ""Besides that, you need everything else - social distancing, avoiding crowded places and so on."""
Yield Spread Analysis,Aberdeen's home streak continues in win over Hibs,2024-09-14,2022-11-04,Jack Herrall,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63422251,"Bojan Miovski nods in his side's second to put Aberdeen in firm control Aberdeen kept up their rampant home form to leapfrog Hibernian into third place in the Scottish Premiership with an absorbing win at Pittodrie. Bojan Miovski slotted home a retaken penalty at the end of the first half after some protracted discussions with VAR, and nodded home his second the other side of the interval. Ylber Ramadani and Leighton Clarkson scored impressive strikes either side of Mykola Kukharevych's tap in for Hibs, which was awarded after a lengthy VAR intervention. It means Jim Goodwin's side have now scored four goals in five of their last seven home matches in all competitions, with Hibs having lost four of their last five games. Reaction & as it happened Get all your Aberdeen news Visit our dedicated Hibs page With the controversy surrounding the reverse fixture between these sides still very much at the forefront of pre-match chat, many anticipated some early fireworks. They weren't disappointed.  Both sides showed good attacking impetus in the opening stages as Luis Lopes and Joe Newell had chances for either team but failed to convert.  Hibs' Kukharevych fired an edge-of-the-area free-kick before Lopes managed to get in behind the away side's high line, but his angled shot was stopped a few yards from cross the line. Ewan Henderson then had a header expertly saved by Kelle Roos. As a fairly end-to-end 45 minutes were coming to an end, Jayden Richardson slipped in Lopes, who appeared to trip on the hand of David Marshall as he dived for the ball. A penalty was given, then saved, then retaken as the Hibs captain was not properly on his line as he sprung to save the initial shot. At the second time of asking Miovski slotted home with a brief rammy ensuing in the following moments.  The drama continued after the interval as Hibs, who had been marginally the first half's better side, found themselves two goals down when Clarkson's cross found the unmarked Miovski who leapt, unchallenged, and nodded in his second of the match. It was soon three as Ramadani lashed home his first goal for the club with a fine volley that skipped up off of the turf before VAR allowed Kukharevych's goal to stand despite an initial on-field decision of offside. The hosts didn't settle however, with Clarkson reaching a low Marley Watkins cross to emphatically backheel in. The 21-year-old looked like a seasoned pro in the middle of the park. A goal, an assist, his side's highest passes and entries into the final third. Immense. An open encounter, as this was, will always have goals in it, but Aberdeen's defensive strength was impressive throughout, too. Whereas Hibs were easily carved open, the home side often stood firm with Anthony Stewart and Liam Scales both looking formidable.   For Hibs, it may be a bit of a head scratcher. Seventeen shots, six on target, and 1.44xG to Aberdeen's 1.93, but three goals fewer. They dominated the ball with 61% possession, but failed to create enough in the way of goal-scoring opportunities. A common theme of late for Lee Johnson's side. Aberdeen manager Jim Goodwin: ""I didn't think there was much between these teams pre-match, the scoreline may suggest we were well on top and gave Hibs a tough time but people at the game will realise it was a lot closer than the scoreline would suggest. ""All in all you've got to be pleased. I'd have taken a scrappy 1-0 before the game so the fact we've been able to entertain the fans and score four goals, I don't know the exact number but I know we've scored a considerable amount here, I'm delighted to go and entertain the fans again tonight."" Hibernian head coach Lee Johnson: ""Anger and frustration [are my overriding emotions]. We came here with good intentions to play forward, to win the game, to counter well and I thought we did that really well for 45 minutes until the injury time that led to the penalty. ""It was difficult for me as I didn't feel like it was absolutely clear and obvious. It took an age to get through and if it takes that long then it's probably not. I suppose I'm bad in that sense.  It's a club with prestige, it's a club that expects to be up there and those soft underbelly tones are not good enough.""

The reviews on Yala News state its impartial, independent credentials. But look closely and there's a theme: stories with a distinctly pro-Russian angle, many virtually identical to those seen on Russian state media the same day.  Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its posts began to gain traction. Here's an example: on 10 March 2022, Russian state TV aired a bizarre, and completely fictitious, story claiming the US was using birds as bioweapons, to distribute deadly diseases as they flew into Russia. That afternoon, the story was translated and published on Russian state-backed networks Sputnik Arabic and Russia Today (RT) Arabic. Two hours later, it was posted as a video on Yala News's Facebook page - with some of the wording identical. The bio-bird story is just one. Working with disinformation specialists over the course of a year, the BBC monitored Yala News's most-viewed videos and found that nearly all of its stories could be traced back to Kremlin-owned and pro-Kremlin news sites. These include fake stories claiming the Bucha massacre was staged, President Zelensky was 'drunk' in a video addressing Ukraine, and Ukrainian soldiers have been fleeing the frontline. All of these originated in Russian state media, followed a few hours later by videos of the same stories on Yala News. 'Information laundering' Belén Carrasco Rodríguez, who researches Russian influence operations for the Centre for Information Resilience in the UK, says Yala News is acting as a ""Kremlin loudspeaker"" in the Middle East. She says the timeframe and similarities in their stories suggest Yala could be ""information laundering"" for Russia: pumping out propaganda through a third party so it doesn't look like it's from the Kremlin. It's something Russia's been known to do in the past. ""Because of Yala's popularity [with] Arabic audiences, Kremlin-affiliated sources might be using it to spread their interests,"" she says. Ruarigh Thornton, from cyber security firm Protection Group International, says information laundering is becoming increasingly common, as people are more aware of Russian state-sponsored media.  ""The idea is to 'wash' slightly inauthentic narratives into the mainstream. By hiring something like a digital marketing firm to produce this type of content for them, the information appears to be totally disconnected from Russia, and can then move organically in the real world,"" he says. Fake reviews Yala News is part of Yala Group, which describes itself as a ""company working in the field of visual production on social networking sites"". But the rest of the operation doesn't appear as slick as its social sites. Yala Group's website consists mainly of dummy text and stock photos. Most of its five star reviews on Facebook look fake, written on the same dates by the same accounts from south east Asia, where paid-for Facebook reviews are known to be big business. Two typical reviews describe Yala News as ""neutral, objective and professional"" and ""a wonderful, honest, transparent and purposeful news platform"". Moustafa Ayad, from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, disagrees: ""It reeks of well-coordinated behaviour,"" he says. He believes the fact that Yala News publishes so many bespoke videos every day, each following the same format, could cost tens of thousands of dollars. Yala Group is registered in the UK. Its address in Bloomsbury, central London, is shared with more than 65,000 other companies, 12,000 of which are active. But the company has no staff or physical offices there. We suspected Yala was operating out of Syria, a country devastated by civil conflict, whose ruler Bashar al-Assad is a long-time ally of Russia. Russia has provided arms for pro-Assad forces during 12 years of civil war. Using local knowledge and geolocation techniques, we sourced Facebook photos showing the team and its offices to a leafy Damascus suburb. Most of their social profiles say they're based in the Syrian capital. A former employee confirmed it. Yala's clients include pro-regime Syrian celebrities and journalists. This picture shows state TV reporter Shadi Halwi, a client of Yala Group, posing with sanctioned Syrian businessmen, the Katerji brothers. Mr Halwi owns a radio station which is funded by the Katerjis. Another Yala client is Sham FM, a pro-regime radio station that has aired programmes made by Sputnik Arabic, part of Russia's state radio network. Syrian media experts at BBC Monitoring say pro-government, private media outlets are ""often owned by business figures with close links to the political and military establishment."" Experts suggest the UK registration could be to avoid Yala being seen as run from a sanctioned country, which would allow it to build business relationships with platforms like Facebook's parent company Meta.  In fact, the owner of one of Yala Group's Facebook pages recently posted about becoming an official Meta 'Business Partner', meaning its social media marketing services come recommended.  When we approached Meta, they denied this. They said they requested that Yala remove all references to being a Meta 'Business Partner'. So, who is behind Yala News? We tracked down Yala's CEO Ahmad Moemna, a Syrian businessman living in Dubai.  ""Yala Group is a UK-based company,"" he told the BBC. ""We have more than 500 clients including public figures, artists and talent. We do not have employees in London yet, but we could in the near future."" We asked him about the pro-Kremlin videos on Yala News. He said: ""Yala News content is not biased. Whether Syria or Russia or anything else, we respect impartiality."" Then, we asked if his business received funding from the Russian or Syrian governments.  ""I am the only funder and founder of Yala and no-one can influence me,"" he said. We asked Companies House about the UK registration. A spokesperson said they ""don't comment on individual companies"" and have ""no legal powers to verify or validate the information which is delivered."" A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, said it works with third-party fact-checkers to fight the spread of misinformation on its platforms.  We also contacted the Russian and Syrian governments to ask if they had a relationship with Yala News, but did not receive a response to our allegations.

Yield Spread Analysis,"UK unready as wildfires surge, warn firefighters",2024-09-14,2023-09-29,By Malcolm Prior,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66948836,"The UK is ""woefully underprepared"" to tackle wildfires as climate change makes them more likely, a new report by the Fire Brigades Union warns. There were more than 44,000 wildfires last year - an increase of 72% on the previous year, according to government figures out this month. Union chiefs say the government and the National Fire Chiefs Council have failed to develop a national strategy. The government said it was ensuring services have the resources needed. A spokesperson for the NFCC said it ""has consistently made clear to government and fire service partners that the impact of climate change will continue to put huge pressure on fire and rescue services in the years ahead"". Climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. Extreme and long-lasting heat like that seen in the UK in the summer of 2022 draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) report found understaffing meant fire services tackling recent wildfires have had to leave fire engines sitting idle in stations and call in off-duty staff to work extra shifts, while firefighters at the scene were ""worked to exhaustion"".  It estimates that 12,000 firefighter jobs have been lost since 2010. Matt Wrack, the FBU's general secretary, said: ""We need urgent climate action. If we are to properly protect life and property from wildfires, the fire and rescue service needs significant investment. ""This means more firefighters, better equipped and trained, along with better planning, research and coordination."" The latest government report on the number of fires last year found an ""exceptional increase"" in outdoor blazes that ""can be linked to the hot, dry summer"". In July 2022, there were 21,246 outdoor fires - nearly trebling the previous July's figure. Wildfires included a number on the ""urban-rural interface"", where the countryside meets homes, the report said. It has also been estimated that, on and around 19 July 2022, around 95 buildings were destroyed including 16 homes in Wennington, in the London borough of Havering. A major incident review released this July, after a Freedom of Information request by the BBC, found firefighter shortages meant 39 fire engines were not available to attend wildfires that burnt across London that day. The FBU is now calling for a UK-wide wildfire strategy for fire and rescue services that sets national standards.  It said that, at present, there is a ""postcode lottery of wildfire response"".  Better recruitment and retention of retained firefighters in rural areas is needed, it added, and greater central government investment in training, crew numbers and PPE - including the introduction of body-worn physiological monitors for firefighters and specialist respiratory protection. The Home Office said that overall, fire and rescue authorities are receiving £2.6bn during 2023/24 and it was down to each authority how that money was spent. Every authority also has to have a plan in place which sets out how they intend to respond to foreseeable risks in their area, including wildfires. A spokeswoman said the department was working closely with both the NFCC and the England and Wales Wildfire Forum, a multi-agency body, to ""continue to improve our response to wildfires and reduce their impact"". The NFCC said it was ""extremely proud of the fantastic, professional response of UK firefighters and 999 control staff in tackling wildfires and protecting local communities"". It said it would continue to ensure all future funding decisions are ""fully informed by, and reflect, the current and future risks that fire services face, including the growing effects of climate change and the impact of wildfires, flooding and other events""."
Yield Spread Analysis,How fast is the coronavirus growing in the UK?,2024-09-14,2020-03-28,By Robert Cuffe & Christine Jeavans,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52056111,"Deaths and confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK have been doubling every three days, and on Friday the country experienced its biggest increase in deaths so far. Models of the epidemic give very different estimates of its potential final death toll, from tens of thousands to one published on Friday that projected a figure of below 7,000. So how to make sense of the projections, and what do the patterns of coronavirus deaths in other countries tell us about what could come next in the UK?  Confirmed cases in the UK are doubling every three or four days. Deaths are growing faster, doubling every two or three days. This data doesn't show all cases, just the confirmed ones. That's because testing is mainly only carried out on those ill enough to be hospitalised, not those with mild symptoms, and so the true number of cases is higher.  Experts in the field would expect those wider cases to also follow a similar pattern: doubling every few days. That's because viruses multiply and so do the numbers of people infected by them. They keep multiplying at a constant rate until they run out of people to infect or measures to slow the spread take effect. It's hard to see this constant multiplication from the chart above, but easier to see if you plot the same figures on a different scale.  On the scale shown below, a straight line means ""doubling at a constant speed"".  We have added dotted guide lines on the chart to show what might be expected if cases or deaths were doubling every two or three days. In reality, doubling speeds often fluctuate until an epidemic reaches a big enough number, say 100 cases. Since that point, confirmed cases in the UK have doubled every 3.3 days.  Thankfully, there haven't been enough deaths in the UK yet for us to draw a settled trend from 100, so our trend line starts from 10.  At the moment, deaths are growing faster than confirmed cases, doubling every 2.5 days.  As of 27 March, the UK has seen 759 deaths. If the speed of doubling continued, we would expect to see another 750 deaths in the following three days and 1,500 in the 2.5 days after that. But is that speed faster or slower in the UK than in other countries?  Italy has the most advanced epidemic in Europe, with the most confirmed cases and the most deaths.  On average, the number of deaths in Italy has doubled every three days, but that masks rapid growth for the first 1,000 deaths followed by a slower pace of growth, suggesting that the course of the epidemic is changing. In other European countries, the early numbers of deaths are also following that pattern of doubling every two to three days.  One notable exception is Spain, where the number of deaths does appear to be rising faster than elsewhere (every two-and-a-quarter days) well past their 1,000 death, although it is unclear why.  Does that mean the UK is only a few weeks behind a peak like Italy's? Not necessarily. Each country has a different healthcare system and is taking different measures to control the spread of the virus. The number of deaths depends both on the spread of the virus and the treatment that people can access when they have it.  The future in each country will depend on the actions governments and citizens take.  Analysis by Rachel Schraer, health reporter A paper released on Friday projected that fewer than 7,000 people would die of coronavirus in the UK in total. This figure is much lower than that in the modelling used by government.   So where did they get their numbers from? To get to these projections, Prof Tom Pike used the trajectory of death numbers in China to predict the progress of the UK and other countries' outbreaks.  But experts in viruses and epidemics have cautioned against assuming that countries will follow the same trajectory, even if there are similarities in early figures from each country.  There are some things that will be the same the world over like how long the virus takes to become infectious in someone's body. But how an outbreak develops after that depends on what measures countries take and when they act, and China brought in restrictions sooner than many other countries.  Small changes in the infection rate add up over time to big reductions in the number of new infections. Scientists expect that each infected person will infect about 2.5 other people on average. As each of them infect another 2.5 and so on, a month multiplying at that pace leads to more than 400 new infections.  Halving that infection rate means that after a month, we'd expect to see just 15 new infections - a 95% reduction. That's because a small difference in the infection rate builds and builds to make a big difference in the number of people becoming infected.  The path of the epidemic in China and South Korea show how it is possible to slow the spread. China implemented severe lockdowns in Wuhan and Hubei province late in January before they saw 30 deaths. At that point, the epidemic was growing rapidly. About 10 days later, the number of deaths started to decelerate, slowing down to doubling every three days, and now growing far slower than that.  The total number of deaths has kept rising, but the number of new deaths each day has slowed and eventually shrunk.  South Korea and Japan never saw the same growth in deaths as other countries. They consistently grew at a slower rate, taking over a week to double.  South Korea rapidly began testing and tracing at scale, using almost 30 hospitals where suspected or confirmed cases could be isolated.  Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, who developed the modelling used by the government, says it takes time before any measures, such as social distancing, have an effect.  People are infected, incubate the virus, develop symptoms, worsen and require hospital treatment before they get confirmed as carrying the virus. After that, it takes time before a case reaches the stage where intensive care is needed and then succeeds or someone dies.  The number of confirmed cases can give a hint earlier, since it takes less time to reach testing than the outcome of death.  It's only a hint, since changes in testing policy or capacity can change the number of confirmed cases.  But Prof Colin Baigent of the University of Oxford says the evidence is that lockdowns are working. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Could these beautiful islands help stop killer diseases?,2024-09-14,2018-11-14,By Prof James Logan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46077299,"Travellers to the remote African islands of Bijagos can expect to find a tropical paradise of pristine beaches and lush rainforest. But the islands are not just beautiful. They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases. A collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions. They also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot. But these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower. Malaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems. However, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them.  Medical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands. The reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness.  While this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease. The islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites.  On the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect. An island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made. While there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments.  There are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness. Trachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation.  The disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease.  Dr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission.  Inner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present.  This might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination.  If the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community. The results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it.  Not only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world.  Trachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled. Our current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.   Given the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease.  Worryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides.  This means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed.  More like this A new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites. Past treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan. In this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the ""intervention"" islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the ""control"" islands, will not.  A team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria.  They have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands.  Whether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen.  Either way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands.  Every study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research.  On the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population.  The LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere. About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. The two-year study towards infectious disease elimination on the Bijagos Islands was funded by UK Research and Innovation.

Yield Spread Analysis,'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser',2024-09-14,2020-03-31,By Megha Mohan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52063755,"With much of the world on coronavirus lockdown, there are warnings that those living with domestic abuse could become hidden victims of the pandemic. In the UK, calls to the national abuse hotline went up by 65% this weekend, according to the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales. Meanwhile, the UN has warned that women in poorer countries and smaller homes are likely to have fewer ways to report abuse. The BBC has spoken to two women who are currently under lockdown with men who they say have abused them.  This interview was conducted the day before India announced a 21-day complete lockdown in order to curb the spread of coronavirus. Geeta wakes up at 5am, her husband is lying next to her on the floor. He's snoring loudly.  The previous night he had come home drunk and upset. The coronavirus outbreak meant fewer people were using public transport, so as an autowallah, or rickshaw driver, Vijay's income had dropped from 1,500 rupees a day (just over £16), to 700 rupees a day. ""How many days will be like this?"" he'd shouted, throwing a bottle of the spirit he'd been drinking against the wall. Geeta's children scrambled behind her for shelter.  Thankfully, Vijay climbed onto the small mattress the whole family share and fell asleep soon after his outburst.  ""It took a while to calm the children,"" says Geeta. ""They've seen their father angry many times in their life but the past few weeks it has been worse. They've seen him throw things against the wall and pull me by the hair.""  Geeta's husband has hit her more times than she can remember, the first time on their wedding night. She tried to leave him once, but he wouldn't let her take the children.  They live in a low-income neighbourhood, called a mohalla, in a rural area.  On a typical day she would walk a kilometre to the nearest well to fetch water for the day. Once she had taken it home, she'd chat with neighbours waiting for the grocer to arrive with his cart of vegetables.  After buying the household food for the day, Geeta would start preparing breakfast. Her husband would leave at around 7am, returning for lunch and a nap, leaving again after the two older children returned from school.  ""But things changed when the school closed on the 14th,"" she says. ""Then the children were home constantly and they began to irritate my husband. ""Usually he saves his anger for me, but he has begun to yell at them for minor things like leaving a cup on the floor. I then say something to divert his attention so he can be angry at me, but the more time we are together, the less I can think of to distract him."" Geeta had a plan. While her husband was at work, and after cleaning the house, she would walk to a nondescript office building just outside the neighbourhood. There she used to attend a secret class set up by community organisers where women learn to sew, read and write.  Geeta wants to get enough skills to be financially independent and move out with her children. At the class, she also met with counsellors who are trained to help domestic violence victims.  But India's 21-day lockdown, which began on 24 March, has put a stop to this. The classes have ended and it's impossible for community counsellors to visit vulnerable women.  Vimlesh Solanki, a volunteer for a Sambhali Trust, an organisation that supports women in Jodhpur, the second largest city in Rajasthan, says coronavirus has put women in danger. ""A complete lockdown means every day is completely disturbed. There are now no local grocers with carts so they need to travel further to the supermarket for food every day.  ""Stressful situations like this means that there are more things that trigger their already abusive partners."" Kai got out her phone and typed slowly. ""Mom wants me to stay with you."" She pressed send. A reply came quickly: ""That's fine."" Last week, the teenager stepped back inside the house she vowed she would never enter again. ""The second I walked back in my brain shut down,"" she says softly. ""Everything turned off, every feeling."" She had moved back in with her father, the man who she says physically and sexually abused her for years. Two weeks ago Kai thought coronavirus was something that would blow over with a passing news cycle. Then things changed. The staff at the shop where her mother worked were getting restless. News that the virus had crossed shores, spread to more than 170 countries and now reached New York, was making people nervous.  Working at a shop meant interacting with customers on a daily basis.  Kai's mum and her co-workers worried about contact with the customers, but they didn't have to worry for long. The shop announced it would close indefinitely and staff would be made redundant.  Kai's mother lost her $15-an-hour (£12) job and was told she would only have health insurance for five days. It began to take a toll on Kai's mother, who had suffered from mental health challenges most of Kai's life. ""She had an episode,"" says Kai. ""She shouted 'things are crazy here, you should go to your dad's house'"".  The words sent a cold pang of distress through Kai's veins. She retreated to her room, hoping that if she gave her mother some time things may blow over. But when she returned downstairs her mother simply said: ""Why are you still here?"" It was only a few months since Kai had started therapy for the years of physical and sexual abuse she had experienced with her father. She says he had abused her since she was a toddler. She still hadn't confided the full extent of the abuse to her mother and sister.  It was early days, but Kai says the therapy was helping her and she felt more in control. She was feeling more hopeful for the future. Then the shelter where she saw her therapist announced that the coronavirus outbreak meant it had to close. And last week, she moved back in with her father. ""He's here the whole time,"" she whispers, ""during the day he watches TV on his computer in the living room. At night I hear him watching porn."" She knows he's awake when she hears him making his breakfast smoothie. ""I hate it so much, it's so loud, the sound of the blender petrifies me. It's the start of my day, when I have to be vigilant."" Kai hasn't slept much since she moved back in, her door doesn't have a lock.  There was a routine to the physical abuse, it happened only when Kai did something to upset him. So she plans to stay out of his way and now only leaves her room to run to the bathroom and make herself something to eat in the kitchen.  The last time they were stuck together the house lost power and the abuse was particularly bad.  ""He acts like we are living through a strange time in history, but doesn't mention anything about the abuse,"" she says. ""That makes me feel like I'm going crazy. He hasn't done anything yet but the anticipation is killing me."" Kai spends all day online. Recently she's been watching YouTube video essays on movies. She enjoys watching analysis of films she's never seen.  She hopes that her mother will let her come back soon, or the coronavirus outbreak ends and she can find somewhere else to live. Nicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales says police are ready to deal with a spike in domestic abuse calls.  ""We're trying to make sure people realise that the police are anticipating that domestic abuse will increase, that they're planning for that,"" she told the BBC. ""And they're very clear that these are prioritised calls. So you can make silent 999 calls by waiting for the call handler to pick up making some kind of a cough or any sound at all, and pressing 5,5."" She added that women with insecure immigration status should have ""all barriers removed, without fear of deportation, when reporting violence at this time"", with more funding for key workers in refuges. She also called for workers in social care and within specialist services to receive protective equipment during the virus outbreak. This is a sentiment echoed by Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women, who told the BBC that there's an urgent need for people working with vulnerable women to be given protective clothing. ""What we need is funding for field workers with PPE to reach communities and check in on vulnerable women. This needs to be a priority and there needs to be urgent global government funding for this."" She said that unlike the US and the UK, where national abuse hotlines have seen increased calls, the opposite will likely be the case in more developing countries. ""It is impossible for women from lower socio-economic backgrounds, in several countries, to report cases of domestic violence as they are living in one or two room homes with their abusers.  ""It was only in the months after the worst of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa where we learned of increases in gender-based violence at home."" Meanwhile, Ms Jacobs says now is the time for a proactive approach to dealing with domestic abuse in the UK.  ""We've heard about these vast amounts of people who are recruited to be NHS volunteers. We need to make sure that they have the information they need to spot domestic violence because they will be our eyes and ears out and about in the community."" The names of the two women have been changed. Illustrations by James Mobbs Translations by Rohan Nair Video edit by Yousef Eldin"
Yield Spread Analysis,'Deano' and Falcons a perfect match?,2024-09-14,2018-05-18,Matt Newsum,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/44101203,"Brains and brawn: Dave Walder and Dean Richards have given Falcons silk and steel in their squad Aviva Premiership semi-final - Exeter Chiefs v Newcastle Falcons Venue: Sandy Park Date: Saturday, 19 May Kick-off: 15:30 BST Coverage: Updates on BBC local radio and live scores on the BBC Sport website When Dean Richards took over at Newcastle Falcons in the summer of 2012, both parties were at a crossroads. After the Falcons enjoyed Premiership success in the early years of professionalism, the glories of the late 1990s were faded memories. Years of battling to avoid the drop had taken their toll, and the inaugural champions were to start that season in the Championship after relegation. Richards - huge in both reputation and stature as a player and coach - had been to the heights of multiple European successes with Leicester and turned Harlequins from a Championship outfit to a top-flight contender. However, the scandal of 'Bloodgate' - using a blood capsule to facilitate a tactical substitution in which he hoped to gain an advantage - saw him sacked by Quins and disgraced, bringing his career to a shuddering halt. Alone, both Newcastle and Richards were in the doldrums. But together they have blossomed; reinvigorated and reborn. On the eve of the club's first play-off semi-final in Premiership history, BBC Sport looks at the factors behind the Falcons' flight of fantasy. Team news and preview: Exeter v Newcastle Richards and Goneva win Premiership prizes This year's success saw Richards collect the Premiership director of rugby of the year prize, while winger Vereniki Goneva won player of the year - reward for the tangible improvement made across the board. Richards' 'Midas touch' at Newcastle was not an immediate one, but the measured overhaul of the club has been patient. The 54-year-old arrived with trusted lieutenant John Wells - a colleague from his England and Leicester days - and their combination made Falcons a tougher proposition, building a close-knit culture and team ethic. Adding the craft to their graft was achieved by the addition of former England, Falcons and Wasps fly-half Dave Walder. The 40-year-old has been an inspired appointment since his return to Tyneside in 2014, was promoted to head coach last summer and has helped deliver a playing style that has entertained and brought success in equal measure. More wins, more try bonus points and a higher league position all coincided with Dave Walder's appointment Having the confidence to delegate and allow others to take control comes with experience, and Richards takes more of an overview of the club. ""As a player I was unconventional,"" Richards told BBC Radio 5 live. ""As a director of rugby I still am a little bit. But there are boundaries you don't cross. ""Those boundaries are less and less in terms of coaching or director of rugby style. I'm very different to most. I'm not a hands-on style, but a steering the ship style. ""There's a lot of pushing and shoving from behind."" Richards has also ensured there is a continuity and a relevance to the personnel, with another ex-Falcon in scrum coach Micky Ward and lock Scott McLeod taking responsibility for the line-outs. Analysis - Chris Jones, BBC rugby union reporter Richards last won the director of rugby award in 2001 when in charge of Leicester, so the fact he is scooping it almost two decades later is a sign of his remarkable longevity and his ability to reinvent his squads, and himself as a coach. Much like when he was at Harlequins, Richards has overseen a long-term plan at Newcastle, with canny recruitment and sensible delegation two of his many strengths. Richards insists the England job is not for him; the Rugby Football Union may always wonder what might have been. Matthew Burke was a megastar, but even he could not bring Falcons the success they enjoy now Featuring an alumni that includes England World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson, Australia full-back Matthew Burke and New Zealand front-rower Carl Hayman to name but three, it is not as if Newcastle fans have been forced to accept second-best in terms of players over the past 20 years. However, not even those legends of the game have triggered the same success as the current crop at Kingston Park. Season-by-season improvement has made the Falcons a far more attractive prospect, while the Richards effect is still a draw for top players. ""We're confident in what we're doing, we're confident in training, our analysis, our preparation and that brings a more relaxed feel,"" England international Mark Wilson told BBC Newcastle. ""We know we're in good hands and everyone's mucking in and doing their jobs. ""If you look after what you do and what you bring to the club, we all come together and reap the rewards."" The mix of home-grown talents such as Wilson, recent England call-up Gary Graham and Chris Harris have dovetailed beautifully with carefully selected imports - Sinoti Sinoti, Goneva and scrum-half Sonatane Takulua. Last summer also saw the shrewd capture of 'local-boy done good' Toby Flood, who having progressed his career away from Newcastle with giants Leicester, returned from a stint with Toulouse to guide the Falcons. ""You have to buy into Dean,"" ex-England winger Ugo Monye told BBC Sport's Rugby Union Weekly podcast. ""You might not be his best mate. You have to put your ego to one side, he doesn't want to get on with everyone and he shouldn't. ""He's so cocksure about what he wants to do, but he gets results."" Already lined up for next season are Leicester's ball-carrying prop Logovi'i Mulipola and London Irish centre Jonny Williams, as Richards continues to tinker and upgrade the player pool. Vereniki Goneva's Alan Shearer celebration at St James' Park was one of the enduring memories of the season Not only are Flood and Goneva elite players with international experience, but they also came from winning cultures and have spread that winning mentality throughout the squad. This campaign has seen Falcons break records on and off the pitch, with more than 30,000 fans attending a regular-season game at Newcastle United's St James' Park and the securing of Champions Cup rugby before their top-four efforts which ensured a highest finish in 20 years. Their victory at Leicester in the penultimate game was Newcastle's first at Welford Road in 21 years, fuelled by belief they can match anyone in the Premiership elite. ""It's winning the big games, being competitive in the big matches,"" Richards told BBC Newcastle. ""We're doing that, we've shown we can beat the big sides from Exeter to Northampton, but ultimately we have to beat Wasps and Saracens."" As much as Richards puts belief into his players, there is also the element of his personality, his will to win, that has another effect on the people under his management. ""He does instil a fear factor which does get the best out of not just the players, but the video analysts, the physio,"" Monye said. ""If the physio says two weeks, Dean will be wanting him back in a week. ""He is always pushing the envelope, perhaps that was some of his downfall - look at 'Bloodgate'. He'll forever be remembered for that, and I hope that's not the defining moment in his career. ""It shouldn't be the defining moment, because he's done so many good things."" Semore Kurdi (left) helped take Newcastle to Philadelphia to face Saracens in a showcase league game Richards, Flood, Goneva - all key facets to the Falcons' revival, but none of whom would be at Newcastle if were not for the impact of owner Semore Kurdi. Little is known about the 'Geordie Jordanian', who established his business in the north east but has remained anonymous as the club he bankrolls charged up the Premiership table. He has been helped by Richards' rugby union nous and the business expertise of former Wigan rugby league chief executive Mick Hogan in off-the-field matters. Kurdi's intervention when Dave Thompson sought to sell the club in 2011 has coincided with the Falcons' upturn. Plans are in place for a new stand at the North Terrace of the ground, as the off-field side of the business seeks to keep pace with their on-field counterparts. ""It probably wouldn't have survived if the truth be known,"" Richards told BBC Radio 5 live. ""The club was on its last legs and you only have to look at the renovations within the club and the way the club is going to understand it's gone a long way.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Germany 'winner' Popp conquering Euros heartache,2024-09-14,2022-07-30,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62333465,"This video can not be played 'You could not make this up!' - Popp heads Germany back into lead When England face Germany in the European Championship final on Sunday, one player in particular will feel relief at just being at the Wembley showpiece. In the lead up to the event, veteran German captain Alexandra Popp, 31, almost saw her wretched injury curse strike again. The Wolfsburg striker's Euro 2013 dream was wrecked because of ankle ligament damage and she had to watch from the sidelines as her team-mates lifted the trophy. She missed the tournament again four years later with a knee problem. Then, last April, she suffered a serious knee injury which kept her out for 11 months, only returning in March, and she would have missed the tournament once more had it not been postponed because of the pandemic. But she has returned to action stronger than ever - even testing positive for Covid three weeks before the start could not keep her out of the team this time. England-Germany final will be 'a football feast' How to watch the final on the BBC This video can not be played 'Popp is a threat' - Bright relishes facing Germany forward While she has a fearsome reputation on the pitch, off it the striker is a relaxed presence around the team. Wolfsburg team-mate Pia-Sophie Wolter told BBC Sport ""Poppi"" - as she is affectionately known - is someone who is ""very open"" with everybody and is ""always joking around"". Wolter said: ""As we were doing rehab together she would spread her good mood and put on Disney songs in our gym every Friday. Singing along to all of them - a great talent of hers. ""The same goes for her mentality, somebody who is throwing herself in every ball, really giving 100%. The team is always at the forefront. ""When you are standing on the pitch with her, she is a player who lifts you up, keeps you going and is an absolute leader. She is someone you really enjoy playing in the same team with."" Alexandra Popp helped Wolfsburg win the DFB Cup final in May after returning from injury Popp has seen it all - winners' medals from the Champions League, Bundesliga, U20 World Cup and Olympic Games are all stacked in her trophy cabinet. However, triumphing at the Euros remains elusive but she looks determined to make up for lost time this year. The 31-year-old didn't start the opener against Denmark, but came off the bench to net an 86th-minute goal in the 4-0 thrashing of Denmark. She has been undroppable since, with further strikes against Spain and Finland in the group stages, against Austria in the quarter-finals and a double in the semi-final with France. Former France defender Laura Georges said on BBC One: ""You can see that every time she scores, everyone is around her because they know she has been struggling. ""She is such an important player on and off the field and people are so happy to see her score. She is lifting this team."" Former England international Fara Williams added: ""Alex Popp was waiting for her moment in this tournament. ""She wasn't even in the starting XI in the opening game. It came down to an injury and a substitution. She came on, scored that fourth goal and took her chance. ""That is what players that are hungry do, that is what winners do and Popp is a winner, she has been renowned for that over the years."" This video can not be played Analysis: Alexandra Popp's goals from Germany's semi-final win over France Two people who know all about Popp's qualities having faced her as an opponent are Scotland defender Jen Beattie and former England international Anita Asante. Playing for Swedish side FC Rosengard, Asante was part of a team which conceded two goals to Popp during a Champions League quarter-final with Wolfsburg.  ""That still haunts me to this day,"" Asante told Radio 5 Live's Daily Euros podcast. ""When you see her on the pitch, she is an intimidating figure. ""She's lethal in the air. I don't know if many people really can understand how good she is in the air. Her aerial ability, the power, the leap that she has, and her ability to use her physicality - that's one of her super strengths."" Former England defender Anita Asante didn't enjoy her meeting with Alexandra Popp in the Champions League quarter-finals Beattie, who has faced Popp as an Arsenal player, picked out the German's clever movement as one of her key assets. ""Popp doesn't necessarily run you down for 90 minutes, but she'll pick those intelligent moments to do it. She sniffs out that moment when you're hesitant."" Popp put in a match-winning performance against France to take Germany through to their ninth Euros final, while also becoming the first player ever to score in five consecutive games at the tournament by netting twice in the 2-1 victory. Her first goal was a sublime volley, outmuscling French right-back Eve Perisset, before scoring the winner with a thumping header, rising above the towering centre-half Wendie Renard to power home. However, German football journalist Annika Becker says she offers more than just her goal threat. ""She's very important for the team as a team player. She's got great vision, with her passing and build-up play. That's not mentioned enough about her."" And for Popp it's all about the team prize this Sunday, despite her being tied in the race for the Golden Boot, along with England's Beth Mead on six goals apiece. ""The Golden Boot is not my priority - my priority is to win the Euros. If I have the chance to crown the title with that achievement, it would be nice. But if it doesn't happen, then I'll still be happy.""

Yield Spread Analysis,'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser',2024-09-14,2020-03-31,By Megha Mohan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52063755,"With much of the world on coronavirus lockdown, there are warnings that those living with domestic abuse could become hidden victims of the pandemic. In the UK, calls to the national abuse hotline went up by 65% this weekend, according to the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales. Meanwhile, the UN has warned that women in poorer countries and smaller homes are likely to have fewer ways to report abuse. The BBC has spoken to two women who are currently under lockdown with men who they say have abused them.  This interview was conducted the day before India announced a 21-day complete lockdown in order to curb the spread of coronavirus. Geeta wakes up at 5am, her husband is lying next to her on the floor. He's snoring loudly.  The previous night he had come home drunk and upset. The coronavirus outbreak meant fewer people were using public transport, so as an autowallah, or rickshaw driver, Vijay's income had dropped from 1,500 rupees a day (just over £16), to 700 rupees a day. ""How many days will be like this?"" he'd shouted, throwing a bottle of the spirit he'd been drinking against the wall. Geeta's children scrambled behind her for shelter.  Thankfully, Vijay climbed onto the small mattress the whole family share and fell asleep soon after his outburst.  ""It took a while to calm the children,"" says Geeta. ""They've seen their father angry many times in their life but the past few weeks it has been worse. They've seen him throw things against the wall and pull me by the hair.""  Geeta's husband has hit her more times than she can remember, the first time on their wedding night. She tried to leave him once, but he wouldn't let her take the children.  They live in a low-income neighbourhood, called a mohalla, in a rural area.  On a typical day she would walk a kilometre to the nearest well to fetch water for the day. Once she had taken it home, she'd chat with neighbours waiting for the grocer to arrive with his cart of vegetables.  After buying the household food for the day, Geeta would start preparing breakfast. Her husband would leave at around 7am, returning for lunch and a nap, leaving again after the two older children returned from school.  ""But things changed when the school closed on the 14th,"" she says. ""Then the children were home constantly and they began to irritate my husband. ""Usually he saves his anger for me, but he has begun to yell at them for minor things like leaving a cup on the floor. I then say something to divert his attention so he can be angry at me, but the more time we are together, the less I can think of to distract him."" Geeta had a plan. While her husband was at work, and after cleaning the house, she would walk to a nondescript office building just outside the neighbourhood. There she used to attend a secret class set up by community organisers where women learn to sew, read and write.  Geeta wants to get enough skills to be financially independent and move out with her children. At the class, she also met with counsellors who are trained to help domestic violence victims.  But India's 21-day lockdown, which began on 24 March, has put a stop to this. The classes have ended and it's impossible for community counsellors to visit vulnerable women.  Vimlesh Solanki, a volunteer for a Sambhali Trust, an organisation that supports women in Jodhpur, the second largest city in Rajasthan, says coronavirus has put women in danger. ""A complete lockdown means every day is completely disturbed. There are now no local grocers with carts so they need to travel further to the supermarket for food every day.  ""Stressful situations like this means that there are more things that trigger their already abusive partners."" Kai got out her phone and typed slowly. ""Mom wants me to stay with you."" She pressed send. A reply came quickly: ""That's fine."" Last week, the teenager stepped back inside the house she vowed she would never enter again. ""The second I walked back in my brain shut down,"" she says softly. ""Everything turned off, every feeling."" She had moved back in with her father, the man who she says physically and sexually abused her for years. Two weeks ago Kai thought coronavirus was something that would blow over with a passing news cycle. Then things changed. The staff at the shop where her mother worked were getting restless. News that the virus had crossed shores, spread to more than 170 countries and now reached New York, was making people nervous.  Working at a shop meant interacting with customers on a daily basis.  Kai's mum and her co-workers worried about contact with the customers, but they didn't have to worry for long. The shop announced it would close indefinitely and staff would be made redundant.  Kai's mother lost her $15-an-hour (£12) job and was told she would only have health insurance for five days. It began to take a toll on Kai's mother, who had suffered from mental health challenges most of Kai's life. ""She had an episode,"" says Kai. ""She shouted 'things are crazy here, you should go to your dad's house'"".  The words sent a cold pang of distress through Kai's veins. She retreated to her room, hoping that if she gave her mother some time things may blow over. But when she returned downstairs her mother simply said: ""Why are you still here?"" It was only a few months since Kai had started therapy for the years of physical and sexual abuse she had experienced with her father. She says he had abused her since she was a toddler. She still hadn't confided the full extent of the abuse to her mother and sister.  It was early days, but Kai says the therapy was helping her and she felt more in control. She was feeling more hopeful for the future. Then the shelter where she saw her therapist announced that the coronavirus outbreak meant it had to close. And last week, she moved back in with her father. ""He's here the whole time,"" she whispers, ""during the day he watches TV on his computer in the living room. At night I hear him watching porn."" She knows he's awake when she hears him making his breakfast smoothie. ""I hate it so much, it's so loud, the sound of the blender petrifies me. It's the start of my day, when I have to be vigilant."" Kai hasn't slept much since she moved back in, her door doesn't have a lock.  There was a routine to the physical abuse, it happened only when Kai did something to upset him. So she plans to stay out of his way and now only leaves her room to run to the bathroom and make herself something to eat in the kitchen.  The last time they were stuck together the house lost power and the abuse was particularly bad.  ""He acts like we are living through a strange time in history, but doesn't mention anything about the abuse,"" she says. ""That makes me feel like I'm going crazy. He hasn't done anything yet but the anticipation is killing me."" Kai spends all day online. Recently she's been watching YouTube video essays on movies. She enjoys watching analysis of films she's never seen.  She hopes that her mother will let her come back soon, or the coronavirus outbreak ends and she can find somewhere else to live. Nicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales says police are ready to deal with a spike in domestic abuse calls.  ""We're trying to make sure people realise that the police are anticipating that domestic abuse will increase, that they're planning for that,"" she told the BBC. ""And they're very clear that these are prioritised calls. So you can make silent 999 calls by waiting for the call handler to pick up making some kind of a cough or any sound at all, and pressing 5,5."" She added that women with insecure immigration status should have ""all barriers removed, without fear of deportation, when reporting violence at this time"", with more funding for key workers in refuges. She also called for workers in social care and within specialist services to receive protective equipment during the virus outbreak. This is a sentiment echoed by Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women, who told the BBC that there's an urgent need for people working with vulnerable women to be given protective clothing. ""What we need is funding for field workers with PPE to reach communities and check in on vulnerable women. This needs to be a priority and there needs to be urgent global government funding for this."" She said that unlike the US and the UK, where national abuse hotlines have seen increased calls, the opposite will likely be the case in more developing countries. ""It is impossible for women from lower socio-economic backgrounds, in several countries, to report cases of domestic violence as they are living in one or two room homes with their abusers.  ""It was only in the months after the worst of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa where we learned of increases in gender-based violence at home."" Meanwhile, Ms Jacobs says now is the time for a proactive approach to dealing with domestic abuse in the UK.  ""We've heard about these vast amounts of people who are recruited to be NHS volunteers. We need to make sure that they have the information they need to spot domestic violence because they will be our eyes and ears out and about in the community."" The names of the two women have been changed. Illustrations by James Mobbs Translations by Rohan Nair Video edit by Yousef Eldin"
Yield Spread Analysis,'Why I paid for my sons to have the HPV jab',2024-09-14,2019-10-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-49960507,"GP Carolyn Calder has two teenage sons and wanted to ensure they were protected against the cancer-causing human papillomavirus (HPV). A vaccination programme is being introduced for all first year boys in secondary schools in Scotland, but aged 16 and 14 her sons James and Oliver would have missed out. Dr Calder decided to take matters into her own hands and get it for them privately. She told BBC Scotland it gave her ""peace of mind"". She has set-up a private clinic in Glasgow for others who want to pay for the vaccine but believes all teenage boys should be offered it on the NHS. Her view is echoed by experts who have said not offering a catch-up programme for all teenage boys could put thousands of lives at risk. Dr Calder said: ""It became very apparent to me that there was lots of evidence that HPV vaccination is needed in boys as well as girls. ""From 2008, the government has been vaccinating girls for cervical cancer and there's a recognised need for that and the programme has been very successful. ""But what we realised for our boys was that there are other cancers which are also a risk, and they can hopefully be avoided by having the vaccination."" The GP admits that going private is a costly option but for her it was ""worth it"". She said: ""Unfortunately it's not a cheap vaccine. We've done it for both our boys and it's £155 per vaccine. If you are under 15 you need two vaccines but over 15 you need three of them.  ""It gives us peace of mind that hopefully we have done all we can to try and prevent these horrible cancers."" By Lisa Summers, BBC Scotland Health Correspondent The human papillomavirus is commonly spread through intimate contact. Most strains are harmless but in rare cases it can cause cancer.  Links to cervical cancer are well known and that's why an HPV vaccination programme was introduced for girls over a decade ago. Evidence suggests it has dramatically reduced pre-cancerous cells in young women.  But HPV has also been connected to other cancers and has been blamed for a sharp rise in cases of throat cancer. Scotland now has the highest incidence of these cancers in the UK.  From this year S1 boys will be offered the vaccination. But dentists say that a catch up programme should be offered to all secondary school boys in the same way that all teenage girls can get the vaccination for free. They say thousands of boys will be at increased risk.  But that would have cost implications and the Scottish government say the decision was made on UK expert advice. Information packs will soon be sent out to all S1 boys. HPV is a leading cause of throat cancer and in Scotland cases of these cancers have almost trebled in recent years. Professor of dental public health at Glasgow University, David Conway, told BBC Scotland: ""Oropharyngeal cancer, throat cancer, is the most rapidly rising cancer in Scotland, and it's the HPV association that seems to be driving that change."" Dentists also think the decision not to offer a catch-up vaccination programme for older boys is a mistake. Dr David Cross, from the British Dental Association Scotland, said: ""Throat cancer is different in Scotland, there is a much higher rate of throat cancers associated with HPV infection and 75% of them are occurring in men so we think the boys need protection, and rolling out a catch-up programme will mean we can protect an additional 140,000 boys."" The Scottish scientist who invented the HPV vaccine says there is ""no sensible argument"" against universal immunisation of boys and girls in schools. Prof Ian Frazer, who is based at the University of Queensland, has been at the forefront of Australia's immunisation programme since it was launched 2013. In the first year, all 12 to 15-year-old boys received three years' worth of catch-up vaccines. Now, all 12-year-old boys are offered the jab which Prof Frazer says loses effectiveness as boys get older. He told BBC Scotland's John Beattie programme: ""The vaccine has been proven safe in trials worldwide and the only complication we have noticed is a very rare one-in-a-million allergic reaction to the vaccine. ""There is no known downside to vaccination, apart of course from the cost which has to be met somehow. But the upside of saving significant numbers of lives is a real one. And it's an investment, not only for now but for the future, because all these cancers which could occur in the future could be prevented."" Prof Frazer said he believed all parents ""owe it to your son to protect him as you would your daughter"". He added: ""It's more sensible to vaccinate one particular age cohort. It would be sensible to do a catch-up programme if there are sufficient funds available. If not, then the logical thing is just to do 12-year-olds. ""The yield is less for every year past 12 you go. The cost-benefits analysis looks less good for every extra year. And by the time you've got to 17, it's down to a third of the benefit that you get from vaccinating 12-year-olds."" The Scottish government has encouraged all eligible boys to take up the offer of the HPV jab. A spokesman added: ""Vaccination policy in Scotland, as with the rest of the UK, is based on recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. ""The JCVI has not recommended a catch-up approach for the HPV boys programme. Should that change, we will not hesitate to act and extend our programme."" For Dr Calder, the important thing was to ensure her sons were protected and she said other parents who have come to her clinic have become more aware of the potential risks from not having the jab. She said: ""Often these are parents, unfortunately at the moment, who can afford to do it and know about it but the issue isn't as widely known as we'd like. ""As a doctor working for the NHS, you always want to try and provide good health for the whole nation. ""So it would be really good if we could get all boys vaccinated and try and eradicate some of these cancers."""

Yield Spread Analysis,Talks continue over new curbs for parts of England,2024-09-14,2020-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54548522,"Talks are continuing between the government and local leaders over the expansion of the strictest coronavirus restrictions to more parts of England.  Liverpool City Region is the only area in the top tier of restrictions, with pubs and bars not serving meals closed. But Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has said he is meeting the PM's team later to discuss the issue. It comes as it was announced London will move into the second highest tier of restrictions from Saturday. Greater Manchester and Lancashire could be placed under ""very high alert"" - the highest level of restrictions. MPs in Greater Manchester and London are taking part in ministerial calls on Thursday morning.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock will update MPs on the latest measures in a Commons statement later. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the government would still take action to place areas into higher levels of restrictions if local leaders objected to the move, business minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""It's important that we look at how we suppress this virus because the alternative is much worse."" He added: ""Let's wait and see what the health secretary says to Parliament."" Also on the programme, Eamonn O'Brien, leader of Bury Council in Greater Manchester, said officials were ""deeply sceptical"" that Tier 3 would work or that it offered enough financial support to businesses and people affected by the restrictions. He said he had a ""strong impression"" that government will go ahead with the changes later. Earlier, Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson told BBC Breakfast he was ""categorically told"" by the government last weekend that Liverpool City Region would be placed under the highest tier restrictions. ""The fact is that the government will decide who goes into Tier 3 today,"" he said, adding that he expected to see more areas being placed under ""very high alert"" later. Mr Anderson acknowledged that the ""virus is out of control and something has to be done"", but called for ""economic intervention to support people"". In the week up to 11 October, local authority figures showed there were 660 cases per 100,000 people in Liverpool, 466 per 100,000 in Manchester, and up to 135 per 100,000 in London (in Richmond upon Thames).  The average area in England had 89. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert. Most of the country is on medium alert, which means areas are subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas on high alert - including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas on very high alert face extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close.  In a meeting on Wednesday, health officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) suggested that Greater Manchester along with much of north-east and north-west England and parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands should be moved into the top tier.  But the recommendations of the JBC will not necessarily be enforced and discussions are likely to continue between local and national politicians and officials over the coming days. Labour's Mr Burnham said he had a briefing with the deputy chief medical officer for England, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, on Wednesday and was expecting a further meeting with the prime minister's team later.  He has argued against Greater Manchester being put into the top tier, saying that without increased financial support they would prefer a so-called ""circuit-breaker"" - a short, limited lockdown to help bring the virus under control.  Mr Burnham said he would consider a legal challenge if the government placed the area under very high alert, adding such a move would be ""by imposition, not consent"". In contrast, Mr Khan said he would back London moving from tier one to two - but called for a package of financial support, including for businesses struggling under the restrictions, despite being allowed to remain open. A final decision to move Greater Manchester and Lancashire into the highest tier of restrictions is one for politicians - and has not yet been made.  But there is increasing concern about the spread of the virus in both areas - and a growing belief that tougher measures are likely.  Mr Burnham is demanding more support for local businesses, which would be hit hard by a further shutdown of large swathes of hospitality.  Local leaders in Lancashire want more support too - but believe new restrictions are all but inevitable.  There are still decisions to be made - but if agreed - the further restrictions could cover another four million people. And other parts of north-east and north-west England could follow after a recommendation by health officials on Wednesday. Again, that still has to be approved by politicians.  Boris Johnson has defended his three-tier system as the ""right way forward"", saying it would ""avoid the misery of a national lockdown"" - but he did not rule out going further.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is continuing to call for a ""circuit-breaker"". Meanwhile, schools in Northern Ireland will close from Monday and pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday. Wales is preparing to ban people from parts of the UK that have high rates of coronavirus from travelling to the country from 18:00 BST on Friday.  And in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has advised Scots against travelling to high risk areas of England, singling out Blackpool as being linked to ""a large and growing number"" of Covid-19 cases in her country.  On Wednesday, a further 19,724 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 137 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus."
Yield Spread Analysis,The violent solar storms that threaten Earth,2024-09-14,2018-11-22,By Prof Chris Scott,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46260959,"A violent storm on the Sun could cripple communications on Earth and cause huge economic damage, scientists have warned. Why are solar storms such a threat?  In 1972, dozens of sea mines off the coast of Vietnam mysteriously exploded. It was recently confirmed the cause was solar storms, which can significantly disrupt the Earth's magnetic field. Today, the effects of a similar event could be much more serious - disrupting the technology we rely on for everything from satellites to power grids. The cost to the UK economy alone of an unexpected event has been estimated at £16bn.  There are good reasons why we are vulnerable to events taking place millions of miles from Earth. The Sun is a star, a seething mass of electrified hydrogen.  As this fluid moves around, it builds up energy within its complex magnetic field. This magnetic energy is released through intense flashes of light known as solar flares and through vast eruptions of material and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections or solar storms.  While flares can disrupt radio communication on Earth, solar storms pose the greatest threat. Each storm contains the energy equivalent to 100,000 times the world's entire nuclear arsenal, although this is spread throughout an enormous volume in space.  The Sun rotates like a vast spinning firework, launching eruptions into space in all directions.  If one of these heads towards our planet, with a magnetic field aligned opposite to the Earth's, the two fields can merge together. As the solar storm washes past, some of the Earth's magnetic field is distorted into a long tail.  And when this distorted magnetic field eventually snaps back, it accelerates electrified particles towards the Earth. Here, they strike the upper atmosphere, heating it and causing it to glow in a spectacular display known as the northern and southern lights.  But this distortion of the Earth's magnetic field has other, more significant effects. It is thought to have triggered the sea mines back in 1972. The mines were designed to detect small variations in the magnetic field caused by the approach of metal-hulled boats. But their engineers hadn't anticipated that solar activity could have the same effect. Scientists are looking for clues as to what triggers these vast eruptions and, once they have been launched, how to track them through interplanetary space.  Our records of the Earth's magnetic field go back as far as the mid-19th Century.  They suggest an extreme space weather event is likely to occur once every 100 years, although smaller events will happen more frequently. In 1859, the Carrington Event - most extreme solar storm recorded to date - caused telegraph systems to spark and for the northern lights to be spotted as far south as the Bahamas. The next time it happens, the effects are likely to be far more serious. With every solar cycle, our global community has become more reliant on technology. In 2018, space satellites are central to global communication and navigation, while aeroplanes connect continents and extensive power grids crisscross the world.  All of these could be badly affected by the aftermath of extreme solar events.  Electronic systems on spacecraft and aeroplanes could be harmed as their miniaturised electronics are zapped by energetic particles accelerated into our atmosphere, while power networks on the ground can be overwhelmed by excess electrical currents.  More like this Enough satellites and power grids have failed during past space weather events to make it clear that the Sun must be closely monitored, to help predict when a solar storm will affect Earth.  Forecasters are working on this all over the world, from the UK's Met Office to the Australian Met Bureau and the Noaa Space Weather Prediction Center in the US.  All being well, they can detect when a storm is heading towards Earth and predict its arrival time within six hours. That still leaves relatively little time to prepare but forecasting would cut the cost to the UK economy from £16bn to £3bn. Space weather now appears on the UK government's risk register, alongside other, more familiar risks such as a flu pandemic and severe flooding. It has been rated at the equivalent risk as a severe heatwave or the emergence of a new infectious disease.  Government agencies are now speaking to power companies, spacecraft and airline operators to ensure they have plans in place to limit the impact of an extreme space weather event.  It is vital, for example, to make sure enough power is available to refrigerate supplies of food and medicine as well as to make sure water and fuel can be pumped as needed.  If communication with some satellites is lost, familiar technologies such as sat-navs and satellite television could stop working. Spacecraft engineers study extreme events so they can build resilience into spacecraft, protecting vulnerable electronics and installing backup systems.  An accurate space weather forecast would enable operators to further protect their assets by ensuring they were in a safe state as the storm passed.  Many planes fly over the north pole en route from Europe to North America. During space weather events, aircraft operators re-route aeroplanes away from the polar skies, where most of the energetic particles enter Earth's atmosphere.  This is to limit exposure to enhanced radiation doses and ensure reliable radio communication.  We have learned much about space weather since the events of 1972 but as modern technologies evolve, we need to make sure they can withstand the worst the Sun can throw at us.

Yield Spread Analysis,Coronavirus field hospital could open in two weeks,2024-09-14,2020-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52092082,"The Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow could be in operation as a temporary hospital within two weeks, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The emergency facility will be run by the NHS and could have capacity for more than 1,000 patients. The first minister confirmed that six more people with Covid-19 have died in Scotland, bringing the total to 47. A total of 1,563 people were confirmed as having been diagnosed with the virus - up from 1,384 on Sunday. Meanwhile screening programmes for bowel, breast and cervical cancer have been put on hold in a bid to free up capacity in the health services. And 10,000 people have come forward to volunteer to help support services and vulnerable people inside the first four hours of the new Scotland Cares campaign. Exploratory work had been carried out by the army to see if the SEC could be used as a temporary hospital, similar to those being set up in London, Birmingham and Manchester. Ms Sturgeon said work had begun to initially create capacity for 300 extra beds, but that figure could ultimately rise to over 1,000. Ms Sturgeon stressed that ""we might not need to use the exhibition centre"", with 3,000 of the 13,000 hospital beds across Scotland's NHS hospitals currently being kept available for coronavirus patients. However she said it ""makes sense for us to act now to increase hospital capacity further"", with the SEC the ""best option"" for doing this given its proximity to other facilities and transport links. She said the extra beds there would ""initially be for use by those who have been through hospital treatment and are recovering from their symptoms"". Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the emergency facility would be a hospital staffed by and run by the NHS, ""with full clinical and medical infection control standards"". SEC chief executive Peter Duthie said he was ""proud to be in a position to help our NHS"", adding: ""Our teams will support the NHS in the build, security and safe operation of the resource, and continue to express our sincere gratitude for all that they are doing to fight Covid-19."" Work is also ongoing to quadruple the number of intensive care beds in Scotland to 700 - Ms Sturgeon said there were now 108 patients with the virus in intensive care, up 13 from the weekend. Other measures are also being taken to free up capacity in the NHS, with treatments such as knee and hip operations being put off. Ms Sturgeon said ministers had now taken the ""very difficult"" decision to suspend screening programmes for breast, cervical and bowel cancer. Hundreds of thousands of people take part in these screenings each year, but the first minister said it was important to ""maximise"" the ability of the health services to deal with the virus over the coming weeks. The government has also encouraged medical students and retired healthcare staff to volunteer their services to ""plug gaps"" in frontline services. Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood said up to 20% of the health workforce could ultimately have to take time off due to illness. Ms Sturgeon said about 5,000 students or former workers have expressed an interest in filling posts, and said ""many will be offered fixed-term employment"". Two weeks before the expected peak in the virus, NHS Scotland is getting ready. They are freeing up staff for the frontline. That lies behind today's decision to suspend screening programmes.  This will be worrying for some patients and it's a difficult balancing act. Contact with health professionals could spread the disease further but could also store up problems for the future. The decision to announce the SEC in Glasgow as the site of a temporary hospital is also getting more capacity into the system to deal with the coming peak in infections. It's a complex exercise as it's important to keep Covid-19 patients away from others to prevent cross-infection. Within a fortnight the new hospital could be providing 300 extra beds and this could eventually reach 1,000 beds.  The Scottish government say they are making the decision now to act now, even while hoping they won't need to use it. Meanwhile police in Scotland have handed out 25 fixed penalty notices to people who were not complying with social distancing rules. Ms Sturgeon said ""the vast majority of people are doing the right thing to protect themselves and the wider community"", saying that ""by staying at home we can all help slow the spread of this virus and ultimately save lives"". Warning that strict measures could be in place for a long period of time, she added: ""I don't want people to have to comply with these measures for a single day longer than is necessary. ""I want to get back to normal in this country as soon as possible. But we need to keep the measures in place for as long as we judge, based on expert advice, and I and others have to ask the public to stick with them."""
Yield Spread Analysis,US vows strongest ever Iran sanctions,2024-09-14,2018-05-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44200621,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the US is imposing the ""strongest sanctions in history"" on Iran. In a speech in Washington, America's top diplomat said Iran would be ""battling to keep its economy alive"" after the sanctions took effect. His Iranian counterpart said the US was a prisoner of its ""failed policies"" and would suffer the consequences. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump took the US out of the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Mr Pompeo had not demonstrated in his speech how abandoning the deal made the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation. US sanctions lifted after the 2015 deal will be re-imposed, Mr Pompeo said, and those and new measures will together constitute ""unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime"". The older American sanctions prohibited almost all trade with Iran, making some exceptions only for activity ""intended to benefit the Iranian people"" such as the export of medical and agricultural equipment. The secretary of state did not say what new measures Washington was contemplating but he described sanctions imposed last week on the head of Iran's central bank as ""just the beginning"".  Some of Europe's biggest firms who rushed to do business with Iran after the nuclear deal now find themselves forced to choose between investing there or trading with the US. Some of the biggest contracts at risk include: Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, and the export of oil and gas is worth billions of dollars each year. Both the country's oil output and its GDP fell noticeably under international sanctions. The sanctions will not be re-imposed on Tehran immediately but are subject to three-month and six-month wind-down periods. ""Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East,"" Mr Pompeo said. Javad Zarif said America was ""regressing to old habits"". Iran, he added, was working with the other partners of the nuclear deal to find a solution. Ms Mogherini said there was ""no alternative"" to the JCPOA. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent This then is the US ""Plan B"" for Iran - to step up the sanctions pressure, to force the Tehran government into a new diplomatic deal.  It would need to accept broader constraints not just on its nuclear activities but also on its missile programme and wider behaviour in the region.  It is certainly tough but may be totally unrealistic. For sanctions to work they must be comprehensive. The pressure that brought about the JCPOA deal that President Trump has now abandoned was long-standing and widely supported. Now Washington's European allies want to stick with the existing deal. Russia, China and India are unlikely to bow to US pressure. Compelling allies and other countries to abandon trade with Iran risks damaging a whole series of wider diplomatic relationships. Critics may charge that this ""policy"" is impossible - a diplomatic smokescreen intended to cloak a policy whose fundamental goal is regime change in Iran. Read Jonathan's analysis in full Mr Pompeo laid out 12 conditions for any ""new deal"" with Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Others include Tehran: It has spread its influence across parts of the Middle East where there are large communities of fellow Shia Muslims, from Iraq to Lebanon. Its support for Lebanon's Hezbollah movement is particularly alarming for Israel while Saudi Arabia, another bitter enemy, accuses the Iranians of equipping rebels in Yemen. In the Syrian civil war, it is one of President Bashar al-Assad's few outside allies, sending thousands of fighters and military advisers.  Israel praised the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the pact but the move was roundly criticised by fellow signatories, including France, Germany, the UK and Russia. All of the above signatories pledged to honour their commitments under the deal. Mr Pompeo has made clear he expects the backing of his allies in Europe but also called for support from ""Australia, Bahrain, Egypt, India, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea [and] the UAE"". ""We welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation and the brutality of a regime at peace with inflicting chaos on innocent people,"" he said. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted. The deal was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the IAEA."
Yield Spread Analysis,'Terror strikes the heart of Barcelona',2024-09-14,2017-08-17,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-40970102,"The papers are dominated by the Barcelona van attack in which 13 people died. The Daily Mail, the Sun and the Daily Telegraph all use the same image on their front pages - of an injured man, holding his head and being helped by police officers. The Mail calls it a ""massacre of holiday families"" and the paper has eyewitness accounts from Britons who had to run for their lives as a van sped through crowds in Las Ramblas. It describes abandoned prams, toys and tourists' selfie sticks among the carnage. Pictures on a double-page spread inside the paper capture the fear and panic on people's faces. The word ""massacre"" also appears in the Daily Mirror headline. Its front page shows people lying in the street, with some of them pixelated because the images are too graphic. Inside the paper it calls Las Ramblas ""the street of blood and tears"", and carries more powerful photos of people caught up in the violence and armed police sweeping the streets. The Sun devotes two pages to a Moroccan suspect named by Spanish police as the man who hired the van. The paper calls Driss Oubakir a Muslim ""party boy"" who likes ""dope, rap and booze"" - but adds that he has denied any involvement. The Telegraph's report includes a claim that the CIA warned Spanish authorities two months ago that the tourist area in Barcelona was a potential terrorist target. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Thursday's A-level results also get widespread coverage. The news that boys got more top marks than girls for the first time in 17 years prompts the Mirror's headline ""alpha males"". The Times notes that fewer pupils are choosing English and History in favour of science subjects. The paper's analysis says the results are the first product of ""sweeping changes"" by former Education Secretary Michael Gove and it broadly believes they are working to help restore the prestige of the A-level exam. The Mail's editorial suggests that reforms to prevent ""rampant grade inflation"" have been undermined as pass marks are lowered. The Guardian argues that the government has given a low priority to alternatives to university education which is failing to meet the needs of the economy. It concludes that Mr Gove's focus on the academic was ""misdirected"". The Times and the Telegraph both feature the discovery of an 18th Century Dutch merchant ship off the Kent coast along with its lost crew. The Times explains how the vessel, thought to have been carrying silver coins, was first located 20 years ago on Goodwin Sands but is now being excavated after concerns that it was being destroyed by shifting currents. The Telegraph says the discovery of human remains will yield clues as to how the crew lived and died. Marine archaeologist Mark Dunkley tells the paper: ""It's so rare to find a crew on a shipwreck. It's like an underwater Pompeii"". Scotland has a new species of indigenous butterfly, according to the Guardian. It reports that the endangered white-letter hairstreak has been spotted in Berwickshire, just 100m from the English border. It is apparently the first time it has been sighted in Scotland since 1884 - and it is thought that climate change may have helped it to become the 34th species to live and breed in the country. Paul Kirkland, of Butterfly Conservation Scotland, tells the Guardian: ""Climate change is a double-edged sword but it's an exciting time to be in the Scottish borders. ""It's not just butterflies but moths and dragonflies are moving north quite quickly."""
Yield Spread Analysis,Get Involved: GYMNASTICS (RHYTHMIC),2024-09-14,2012-01-06,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/gymnastics/16447779,"This video can not be played Get involved with... Gymnastics Rhythmic gymnastics provides one of the most spectacular events of the Olympic programme and a true demonstration of athletic prowess. Like synchronised swimming, rhythmic gymnastics is only contested by women. It uses many positions and leaps derived from classical ballet, including pliés, jetés, attitudes and arabesques. Former Soviet Union countries, particularly Russia and Belarus, plus Italy are likely to be among the strongest nations. Great Britain's rhythmic gymnasts survived a scare en route to London 2012 when they narrowly failed to reach a target set by their own governing body. The gymnasts launched an appeal and were eventually granted their place at the Olympics by an independent arbitrator. Gymnastics requires strength, mobility, endurance, flexibility, body control and co-ordination.  The high level of physical fitness needed to excel helps encourage a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity and eating a well-balanced diet. The wide range of movements involved works every muscle in the body and burns approximately 315 calories per hour. A University of Athens study found rhythmic gymnastics can help athletes develop strong, healthy bones and joints as it is a weight-bearing activity. This reduces the risk of developing osteoporosis later on in life.  As falling and rolling are key parts of gymnastics training, athletes learn how to spread the force of impacts across their whole body. This can help with injury prevention in sport and other situations. Gymnastics is a breathtaking sport featuring a range of disciplines such as artistic, trampoline, acrobatics, aerobics and tumbling.  It is enjoyed by an estimated four million people in the United Kingdom.  Rhythmic's combination of the flexibility of gymnastics, the technical knowledge of ballet and the expression of modern dance makes it a unique activity.

From Thursday 9 August to Sunday 12 August, 96 athletes (all women) will compete at Wembley Arena There are two rhythmic gymnastics medals available at the Games. One is the individual all-around, which involves performances with a ball, clubs, a hoop and a ribbon. The other is the group all-around, involving teams of six gymnasts, five of whom perform in each of two routines. One routine is with five balls and the other is with three ribbons and two hoops. Both events see gymnasts enter a qualifying round first, to determine who reaches the final. In the individual all-round competition, the top 10 athletes in the qualification round advance to the final. In the group competition, the scores in the two routines in the qualification round are added together and the top eight progress to the final. More on the London 2012 website, external Scoring in rhythmic gymnastics has been subject to several changes in recent years. Points are now awarded for difficulty, artistry and execution up to a total of 30 for each routine. Routines using the various types of apparatus are performed to music on a square competition area that measures 13m x 13m, with marks deducted for errors. The gymnast or group with the highest score wins. Points are deducted for a variety of infringements, for example if the music does not conform to regulations 0.50 points are taken away, if a gymnast crosses the boundaries of the floor 0.20 points are lost, and for every second a routine is under or over the allotted time 0.05 points are removed.

World and Olympic champion Evgeniya Kanaeva of Russia is one of the most dominant competitors in any sport and will start as favourite for all-around gold.  Italy are world group champions, but 2008 gold medallists Russia will be strong again. Rhythmic gymnastics developed in eastern Europe during the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Elements from Swedish exercise routines and German muscle-building techniques were incorporated during the early days of the sport's evolution.  When it moved onto the radar of gymnastics' governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), in the middle of the 20th Century, its devotees were calling it ""modern gymnastics"". The FIG recognised rhythmic gymnastics as an official discipline in 1962 and the first World Championships were held in 1964.  That first title was won by Ludmila Savinkova of the Soviet Union. Its Olympic debut came at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles and the team event was introduced 12 years later in Atlanta, with Spain taking gold. Organisers will be paying close attention to Wembley Arena's air-conditioning system. In 1984, it played havoc with the ribbon routine, allowing rank outsider Lori Fung of Canada to win gold.

Yield Spread Analysis,"China has sharply expanded nuclear arsenal, US says",2024-09-14,2023-10-19,By Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67163903,"China has significantly expanded its nuclear stockpile over the past year and is now holding some 500 operational warheads, the US has said. An annual report released by the Pentagon also said Beijing hoped to double its arsenal to over 1,000 warheads by 2030.  But it said China remained committed to a ""no-first-strike"" nuclear policy. While the report said the rise exceeded projections, China's stockpile is still dwarfed by those of Russia and the US. Russia has a nuclear arsenal of some 5,889 warheads and the US can field 5,244, according to the independent Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.  In 2021 the US Department of Defense estimated China had around 400 warheads.  ""We're not trying to suggest a very large departure from where they [China] looked to be headed... but we are suggesting that they're on track to exceed those previous projections,"" a senior Pentagon official told reporters on Thursday, adding that the issue raised ""a lot of concerns"" for the US. President Xi Jinping has declared China will field a ""world-class military"" by 2049. Since he came to power in 2012, he has sought to modernise the country's armed forces.  Thursday's Pentagon report said that China's drive to boost its nuclear arsenal was set to ""dwarf previous attempts in both scale and complexity"".  US officials said Beijing had probably completed the construction of three new clusters of missile sites in 2022. These fields include at least 300 new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBMs) silos, the report said.  ICBMs are ballistic missiles with a range greater than 5,500km (3,400 miles).  China's People's Liberation Army has also been seeking to develop ICBMs that would allow it ""to threaten conventional strikes against targets in the continental US, Hawaii and Alaska"", the US report found. The analysis said that despite the growth of its nuclear stockpile, China remained ""committed to a policy of 'deterrence' of an enemy first strike and 'counterstrike' when deterrence fails"".  In a press briefing on Friday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said the US report ""is full of prejudice and spreads the theory of the threat posed by China"". Ms Mao added that China had ""always maintained our nuclear forces at the lowest level required for national security, and we have no intention of engaging in a nuclear arms race with any country"". Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC the reported rate of increase did not look ""hugely exceptional"". He also conceded that China was ""moving slightly faster than estimated"" towards its stated goal of 1,000 warheads.  Lyle Morris, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told the BBC that developments such as hypersonic missiles were making China reconsider its second-strike policy, forcing the expansion of its stockpile.  Thursday's Pentagon report also noted that Beijing has ""amplified diplomatic, political, and military pressure"" against Taiwan over recent months.  Mr Xi has reportedly ordered his defence chiefs to develop the military capability to forcibly re-take the island by 2027.  A series of ballistic missile overflights of Taiwan, increased flights into its airspace and a series of military exercises around its waters have been ordered to destabilise the island, the Pentagon report added.  The findings come amid a low point in China-US diplomatic relations.  On Wednesday, Washington accused Chinese air force pilots of conducting hundreds of ""coercive and risky"" manoeuvres against US military planes in international air space over the Pacific.  The Pentagon - which also released videos and photos of the manoeuvres - said there had been 180 incidents since autumn 2021. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Climate scientists are working with indigenous tribes,2024-09-14,2023-11-04,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231102-climate-scientists-are-working-with-indigenous-tribes,"Native peoples have long collected environmental data. Now scientists are cataloguing these observations and learning how they're affecting indigenous communities globally. When the warm nights used to come each summer, Frank Ettawageshik would spend most of his time outdoors, sleeping outside, right on the ground. Today, he balks at the thought. ""I was 35 or so before I ever saw a tick,"" says the 74-year-old executive director of the United Tribes of Michigan, a Native American advocacy group. Now in northern Michigan, he says, ""there's ticks all over the place"". Ettawageshik belongs to the Anishinaabe people, whose members are from the Great Lakes. His own Tribal Nation is the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, who have lived in the northwestern shores of Michigan's lower peninsula for centuries. Besides the spread of ticks, a phenomenon exacerbated by rising temperatures, they've witnessed the struggling populations of whitefish in nearby Lake Michigan and the gradual changes in harvests from the sugar maple tree, whose name in Odawa is ""niinatig"" — meaning ""our tree"". Research suggesting warmer temperatures might force sugar maples out of Michigan add to Ettawageshik's concerns. ""Our tree is going to be moving away from us,"" he says. Ettawageshik's tribe has observed many changes to their ancestral lands over hundreds of years, but Ettawageshik says human-caused climate change is different. ""It's happening at a pace that we don't normally see."" For many people, climate science brings to mind satellite observations, temperature records or the analysis of ice cores. But there's plenty more data besides that. Indigenous communities that have long lived close to the land — and have traditionally depended on deep knowledge of their environments to survive — often hold their own records and recollections. These can include extraordinary details about alterations in weather patterns, changes in vegetation or unfamiliar behavior of animals that have emerged under their watch. Today, anthropologists and climate researchers working for Western institutions are increasingly turning to indigenous people to ask what they have observed about the world around them. In the process, these scientists are learning that indigenous communities have been cataloguing, in their own way and often in their own language, data at a hyper-local level — insights that Westernised climate science might miss — and also how that change is affecting people. ""I believe in Native science — that it's real science,"" says Richard Stoffle, an anthropologist at the University of Arizona, lead author on a 2023 paper that includes numerous observations from Anishinaabe people belonging to three tribes in the Upper Great Lakes. The anonymous interviews, conducted in 1998 and 2014, feature comments on a wide range of environmental changes witnessed by Anishinaabe people over the decades: hotter summers, drier springs, mushrooms emerging at unusual times of the year, or plants that don't yield as much fruit or sap as they used to. The recollections, Stoffle says, make it clear the Anishinaabe people have been monitoring anthropogenic climate change long before it was a regular topic of public discussion. ""It's not like it was in the old days, I think the nights and days aren't as cold as they used to be,"" said one contributor. ""That's what brings that sap up into the trees. It draws it and pushes that sap up. I used to hear those trees snap up there in the woods because, those maple trees, that sap would freeze and crack the trees."" ""Wow, that is a spring morel! Finding it here in September is insane!"" another participant commented on a mushroom observation. Asking indigenous people about the changes they are witnessing helps us to understand what matters to them, what issues require attention, says Victoria Reyes-García, an anthropologist at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies in Spain, and co-author of a 2021 article in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources about turning to indigenous knowledge and values to help address environmental problems. Sea levels in the Southern Hemisphere Off the north coast of Australia lie the Tiwi Islands, Sergio Jarillo, an anthropologist at the University of Melbourne, has been surveying indigenous people about the environmental changes they are seeing. In a paper published in March 2023, Jarillo and colleagues present comments from participants alongside drone-captured imagery of coastlines that show the coastal erosion that worries many members of the community. Erosion is a natural process, but in this case it is probably exacerbated by rising sea levels caused by anthropogenic climate change, says Jarillo. ""Consulting with local people gives you a more complete, and holistic, picture than you would ever get just using measurements."" To geomorphologists, scientists who study the Earth's surface, the development would be far from surprising. So why make the effort to ask indigenous people about it? The difference is that they can provide granular data that a satellite image could never supply — such as photos of the beach, shown to Jarillo and colleagues, taken by islanders during the 1950s and 1960s. ""There was a fish trap that was permanently on the beach,"" Jarillo says, referring to a traditional structure for catching fish. ""There's no longer space."" You might also like: The Tiwi community has been around for long enough to notice substantial changes, and they spend a lot of time in direct contact with the environment, adds Jarillo. ""They know where there is erosion, they know if there's a creek that is drying up."" It is a social justice issue, too, because these environmental changes can have significant effects on the health and well-being of people who live on these islands. Many participants who contributed to the research expressed concerns about land lost to erosion near to a renal dialysis center in the settlement of Wurrumiyanga — an important health-care facility in a community where kidney failure is the leading cause of death. Highlighting indigenous people's knowledge of threats like this might prompt action. The very act of documenting such information is potentially significant because, the paper authors note, ""in the case of the Tiwi, there has been no local, territory, or Commonwealth government initiatives to support climate change adaptation"". Nelson Chanza, a climate adaptation scientist at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa, also recorded finer details after talking to direct witnesses of changes to the environment in Zimbabwe. In a study published in 2022, he and a colleague gathered observations made by 37 indigenous elders from the Mbire District in northern Zimbabwe. This, Chanza says, is a part of the world where meteorological data collection is relatively sparse: The study area is about 50 miles (80km) from the nearest weather station. The elders, whose average age is 63, helped to fill in the gaps by recounting memories of how the environment has changed over the years. Many observed that the rainy season now starts later and ends sooner than it once did. But there were variations on this point, suggesting different areas were drying up at different rates. ""That detail: you tend to lose it if you only rely on the meteorological data,"" says Chanza. In addition, elders related how various fruits, such as Uapaca kirkiana (mazhanje), also known as sugar plums, are becoming less abundant, smaller in size, and poorer in quality. Reports like this are full of information and yet ""they might be treated as anecdotal,"" says Reyes-García. In an attempt to encourage non-anthropologists to take such information seriously, and to standardise data collection involving indigenous communities, Reyes-García and colleagues have developed a study protocol which could be applied to any community anywhere in the world.   It involves collecting, for example, meteorological data as well as carrying out multiple interviews with indigenous people who have lived a long time in a particular place. Comments with group consensus would then be classified in a database. Entries in this database could catalogue anything from observations about wind speed and temperature to animal behaviour. Such standardisation could help to make such information, though admittedly stripped of its colour and richness, appealing to climate researchers and international bodies such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says Reyes-García. Knowing what is important to indigenous communities is also beneficial because it helps those involved in planning mitigation or adaptation strategies to do so appropriately, says Reyes- García. Listening carefully can reveal the true depth of the challenges faced by indigenous communities, too — so by recording their observations of climate change, there is an opportunity to work on climate justice. ""I see my culture starting to disappear,"" is how one indigenous participant in a 2022 study described the severity of change. The paper resulted from a two-day workshop attended by elders, knowledge holders and young adults (ages 19 to 30) from 12 Anishinaabe communities around the Great Lakes region. One of those communities, the Magnetawan First Nation, had the initial idea for an information-gathering session. ""They just said, 'Hey, this is something we're concerned about. Can you organise something?'"" says lead author Allyson Menzies, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Guelph. As Menzies and her coauthors reported, the 37 participants discussed a range of effects they had noticed, such as how strawberries were appearing later in the year — July rather than June — and how fish spawning, which used to last a month, now continues for only about two and a half weeks because of rising river water temperatures. The participants also said that passing on traditional harvesting and hunting techniques was becoming difficult since these depend on the climate behaving in a way that it no longer does. This concept of evaporating culture is familiar to many indigenous people. Inuit communities on Baffin Island, Canada, for instance, frequently report that, as temperatures soar, they are finding it harder to predict the weather, navigate the ice and pass on hunting skills to younger members. In that sense, we might miss something important if we treat research involving indigenous communities as merely an exercise in filling in cells on a giant spreadsheet, says Ben Orlove, an anthropologist at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored an article about climate anthropology in the 2020 Annual Review of Anthropology. ""I think the indigenous people are saying the whole problem with climate change is not the data gaps,"" he says. ""It's the limits in your framework."" Speaking broadly, he says there's a tension between the Western view of the natural world as a resource to be exploited and the indigenous view of a world where humans and nature are part of one single whole. Ettawageshik agrees: Traditional knowledge is not just an encyclopedic list of facts. What matters, he says, is the Odawas' ongoing relationship with beings — plants, animals and natural places. ""We're but one spot in that web of life,"" says Ettawageshik. ""We knew that in that web of life we could not survive without the other beings and, those other beings, they agreed to take care of us. And we agreed to take care of them."" * This article originally appeared in Knowable magazine and is republished with permission.

Yield Spread Analysis,'Things coming together' as Hearts beat Motherwell,2024-09-14,2023-11-11,Clive Lindsay,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67318547,"Lawrence Shankland's flick evaded Blair Spittal at the far post Lawrence Shankland says ""you can see things coming together"" after his double secured a narrow win over Motherwell that lifts Heart of Midlothian up to fourth in the Scottish Premiership. The visiting captain prodded in from close range before Hearts were denied a penalty after a VAR check when strike partner Liam Boyce went down claiming a boot in the face. When Shankland slotted the second on the counter-attack - his fifth goal in five games - after the break, it looked like game over. But, when Motherwell were awarded a spot-kick, Blair Spittal gave the hosts hope of a similar fightback to the midweek draw with St Johnstone. However, Stuart Kettlewell's men fell short this time and have now gone nine games without a win - losing seven of them. Motherwell, who stay ninth, had not won a game since victory at Tynecastle in early September before the previous international break, but there was to be no deja vu as Hearts secured only their second win in six outings. Follow live coverage Keep up to date with Motherwell The latest at Hearts ""You want to win your game before the international break,"" Shankland told BBC Scotland. ""I think it's important. It's a long break and feels that way anyway when you're without a game.  ""You can kind of feel things getting better, things starting to click in games."" Kettlewell had brought Theo Bair back into his starting line-up and the striker was handed the opportunity to give his side an early lead only to head wastefully wide from a corner. Two of Steven Naismith's changes also almost paid dividends.  When Calum Butcher had a clearance charged down, it fell to Alex Lowry and the midfielder, who had already threatened with a curling drive, set up Boyce only for the unmarked striker to fire low and wide. Shankland made the difference, however, when he showed his predatory skills with a little flick to divert a Jorge Grant header into the far corner. Hearts thought they should have had a spot-kick when Boyce went down theatrically holding his face on the edge of the box following a high boot from Dan Casey.  Confusion reigned as referee David Munro, who appeared to stop the game for a potential head knock, resumed with a drop ball after being advised by VAR to have a second look having presumably decided there was minimal contact on the striker's chest rather than his face. Shankland wanted a penalty after a challenge at the back post, but Munro again waved play on after a VAR check, although the Scotland striker got his just deserts when he rounded goalkeeper Liam Kelly after a fine Beni Baningime through ball. It was Motherwell who did eventually get a spot-kick when Alex Cochrane blocked Oli Shaw's goalbound shot in the six-yard box. However, despite Spittal's clinical finish igniting some intense home pressure, there was to be no point rescued this time by the hosts. Given his two crucial goals, you can't really look beyond captain Lawrence Shankland as the one who made the difference. Bair had obviously done enough as a midweek substitute in that Perth fightback to earn a starting place as Kettlewell tweaked his formation. However, the more attacking intent failed to pay dividends and the striker was hooked at half-time, to be replaced with the man he had relegated to the bench - Brodie Spencer. It didn't change the narrative, with Motherwell going 2-0 down, as they had in midweek. Only this time their late pressure came up short and Kettlewell will again be left wondering how his side have waited until they are almost beaten before stepping up a gear. Naismith was looking for a response from last weekend's League Cup semi-final defeat by Rangers - and he got it in terms of the result at least. The creativity of on-loan Lowry, who could not face his parent club at Hampden, was crucial in establishing Hearts' lead. The pressure is eased on Naismith and he will be delighted that his side are now so high in the table considering they are yet to hit their best form. Motherwell manager Stuart Kettlewell: ""Again we get a rally with a penalty, but it's too little too late. We've shot ourselves in the foot again. ""I can't ask any more of them on the training field, but we have to rectify it and we have to do it quickly. They are flat coming off the park, but I can guarantee that the players and I will take responsibility for it."" Heart of Midlothian head coach Steven Naismith: ""It was a big win but one where we performed really well - we were brave on the ball. Overall, it was a good afternoon.  ""We scored goals and could have scored more and probably should have had a penalty. I think there's a penalty because there's contact. Twenty minutes later, there's another foul the exact same with less contact and it is given as a foul against us."" Motherwell next visit leaders Celtic on Saturday, 25 November, with Hearts hosting St Johnstone at the same time (15:00 GMT). BBC Sport Scottish Football SPFL"
Yield Spread Analysis,Spurs score twice in stoppage time to stun Blades,2024-09-14,2023-09-15,Michael Beardmore,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66760556,"This video can not be played Match of the Day: How first Spurs home goal could revitalise Richarlison Richarlison's match-winning stoppage-time cameo against Sheffield United can help ease his off-field troubles, says Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou. The Brazil striker, who said this week he would ""seek psychological help"" for personal issues, came off the bench to head Spurs level eight minutes into the 16 added on. He then turned provider by picking out an unmarked Dejan Kulusevski in the box for the Sweden midfielder to fire home the winner. ""We've got to maintain a balance in life and even for him, he needs to understand his football is still good. He's a fantastic footballer,"" Postecoglou told BBC Sport. ""He's got so much to give and that can help ease the burden he's feeling in other parts of his life. I'm really pleased for him."" Until Richarlison's intervention, Spurs' unbeaten Premier League start under Postecoglou looked to be coming to an end thanks to a Gustavo Hamer strike that crept in off a post. Sheffield United had seemingly engineered a classic smash-and-grab away victory after soaking up pressure for long periods, with goalkeeper Wes Foderingham making a number of fine saves. But Richarlison glanced home fellow substitute Ivan Perisic's corner before Kulusevski left the gallant visitors, who had Oli McBurnie sent off at the end, broken-hearted. Having trailed until the 98th minute, Tottenham's turnaround was the latest winning comeback in Premier League history. ""There's some real resilience and spirit within that group already, which is great to see because they are a relatively new group,"" said Postecoglou. ""You get tested on days like this. It helps fuel belief for us to grow. Our supporters have had an unforgettable day and all those things help in what we are trying to do."" This video can not be played Postecoglou praises Tottenham 'resilience' after late win How did you rate Spurs' performance? Have your say here What did you make of Sheff Utd's display? Send us your views here Spurs have been hailed for their fine start to life under Postecoglou - and to life without Harry Kane - with their vibrant performances helping the Australian win the Premier League manager of the month award at his first attempt. But, of their four wins so far, this victory arguably might please him the most given the way Spurs had to battle and persevere to eke it out. Most of their opponents this season had been happy to go toe-to-toe with Postecoglou's famed 'Ange ball' philosophy, but that was always unlikely with Sheffield United. Paul Heckingbottom's side came with a clear gameplan to stifle Spurs, and it succeeded for much of the afternoon, although they still needed Foderingham to be at his best. He made an excellent near-post stop to foil Yves Bissouma in the first half and also thwarted Pape Matar Sarr, Son Heung-min, the lively Manor Solomon, James Maddison and Kulusevski. The visitors created the odd chance on the counter, James McAtee eliciting a smart save from Guglielmo Vicario in the first half, and Hamer pounced when Spurs fell asleep from a long throw. Gustavo Hamer's goal was his second for Sheffield United since joining from Coventry City in August Brennan Johnson thought he had equalised with virtually his first touch in a Spurs shirt, but the offside flag denied the deadline-day signing, leaving the stage clear for his fellow replacement to steal the show. Richarlison has endured a difficult time since leaving Everton for north London last summer, often employed as a substitute and scoring only once in the league before his header here. But he - and Postecoglou - will hope the honesty he displayed off the pitch this week and the impact he made on it against United can be the turning point of his Spurs career. A fourth successive victory means Spurs have their best start to a season for 57 years and keeps them second in the table before Postecoglou's first taste of a north London derby against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium next weekend. The winless United, meanwhile, remain on one point from five games despite redoubtable efforts against both Spurs and Manchester City - with all four of their losses coming by a single goal. They will be without McBurnie for at least one match after he was handed a second booking not long after Tottenham's winning goal. ""It's sickening for everyone involved in the dressing room - to come so close to three points, then thinking you're going to have settle for one, and come away with nothing,"" said Heckingbottom. ""But that doesn't alter the performance. Right now we have to be positive about how we played.  You can see how they celebrated when they won the game, we did that to them.""

Sterling had a hand in all four goals as the Blues romped to victory after falling behind at Burnley. The veteran of 82 caps last played for England at last year's World Cup and has just been left out of a fourth successive squad for a friendly with Australia and a Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy. ""I think a player with his experience knows he needs to perform and to show the manager of the national team he was wrong in the decision,"" said Pochettino after Chelsea scored four goals in a Premier League match for the first time since April 2022.  ""Only with performances and scoring goals is he going to show he deserved to go."" Sterling's heroics at Turf Moor came after 18-year-old French forward Wilson Odobert marked his first Premier League start by drilling low and hard past Robert Sanchez to send Burnley into raptures. Chelsea were disjointed for spells but were back on level terms before half-time thanks to an own goal. A cross by Sterling, back in the starting XI after a virus, struck the knee of Belgium defender Ameen Al-Dakhil and looped over James Trafford into the net. Chelsea, inspired by Sterling, then scored three times in a strong second-half showing to take the points. Sterling - a four-time Premier League winner - won a penalty after being fouled by Brazilian defender Vitinho, which allowed Cole Palmer to score his first goal for the Blues since moving from Manchester City. The former Manchester City player then scored his side's third with an arrowed finish after Conor Gallagher had spotted his run. Play restarted after Sterling's goal before referee Stuart Attwell stopped the game as a check by the video assistant referee (VAR) for a potential offside was still continuing. The goal was eventually allowed to stand. Substitute Nicolas Jackson sealed the points with a spin and finish, with Sterling once again involved in the move. Having won at Fulham on Monday, it is the first time Chelsea have secured back-to-back away wins in the Premier League since October 2022.

Odobert followed it up with a cross which almost led to a second goal before the Clarets defence crumbled after Al-Dakhil's own goal. Only bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United have conceded more than Burnley, who have not kept a clean sheet in the league since winning promotion. It is not only the defence that needs fixing. After five successive home league defeats, Burnley have to quickly find a way of winning in front of their own fans if they are to give themselves a chance of staying up. ""I wish there was a magic wand to solve everything but it's a lot of work on the training ground to get the basics right,"" said Clarets boss Kompany. ""We've done it in games and done it well but it's been spells and that's our own mistake and we have to work on it."" Kompany, who was part of two title-winning City sides with Sterling, could only puff out his cheeks when asked about his former team-mate. ""He's a top player,"" he added."
Yield Spread Analysis,Hearts win to prevent 10-man Celtic going top,2024-09-14,2024-03-02,Andy Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68395495,"Lawrence Shankland brushed off the disappointment of a disallowed first-half goal to cap a fine display with this goal Hearts beat 10-man Celtic in a VAR-dominated encounter to prevent the defending champions returning to the top of the Scottish Premiership. The visitors' Adam Idah had an early penalty saved and Brendan Rodgers' side soon found themselves depleted. Yang Hyun-jun was initially booked for a high boot on Alex Cochrane but it was upgraded to a red card on review. Jorge Grant put the hosts in front from a VAR-awarded spot-kick before team-mate Lawrence Shankland had a goal ruled out for offside. But Shankland's second-half effort did count and ensured Celtic remain two points behind Rangers, whose loss at home to Motherwell on Saturday had opened the door for Rodgers' team. Hearts, with successive 2-0 wins over Celtic this season, bolster their position in third, restoring a 13-point lead over St Mirren. And for the first time in six years, both halves of the Old Firm have suffered league defeats on the same weekend. Rodgers described the officiating as ""really poor"" and counterpart Steven Naismith felt both penalties were ""soft"". And Rodgers said of the title race: ""It'll be tight. We had a chance to go a point ahead, we couldn't manage that. Everything we want to achieve this year is with us. We have to get over this today and we will do."" Celtic loss 'refereed outside the field' - Rodgers Keep up to date with Hearts The latest Celtic news While Celtic were without captain Callum McGregor, nursing an Achilles strain, they started brightly and the first flashpoint between Yang and Cochrane came on 11 minutes. The in-form Celtic winger got in behind the Hearts defender and was tripped, prompting referee Don Robertson's first big call of the day. Idah, after three goals in two games, stepped up and struck down the middle only for Zander Clark to sweep away with his feet. And then, midway inside the Hearts half, Yang's elevated foot appeared to catch Cochrane's shoulder, resulting in a quick flash of the yellow card by Robertson. However, the referee was advised to give the challenge a second look and Yang's game was over after 16 minutes. There was little let-up in the first-half drama as Matt O'Riley netted via both posts, only for Idah's offside earlier in the move to cut short the Celtic celebrations. And VAR was once again involved in the next twist as Tomoki Iwata's contact with a falling ball was reviewed. Iwata and team-mate Alistair Johnston leapt together with Stephen Kingsley and the ball appeared to strike Iwata's outstretched arm. Captain Shankland, who netted from the spot against Hibernian in midweek, stepped aside for Grant to send the ball firmly into the net to Joe Hart's right. Iwata's day threatened to go from bad to worse as he was robbed by Beni Baningime and Alan Forrest played in Shankland to net. But Iwata was able to breathe a sigh of relief as the striker had gone a little too early as Liam Scales held his defensive line. The eight added minutes alone told a story about just how eventful the first half had been. When the teams reappeared, Celtic's Kyogo Furuhashi was on in place of Paulo Bernardo. The pace of the game dropped and Hearts reverted to a patient approach to eke out an opening. It duly arrived when Calem Nieuwenhof slipped in the inside right channel but somehow managed to tee up Shankland for a smart finish - a 27th goal of the season. Celtic needed something and almost found the net when Kyogo connected with O'Riley's low ball, Clark making another astute save. The goalkeeper had further says in proceedings as he denied Idah from close range after Kyogo's enterprising run and then again after the former got in behind the Hearts defence. Like club and international team-mate Shankland, Clark showed his best in full view of Scotland manager Steve Clarke in the stand One-nil down to Motherwell at half-time last Sunday, Celtic faced the prospect of being five points behind Rangers. Ten goals in 135 minutes later and Rodgers' side travelled to Edinburgh aiming to be top. The missed penalty and Yang's dismissal changed the nature of their task and VAR continues to add unpredictability - and controversy - to the Scottish game. Striker Kyogo's introduction for a midfielder showed ambition and the revamped attack would have registered but for Clark's alertness. Celtic's title destiny remains in their own hands with two meetings against Rangers still to be played this term. Hearts' impressive league season hit a major speed bump with last weekend's 5-0 defeat at Ibrox and a draw at home to city rivals Hibs in midweek could only partially raise their spirits. This victory, a second win over Celtic in a league season for the first time since 2006-07, gets their campaign firmly back on track with third all but secure and a Scottish Cup run still ongoing. Hearts head coach Steven Naismith: ""I'm happy - happy with a professional, good performance. We controlled a lot of the game. We continued to create chances. The way the game played out, every moment and every turning point that could've been, we dealt with it perfectly. ""[For Celtic's penalty] Alex plants his foot in the ground and the forward has kicked him. Credit to Zander, who had a really good game when he needed to. The [red card] decision's right because other red cards that are similar have been given as red cards."" Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: ""We wanted the three points, we didn't get it, so we move on. Credit to my players because they kept going and fighting until the very end.  ""However, the overall game is influenced by the officials. I never come and speak about officials because I understand we all make mistakes, we're all human, but it felt like really poor officiating today."" The Scottish Cup quarter-finals.

Yield Spread Analysis,Maeda treble helps 'uncomfortable' Celtic beat Livi,2024-09-14,2024-03-09,Clive Lindsay,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68460886,"Daizen Maeda headed his own - and Celtic's - second goal Holders Celtic were given an almighty fright by Livingston before reaching their ninth Scottish Cup semi-final in 10 years, with manager Brendan Rodgers conceding he ""wasn't comfortable"" until two late goals. Daizen Maeda completed his hat-trick before Kyogo Furuhashi made the scoreline more convincing. Celtic were looking to recover from last weekend's league defeat by Hearts and Rodgers admitted ""today, we didn't play well, but we won and that makes me very happy"". Indeed, the Premiership's bottom side threatened another shock as they twice came from behind to level in search of their first-ever win at Celtic Park. Daniel MacKay's fine finish was sandwiched between two Maeda goals within an action-packed opening 22 minutes. Tete Yengi superbly fired Livingston level again 10 minutes after the break, but Celtic's Japanese forward was on hand to ease home nerves as extra-time loomed before his international colleague added the final flourish. Follow Celtic news on BBC Scotland Latest Livingston updates on BBC The talk just before kick-off was more about who was not in the respective starting line-ups rather than who was playing. Livingston boss David Martindale admitted he was depressing himself explaining why he had made five, mainly forced, changes but saw a chink of light in the absence of Callum McGregor and Cameron Carter-Vickers. It looked like any optimism would be misplaced when Celtic forged ahead after only seven minutes. Nicolas Kuhn, handed a start in place of the suspended Yang Hyun-jun, turned in from the touchline and delivered a superb ball behind the visiting defence and fellow winger Maeda provided the clinical finish. Seven minutes gone and a long day for Livi looked in prospect, but they were soon level when MacKay was found by a long ball and the on-loan Hibernian midfielder thumped it high past goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, hesitancy as they tried to clear their penalty box meant the visitors were only level for another 10 minutes. Matt O'Riley pounced to fire a shot off the legs of McGovern and, although the veteran goalkeeper did well to deny the midfielder, he was unable to get enough on Maeda's diving header on the rebound to deny the Japanese international. Yengi had already headed just wide before the former Ipswich Town forward pounced on lost Celtic possession, turned O'Riley inside out, and fired superbly into the far corner. Celtic looked shaken and were thankful for Hart's legs as Michael Nottingham's header was cleared off the line. At the other end, McGovern was performing heroics of his own to thwart Celtic until two substitutes made the difference - James Forrest setting up Maeda for his fourth and Kyogo slotting in the killer fourth. There were a few candidates - Livingston goalkeeper McGovern, goalscoring team-mate Yengi and Celtic's Kuhn - but how can you ignore anyone scoring a hat-trick and coming close to scoring more? Maeda it is. The pressure was back on Rodgers and his side after they fell short when given the opportunity to go back to the top of the Premiership last weekend. Defeat by Hearts was compounded by the loss of captain McGregor and Carter-Vickers through injury and their leadership was clearly missing. Rodgers' side enjoyed their traditional lions' share of possession, but they looked vulnerable at the back before their superior resources off the bench proved the difference and kept them in the hunt to lift the cup for a 42nd time. The Northern Irishman suggested that Celtic, more than any other team in the country, are expected to not only win but also put in a show, but on this occasion he will simply be pleased to have made it 15 wins in 15 Scottish Cup ties as the club's manager. Martindale had bemoaned his need to field a ""makeshift"" midfield such were Livingston's absences, but he has made his name from making the most of the players at his disposal - and so it was again. They will be disappointed to exit the cup considering they came close to going ahead at 2-2, but the league remains their priority. Martindale has found a bit of a gem in Yengi and the big striker could yet be the difference between staying up and going down as the West Lothian side look to show similar battling qualities and clinical finishing in the Premiership run-in. This video can not be played Celtic 'gave Livingston too many possibilities' Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: ""We got ourselves into the semi-final and you can see the players we had missing and the difference that makes. We gave them too many possibilities and the centre-halves need to be higher up the pitch. ""But you've still got to show that mentality and that drive and that ambition to keep wanting to get there.  ""Also a big credit to Livingston because it's been a really difficult year for David and his team, but they came here and they fought and made us work right to the very end to get to the semi-final."" Livingston manager David Martindale: ""It was a good game, but it was disappointing at the same time because I thought we had a wee opportunity. ""We get sucker-punched into the third goal. Fourth goal, I'm not really too fussed about. We just threw caution to the wind.  ""It's probably one of the few occasions we've come here and we've genuinely been in the game."" Second-top Celtic host St Johnstone next Saturday in the Scottish Premiership (15:00 GMT) at the same time bottom-of-the-table Livingston visit Hibernian."
Yield Spread Analysis,How the BBC reports election results,2024-09-14,2019-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50241331,"Key questions about general election results, and how the BBC reports them, answered. By winning more seats in the House of Commons than all the other parties put together. If a party does that, it has what is known as a majority. There are 650 seats available, which means 326 seats are needed to win an overall majority. However, an effective majority could be smaller as Sinn Fein, which won seven seats in Northern Ireland in 2017, traditionally refuses to swear allegiance to the Queen and, as a consequence, is not entitled to vote.  So in 2017, 650 minus Sinn Fein's seven would be 643 voting MPs, and 322 would have been enough to command a majority. But obviously that figure changes depending on how many non-voting MPs there are. Also called a seat, in a general election, this is where the political battles are fought. Voters in each constituency choose just one MP. To win an election, a party must win enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government. To do that simply one party needs to get one more seat than all the others added together. That is called an overall majority, but in the shorthand language of elections it is just called a majority. There are 650 seats in Parliament, so to get one more than everyone else put together a party must get 326 or more to get a ""majority"". Of course, it makes things much easier for a government if they have many more MPs than all the others put together. That number is called the size of the majority. So, if one party were to win 326 seats, then all the other parties added together would be 324. The majority is therefore 326 minus 324: two. So the smallest majority possible is not one seat but two. Another quick way of working this out is to take away 325 from the number of seats that the winning party has got and double the result. For example, if the winning party has 350 seats what is the majority? 350-325=25. 25x2=50. So the majority is 50. A tip for any office sweepstake on the size of the majority is never bet on an odd number. A hung Parliament happens when no single party wins a majority. A party can stay in power without an absolute majority by trying to forge an alliance with a smaller party to create a coalition government, as when David Cameron's Conservatives signed up with Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats in 2010. Alternatively, it can aim to reach agreements with smaller parties to support it in Parliament in the event of a confidence motion aimed at bringing down the government. This can be in the form of a confidence-and-supply agreement - as with Theresa May's Conservatives and the DUP in 2017. They didn't take ministerial positions but agreed to support the party in confidence votes and budgets. Another possibility is for the biggest party to form a minority government with no agreements with other parties, and just try to form majorities in favour of each individual bill as it comes up. If no party is prepared to go down one of these paths, Parliament will be dissolved again and there will be another election. No. They haven't changed since 2010. There was a proposal to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 under the coalition government, which would have meant changes to some constituency boundaries. These have not been implemented. The Speaker of the House of Commons is an MP and has to stand for re-election in his or her constituency at every general election. Traditionally the biggest parties in the House of Commons do not stand against the Speaker, although the Green Party has done so this year and in other recent elections. The new Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is standing for election in Chorley, Lancashire. The Speaker is a neutral figure in Parliament, so Sir Lindsay is no longer a member of Labour as he was before his election to the role (by Parliament). However, for the purposes of calculating the number of seats belonging to each party - and calculating those held, gained or lost by each party - Sir Lindsay's seat is regarded as being a Labour constituency, as he won it for the party in 2017 before being elected Speaker. If Sir Lindsay wins again, the result in 2019 will be described as ""Speaker win"" - and his seat will be added to the Labour total and not included in any change calculations. This means the 326 majority target still works, as there is traditionally one deputy Speaker from the same side of the House as the Speaker, and two deputies from the opposing bench. The votes for Sir Lindsay will be added to our ""Others"" tally, however, not included for Labour. The BBC follows the same principle at every general election. What matters most is how many ""seats"" - constituencies - each party wins, and for things to change in Parliament, political parties need to win seats from each other. Because winning seats from each other is so important, a special language is used to show this. Seats that are won mainly fall into two categories: hold or gain. By-elections are one-off elections in seats where, for example, the sitting MP has stood down or died. There have been five by-elections since 2017 but only one - in Brecon and Radnorshire - resulted in a change of party control. When the BBC reports general election results, all of these interim by-elections are ignored, to allow for straightforward comparison with 2017's seats. The BBC uses slightly different terminology to describe results where seats have changed hands in by-elections. For example, in Brecon and Radnorshire, Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds won from Conservative Chris Davies. If the Conservative candidate regains the seat on 12 December, the result will be described as a ""Conservative win"". Likewise if Ms Dodds wins again that will go down as a ""Liberal Democrat win"". It would not appear as a net gain in the Conservatives' overall UK seat tally if they win, but if the Lib Dems win that will give them a +1 in the gains total, and the Conservatives -1. However, if an entirely different party wins a by-election seat, that result will be described as a ""gain"" from whichever party won the seat in 2017. It's a similar situation where an MP has changed party but is standing in the same seat as before. More about that below. The BBC adopts this policy in recognition of the very particular circumstances which often shape the outcome of by-elections. Comparing seat changes from 2017 is a fairer way of representing how the political expression of voters has altered from general election to general election. Despite it only having been two-and-a-half years since the last election, more MPs have changed parties than in any Parliamentary term since 1886 when the Liberals split over the issue of Home Rule in Ireland. Several Labour and Conservative members unhappy with the Brexit process left to form the Independent Group last February, since then they have been called Change UK and now the Independent Group for Change. They have three candidates standing in this campaign. Others have joined the Lib Dems or become Independents, and there has also been a considerable number of MPs suspended or expelled from their parties due to internal disciplinary procedures. For the purposes of calculating change in seats, we will compare these areas with how they were immediately after the 2017 election. Let's use the case of Chuka Umunna as an example. He won Streatham in London for Labour in 2017, but has been a Liberal Democrat MP since June. For this election, he's running in the Cities of London and Westminster seat won by the Conservative Mark Field in 2017. If Mr Umunna wins there this time around, that will count as a Liberal Democrat gain and a Conservative loss, even though he would have been a sitting MP before and after the election. If the new Labour candidate for Streatham wins, that will be a Labour hold rather than Lib Dem loss. If the defected MP were to run in the same constituency they won in 2017, that would be treated similarly to the way we deal with by-elections, explained above. We would describe it as a ""win"", rather than a hold or gain, for whoever gets the most votes, but for the overall change tallies for the parties we would compare it against the result in the constituency in 2017. An exit poll is conducted by approaching voters as they leave polling stations and asking them to fill in a mock ballot paper to indicate how they have just voted. The exit poll is carried out by polling company Ipsos Mori for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. The poll is carried out in Great Britain only, so there are no seat forecasts for the Northern Irish parties. The results of the exit poll will allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won. Constituencies in the UK are supposed to have broadly similar numbers of people living in them. There are exceptions for island constituencies, like the Isle of Wight (the biggest seat by population) and Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) in Scotland, (the smallest). But in general there are about 70,000 eligible voters in constituencies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and an average of 56,000 in Wales. Each seat has equal value in the House of Commons, but the way you view them on a map can be quite skewed - rural areas where populations are more spread out take up more space than inner city ones, for example. The cartogram is a way of viewing each seat as equal size, while attempting to show roughly where in the UK they are. There are some, mostly around London - whose high population density distorts the map most significantly - that are in different places to where you'd expect, no longer neighbouring the seats they lie next to geographically. All the seats are correctly within the right nation and English region, but they are occasionally arranged strangely within that. On national and constituency scoreboards you may find that if you add all the vote share gains and losses together they don't equal zero, and it's not clear where extra votes have come from. That's because we only include vote share changes for parties or independents that are running in this election. So in a constituency where a certain party is not standing this year but they stood in 2017, like UKIP and the Lib Dems in Beaconsfield, the 11% they won between them in 2017 won't be accounted for in the change figures. The figures for the parties that are running this year will all be correct individually though. If a party or independent is running this year but didn't run in 2017, their vote share change figure will be the same as their vote share because it is in effect an increase from zero. The seats change totals will always sum to zero at a national or regional level, even where there are Independents who won seats in 2017 that aren't standing this time, like Lady Sylvia Hermon in North Down. On election night, the BBC calculates percentage turnout by dividing the number of valid votes cast for all candidates by the number of people eligible to vote (known as the electorate). Spoilt or rejected ballots are not included. The UK and nations turnout figures are updated through the night, based on electorates divided by valid votes of all constituencies declared so far. When polls close at 22:00 GMT, the BBC will broadcast the results of the exit poll. The projected seats for the top five parties based on the exit poll will be displayed in the summary graphic as grey bars. When the first results are declared, around an hour later, parties will begin to be ordered left to right by number of seats won at that time, with the number of votes received as a tie-breaker if they're level on seats. As the night progresses, the summary results graphic will always display the top five parties according to seats won. All other parties' seats will be amalgamated into ""Others"". When we get closer to the end of the night, the predictions will be switched off and we'll just be left with a bar chart summing up the results. Full UK results are always available via the link to the results homepage, which contains party listings and breakdown of seats, votes and vote share by party. There are also separate results pages for each of the four nations in the UK, and one for every constituency. We also publish results for Wales and the 40 Welsh constituencies in Welsh. To appear as a named party in either the overall UK scoreboard or a nation scoreboard, a party must fulfil one of the following criteria: All parties which do not meet these criteria are amalgamated into a group called Others, including the 224 independents running this year. Each constituency page will always name every party and independent standing in that constituency. The BBC only recognises parties which are registered as political parties by the Electoral Commission. The postcode search box uses the latest available data supplied by Ordnance Survey. Discrepancies can occasionally occur when a postcode search returns a different constituency to the one given on polling cards sent to an address at the same postcode. Normally the constituencies concerned are next to each other, and it appears these discrepancies occur when postcodes are on the border between the two constituencies. We would advise people affected to follow the information on their polling card in terms of the constituency they are in and the polling place to be used on 12 December. Where possible we try to use full party names, but in some places we have to shorten them so they fit better. Some are easier to guess than others, here are what they all mean (ordered by the parties standing the most candidates this time around): CON - Conservatives LAB - Labour LD - Liberal Democrats GRN - Green Party BRX - The Brexit Party IND - Independents (any individual candidate not affiliated to a party registered with the Electoral Commission) SNP - Scottish National Party UKIP - UKIP PC - Plaid Cymru CPA - Christian Peoples Alliance YRKS - Yorkshire Party MRLP - Monster Raving Loony Party SDP - Social Democratic Party LIB - Liberal Party APNI - Alliance Party DUP - Democratic Unionist Party UUP - Ulster Unionist Party SDLP - Social Democratic & Labour Party SF - Sinn Fein AONT - Aontú ANWP - Animal Welfare Party LBT - Libertarian ADV - Advance Together ED - English Democrats WRP - Workers Revolutionary Party REN - Renew AGS - Alliance for Green Socialism GWLD - Gwlad Gwlad JACP - Justice & Anti-Corruption Party [The] SEQ - Socialist Equality TIG - Independent Group for Change WEP - Women's Equality Party YPP - Young People's Party CHP - Christian Party CLGB - Communist League CMU - Communities United NE - North East Party PBP - People Before Profit POS - Proud of Oldham & Saddleworth PP - The Peace Party SFP - Scottish Family Party SPGB - Socialist Party of Great Britain VPP - Veterans and People's Party YESH - Yeshua SPK - Speaker ASH - Ashfield Independents BNP - British National Party BPI - Burnley & Padiham Independent Party BSJP - Birkenhead Social Justice Party CF - CumbriaFirst CMEP - Church of the Militant Elvis Party CMUK - Citizens Movement Party UK CP - The Common People CVP - The Cynon Valley Party HWDI - Heavy Woollen District Independents INET - Independent Network LNIN - Lincolnshire Independents LUTN - Best for Luton MK - Mebyon Kernow MTHR - Motherworld Party PATR - Patria PFP - Psychedelic Future Party RBD - Rebooting Democracy SHRP - Shropshire Party SLP - Socialist Labour Party SNAV - Space Navies Party TCRP - The Constitution and Reform Party TLW - Touch Love Worldwide UGP - The Universal Good Party WY - Wycombe Independents"

John McGinn's close-range finish - the Aston Villa midfielder's 16th goal for his country - was reward for a dominant first-half display. Substitute McTominay eased increased nervousness around Hampden with a clinical 87th-minute finish.  And the Manchester United midfielder added his second moments later. Steve Clarke had billed it as a must-win game against Group A's lowest seeds, who ended the game with 10 men after a late red card for Nicholas Ioannou, and it was job done in that sense. But the Scotland head coach will know that, despite their first winning start to a Euro qualifying campaign since 2006, improvement will be needed as top seeds Spain visit on Tuesday. Lessons as Scots and Spain start with 3-0 wins Joselu debut double helps down Norway Reaction and as it happened The dawn of new qualifying campaign brought the Tartan Army to Hampden full of optimism.  They were rewarded with a dominant first-half performance during which they were rarely under threat and probed at the Cypriot defensive wall with consistency and determination.  All that was lacking was a little more cutting edge in the vital area - directly in front of goal. That was a theme until late on, with the result still uncertain until McTominay stepped up. Scotland's intent was clear. Get at Cyprus down the flanks, particularly the left. That pattern was fairly consistent, but the first real threat came down the other side when Aaron Hickey danced into the box and, from the tightest of angles, forced goalkeeper Demetris Demetriou into a low save at his post.  Clarke's side were cruising, comfortable on the ball and showing an impressive level of composure.  The left flank proved the route to the crucial opening goal as Stuart Armstrong fed Andy Robertson, who timed his run perfectly to stay marginally onside and cross first time. The ball deflected perfectly into McGinn's path as he instinctively raced to meet it and finish from close range to take his Scotland tally to one more than the talismanic James McFadden.  Che Adams came close after super interplay with McGinn, but his shot was tipped over and the unfortunate striker left the field early in the second half with a worrying looking injury.  The second half show dipped significantly and the creeping doubt began to emerge that Cyprus might just nick something. Finally, though, Scotland got there - thanks to three of their own substitutes. Ryan Christie did superbly to win possession and fire in a cross ,Lyndon Dykes nodded it on and McTominay raced onto it to half-volley home.  An enormous cheer and accompanying sigh of relief engulfed Hampden before McTominay capitalised again when Robertson laid the ball into his path and he calmly dispatched it home with ease. Who else but John McGinn? Scott McTominay's late intervention was emphatic, but McGinn was exactly where it counts at the right time to make the vital breakthrough. The 3-0 scoreline adds significant and welcome gloss to the occasion. Clarke will be delighted with that but equally happy to get through this unscathed.  It became something of a struggle until very late on, but the players stayed calm and avoided a calamity. The initial signs were very positive in the first period, with Scotland in complete control.  They were perhaps a touch cautious in getting into dangerous areas directly in front of goal, but the performance was strong and promised more as the game wore on. That said, Cyprus were very well organised and proved sticky opposition. The concern will be how standards seemed to slip. There was little composure in the final pass or deliveries from wide areas, but the substitutes made a significant impact to get Scotland over the line. This video can not be played Clarke wants to 'focus on positive headlines' but things to improve before Spain Scotland head coach Steve Clarke: ""We spoke a lot about getting off to a good start and I thought we started the game really well. The movement, the rotation of the players, the creation of space was good. We deserved the lead at that time. ""I thought up until 30 minutes we were good and I don't know whether we went a bit casual, we switched off a little bit and Cyprus made it difficult for us. Second-half was a slightly difficult game and we slowed the game too much, but it is nice to look at the bench and bring on Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie."" Cyprus head coach Temuri Ketsbaia: ""I believe we lost to the better team. Scotland deserved to win the game, well done to them. Congratulations.  ""I'm disappointed that we didn't give our best. We tried to change our formation, we tried to put more offensive players. It cost us because we conceded two easy goals.""

Few have the talent; fewer still possess such single-minded commitment. The multi-skilled individual is a special breed. That is why the heptathlete is not a jack of all trades. They are athletes with world-class ability in a number of disciplines - sprinting, throwing and jumping to a standard that rivals the specialists. With British heptathletes Jessica Ennis-Hill and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in World Championship action in Beijing, we talk to Ennis-Hill's coach Toni Minichiello, former Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis and Mike Holmes, the coach of Johnson-Thompson, to find out what makes the perfect heptathlete. ""The emotional toll can be huge. It can be quite a debilitating experience and I have known athletes to require weeks, even months, to recover fully."" Mike Holmes. Even if all heptathletes were born equal, the great could still be separated from the good by one trait. The champions are the ones who can ride out adversity. They will not collapse like a souffle when a bar tumbles or a javelin strays out of bounds. They go again. And again.  ""Rarely, if ever, does an athlete execute the perfect heptathlon so resilience is necessary,"" says Holmes.  And because of the demands of multi-discipline events, heptathletes will only complete full competitions once or twice a year, so the pressure to get it right is immense. The days, too, are long: early starts, late finishes; eating, competing, resting, fulfilling media commitments - all for a two-day competition which could, were all seven disciplines performed without pause, be done and dusted in three minutes or so.  ""You have to be the greatest individual you can be spread over two days and that's what takes it out of you,"" says Minichiello. ""The three and a half minutes is physical; the 48 hours you go through is mental."" Part of that mental strength is the preparedness to work hard, all the time.  ""Sunday morning running session followed by weights. Back to basics,"" posted Ennis-Hill on Instagram when she returned to training late last year after giving birth to her son ""You're talking six to seven hours of work a day,"" says Minichiello. ""There's weight training sessions two or three times a week, and running sessions which not only cover speed but endurance too.  ""It's a grind. It's year-on-year development. It doesn't come instantly; it's nothing short of graft."" The 29-year-old Olympic champion Ennis-Hill, a dainty 1.65m (5ft 5in) and 57kg (8st 13½lb), was too small to be world class, her coach was told early in her career. Johnson-Thompson, at 22, stands 1.83m (6ft 0in) tall and weighs 68kg (10st 10lb) - a stature far more common among current heptathletes. ""What they couldn't see was the work ethic or the competitive nature of the individual,"" says Minichiello of the young Ennis-Hill. ""That ability not to give up and keep improving."" ""If you're not a decent high jumper I don't think you'll ever have a high score in the heptathlon. It really is a breaker."" Denise Lewis To soar through the air, to cover the track at lightning speed or to produce a bicep-popping throw? Which skill is the most important? Which will gain most points?  What is the heptathlon? The heptathlon is a speed and power event. Over two days, athletes compete in seven events - 100m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200m, long jump, javelin and 800m. A heptathlete will receive points for her best performance in each. The athlete with the highest overall score wins. All the events are ""crucial"", says Minichiello. But a heptathlete who excels in the high jump and long jump will earn enough points to put them in contention for glory. Clearing 1.82m in the high jump will earn 1,000 points - the elite will easily go higher (Ennis-Hill's outdoor best is 1.95m, Johnson-Thompson's 1.90m).  To collect 1,000 points in the shot, by contrast, requires a 17.07m throw, a mark not even Jackie Joyner-Kersee - an athlete Minichiello says was as close to perfection as there has been - could get close to. The American's best was 16m (928 points), and she threw 20cm below that when breaking the world record.  Holmes, originally a throwing coach, says it takes time to develop consistency in the shot and javelin.  ""It's not until you're about 33 that you peak in the shot - that's why if you look at the development of Denise Lewis and Jessica Ennis-Hill, it's been very gradual,"" he says. ""They got there in the end but it's not as rapid as the high jump, for example, when you peak at the age of 21 and 22."" ""If an athlete has a weak event, it can be very annoying, but the best way of dealing with it is not to compare yourself against your rivals."" Mike Holmes Denise Lewis came away from the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 with a bronze medal, but she wasn't satisfied. She moved to the Netherlands to link up with Charles van Commenee, who would later become Britain's head coach. Between them they concocted a four-year plan for Olympic gold. Outdoor PBs: Ennis-Hill & Johnson-Thompson 100m hurdles 12.54 secs 13.47 secs High jump 1.95m 1.90m Shot put 14.67m 12.17m 200m 22.83 secs 22.89 secs Long jump 6.51m 6.92m Javelin 48.33m 42.01m 800m 2:07:81 2:07:64 Total 6955 pts 6682 pts ""During that time you can't really go into detail with all seven events,"" says Lewis. ""Yes, you have the general conditioning throughout, but specifically you would need to target events per year to pull them up to standard."" Lewis focused on the shot and javelin. She teamed up with an international shot putter, worked on her technique - increasing power and speed - and used video analysis. After 12 months of shot put drills three days a week, the Briton had improved.  In 2014, Holmes said he and Johnson-Thompson were giving the shot ""treble the amount of attention"" of other events In 1995 her shot put best was 13.24m, but 12 months before the 2000 Olympics she hit a personal best 16.12m - a 193-point improvement.  But a coach will ""look at the animal they've got,"" says Minichiello.  ""With Jess we pushed more with the sprints, developed the jumps to a good level and had a good long look at her weaknesses, which were the throws. They were incredibly weak when she was young, and we worked hard to get those to a level where they were very competitive. ""You're thinking: do I thrash that to get more points or not? If I wanted to throw the shot half a metre further, what is it going to take and will it be detrimental to other events? If I get 20 points out of four events I get 80, as opposed to thrashing one event to try to get 50 points."" ""They have to understand your personality, know what makes you tick, when to talk to you, when not to talk to you."" Denise Lewis Understanding and trust between athlete and coach are essential to making those year-on-year improvements in different disciplines, as they are to excelling under pressure on the day. Lewis likens working with the right coach to ""getting the right pair of shoes""; she talks of a relationship which must ""feel good and comfortable"".  Katarina Johnson-Thompson (left) with her coach Mike Holmes at the European Indoor Championships ""The coach has to give you the right instruction at the right time and that's why it's so special,"" she says. ""Imagine two no-jumps in the long jump. Whatever they say to you after the second no-jump is crucial. They have to be able to stay calm, be clinical in their instructions.""  Holmes adds: ""When maximum effort is put in and something goes wrong, even the most experienced world-class heptathlete will suffer vast disappointment. ""Points have been haemorrhaged and must be made up. The coach has the task of turning that around and moving things forward because there is another event coming up and that requires 100%."" ""There's not one athlete that goes out that doesn't have the game face or the poker face."" Denise Lewis Mind games are not the preserve of Premier League football managers. Heptathletes have also been known to manipulate a rival's mind because the battle for multi-eventing supremacy does not begin on the track. Injured? Keep quiet. Worried? Say nothing.  ""I wanted it more than anyone else,"" says Lewis of her Olympic gold in 2000 Lewis injured her Achilles tendon during a javelin competition in Birmingham in the summer of 2000, weeks before the Sydney Olympics for which she had made life-changing sacrifices. Her iffy heel stopped her from competing, stopped her from training, but her rivals could not find out.  ""Three weeks before competition I was in trainers, walking around the track - that's all I could do. I was pulling out of things left right and centre. I just didn't want people to know the extent of my injuries because I didn't want my competitors gaining strength,"" she recalls.  ""We all have the bravado. You have to choose your words carefully in the press conference. You don't want to give too much away about your physical state because you don't want awkward questions that are going to make you feel vulnerable. ""It was a laborious two days, even away from competition, and that's why I'm so proud of my gold medal. It wasn't the best score but, to me, it was everything because I had to dig deep.""

Yield Spread Analysis,Italy crisis hits financial markets,2024-09-14,2018-05-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44287455,"Fears over Italy's political upheaval spread to Wall Street after Europe's financial markets closed lower. The prospect of fresh elections and the possibility of eurosceptic parties strengthening their position has raised concern about the eurozone's stability. The Dow Jones index shed 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%, coming after Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 2.7% and Europe's other main markets shed well over 1%. A sell-off in Italian bonds saw the yield on two-year debt breach 2%. It meant that short-term Italian bonds suffered their biggest one-day jump in 26 years. Movements in bond prices are important as they affect the cost of borrowing for the government. Italy's debt currently stands at 130% of its economic output. The bond sell-off hit the share prices of European banks exposed to government debt, especially those in Italy. Banco BPM, Banco Generali, Unicredit  and BPER Banca closed down between 5% and 6.7%.  On Wall Street, JP Morgan was down 3.7%, and Bank of America and Citigroup were just more than 3% lower. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3%.  Falling bank shares dragged down Europe's main share markets. At the close the UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1.3%, while Germany's Dax was down 1.5% and France's Cac 1.3% lower. ""It's a market that is totally in panic"", said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, who noted ""a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances"". Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in the US, said:  ""If the political situation in Italy worsens, the longer-term spillovers would be felt in the US via a stronger dollar and lower European growth."" What is Italy's political crisis all about? Call to impeach Italian president Italy's economy in charts The turmoil was precipitated after the anti-establishment Five Star and League political parties abandoned their attempts to form a ruling coalition after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella. He had vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic economy minister, and appointed former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister with the task of trying to form a government. But his term is likely to be cut short, as he will almost certainly lose a parliamentary vote of confidence. If he does, then new elections would soon follow. How bad is the financial situation in Italy? There is no question that the political crisis has led financial market investors to judge that the risks have increased markedly. The rise in Italian government bond yields has been very sharp and tells us that there is increased nervousness about the outlook.  But we are not - not yet at least - anywhere near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12.  At the time there was an informal rule of thumb sometimes used, that countries were likely to need a bailout if the yield on their ten year bonds - essentially the annual cost of borrowing money for ten years - was sustained at more than 7%.  Italy did hit that level briefly in that earlier episode.  But it's currently around 3%. Higher than it was - but not yet flashing red.  Five Star and the League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in March's election, and could increase their combined majority in a new national poll. ""We've seen a steep sell-off in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com ""The moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the eurozone debt crisis. ""The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe."" Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans.  The leftist Manifesto newspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire."" The centrist daily Corriere Della Sera suggests that Mr Cottarelli will be a ""steady hand at the wheel, in market waters that promise to be rough"", but that it will be difficult for him operate because he will be ""a prime minister without trust"".

Yield Spread Analysis,The DNA viruses left in ancient remains,2024-09-14,2023-10-16,Jasmin Fox-Skelly,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231013-how-unearthing-diseases-ancient-origins-could-help-produce-modern-cures,"The DNA of bacteria and viruses that infected humans thousands of years ago is still trapped in their skeletal remains. Scientists are finding out what we can learn from them. In the 16th Century, in the country now known as Mexico, there was a sudden and dramatic drop in the population. Disease spread after Europeans conquered the territory and millions of indigenous people died as a result. Until recently, it was believed the Europeans had brought the illness with them from Europe - but the exact pathogen responsible was unknown. Now a team of scientists have extracted ancient viral DNA from the teeth of victims of the outbreaks, buried beneath a colonial-era hospital and chapel in New Mexico. The DNA reveals that the victims were infected with hepatitis B virus and human B19 parvovirus. Rather than a European origin as previously thought, the researchers found that the viruses likely originated in Africa. ""The viruses seem to have an African origin, and three of the humans we analysed were genetically African as well,"" says María C Ávila Arcos, assistant professor at the International Laboratory for Human Genome Research at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. At the time, European traders and colonists were forcibly enslaving Africans and transporting them thousands of miles to the Americas. The cruel conditions on ships allowed infections to spread rapidly. ""These humans were kidnapped and then placed in crowded, unsanitary ships in completely subhuman conditions,"" says Ávila Arcos. ""Once the virus arrived in the Americas, the indigenous people had never been exposed to it before, so they were extremely vulnerable. It wiped out a large fraction of the indigenous population."" Rewriting history The discovery is one of the latest in the field of paleomicrobiology, whereby researchers extract fragments of microbial DNA from centuries-old skeletons. The DNA is then reconstructed, allowing scientists to diagnose a disease or condition hundreds or even thousands of years after the person's death. The technique is changing how we view and understand our past. Take smallpox – a devastating illness that killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th Century alone. The origins of the variola virus that causes smallpox have always been obscure. From anecdotal accounts, historians believed it may have been around since 10,000BC, but until recently there was no scientific proof, and the oldest confirmed case was dated to the 17th Century using DNA extracted from a Lithuanian mummy. However in 2020 that date was pushed back, when Barbara Muhlemann, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, and her colleagues extracted variola virus from the teeth of Viking skeletons dated to AD600. The skeletons were uncovered in 11 burial sites in Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the UK. Smallpox was also found in multiple human remains from Öland, an island off the east coast of Sweden with a long history of trade. The finding predates the earliest confirmed smallpox cases by 1,000 years. The study provides clear evidence that the Vikings, who travelled extensively around Europe and beyond, carried smallpox with them. Meanwhile ancient-DNA analysis has also shone a light on the origins of the plague. A 2015 study analysing microbial DNA from the teeth of 101 skeletons found that the bacteria that causes plague, Y. pestis, had been spreading amongst humans for at least 3,000 years prior to the first documented plague pandemic. The researchers found Y. pestis bacteria in the DNA of seven of the skeletons, the oldest of whom died 5,783 years ago. Although modern plague is usually spread via rats carrying infected fleas, the study showed that the plague bacterium didn't acquire the mutations necessary to infect fleas until the turn of the 1st millennium BC. Before then it likely spread through human-to-human contact, resulting in the less serious pneumonic plague. Once it acquired the ability to infect fleas it spread rapidly, leading to outbreaks of the bubonic plague (Black Death), a pandemic which wiped out half the population of Europe in the 14th Century.   Ancient DNA is changing the way we view another serious disease: syphilis. It was previously believed that the first outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1495 in Italy, just after Christopher Columbus returned from his first voyage to the Americas. The sexually transmitted disease ran rampant amongst the infantry of King Charles VIII of France, who at the time was planning to conquer the Kingdom of Naples. The debilitating disease then quickly spread around Europe. As the outbreak happened just after the return of Columbus and his crew from their first trans-Atlantic voyage, most historians believed syphilis spread to Europe from what was referred to at the time as the 'New World'. But support is growing for a different theory. In 2020, Verena Schuenemann, a professor of archaeological science affiliated with the University of Basel and University of Zurich, led a team which extracted DNA from nine individuals whose bones bore the characteristic lesions of syphilis. The remains were recovered from cemeteries in Finland, Estonia, and the Netherlands. The researchers detected at least three separate strains of Treponema pallidum, the pathogen that causes syphilis, as well as other diseases such as yaws – now found only in the tropics. Carbon-dating of the skeletons and coffins confirmed that the individuals died between the early-to-late 15th Century, suggesting that syphilis was already circulating in Europe before Columbus returned from his maiden voyage. Calculations based on the mutation rate of the syphilis bacterium also suggest that the origin of the disease predates the time of arrival of Columbus. ""We know that the spread of pathogens is connected to trade routes,"" says Schuenemann.   ""We see that with syphilis, the plague, and leprosy – whenever humans started to exchange travel and trade, they also brought opportunities for pathogens to travel.""   Conversely, that means that microbial DNA can only tell us so much about the history of ancient pandemics. The DNA itself isn't a problem. Although DNA does degrade over time, researchers have sequenced the genome of a woolly mammoth who lived one million years ago. However it's likely that before around 12,000 years ago when humans adopted agriculture and farming, people wouldn't have come into contact often enough to cause a pandemic.   ""You need a certain amount of humans to actually transfer diseases, so we tend to see these diseases appearing alongside the first cities. When people started settling down, that's when the pandemics struck,"" says Schuenemann.   Clues from teeth   A great place to look for ancient microbial DNA is dental plaque. This sticky residue, which builds up on your teeth if you don't brush properly, traps bacteria, eventually causing tooth decay and gum disease. Eventually plaque undergoes a mineralisation process whereupon it hardens, ‘trapping' the DNA of ancient oral bacteria and viruses inside. Decoding this microbial genome is giving scientists access to a treasure trove of information about the health of our ancestors. For example the multinational Medical project is using human dental plaque to piece together the history of how leprosy was treated during the Middle Ages in Europe. Led by Emanuela Cristiani from Sapienza University of Rome, the team have analysed the tartar of teeth excavated from the medieval cemeteries of St Leonard's in Peterborough, England, and Saint-Thomas d'Aizier, in France. You might also like:  The team found traces of ginger in some individuals, suggesting that attempts were made to treat the condition. For instance, Constantine the African, a famous 11th-Century AD physician, wrote about preparing oral treatments containing ginger and other herbs to alleviate stomach pain triggered by leprosy. Mercury was also found in some patients, which could have been used to cover skin imperfections and as a pain-relieving ointment. This suggests that rather than simply stigmatising sufferers, victims were cared for. Diagnosing heart disease and Alzheimer's Sequencing dental DNA can do more than tell us about what infectious diseases a person had when they died. In the future, the technology could also reveal what a person's oral microbiome – the huge and diverse assemblage of bacteria, archaea and fungi that live in and around your mouth – was like too. This information, in turn, could tell us about the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in ancient times. NCDs are chronic conditions that are not the result of a singular infectious agent. They include conditions like heart disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's Disease. ""There's studies going back decades showing how oral health and the oral microbiome are related to these conditions,"" says Abigail Gancz, a biological anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University. In a recent article, Gancz argues that as the links between the oral microbiome and NCDs are so well-established, we may be able to use ancient microbial DNA to infer whether ancient human populations experienced these conditions too. Although they are often thought of as modern diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyles, we actually have no idea to what extent they were prevalent in ancestral human populations, because the vast majority of NCDs leave no distinctive traces on the skeleton. However, there are signs that they were present, although not to the same extent as today. ""In ancient Egyptian literature in some of the earliest written records you have descriptions that look a lot like diabetes, for example accounts of the sweet-smelling nature of urine,"" says Gancz.   ""There is an assumption that people in the past lived short, brutal lives, but a lot of them did make it to older age and would have experienced these non-communicable diseases."" Gancz is leading the Ancient Systemic Disease project, which aims to uncover the link between ancient human microbiomes and the presence of NCDs. So far, she has analysed the skeletons of 192 British individuals dating from the medieval to industrial period. The project involves painstakingly decoding the microbial DNA found in dental plaque to find out what bacteria and viruses the person had when they died. This is then compared to, and correlated with, known markers of disease present in the person's skeleton. ""There are various lesions in skeletons that indicate disease,"" says Gancz. For example, cavities or abscesses in the person's teeth may suggest that the person was suffering from periodontal disease. You can also detect signs of systemic inflammation by looking at a person's bones. For example, arthritis can lead to a visual deformation in bone morphology.   Bones are living thing that change throughout the lifespan, so the bones will have different forms and textures depending on whether someone was actively experiencing stress,"" says Gancz. When complete, the research should allow scientists to look at a skeleton's oral microbiome and use that information to calculate the likelihood that they also suffered from a chronic disease. This will allow researchers to track how conditions like arthritis and obesity have changed over time, including what effect if any the agricultural revolution, industrialisation, and urbanisation had on these conditions. There's good reason to believe that major transitions such as these had a huge impact on human health. For example, a 2013 study by Gancz's supervisor, Laura Weyrich, associate professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University, found that the oral microbiome of our ancestors changed – and became more unhealthy – after we switched from hunter-gatherers to farmers. The finding underlines the role that pathogens have had in shaping human history. But research like this isn't just of historical interest. It could be used to improve the health of modern humans too. One of the aims of Weyrich's research is to develop microbiome transplantations – swapping an unhealthy oral microbiome for a healthy one. ""Imagine a day where you don't have to brush your teeth as you have microbes in your mouth that don't cause oral disease – that might be something we can get to by looking at what microbes people had prior to the widespread presence of these modern oral diseases,"" says Weyrich.  ""I always tell people I wish I had teeth like a Neanderthal because the Neanderthals had brilliant oral health for the most part. If we could take their microbial composition and use that as a guide to develop modern oral microbial transplantation, we could try to fix the current situation we're in where 90% of Americans will develop cavities throughout their lifetime."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,"AI must have better security, says cyber official",2024-09-14,2023-07-18,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66166824,"Cyber security must urgently be built into artificial intelligence systems, a top security official has told the BBC. Lindy Cameron from the National Cyber Security Centre said it was key to have robust systems in place in the early stages of AI development. As companies rush to develop new AI products, there are fears that security it is being overlooked. As a result, malicious attacks could have a ""devastating"" effect, a former intelligence chief added. In the future, AI will play a part in many aspects of daily life in our homes and cities through to high-end national security and even fighting wars. But for all the benefits, there are also risks. ""As we become dependent on AI for really good things like delivery of food, autonomous vehicles, utilities or all sorts of things that AI will help to control in the future, attacks on those systems could be devastating,"" says Robert Hannigan, who used to run the UK's communication intelligence agency GCHQ. The concern is that companies - competing to secure their position in a growing market - will focus on getting their systems out for sale as fast as possible without thinking about the risks of misuse. ""The scale and complexity of these models is such that if we don't apply the right basic principles as they are being developed in the early stages it will be much more difficult to retrofit security,"" says Lindy Cameron, CEO of the NCSC, which supports UK organisations with cyber security and responds to incidents. AI systems can be used as tools by those seeking to do harm. For instance, coming up with malicious code to hack into devices, or writing fake messages to be spread on social media. What is particularly dangerous is the systems themselves can also be subverted by those seeking to do harm. For many years, a small group of experts has specialised in a field called 'adversarial machine learning', which looks at how AI and machine learning systems can be tricked into giving bad results. ""The systems are very brittle unfortunately"", explains Lorenzo Cavallaro, a professor of computer science at University College London, ""it is always a cat and mouse game"". Take for example AI trained to recognise images. Researchers ran a test by placing stickers on a 'stop' road sign, which made the AI think it was a speed limit sign - something with potentially serious consequences for self-driving cars. Another field involves 'poisoning' the data which the AI is learning from. Results generated by AI can be biased because of data sets that are not representative of the real world. But poisoning means deliberately creating bias by injecting bad data into the learning process. ""It is hard to spot,"" says Professor Cavallaro. ""You can only identify it in retrospect with forensic analysis."" A major problem for AI systems is they can be hard to understand. The risk is that even if someone simply fears their model might have been poisoned by bad data, then it becomes harder to trust it. ""It is a fundamental challenge for AI right across the board as to how far we can trust it,"" says former GCHQ head Robert Hannigan. The dangers are not just of hackers seeking to cause disruption, but to wider national security. If AI was used to analyse satellite imagery looking for a military build-up, then a malicious attacker could work out how to either miss the real tanks or see an array of fake tanks. These concerns were previously theoretical, but signs are now emerging of real-world attacks on systems, according to Andrew Lohn, a senior fellow at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. ""For a while all the academics like me were asking the people in industry: 'is this a real thing?' and they would just give us winks and nods. But there's just now starting to be an acknowledgment that this is a real thing happening in industry."" It seems to be happening first where AI is used to improve cyber security by detecting attacks. Here adversaries are seeking ways to subvert those systems so their malicious software can move undetected. This week BBC News is focussing on AI, how the technology affects our lives and what impacts it may have in the near future. A new article co-authored by GCHQ's chief data scientist looks at how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could also give rise to new and unanticipated security risks.  It says there are 'serious concerns' around individuals providing sensitive information when they input questions into models, as well as over 'prompt hacking' in which models are tricked into providing bad results. Officials believe it's vital to learn lessons from the early days of internet security. For example, by making sure those writing the software and building products take responsibility for security. ""I don't want consumers to have to worry,"" says Lindy Cameron of the NCSC. ""But I do want the producers of these systems to be thinking about it."""
Yield Spread Analysis,Labour move to force school funding papers fails,2024-09-14,2023-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66669998,"Labour has failed in its bid to force the release of documents about school repairs spending when Rishi Sunak was chancellor. The party wanted ministers to publish details of past funding decisions after school closures due in England due to crumbling concrete. But the attempt was blocked after the government ordered Conservative MPs to vote it down. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan accused Labour of ""playing politics"". She said the documents, on past spending negotiations, contained ""sensitive"" information - and disclosing them would jeopardise the ability of officials to offer frank advice to ministers in the future.  But shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused her of trying to ""spread responsibility"" for the crisis, adding the prime minister needed to ""come clean"" about what he knew of the risks. ""The Conservatives have voted to cover up the truth about the prime minister's failure to act on dangerous buildings and the true scale of this crisis,"" she said. Labour's motion comes after more than 100 schools in England containing reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) were told last week they would have to introduce safety measures, involving some partial and full closures. RAAC was used in various types of building between the 1950s and 1990s, but the material, a cheaper alternative to standard concrete, has a lifespan of around 30 years. Although concerns about the material have been around for a while, the recent announcement about schools has sparked a political wrangle about previous levels of investment for repairs. Since the announcement, Labour has increasingly sought to put Mr Sunak's record in the spotlight by questioning funding decisions he made when he was chancellor. It used a parliamentary procedure called a humble address to try and force the release of documents on spending negotiations between the education department and the Treasury from from 2020 to 2022, when Mr Sunak was chancellor. But the move was defeated by 309 votes to 175 in a vote in the House of Commons. Little used before Brexit, this procedure has increasingly been employed by Labour in recent years to embarrass Tory MPs, who are normally expected to vote with the government. After a similar vote on school safety in May, individual MPs were targeted with attack ads on social media for not backing a Labour motion to release buildings survey data. In a sign the tactic is likely to be used again, Ms Phillipson said before the vote that Conservatives who vote against their latest motion would be voting to ""conceal the true scale of this crisis"".  Speaking ahead of the vote, Ms Keegan said the the government had acted ""responsibly and decisively"" in response to three cases over the summer that raised safety fears. She told MPs that the crisis was ""50 years in the making"", adding that guidance on managing RAAC had been around since 1994 and ""nobody is blameless"". On Monday, Jonathan Slater, a former senior civil servant in the education department, said that analysis from 2019 had found that between 300 and 400 schools needed rebuilding each year. Mr Slater told the BBC the department had initially secured funding for 100 a year, but that Mr Sunak later took the decision to ""halve the size of the programme"". Schools Minister Nick Gibb acknowledged his department had put in a bid for 200 refurbishments a year in 2021 but the Treasury had only funded 50. He also said that since Mr Sunak became prime minister, £4bn had been added to revenue funding for schools in England, meaning £59.6bn would be in the budget next year, a ""record amount"". The DfE has said that so far, of the 500 schools it has committed to rebuilding by 2030, only four have been completed. The department says it expects the rate to increase towards the end of the decade. "
Yield Spread Analysis,Scotland relegated to Nations League B after draw,2024-09-14,2023-11-30,Amy Canavan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67543676,"Scotland will be relegated to League B of the Women's Nations League, despite dominating in a draw with Belgium. Erin Cuthbert's sublime strike from distance cancelled out Marie Detruyer's tidy opener in Leuven, but it was not enough for a Scotland side requiring a win to prolong their stay in the top division.  Substitute Amy Gallacher came closest to netting a winner, passing up a glorious opportunity to score her first international goal by missing the target from close range. Pedro Martinez Losa's side finish the campaign by welcoming European champions England to Hampden on Tuesday. Demotion 'a learning moment', says Scotland boss More reaction & as it happened All your Scottish women's football news The sturdy start from Scotland showed no sign of a side who were winless in their past four. There was a speed and slickness to their play, exploiting the sizeable spaces the Belgians were willing to leave in the middle of the park.  Cuthbert tested Nicky Evrard with a tame effort before Detruyer dealt an all too familiar sucker punch to the Scots with a fine finish. What was not so familiar though was the response.  With the freedom of Leuven, Cuthbert carved a beauty out of nothing, a fitting reward for the team's application to going a goal down. The heads never dropped, the intensity did not diminish.   Piling on the pressure, the towering Jenna Clark seemed destined to nod the visitors ahead. Somehow, though, her effort nestled in the roof of the net. A wise head entered the fray as Scotland searched for the precious next goal. Hayley Lauder made her first Scotland appearance since March 2020, her 104th cap, nearly 14 years since she made her first. Fellow substitute Gallacher nearly made it a match to remember for all but the Celtic forward squirmed a delicious chance in front of goal from a sizzling cross. The match ended in a sour note for Cuthbert and Scotland as she left the field following a facial knock. The attacker (left) dragged Scotland back into the contest and was tidy in possession before going off injured late on Once again, Scotland fans are left feeling frustrated after another tale of what could have been.  As they have been in almost every outing in this quality-laden group, this team fought. They scratched and they clawed, but it wasn't enough.  Their display in Leuven was perhaps the most confident and mature so far in this competition, as if the bruisings they've faced in recent months had almost battered them into a belief that they belong.  The manager didn't rest on his laurels, making attacking change after attacking change in search of a winner. The quality to find the breakthrough was once again lacking. Alas, the killer instinct has not yet been instilled in his squad of technical talents.  Now that relegation is confirmed, there's hope that they can learn their lessons and re-build faith by putting a run of results together en route to Euro 2025 and in future Nations League outings in Group B.  If they do so, while adding finishing touches to this youthful team, the international heavyweights may just be in for a shock when Scotland next show up to the top table.  Scotland head coach Pedro Martinez Losa: ""It's a moment of learning. It's a moment to be ready for the next challenge that's coming up. ""I think it was a very competitive game as we have seen in all the Nations League games. I think we did more than enough to win this game. That's football. Belgium is a very good team. We showed a little more [than them]. ""We have to keep going. We have an important game on Tuesday. We have to recharge the batteries."" Scotland host England at Hampden on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) in their final group game, while Belgium travel to take on Netherlands at the same time."
Yield Spread Analysis,Hearts third as own goal seals win at Kilmarnock,2024-09-14,2023-12-02,Sean McGill,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67528589,"Will Dennis' own goal was enough to give Hearts victory Will Dennis' own goal moved Hearts up to third in the Scottish Premiership as Kilmarnock sustained a rare home loss. Dennis turned in Lawrence Shankland's drilled ball across on 18 minutes. His day could have gone from bad to worse when he flew into a last-man challenge with Yutaro Oda, but a lengthy VAR review led to no change from the on-field booking.  And Hearts held on to win four consecutive top-flight games for the first time in five years. Steven Naismith's side leapfrog St Mirren, who play Rangers at Ibrox on Sunday, while Derek McInnes' team drop out of the top six after his 700th game as a manager. Reaction & as it happened Subscribe to Kilmarnock updates All your Hearts news The hosts looked to continue their formidable home form with a bright start, but it would be a blunder from their goalkeeper that forced a breakthrough in the game.  Shankland found himself in behind of an indecisive Lewis Mayo and proceeded to ghost into the box and force the error from Dennis.  The jinking runs and clever passes of Danny Armstrong could not drag Kilmarnock back into the game - the best chance skewed wide by the boot of an onrushing David Watson.  Still rocked by his own goal, the home goalkeeper could have sent himself for an early shower when he clattered into Oda. Confusion reigned at Rugby Park when Dennis' booking was ruled to be enough by VAR as the Japanese forward was also shown to be in an offside position.  The home side knocked on the door but did not really look like troubling Hearts until Stuart Findlay headed inches over at the death moments after Aidan Denholm had failed to kill the game for the visitors.  It seems almost lazy to give the Hearts captain the spotlight week after week but once again his determination and doggedness epitomised all that was good about his team's performance Consistency. Consistency. Consistency.  That was the message from the Hearts camp this week as they endeavoured to put on the kind of run that has eluded their club since 2018.  Was this a brilliant performance that will win over the Tynecastle faithful still sceptical of Steven Naismith's credentials? Probably not.  But having defeated Livingston, Motherwell and St Johnstone in November, their fourth win on the bounce was impressive in the sense they never looked troubled against a team unbeaten in their past five league games in Ayrshire.  Beyond Dennis' disaster of a day, there was not really too much between the sides as Kilmarnock passed up half-chance after half-chance.  The return of important players Kyle Vassell, Brad Lyons and Corrie Ndaba should have lifted the hosts but they remained fairly flat as fortress Rugby Park could not be the safe haven it has been so often since their return to the Premiership.  McInnes said pre-match his team need to act like a top-six club if they want to stay in the top half of the table. Now pushed down to seventh, his side will need to do more in encounters such as this to achieve their goals this term. Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes:  ""I'm disappointed because we put so much into the game. I thought we were the dominant team. ""I'm not here to put blame on any one but it's a poor one to concede. By and large, we still had enough of the game to go and do something about it."" Hearts head coach Steven Naismith: ""There are a lot of positives from what was an ugly game. I'm pleased with the result. We knew the game would be the way it was. It was not a spectacle at all."" ""The longer you're at a club you want to have a system and style that reflects you. That comes over time. Every game and every result you get breeds confident."" Both sides are in action on Wednesday as Kilmarnock travel to Aberdeen (19:45 GMT), while Hearts will look to close the gap to second-placed Rangers in Edinburgh (20:00).

Yield Spread Analysis,Five lessons from the Russian GP,2024-09-14,2020-09-29,Jolyon Palmer,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/54340678,"Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault during the 2017 season, is part of the BBC team and offers insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors. The Russian Grand Prix will not go down as a classic.  Lewis Hamilton's penalties killed off what could have been an intriguing battle for the race win, and there was precious little action down the field. But a boring race on a bland track has nevertheless brought to the fore a number of key themes emerging in Formula 1 as the season heads towards its final phase. Hamilton feels like public enemy number one with governing body the FIA right now, after receiving a penalty that cost him a probable race win for the second time in three races. With his lead at the top of the championship seemingly unassailable even at this early stage, Hamilton came out after the race with the bold claim that the race stewards were ""trying to stop me"". The reality is that Hamilton and Mercedes have simply broken the rules both times.  Hamilton leads Mercedes team-mate Bottas in the drivers' championship by 44 points after the Russian Grand Prix In Monza, Mercedes and Hamilton pitted when the pit lane was closed and received a penalty for it - the same one as Antonio Giovinazzi's Alfa Romeo was given for the same infringement. None of Hamilton's immediate rivals made the same mistake in Monza and nobody else in the field broke the rules by doing a practice start at the exit of the pit lane in Sochi. The regulations stated that drivers must do practice starts on the right after the pit-lane exit lights. Mercedes argued that there was no designated spot - in terms of anything delineated by markings - but they know the rules define a specific place, and everyone else managed to use it. I do sympathise with Hamilton, because it is not necessarily his fault in both of these instances.  His Mercedes team let him down by telling him to pit in Monza, and when Hamilton asked on the team radio whether he could do a practice start from further down the pit lane in Russia, his race engineer Pete Bonnington gave Hamilton the green light to do it. The problem was, Hamilton went a lot further down the pit lane than the team had expected. It's harsh for him to lose two races in this manner, and the fact that he picked up penalties for both infringements (doing a practice start in the wrong place on consecutive laps) will only grate that bit more, and perhaps seem over the top. The fact is, though, that Hamilton wanted to do a practice start there, rather than in the designated practice start box, because it was less grippy than the practice area, and therefore more like the grid slot he would be starting on in the race. It would give him a better feel for the start. If this was allowed, everyone would do it. The practice-start box has more rubber down because that is the place drivers can practise their starts. So every other driver who complies with the regulations does their starts there and little by little rubber from their rear tyres is deposited on to the asphalt. Sure, it's not always ideal for race-start preparation, but they are the rules and Hamilton was the only one to do something different. He did it twice, and he was penalised accordingly. In summary, I don't think the FIA stewards are against Hamilton, they are simply applying penalties for breaches of the rules.  Sometimes they seem harsh, but I'm sure Haas were arguing the same in Hungary when both drivers were given the same penalty as Hamilton for being told to pit on the formation lap. All these instances are procedural infringements which leave little wriggle room in terms of application of the rules. In that sense, they are unlike racing incidents, which can be argued against as they aren't always black and white. Mick Schumacher set for F1 race weekend debut 'Records must wait after Hamilton falls fouls of stewards' Bottas wins in Russia  The Sochi Autodrom winds its way around the 2014 Winter Olympic park. Combined with its location on the shores of the Black Sea, with mountains as a backdrop, it should create a nicely atmospheric setting. But looks can be deceptive. The reality is that it's a circuit that lacks much character. It's almost entirely flat, and every corner seems almost the same - an approximately 90-degree turn. The only exceptions are the slightly trickier  - but still 90-degree - chicanes of Turns 13-16.  It's certainly not any driver's favourite venue. This year, Sochi followed on from the debut of Italy's Mugello track, which I praised in my last column for its old-school characterful feel. In that context, I'd argue the new-school sanitised feel of Sochi did little to help the excitement. There were 30,000 fans watching on inside the Sochi Autodrom There have been seven Russian Grands Prix at Sochi now, and it has yet to produce a properly decent race. Overtaking is tricky and cars often spread out, despite the track having a high chance of a safety car. Statistically, that safety-car probability will be even higher next year, after first-lap crashes for McLaren's Carlos Sainz and Racing Point's Lance Stroll. But the safety car on Sunday did little to spice up the action - unlike in Mugello. Turn Two at Sochi has come under some scrutiny, specifically for the way the policing of track limits and rules about rejoining the track led to incidents and penalties. Britain's George Russell labelled the corner ""one of the worst on the calendar"". And with a combination of track-limits madness and a lack of overtaking it's a thought that many share. Sainz hit the wall in the run-off area trying to go too fast though the bollards before rejoining the track, and Renault's Daniel Ricciardo and Red Bull's Alex Albon received penalties for not going through the run-off in the correct manner. Drivers are meant to lose heaps of time by swerving left to go through the bollards next to the wall Sainz hit, even if they slide off track by only a few millimetres. Race director Michael Masi admitted after the race that there was room for improvement here. At the end of Sochi's kilometre-long main straight, a tighter corner may help overtaking and also perhaps reduce the corner-cutting issue that the following kink causes. Several drivers have spoken about this, and perhaps a change here can produce some better Russian Grands Prix in the future. In defence of this year's race, without Hamilton's penalty, it may have been set up for a good race with offset tyre strategies between the Mercedes drivers, but we were denied a chance to see that play out. Sergio Perez is on the back foot because his seat at Racing Point has been taken by Sebastian Vettel for next season and he is looking for a drive in 2021. But he is putting in some good performances in the face of adversity to solidify his reputation and plant himself firmly on the radar of other teams. For the second race in a row, Perez has had to race a car without new upgrades, after they were once again given to team-mate Lance Stroll following his crash in Mugello. Despite that, Perez was best of the rest in both qualifying and the race in Russia, and well ahead of Stroll. He beat fifth-placed Ricciardo by 22 seconds - pretty much a full pit stop.  He has had a public falling out with the team after being dropped at the end of the season, despite having a contract in place. He has clearly felt poorly treated by a team he helped save a couple of years ago by taking them into administration and forcing a sale to Lawrence Stroll. In spite of this, Perez is capable of delivering good results, and his fourth place is a demonstration that he does deserve a place in a decent car next season as well. Sebastian Vettel is leaving Ferrari for the renamed Aston Martin team next year Next season can't come soon enough for Vettel. Ferrari have a poor car this season and the four-time champion has never looked comfortable in it. Team-mate Charles Leclerc has pulled a few star performances out of the Ferrari and on Sunday he finished a very credible sixth from 11th on the grid. In contrast, Vettel had another weekend to forget. He crashed in qualifying while trying to make up a 0.4-second deficit to Leclerc, and then never made an impact in the grand prix after a long first stint. The Ferrari is certainly a handful with which Vettel is struggling to make any progress, but on top of that his relationship with the team has soured in a similar way to Perez's at Racing Point. There has been needle between Vettel and team principal Mattia Binotto all season long since it was confirmed Vettel hadn't retained his drive.  Vettel doesn't seem to trust the Ferrari strategists at all this year - and this is not the first season in which that has been apparent. He is debating and often overriding some of their in-race calls. But more importantly he seems to have lost his usual mojo for racing and performance. It almost looks as if he is seeing out this year in a holding pattern. I'm sure a fresh challenge at Aston Martin will reinvigorate Vettel and he probably can't wait for it to come around already.  Ricciardo has been outstanding this season, and produced another excellent drive in Russia. When he was given a five-second penalty for exceeding the track limits at Turn Two, his radio message spoke volumes for his confidence. ""Yeah, that's my bad; I'll make up for it,"" he said, adding: ""I'll drive faster."" He is driving the wheels off his Renault and has been unlucky not to be on the podium already this season with fourth places at Silverstone, Spa and Mugello. Ricciardo is making it a very tough return season for Esteban Ocon, a young French star who has seemed destined for greatness.  Ocon was seen as a man of the future by many after beating Max Verstappen to the European Formula Three title on their way up through the ranks, and he impressed for Force India against Perez in the first phase of his F1 career. Ricciardo is showing top-class driving in a midfield team, but if Ocon was thinking things might get easier when it was announced the Australian would be off to McLaren for next year, he may have been mistaken. Fernando Alonso is returning to Renault to fill Ricciardo's shoes in 2021, and with the Spaniard's recent visit to the team's factories and insistence on being closely in the loop through the remainder of this year as well, it seems he could be at least as stiff competition for Ocon. If Alonso comes back at somewhere near the level he left F1 a couple of years ago, then Ocon will need to raise his game in the remaining races and through the winter to not be left behind.  He only has to look at the podium interviewer last weekend to see the risks. Stoffel Vandoorne was the man with the microphone. He was dropped from F1 after a tough season in 2018 against Alonso Ocon has had promising moments but is yet to look fully on top of things in 2020.  Formula 1"

Yield Spread Analysis,What makes the perfect heptathlete?,2024-09-14,2015-08-20,Aimee Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/33853462,"Johnson-Thompson (left) finished fifth in the 2013 World Championships while Ennis-Hill won gold in 2009 and silver in 2011 To master anything requires practice and dedication; to excel in multiple events needs round-the-clock devotion. Few have the talent; fewer still possess such single-minded commitment. The multi-skilled individual is a special breed. That is why the heptathlete is not a jack of all trades. They are athletes with world-class ability in a number of disciplines - sprinting, throwing and jumping to a standard that rivals the specialists. With British heptathletes Jessica Ennis-Hill and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in World Championship action in Beijing, we talk to Ennis-Hill's coach Toni Minichiello, former Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis and Mike Holmes, the coach of Johnson-Thompson, to find out what makes the perfect heptathlete. ""The emotional toll can be huge. It can be quite a debilitating experience and I have known athletes to require weeks, even months, to recover fully."" Mike Holmes. Even if all heptathletes were born equal, the great could still be separated from the good by one trait. The champions are the ones who can ride out adversity. They will not collapse like a souffle when a bar tumbles or a javelin strays out of bounds. They go again. And again.  ""Rarely, if ever, does an athlete execute the perfect heptathlon so resilience is necessary,"" says Holmes.  And because of the demands of multi-discipline events, heptathletes will only complete full competitions once or twice a year, so the pressure to get it right is immense. The days, too, are long: early starts, late finishes; eating, competing, resting, fulfilling media commitments - all for a two-day competition which could, were all seven disciplines performed without pause, be done and dusted in three minutes or so.  ""You have to be the greatest individual you can be spread over two days and that's what takes it out of you,"" says Minichiello. ""The three and a half minutes is physical; the 48 hours you go through is mental."" Part of that mental strength is the preparedness to work hard, all the time.  ""Sunday morning running session followed by weights. Back to basics,"" posted Ennis-Hill on Instagram when she returned to training late last year after giving birth to her son ""You're talking six to seven hours of work a day,"" says Minichiello. ""There's weight training sessions two or three times a week, and running sessions which not only cover speed but endurance too.  ""It's a grind. It's year-on-year development. It doesn't come instantly; it's nothing short of graft."" The 29-year-old Olympic champion Ennis-Hill, a dainty 1.65m (5ft 5in) and 57kg (8st 13½lb), was too small to be world class, her coach was told early in her career. Johnson-Thompson, at 22, stands 1.83m (6ft 0in) tall and weighs 68kg (10st 10lb) - a stature far more common among current heptathletes. ""What they couldn't see was the work ethic or the competitive nature of the individual,"" says Minichiello of the young Ennis-Hill. ""That ability not to give up and keep improving."" ""If you're not a decent high jumper I don't think you'll ever have a high score in the heptathlon. It really is a breaker."" Denise Lewis To soar through the air, to cover the track at lightning speed or to produce a bicep-popping throw? Which skill is the most important? Which will gain most points?  What is the heptathlon? The heptathlon is a speed and power event. Over two days, athletes compete in seven events - 100m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200m, long jump, javelin and 800m. A heptathlete will receive points for her best performance in each. The athlete with the highest overall score wins. All the events are ""crucial"", says Minichiello. But a heptathlete who excels in the high jump and long jump will earn enough points to put them in contention for glory. Clearing 1.82m in the high jump will earn 1,000 points - the elite will easily go higher (Ennis-Hill's outdoor best is 1.95m, Johnson-Thompson's 1.90m).  To collect 1,000 points in the shot, by contrast, requires a 17.07m throw, a mark not even Jackie Joyner-Kersee - an athlete Minichiello says was as close to perfection as there has been - could get close to. The American's best was 16m (928 points), and she threw 20cm below that when breaking the world record.  Holmes, originally a throwing coach, says it takes time to develop consistency in the shot and javelin.  ""It's not until you're about 33 that you peak in the shot - that's why if you look at the development of Denise Lewis and Jessica Ennis-Hill, it's been very gradual,"" he says. ""They got there in the end but it's not as rapid as the high jump, for example, when you peak at the age of 21 and 22."" ""If an athlete has a weak event, it can be very annoying, but the best way of dealing with it is not to compare yourself against your rivals."" Mike Holmes Denise Lewis came away from the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 with a bronze medal, but she wasn't satisfied. She moved to the Netherlands to link up with Charles van Commenee, who would later become Britain's head coach. Between them they concocted a four-year plan for Olympic gold. Outdoor PBs: Ennis-Hill & Johnson-Thompson 100m hurdles 12.54 secs 13.47 secs High jump 1.95m 1.90m Shot put 14.67m 12.17m 200m 22.83 secs 22.89 secs Long jump 6.51m 6.92m Javelin 48.33m 42.01m 800m 2:07:81 2:07:64 Total 6955 pts 6682 pts ""During that time you can't really go into detail with all seven events,"" says Lewis. ""Yes, you have the general conditioning throughout, but specifically you would need to target events per year to pull them up to standard."" Lewis focused on the shot and javelin. She teamed up with an international shot putter, worked on her technique - increasing power and speed - and used video analysis. After 12 months of shot put drills three days a week, the Briton had improved.  In 2014, Holmes said he and Johnson-Thompson were giving the shot ""treble the amount of attention"" of other events In 1995 her shot put best was 13.24m, but 12 months before the 2000 Olympics she hit a personal best 16.12m - a 193-point improvement.  But a coach will ""look at the animal they've got,"" says Minichiello.  ""With Jess we pushed more with the sprints, developed the jumps to a good level and had a good long look at her weaknesses, which were the throws. They were incredibly weak when she was young, and we worked hard to get those to a level where they were very competitive. ""You're thinking: do I thrash that to get more points or not? If I wanted to throw the shot half a metre further, what is it going to take and will it be detrimental to other events? If I get 20 points out of four events I get 80, as opposed to thrashing one event to try to get 50 points."" ""They have to understand your personality, know what makes you tick, when to talk to you, when not to talk to you."" Denise Lewis Understanding and trust between athlete and coach are essential to making those year-on-year improvements in different disciplines, as they are to excelling under pressure on the day. Lewis likens working with the right coach to ""getting the right pair of shoes""; she talks of a relationship which must ""feel good and comfortable"".  Katarina Johnson-Thompson (left) with her coach Mike Holmes at the European Indoor Championships ""The coach has to give you the right instruction at the right time and that's why it's so special,"" she says. ""Imagine two no-jumps in the long jump. Whatever they say to you after the second no-jump is crucial. They have to be able to stay calm, be clinical in their instructions.""  Holmes adds: ""When maximum effort is put in and something goes wrong, even the most experienced world-class heptathlete will suffer vast disappointment. ""Points have been haemorrhaged and must be made up. The coach has the task of turning that around and moving things forward because there is another event coming up and that requires 100%."" ""There's not one athlete that goes out that doesn't have the game face or the poker face."" Denise Lewis Mind games are not the preserve of Premier League football managers. Heptathletes have also been known to manipulate a rival's mind because the battle for multi-eventing supremacy does not begin on the track. Injured? Keep quiet. Worried? Say nothing.  ""I wanted it more than anyone else,"" says Lewis of her Olympic gold in 2000 Lewis injured her Achilles tendon during a javelin competition in Birmingham in the summer of 2000, weeks before the Sydney Olympics for which she had made life-changing sacrifices. Her iffy heel stopped her from competing, stopped her from training, but her rivals could not find out.  ""Three weeks before competition I was in trainers, walking around the track - that's all I could do. I was pulling out of things left right and centre. I just didn't want people to know the extent of my injuries because I didn't want my competitors gaining strength,"" she recalls.  ""We all have the bravado. You have to choose your words carefully in the press conference. You don't want to give too much away about your physical state because you don't want awkward questions that are going to make you feel vulnerable. ""It was a laborious two days, even away from competition, and that's why I'm so proud of my gold medal. It wasn't the best score but, to me, it was everything because I had to dig deep.""

But the last edition, hosted by Australia in 2008, proved to be a resounding success, drawing large crowds and an impressive worldwide television audience.

""The idea is that we don't have any of the blow-outs that you see in other World Cups,"" said communications manager Martin Johnson. ""So every team will go into the group stages thinking they have a chance of winning their group, although that will be a bit harder in the elite groups.  ""But every team in groups C and D has a chance of winning a game and no team should go home without scoring a few tries - and that's better for the supporters and better for the development of the game."" Former England skipper Jamie Peacock, who is part of BBC Sport's commentary team for the World Cup and will have a weekly column on the website, won 48 caps for England and Great Britain before retiring from international duty in June 2012.

Australia's World Cup squad Johnathan Thurston Coach: Tim Sheens Captain: Cameron Smith Star man: Johnathan Thurston (half-back) Appearances: 13 Best: Champions (1957, 1968, 1970, 1975, 1977, 1988, 1992, 1995, 2000) Jamie Peacock's view: ""Australia are the overwhelming favourites - but they are beatable. New Zealand have proved that in big games, including the 2008 World Cup final.  ""The Aussies are very effective at international level and it is a big help that their four key players - Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith and Billy Slater - play together for Queensland in the State of Origin. That's another high-pressure situation.  ""Australia have the biggest pool of players to pick from so it is no surprise they are the favourites."" England's World Cup squad Sam Burgess Coach: Steve McNamara Captain: Kevin Sinfield Star man: Sam Burgess (prop forward) Appearances: Four (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: Runner-up (1975, 1995)  *Great Britain were three-time champions (1954, 1960, 1972) Peacock's view: ""They have a great chance of winning the tournament, especially with home advantage. That's a big bonus. Look at the Olympics - some of the performances from the British athletes rose to levels they didn't know they could reach. ""All the main players are fully fit and Steve McNamara has managed to break down the barriers of the club rivalries which exist between the players on a weekly basis in the Super League. This is something that others haven't been able to do in the past. ""And they have got Sam Burgess, who is the best forward in the world. That's because he can play prop, second row or loose forward as well as anyone else in the world."" New Zealand's World Cup squad  Sonny Bill Williams Coach: Stephen Kearney Captain: Simon Mannering Star man: Sonny Bill Williams (second row) Appearances: 13 Best: Champions (2008) Peacock's view: ""Defending champions New Zealand have got every chance of upsetting the odds again and repeating their 2008 success. ""They have a lot of players who not only start regularly in the NRL, but are key players for their sides. ""The Kiwis have lost their last five Tests against the Aussies but have managed to beat them in the big games like the 2008 World Cup and Four Nations.

But they will be hoping to give them a close game. ""It is clear that the other teams in the group, including Fiji, are much stronger, but Ireland will look at this World Cup as an opportunity to give rugby league a huge lift in their country. ""Pat Richards is a massive player for them. He has been one of the top three overseas players the Super League has ever had.

There are two stadiums in Hull - the KC Stadium and Craven Park - and 21 in total Although the tournament is split across four nations, England is the primary host with 20 of the 28 matches taking place across the country.

""A double-header at Wembley will be fantastic, and we had to have a marquee venue for the opener and you can't do better than Cardiff. After that we go to the heartlands, areas where we know our fans will come out. ""But we're also going to areas where the game is developing, places like Bristol, Limerick and the two games in France. So it's a really good spread for everybody."" Australia have dominated the competition since its inception in 1954, winning nine of the 13 tournaments, and begin as overwhelming favourites to regain the title this year. France were the driving force behind the World Cup's creation and hosted the inaugural four-team event, which also included Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. But they were defeated in the final by Great Britain in front of an expectant Parisian crowd. The next five World Cups, which took place in 1957, 1960, 1968, 1970 and 1972, featured the same four nations. Australia and Great Britain dominated - winning three times and twice respectively - within varied formats. The original trophy, which will be the one presented to the tournament winners, was stolen during the 1970 competition while on public display at Bradford's Midland Hotel and was not found again until 1990. The competition was revamped in 1975, becoming a five-team tournament with Great Britain splitting into England and Wales and the action being played over eight months as part of a ""World Series"". It returned to the previous format in 1977 as Australia defended their crown, before another overhaul - including the addition of Papua New Guinea - saw matches stretched over three years between 1985-1988 and 1989-1992. The unstoppable Kangaroos won both, including a 10-6 victory over Great Britain in front of a World Cup record crowd of 73,361 at Wembley in 1992. In 1995, to mark the centenary of rugby league's birth, an innovative new structure was adopted. The number of teams doubled to 10, with Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and South Africa participating for the first time. Australia's continued their dominance and also added the 16-nation version in 2000, when Lebanon, Russia, Ireland, Scotland and the Cook Islands made their bows.

Sterling had a hand in all four goals as the Blues romped to victory after falling behind at Burnley. The veteran of 82 caps last played for England at last year's World Cup and has just been left out of a fourth successive squad for a friendly with Australia and a Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy. ""I think a player with his experience knows he needs to perform and to show the manager of the national team he was wrong in the decision,"" said Pochettino after Chelsea scored four goals in a Premier League match for the first time since April 2022.  ""Only with performances and scoring goals is he going to show he deserved to go."" Sterling's heroics at Turf Moor came after 18-year-old French forward Wilson Odobert marked his first Premier League start by drilling low and hard past Robert Sanchez to send Burnley into raptures. Chelsea were disjointed for spells but were back on level terms before half-time thanks to an own goal. A cross by Sterling, back in the starting XI after a virus, struck the knee of Belgium defender Ameen Al-Dakhil and looped over James Trafford into the net. Chelsea, inspired by Sterling, then scored three times in a strong second-half showing to take the points. Sterling - a four-time Premier League winner - won a penalty after being fouled by Brazilian defender Vitinho, which allowed Cole Palmer to score his first goal for the Blues since moving from Manchester City. The former Manchester City player then scored his side's third with an arrowed finish after Conor Gallagher had spotted his run. Play restarted after Sterling's goal before referee Stuart Attwell stopped the game as a check by the video assistant referee (VAR) for a potential offside was still continuing. The goal was eventually allowed to stand. Substitute Nicolas Jackson sealed the points with a spin and finish, with Sterling once again involved in the move. Having won at Fulham on Monday, it is the first time Chelsea have secured back-to-back away wins in the Premier League since October 2022.

Chelsea have found goals hard to come by this season but, with Sterling running the show, they had no such problems in east Lancashire. ""I wouldn't say I had something to prove,"" Sterling told Match of the Day. ""I took the strike and I'm happy to score. We're just building, that's all we can do. Just keep building and keep working on the training field to replicate that in matches."" This was only Chelsea's seventh top-flight win in the calendar year and they remain a work in progress under Pochettino, with Arsenal expected to provide a much sterner test when the two sides meet after the international break on 21 October (17:30 BST). But having gone into September's international break with four points from four games, they now appear to be moving in the right direction with goals beginning to flow. This video can not be played Burnley 1-4 Chelsea: Burnley 'hurt' by poor decision-making - Vincent Kompany Burnley were looking to build momentum having won for the first time in the league this season at Luton on Tuesday. It looked to be going to plan for Vincent Kompany's side when the highly-rated Odobert scored his first Premier League goal. Odobert followed it up with a cross which almost led to a second goal before the Clarets defence crumbled after Al-Dakhil's own goal. Only bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United have conceded more than Burnley, who have not kept a clean sheet in the league since winning promotion. It is not only the defence that needs fixing. After five successive home league defeats, Burnley have to quickly find a way of winning in front of their own fans if they are to give themselves a chance of staying up. ""I wish there was a magic wand to solve everything but it's a lot of work on the training ground to get the basics right,"" said Clarets boss Kompany. ""We've done it in games and done it well but it's been spells and that's our own mistake and we have to work on it."" Kompany, who was part of two title-winning City sides with Sterling, could only puff out his cheeks when asked about his former team-mate. ""He's a top player,"" he added."
Yield Spread Analysis,Spurs score twice in stoppage time to stun Blades,2024-09-14,2023-09-15,Michael Beardmore,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66760556,"This video can not be played Match of the Day: How first Spurs home goal could revitalise Richarlison Richarlison's match-winning stoppage-time cameo against Sheffield United can help ease his off-field troubles, says Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou. The Brazil striker, who said this week he would ""seek psychological help"" for personal issues, came off the bench to head Spurs level eight minutes into the 16 added on. He then turned provider by picking out an unmarked Dejan Kulusevski in the box for the Sweden midfielder to fire home the winner. ""We've got to maintain a balance in life and even for him, he needs to understand his football is still good. He's a fantastic footballer,"" Postecoglou told BBC Sport. ""He's got so much to give and that can help ease the burden he's feeling in other parts of his life. I'm really pleased for him."" Until Richarlison's intervention, Spurs' unbeaten Premier League start under Postecoglou looked to be coming to an end thanks to a Gustavo Hamer strike that crept in off a post. Sheffield United had seemingly engineered a classic smash-and-grab away victory after soaking up pressure for long periods, with goalkeeper Wes Foderingham making a number of fine saves. But Richarlison glanced home fellow substitute Ivan Perisic's corner before Kulusevski left the gallant visitors, who had Oli McBurnie sent off at the end, broken-hearted. Having trailed until the 98th minute, Tottenham's turnaround was the latest winning comeback in Premier League history. ""There's some real resilience and spirit within that group already, which is great to see because they are a relatively new group,"" said Postecoglou. ""You get tested on days like this. It helps fuel belief for us to grow. Our supporters have had an unforgettable day and all those things help in what we are trying to do."" This video can not be played Postecoglou praises Tottenham 'resilience' after late win How did you rate Spurs' performance? Have your say here What did you make of Sheff Utd's display? Send us your views here Spurs have been hailed for their fine start to life under Postecoglou - and to life without Harry Kane - with their vibrant performances helping the Australian win the Premier League manager of the month award at his first attempt. But, of their four wins so far, this victory arguably might please him the most given the way Spurs had to battle and persevere to eke it out. Most of their opponents this season had been happy to go toe-to-toe with Postecoglou's famed 'Ange ball' philosophy, but that was always unlikely with Sheffield United. Paul Heckingbottom's side came with a clear gameplan to stifle Spurs, and it succeeded for much of the afternoon, although they still needed Foderingham to be at his best. He made an excellent near-post stop to foil Yves Bissouma in the first half and also thwarted Pape Matar Sarr, Son Heung-min, the lively Manor Solomon, James Maddison and Kulusevski. The visitors created the odd chance on the counter, James McAtee eliciting a smart save from Guglielmo Vicario in the first half, and Hamer pounced when Spurs fell asleep from a long throw. Gustavo Hamer's goal was his second for Sheffield United since joining from Coventry City in August Brennan Johnson thought he had equalised with virtually his first touch in a Spurs shirt, but the offside flag denied the deadline-day signing, leaving the stage clear for his fellow replacement to steal the show. Richarlison has endured a difficult time since leaving Everton for north London last summer, often employed as a substitute and scoring only once in the league before his header here. But he - and Postecoglou - will hope the honesty he displayed off the pitch this week and the impact he made on it against United can be the turning point of his Spurs career. A fourth successive victory means Spurs have their best start to a season for 57 years and keeps them second in the table before Postecoglou's first taste of a north London derby against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium next weekend. The winless United, meanwhile, remain on one point from five games despite redoubtable efforts against both Spurs and Manchester City - with all four of their losses coming by a single goal. They will be without McBurnie for at least one match after he was handed a second booking not long after Tottenham's winning goal. ""It's sickening for everyone involved in the dressing room - to come so close to three points, then thinking you're going to have settle for one, and come away with nothing,"" said Heckingbottom. ""But that doesn't alter the performance. Right now we have to be positive about how we played.  You can see how they celebrated when they won the game, we did that to them.""

Yield Spread Analysis,'Things coming together' as Hearts beat Motherwell,2024-09-14,2023-11-11,Clive Lindsay,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67318547,"Lawrence Shankland's flick evaded Blair Spittal at the far post Lawrence Shankland says ""you can see things coming together"" after his double secured a narrow win over Motherwell that lifts Heart of Midlothian up to fourth in the Scottish Premiership. The visiting captain prodded in from close range before Hearts were denied a penalty after a VAR check when strike partner Liam Boyce went down claiming a boot in the face. When Shankland slotted the second on the counter-attack - his fifth goal in five games - after the break, it looked like game over. But, when Motherwell were awarded a spot-kick, Blair Spittal gave the hosts hope of a similar fightback to the midweek draw with St Johnstone. However, Stuart Kettlewell's men fell short this time and have now gone nine games without a win - losing seven of them. Motherwell, who stay ninth, had not won a game since victory at Tynecastle in early September before the previous international break, but there was to be no deja vu as Hearts secured only their second win in six outings. Follow live coverage Keep up to date with Motherwell The latest at Hearts ""You want to win your game before the international break,"" Shankland told BBC Scotland. ""I think it's important. It's a long break and feels that way anyway when you're without a game.  ""You can kind of feel things getting better, things starting to click in games."" Kettlewell had brought Theo Bair back into his starting line-up and the striker was handed the opportunity to give his side an early lead only to head wastefully wide from a corner. Two of Steven Naismith's changes also almost paid dividends.  When Calum Butcher had a clearance charged down, it fell to Alex Lowry and the midfielder, who had already threatened with a curling drive, set up Boyce only for the unmarked striker to fire low and wide. Shankland made the difference, however, when he showed his predatory skills with a little flick to divert a Jorge Grant header into the far corner. Hearts thought they should have had a spot-kick when Boyce went down theatrically holding his face on the edge of the box following a high boot from Dan Casey.  Confusion reigned as referee David Munro, who appeared to stop the game for a potential head knock, resumed with a drop ball after being advised by VAR to have a second look having presumably decided there was minimal contact on the striker's chest rather than his face. Shankland wanted a penalty after a challenge at the back post, but Munro again waved play on after a VAR check, although the Scotland striker got his just deserts when he rounded goalkeeper Liam Kelly after a fine Beni Baningime through ball. It was Motherwell who did eventually get a spot-kick when Alex Cochrane blocked Oli Shaw's goalbound shot in the six-yard box. However, despite Spittal's clinical finish igniting some intense home pressure, there was to be no point rescued this time by the hosts. Given his two crucial goals, you can't really look beyond captain Lawrence Shankland as the one who made the difference. Bair had obviously done enough as a midweek substitute in that Perth fightback to earn a starting place as Kettlewell tweaked his formation. However, the more attacking intent failed to pay dividends and the striker was hooked at half-time, to be replaced with the man he had relegated to the bench - Brodie Spencer. It didn't change the narrative, with Motherwell going 2-0 down, as they had in midweek. Only this time their late pressure came up short and Kettlewell will again be left wondering how his side have waited until they are almost beaten before stepping up a gear. Naismith was looking for a response from last weekend's League Cup semi-final defeat by Rangers - and he got it in terms of the result at least. The creativity of on-loan Lowry, who could not face his parent club at Hampden, was crucial in establishing Hearts' lead. The pressure is eased on Naismith and he will be delighted that his side are now so high in the table considering they are yet to hit their best form. Motherwell manager Stuart Kettlewell: ""Again we get a rally with a penalty, but it's too little too late. We've shot ourselves in the foot again. ""I can't ask any more of them on the training field, but we have to rectify it and we have to do it quickly. They are flat coming off the park, but I can guarantee that the players and I will take responsibility for it."" Heart of Midlothian head coach Steven Naismith: ""It was a big win but one where we performed really well - we were brave on the ball. Overall, it was a good afternoon.  ""We scored goals and could have scored more and probably should have had a penalty. I think there's a penalty because there's contact. Twenty minutes later, there's another foul the exact same with less contact and it is given as a foul against us.""

Martin Boyle's arrowed first-half strike was enough to get his Hibs back on track after their three game-winning streak was ended in brutal fashion at Celtic Park on Wednesday.  The visitors thought they had doubled in their advantage in the second period, but VAR ruled Dylan Vente to be offside after he nodded home.  Victory sees Nick Montgomery's side move up to fourth, while Livingston stay rooted to the foot of the table.  The latest Livingston news Keep up to date with Hibernian But the Livingston manager is defiant in his side's ability to beat the drop, as well as defending his own position at the top-flight strugglers.  ""I've got to take full responsibility. I've got big enough shoulders,"" Martindale told BBC Scotland.  ""I've got a January window coming up and we can bring players in. Do I need to make the squad stronger? Of course I do. ""We played against a very good Hibs side today. I'm not trying to make excuses. I chose to be here. I'm up for the fight. I'm up for the challenge."" The hosts started with far more confidence than their lowly position and form would suggest, but failed to trouble David Marshall during the bright spell. Having barely forayed into the final third, Hibs were pitiless as Elie Youan's surging run allowed the ball to break the way of Boyle, who scored a trademark goal in the week he celebrated 300 appearances for the Leith club.  Already aggrieved after the sucker-punch, the home frustrations grew as play rolled on after Kurtis Guthrie tumbled in the box under pressure from Joe Newell.  VAR did not intervene on that occasion, though it would give Livingston reprieve when it ruled that Vente had nodded in from an offside position, sparing Shamal George's blushes following a howler at the back.  As has been the case in recent victories, Marshall was again required to maintain his side's lead, with two fine stops to keep out Sean Kelly and Bruce Anderson. David Martindale thought his side might be saved by a injury-time penalty following a Paul Hanlon handball, but striker Mo Sangare had strayed offside to further add to the West Lothian woes.  Boyle (left) didn't manage to grab a goal on his landmark 300th appearance on Wednesday. A legend in Leith, his strike proved the difference as his menace and work rate were both on show. When these sides last met in August, they both seemed so far away from the current entities that stepped out in the rain at Almondvale.  Hibs were bulldozered on the day in what was the final nail in the coffin of Lee Johnson's Easter Road tenure.  Before, they were rudderless. Here, they were ruthless. Before, they were soft. Here, they were solid.  Montgomery's men were far from their free-flowing best, but they showed plenty of determination and composure to grind one out in brutal conditions.  Based off that showing on a summer's day in the sunshine on Leith, Livingston looked destined for another season of defying expectation.  Martindale's side showed flashes of the outfit that has impressed the top-flight for years, but the grit and guile that had become synonymous with this side has seemingly seeped away.  Seven losses in a row, the last six without scoring. That makes them first team to suffer six successive top-flight defeats with no goals since Aberdeen in 1999.  The manager maintains that the changing room holds the necessary quality to escape the self-admitted ""crisis"" they find themselves in.  With every passing week, the lack of evidence to back up that belief up leaves Livingston languishing. Livingston manager David Martindale: ""I look at the game, I think we were really unlucky not to take anything from the game. I thought the players' application, effort, intensity was all there. ""I thought there was a penalty in the first half for Kurtis Guthrie. I'm disappointed the on-field referee wasn't asked to go and look at that."" This video can not be played Martindale 'knew how hard this season would be' Hibernian manager Nick Montgomery: ""It's a hard-fought three points. It was really difficult conditions for both teams. I'm really happy with the three points. ""It was a great finish from Boyley, who's just passed 300 games for the club. You can see how much it means to him and the boys. He's delivered the goods today."" Livingston are at home against as they welcome Kilmarnock next Saturday, while Hibs travel to Perth to face St Johnstone (both 15:00 GMT).

Yield Spread Analysis,Hidden rules of human progress,2024-09-14,2012-10-18,Samuel Arbesman,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20121018-hidden-rules-of-human-progress,"Our lives are governed by centuries of advances that haven’t been random, as mathematician and network scientist Samuel Arbesman argues there’s a pattern that reveals how our knowledge has changed over time. I had my first experience with the internet in the early 1990s. I activated our 300-baud modem, allowed it to begin its R2-D2-like hissing and whistling, and began to telnet. A window on our Macintosh’s screen began filling with text and announced our connection to the computers at the local university. After exploring a series of text menus, I began my first download: a text document containing Plato’s The Republic, via Project Gutenberg. After what felt like a significant fraction of an hour, I was ecstatic. I can distinctly remember jumping up and down, celebrating that I had this entire book on our computer using nothing but phone lines and a lot of atonal beeping. It took me almost a decade to actually get around to reading The Republic. By the time I did, the notion that I expressed wonder at such a mundane activity as downloading a text document seemed quaint. In 2012, people stream movies onto their computers nightly without praising the modem gods. We have gone from the days of early web pages, with their garish backgrounds and blinking text, to slick interactive sites with enough bells and whistles to make the entire experience smooth and multimedia based. No one thinks any longer about modems or the details of bandwidth speeds. And certainly no one uses the word baud anymore. The changes haven’t ended there. To store data, I have used floppy disks, diskettes, zip discs, rewritable CDs, flash drives, burnable DVDs, even the Commodore Datasette. Now, I save many of my documents to storage that’s available anytime I have access to the internet: the cloud. The technological revolution we’re currently experiencing is not a one-off, technology has been changing over the centuries. But what’s surprising is that if you look below the surface you discover that this progress is not random or erratic, it almost always follows a pattern. And understanding this pattern helps us to appreciate far more than faster download speeds or improved data storage. It helps us to understand something fundamental to our success as a species. It helps us to understand how our knowledge changes and evolves. Double up In technology, the best-known example of this pattern is Moore’s Law, which states that the processing power of a single chip or circuit will double every year. Gordon Moore, a retired chemist and physicist as well as the co-creator of the Intel Corporation, wasn’t famous or fabulously wealthy when he developed his law. In fact, he hadn’t even founded Intel yet. In 1965, Moore wrote a short paper, entitled Cramming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits, where he predicted the number of possible components placed on a single circuit for a fixed cost would double every year. He didn’t arrive at this conclusion through exhaustive amounts of data gathering and analysis; in fact, he based his law on only four data points. The incredible thing is that he was right. This law has held roughly true since 1965; it has weathered the personal computer revolution, the march of processors from 286 to 486 to Pentium, and the many advances since then. While further data has shown that the period for doubling is closer to eighteen months than a year, the principle stands. Processing power grows every year at a constant rate rather than by a constant amount. And according to the original formulation, the annual rate of growth is about 200%. But when processing power doubles rapidly it allows much more to be possible, and therefore many other developments occur as a result. For example, the number of pixels that digital cameras can process has increased directly due to the regularity of Moore’s Law. This ongoing doubling of technological capabilities has even reached the world of robots. Rodney Brooks, a professor at MIT and a pioneer in the field, found that how far and how fast a robot can move goes through a doubling about every two years: right on schedule and similar to Moore’s Law. You could argue that this has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once Moore’s prediction came to pass, it was simply a matter of working hard to ensure it continued to do so. The industry has a continued stake in trying to reach the next milestone predicted by Moore’s Law, because if any company ever fell behind this curve, it would be out of business. But while Moore provided a name to something, the phenomenon he named didn’t actually create it. If you generalise Moore’s Law from chips to simply thinking about information technology and processing power in general, Moore’s Law becomes the latest in a long line of technical rules of thumb that explain extremely regular changes in technology over the last few centuries. Chris Magee, a professor at MIT in the Engineering Systems Division, has measured these changes. Together with his postdoctoral fellow, Heebyung Koh, he compiled a vast data set of all the different instances of information transformation that have occurred throughout history. By lining up one technology after another – from calculations done by hand in 1892 that clocked in at a little under one calculation a minute to today’s machines – a pattern emerged. Despite the differences among all of these technologies, human brains, punch cards, vacuum tubes, integrated circuits, the overall increase in humanity’s ability to perform calculations has progressed quite smoothly and extremely quickly. Put together, there has been a roughly exponential increase in our information transformation abilities over time. But how does this happen? How can all of these combined technologies yield such a smooth and regular curve? When someone develops a new innovation, it is often largely untested. As its developers improve and refine it, they begin to realise the potential of this new innovation. Its capabilities begin to grow exponentially, but then a limit is reached. And when that limit is reached there is the opportunity to bring in a new technology, even if it’s still tentative, untested and buggy. Combine all these successions of technologies together and what you get is a smooth curve of progresss. Giant’s shoulders So technological knowledge exhibits rapid growth just like scientific knowledge. But the relationship between the progression of technological facts and that of science is tightly intertwined. Take the periodic table of chemical elements. We know that the number of known elements has steadily increased over time. However, while the number appears to have grown relatively smoothly over the centuries, if you look at the data more closely, a different picture emerges. As science historian Derek de Solla Price found, the periodic table has grown by a series of logistic curves. He argued that each of these was due to a successive technological advance or approach. For example, from the beginnings of the scientific revolution in the late 17th Century until the late 19th Century, more than sixty elements were discovered, using various chemical techniques, including electrical shocks, to separate compounds into their constituent parts. However, these approaches soon reached their limits, and the discoveries slowed. But, following a Moore’s Law-like trajectory, a new technology arose. The particle accelerator was created, and its atom-smashing ability enabled further discoveries. As particle accelerators of increasing energies have been developed, we have discovered heavier and larger chemical elements. In a very real way, these advances have allowed for new facts. Technological growth facilitates changes in facts, sometimes rapidly, in many areas: sequencing new genomes (nearly two hundred distinct species were sequenced as of late 2011); finding new asteroids (often done using sophisticated computer algorithms that can detect objects moving in space); even proving new mathematical theorems through increasing computer power. The question is why everything adheres to these exponential curves and grows so rapidly. A likely answer is related to the idea of cumulative knowledge. Anything new – an idea, discovery, or technological breakthrough – must be built upon what is known already. This is generally how the world works. Scientific ideas build upon one another to allow for new scientific knowledge and technologies, and are the basis for new breakthroughs. When it comes to technological and scientific growth, we can bootstrap what we have learned towards the creation of new facts. We must gain a certain amount of knowledge in order to learn something new. So, while exponential growth is not a self-fulfilling proposition, there is feedback, which leads to a sort of technological imperative: as there is more technological or scientific knowledge on which to grow, new technologies increase the speed at which they grow. But why does this continue to happen? Technological or scientific change doesn’t happen automatically; people are needed to create new ideas and concepts. The answer is that in addition to knowledge accumulation, we need to understand another factor that’s important to knowledge progression: population growth. Rapid spread In an incredibly sweeping and magnificent article, entitled Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million BC to 1990, economist Michael Kremer argues that the growth of human population over the history of the world is consistent with how technological change happens.  Kremer does this in an elegant way, making only a small set of assumptions. First, he states that population growth is limited by technological progress. This is one of those assumptions that has been around since Thomas Malthus, and it is based on the simple fact that as a population grows we need more technology to sustain the population, whether through more efficient food production, more efficient waste management, or other similar considerations. Conversely, Kremer also states that technological growth should be proportional to population size. If invention occurs at the same rate for each person, the more people there are, the more innovation there should be. (More recent research, however, shows that population density often causes innovation to grow faster than population size, so this seems like an underestimate.) Travel and communication must also play a significant role in the spread of facts and knowledge. For instance, David Bradley, a British epidemiologist, discovered the extent to which populations have spread in an elegant way. He plotted the lifetime distances travelled by the men in his family over four generations. His great grandfather only travelled around the village of Kettering, north of London – which could be encompassed in a square that is about 25 miles (40 kilometres) on each side. His grandfather, however, travelled as far as London, defined by a square that is about 250 miles (400 km) on each side. Bradley’s father was even more cosmopolitan and travelled throughout Europe; his lifetime movements could be spread throughout a space around 2,500 miles (4,000 km) on each side. Bradley himself, a world-famous scientist, travelled across the globe. While the Earth is not a square grid, he travelled in a range that is around 25,000 miles (40,000 km) on a side, about the circumference of the Earth. A Bradley man moved ten times farther throughout the course of his life with each successive generation, an exponential increase of an order of magnitude more extensive in each direction than his father. Bradley was concerned with the effect that this increase in travel would have on the spread of disease. But the Bradley family’s exponentially increasing travel distances illustrates not only advances in technology; it is indicative of how technology’s march can itself allow for the greater dispersal of other knowledge. The speed at which individuals, information and ideas can spread has greatly increased in the past several hundred years. And, unsurprisingly, it has done so according to mathematical rules. The upper limit of travel distances made by people in France in a single day has exponentially increased over a 200-year period, for example, mirroring Bradley’s anecdotal evidence. Similar trends hold for air and sea transportation. The curves for sea transport begin a bit earlier (around 1750), and air transit of course starts later (from the 1920s onwards), but like movement over land, these other modes of transportation obey clear mathematical regularities. These transportation speeds have clear implications for how the world around us changes. For instance, Cesare Marchetti, an Italian physicist and systems analyst, examined the city of Berlin in great detail and showed that the city has grown in tandem with technological developments. From its early dimensions, when it was hemmed in by the limits of pedestrians and coaches, to later times, when its size ballooned alongside the electric trams and subways, Berlin’s general shape was dictated by the development of ever more powerful technologies. Marchetti showed that Berlin’s expanse grew according to a simple rule of thumb: the distance reachable by current technologies in thirty minutes or less. As travel speeds increased, so too did the distance traversable and the size of the city. So we arrive at the foundations of a variety of ever-changing facts based on the development of travel technologies: the natural size of a city; how long information takes to wing its way around the world; and how distant a commute a reasonable person might be expected to endure. And from communication and urban growth to information processing and medical developments, the facts of our everyday lives are governed by technological progress. While the details of each technological development might be unknown – what I can download, or how many more transistors can be crammed into a square inch, for instance – there are mathematically defined, predictable regularities to how these changes occur. All of these facts, ever changing, are subject to the rules of technological change. And more often than not these ultimately follow a defined pattern: their own mini-Moore’s Law.   This is an edited extract from The Half-Life Of Facts: Why Everything We Know Has An Expiration Date, by Samuel Arbesman.

Yield Spread Analysis,The race to stop a global killer,2024-09-14,2012-11-21,Katharine Sanderson,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20121121-the-race-to-stop-a-global-killer,"A deadly fungus sweeping the world is behind the mass death of hundreds of amphibian species. Researchers in Europe have teamed up to work out how to stop it – can they succeed? Scientific endeavour isn’t always as glamorous as crashing atoms into each other deep underground in Switzerland, or sending rovers to roam the surface of Mars looking for clues to life. For Dirk Schmeller, a researcher at the CNRS research centre in Moulis, southern France, there are more fundamental problems to deal with – like how to get a stubborn ass to shift. Donkeys and mules may not be the most hi-tech option for lugging large volumes of water down a Pyrenees mountain, but it’s the most effective… until you get an uncooperative animal, of course. “We can thank Gaston and Justin, but we aren’t thanking Emile,” says biologist Adeline Loyau, Schmeller’s co-worker and wife, while discussing who to include in the acknowledgements section when writing up their research. Gaston, Justin and Emile were the donkeys Loyau and Schmeller hired to carry lake-water samples down from the mountain last summer. Her displeasure with Emile stems from a stressful day she spent unsuccessfully trying to get the beast to budge, in turn condemning Loyau to a backbreaking hike to and from a lake with up to 30 kilos (66 pounds) of water. The donkeys have a key role in trying and save some of the world’s most vulnerable amphibians from their plight. Schmeller, Loyau and their colleagues are part of a Europe-wide project, RACE (Risk Assessment of Chytridiomycosis to European Amphibian Biodiversity), investigating – and trying to halt the spread of – a fungal disease that threatens to devastate amphibian populations across the globe. The disease is already responsible for the mass death of over 350 amphibian species, pushing many to the brink of extinction. “If a single pathogen were causing the death, decline and extinction of 30% of mammal species (including humans), the entire world would be paying attention,” wrote the evolutionary biologists Valerie McKenzie and Anna Peterson from the University of Colorado last month. “This is what has been happening to the world's amphibians.” Jaime Bosch first encountered the amphibian threat in Europe just over a decade ago. He was studying communication between midwife toads (Alytes obstreticans) in a lake in the Peñalara national park outside Madrid, when his worst nightmare began to appear before his eyes. The toads were beginning to die off in huge numbers, a once thriving lake became a graveyard for countless floating bodies. By 1999, Bosch and his colleagues at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid reported that no living animals were found in 86% of the toad’s usual mating ponds in Central Spain. But this wasn’t just happening in Spain. Thousands of dead amphibians were found floating in waters in North and Central America, and Australia. What was causing this mass slaughter seemed to have little regard for borders or which species it infected. In 1999, scientists finally tracked down the culprit and gave the disease a name: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd. “Lakes of death” Since then, a handful of scientists have got together to track its spread throughout Europe. Fungal epidemiologist Matthew Fisher, now at Imperial College, London, recalls how he first got involved in Europe’s Bd fight in 2002. He had just returned to the UK from studying the evolution of killer fungi at the University of Berkeley, California, when he read Bosch’s work on this mysterious new disease. Fisher got in touch, little suspecting the gruesome nature of what he was about to encounter. “Jaime started FedEx-ing me these boxes of rotting frogs,” Fisher explains. As well as stinking out a lab, rotten bodies aren’t very useful for studying the genetic roots of the disease. Fisher needed a live sample of the fungus, but even Bd has its limits, and is easily killed by the bacteria in rotting flesh. “You have to get it from a frog that is either close to death, or recently dead,” he says. Once he started to receive very fresh animals, Fisher managed to successfully grow the fungus in culture. “From that point on we could look at it's virulence, and genetics, and to start to do proper epidemiology,” he says. Fisher was finally in a position to study the genome of the disease, to try and understand how it evolved. In 2003, Fisher and Bosch began driving around Spain looking for amphibians to sample for the disease. At the end of a long days’ hiking in the Spanish Pyrenees they arrived at a mountain lake called Ibon Acherito. They were confronted by an amphibian horror scene, a “lake of death” Fisher says. “We saw dead animals everywhere,” says Fisher. They found more gruesome scenes in other lakes in the Aspe and Lescun valleys of the French Western Pyrenees. Ever since that grisly hiking trip Fisher and his team have been regularly revisiting the lakes to monitor the health of the animals and the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, Schmeller arrived at the tiny French Pyrenean village of Moulis, tucked away in the lush, remote Ariege area of Southern France. Moulis hosts a French national research centre, and Schmeller started work there in 2007 to monitor the area's biodiversity. Around the time Fisher and Bosch were getting to grips with rotten toads and frogs, Schmeller was investigating the population genetics of waterfrogs at the University of Mainz, Germany, and met PhD student Trent Garner through his work. Garner moved to Fisher’s lab, and realised that Schmeller, newly landed in Moulis, was perfectly poised to investigate this mysterious disease in the Pyrenees. “I was working with amphibians and genetics before, but diseases was a whole new thing to me,” says Schmeller. They gathered together other researchers, and initiated the Europe-wide RACE project, with €1.5 million funding from the EU’s Biodiversa network, as a concerted, organised effort to understand Bd in Europe. Schmeller’s team work with Fisher in the Aspe and Lescun valleys, and also monitor eastern Pyrenean lakes every year, to see whether Bd has reached them. There they hike up to the Bassies mountain refuge in the Auzat-Vicdessos valley, and spend hours waist-deep in cool mountain lakes, collecting frogs, toads and newts. They swab them, weigh and measure them and sometimes mark them with tiny electronic tags. Cold comfort So far, even though Bd has reached the western Pyrenees, the lakes Schmeller and his colleagues are monitoring in the east are disease-free, although Schmeller doesn’t expect them to remain so for much longer. “You can run but you can’t hide from Bd. It will get there in the end,” Fisher told a meeting of all RACE participants in May this year. The end is pretty horrific for frogs, toads and other amphibians. Once Bd infection sets in, the skin thickens. This is deadly for amphibians because they absorb water and nutrients through their skin, not through the mouth like we do. The disruption in fluid balance leads to heart failure, and eventually death. As suspects go, Bd is probably one that you’d have least pointed the finger at. The group of fungi it belongs to is an obscure species called chytrids, which normally feed on dead, decaying plants. Something clearly converted them from a vegetarian to a carnivore diet. What’s also interesting is that the disease doesn’t always wipe out amphibian populations, so something else is at play too. Both the Penalara and the Pyrenean work show that altitude is critical to the devastating effect of Bd. Usually, midwife toad eggs laid in spring hatch into tadpoles after a few weeks. The next weeks and months see the tadpoles metamorphose into toadlets, at which point they hop off to enjoy life out of the pond. But tadpoles born in high-altitude mountain lakes do something unique: they stay as tadpoles over winter. Once summer warms the mountains briefly the following year, they continue to grow slowly. Sometimes this process can go on for several years. There seems to be a link between overwintering and the disease's deadliness. Tadpoles in frozen-over lakes all huddle together in the deepest part of the lake where the water isn’t frozen – it usually stays around 4C. The disease tends to gather around the tadpoles’ mouths, and as these chilly tadpoles wriggle around they pass on the infection to other tadpoles they come into contact with. “At 4 degrees there’s not much the immune system can do about it,” says Schmeller. The Bd spores become concentrated over the years, leading to infections that are much more severe at high altitudes than at lower altitudes. When these high-altitude tadpoles finally metamorphose into toads, the disease overwhelms them and the effort is too much: they die. To dig into the effects of the disease, Schmeller carries out experiments in the more comfortable conditions of his lab in Moulis. A concrete shed houses row upon row of small plastic water-filled tanks the size of office water cooler bottles, each home to a midwife toad at some stage in its development, monitored regularly for the disease and any changes in physiology or behaviour. Some of these experiments are done with Bd-infected water from the Aspe valley, hence Schmeller’s need for those donkeys. Infected tadpoles apparently need to invest some energy in fighting the infection, and they are smaller when they reach the toadlet stage, says Schmeller. They’ve also seen that when they cool down infected toadlets to 4 degrees for just five or ten minutes, they die very quickly, while the ones that were not infected don’t. In other words, the animals can live with Bd until there’s an additional pressure, Schmeller explains. “This is something we need to understand better, especially under climate change scenarios,” he says. Killer trade What also needs to be understood is how to treat the disease. There have been various unsuccessful attempts; for instance, Bosch and Fisher’s teams have tried treating animals in Spain, the Western Pyrenees, and the Balearic island of Majorca with the anti-fungal agent itraconazole. While this can get rid of the disease, it often ends up killing infected toads as well. And in other cases, in Mallorca for example, early experiments to treat infected larvae cleared the disease, but once they were returned to their lakes or rivers, they became re-infected. Over in the small town of Rascafria in the Penalara park, Bosch has built a breeding centre to try another another tack – repopulate the area with animals that have survived Bd outbreaks. Work has been slow going, and again results have been mixed, but he is beginning to see some success. “We are using the last surviving animals after 10 years of the outbreak to breed with them, and their offspring look more resistant,” he says. The big test will come when these animals are released into the wild. That’s because we still don’t know how Bd arrived into these mountainous areas in the first place. In the western Pyrenees, there have been at least two separate infections, with several theories about their origins. The disease could have been unwittingly spread on the muddy boot of a hiker, or stuck to the feet of ducks or other water fowl. Or perhaps stocking lakes with fish, or hydroelectric pumping brought Bd in.   Another possibility is that the fungus was introduced into countries through trade: two of the main suspects being the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), which is used in biological research; and the North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeina), which is prized for its meat. Trade laws are in urgent need of updating, if Bd’s global spread is to be halted, says RACE participant Mark Auliya, a herpetologist and trade-policy expert at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. Pet fairs are big business, and exotic amphibians go for handsome sums. Yet these animals aren’t tightly regulated and could easily be carrying Bd or other infectious diseases. The importance of regulating trade really hit home recently after Fisher and his team published a detailed look at Bd’s genome. When Fisher and his team deciphered the DNA from 20 fungus samples, they found three distinct strains of Bd. One is isolated in South Africa, another in Switzerland, both of which aren’t as deadly as the third. The bad news for the European team is that the third strain, the one found in the Pyrenees, is hypervirulent – extra deadly. This strain, BdGPL, is also responsible for infections in Central and North America, and Australia. It seems likely the only way the fungus travelled such distances is through human movements – mainly through trade. That trade could also be responsible for BdGPL’s deadly characteristics – its genome reveals that it was formed from the recombination of different, possibly harmless, strains of Bd to become the lethal frog-killing fungus. “We’re dealing with a much more complex evolutionary history than previously expected,” says Fisher. Stay vigilant So far the story seems gloomy at best. Amid all the monitoring experiments, mitigation efforts and genomic analyses, it’s hard to see a rosy prognosis for amphibians, particularly those destined to live at high altitudes. “The reintroduction doesn’t work, disinfection is very difficult, cleaning of ponds in Mallorca didn’t work,” says Schmeller. “It’s very difficult.” Time will tell. Optimism is essential for researchers in this field, and Fisher thinks there are reasons to be cheerful. “I’d be very sceptical of a shock horror story in Europe,” he says, despite having witnessed “lakes of death” for himself. Bd will continue to cause population declines in high altitude places, including the Pyrenees, he predicts, but things could change. One glimmer of light is that Fisher’s genome work revealed something else about Bd – “the fungus has an extraordinarily dynamic genome,” he says, “This means there could be very rapid selection for less virulent lineages,” Fisher explains. It makes sense: the disease can’t propagate if it kills off all its hosts. What would be a much better scenario for the fungus’s survival is a milder version that can live together with the amphibians it infects. Bosch, who first witnessed the devastating effects of Bd, agrees. “In the end, most amphibian species here will co-exist with Bd,” he says. That’s not to say that amphibians are safe. “Just for a few of them, in high elevation areas, most populations will disappear,” Bosch adds. “In my opinion, the key is just to try to keep these populations alive for a few generations to allow natural selection to act.” This is why he believes his breeding centre is so important. Schmeller is about to take up a new post at the Helmholtz institute in Leipzig, but he’s determined to keep a close eye on amphibians in the Pyrenees, even if natural selection might end up being the only answer. “We need to stay vigilant,” he says. So until Bd is better understood, or trade rules tightened to control its spread, Schmeller and his team will continue wading through chilly mountain lakes swabbing toads and newts. With or without the help of those stubborn donkeys. If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Yield Spread Analysis,Why we are all scientists now,2024-09-14,2012-03-29,Dan Drollette,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120329-citizen-science-enters-a-new-era,"From China to the Congo, a new wave of volunteer science projects aims to allow amateur participants to actively gather data for the benefit of their communities. Earthquake researchers have a problem. So do scientists trying to investigate the spread of deadly malaria. Whilst conservationists trying to get a handle on the state of illegal logging may have it worst of all. What connects all of these is that when it comes to cracking some of their field’s biggest issues, traditional science methods are not fully up to the task. The earthquake researchers would like to have monitoring systems that fully span high-risk areas, but having enough research-grade sensors that cover hundreds of miles of fault lines would cost them millions and millions of dollars. Swiss malaria researchers need to run enormous numbers of calculations to simulate the spread of malaria worldwide; valuable information for governments deciding where best to spend limited resources on life-saving interventions. But the computing power to run it is too expensive. Whilst in the deep, lush forests of the Congo Basin having enough well-trained people to monitor illegal tree felling and poaching is almost impossible. But science is changing. In the age of the internet it is waking up the idea of people power: the combined forces of thousands of ordinary connected volunteers can help collect or crunch overwhelming masses of data. “There’s so many people that can take part in this way, I think crowd-sourcing could almost be more important than the development of the Web,” says Ben Segal, who has worked on many volunteer computing projects at the at the European Particle Physics Laboratory, Cern – and who mentored, among others a young Tim Berners-Lee, who would go on to invent the World Wide Web. “Citizen science” is not a new concept. So-called “volunteer computing” projects have expanded rapidly since the launch of Seti@Home in 1999, a program that still uses the power of millions of ordinary computers in screen-saver mode to help search for signs of intelligent life in the universe. Tapping into aspects of computer processing power, such as recharging modes, and making use of previously wasted “cycles”, desktops or laptops from people scattered worldwide can band together to mimic the number-crunching power of a supercomputer. By the end of the last decade, several projects were using volunteer computing power for solving complex problems, ranging from cataloguing stars in the distant corners of the universe with Galaxy Zoo to predicting the complex three dimensional structures of protein structures with FoldIt. There is even a site (scistarter.com) devoted to the growing popularity of citizen science, where people can discover, take part in and fund research projects. But those at the forefront of the field say that citizen science is now beginning to enter a new era. What has changed is a growing sense that participants can actively take part in projects, rather than passively allowing their idle computer to do the grunt work. “Their feeling is that science is too important to be left to scientists alone,” says Francois Grey from the Citizen Cyberscience Centre, a collaboration set up in 2009 between CERN, the University of Geneva, and the United Nations, with seed money from the Shuttleworth Foundation. Tools for the trade Grey’s Citizen Cyberscience Centre is one of the main operations pushing citizen science into unexplored territories. One reason Grey says this is becoming increasingly possible is that the technology barrier is dropping, so more and more sophisticated hardware can be placed in citizen’s hands. One project the CCC supports – the “Quake Catcher Network”, or QCN as it is known  – epitomizes the trend towards ever-smaller, more nimble devices, based upon the latest chips. A customized external motion-detecting device with a USB plug turns peoples’ ordinary desktops into automated earthquake detectors. Connect computers via the internet to a centralized system, or server, and you now have a wide-ranging system that maps an earthquake’s aftermath. The network has been tested in the San Francisco Bay Area, and sensors were sent to New Zealand following the earthquake in September 2010 to learn more about the occurrence of “aftershocks” – which are almost as dangerous as the main event itself. In November last year, researchers at Taiwan’s Academia Sinica set up a server to monitor the quake-prone island that lies between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates. The sensors were developed by Elizabeth Cochran of the US Geological Survey and Jesse Lawrence of Stanford University an currently cost between $60 and $200 per sensor, a fraction of the cost of professional seismometers which can cost anything up to $100,000 apiece. The QCN devices only have a fraction of the sensitivity of research-grade seismometers, but what they lack in sensitivity, they more than make up for in sheer volume, says Lawrence. “With many more cheap sensors, instead of guessing where strong motions were felt by interpolating between research sensors, we should be able to know where strong motions were felt immediately, because we have (QCN) sensors there.” And soon there could be an army of mobile “quake-catchers”, according to QCN’s Carl Christensen. Smartphones are ideal for the task, as they already have built-in motion-detectors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and GPS signaling. By summer 2012 QCN expects to release an app that turns your Android smartphone into a pocket-sized earthquake sensor. Soon after, they hope to send 1,000 sensor-equipped phones to places where a fault-line has just slipped. Some of the hardware being adopted in other citizen science projects also hail from unexpected origins. A major advance in scientific computing came from the development of superfast 3D Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to run video games on Sony’s PlayStation 3 console. GPUs can do 10 times more than an ordinary chip. Consequently, Dave Anderson, founder of the open-source software platform BOINC, foresees volunteer computing at an “exascale” level – about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second – 100 times more powerful than today’s top supercomputers. Gaming for gain The scientific benefits of volunteer computing can be enormous, and consequently there are a host of efforts looking to capitalise on people’s unused processing power. For example, malariacontrol.net simulates the spread of the disease on computer – helping governments decide how to invest most effectively on, for instance, bednets versus vaccines. In 2005, the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute’s 40-strong office computers struggled to run the enormous numbers of epidemiological simulations needed to get “real-world” results. After turning to volunteer computing, they now have the computing power of up to 15,000 desktops working simultaneously. Nicolas Maire, a researcher for the organization, estimates that this figure is the equivalent of a single desktop computer operating between 800 and 1,000 years. “Realistically, it would have been unfeasible to do in any other way,” he admits. But it is not all serious work. Some of the most successful volunteer computing approaches have their roots in the world of gaming. Designers and software engineers are taking algorithms and game design principles and using them to solve longstanding scientific puzzles that require complex computer calculations. The programs they are creating encourage volunteers to donate spare processing power by turning it into an online game where people compete and collaborate with each other. In FoldIt, for instance, players bend, pull and fold digital versions of protein molecules on their computer screens. Building the protein components needed for life involves a complex set of machinery in our cells translating information encoded in our genes into a sequence of amino acids, which are then wrapped and folded by into a three-dimensional form designed to carry out its required function. The amino-acid sequence dictates the shape the protein will eventually adopt, but even small proteins can potentially fold in a huge number of different ways, and so it is always a challenge for computers to figure out which of the many possible structures is the best one. With around 240,000 registered players FoldIt is proving invaluable for researchers trying to solve the complex structural and folding patterns of proteins. Players can bend and pull proteins into their optimum shape, as long as they obey the rules of physics. The closer your attempts at protein origami adhere to those rules, the more points you get. In recent months the game-playing volunteers have shown they can both actively predict protein structures and design new proteins. Last September, scientists reported the structure of a key enzyme that allows HIV to replicate, making it an obvious target for drugs. The precise protein structure had stumped them for almost 15 years, but the FoldIt community produced it within days. In January this year, gamers produced the first crowdsourced protein redesign – revving up the performance of an enzyme for one of the most important reactions organic chemists use to build compounds ranging from drugs to pesticides. Another online program, Phylo, is advancing scientists’ knowledge of genetics by making a game out of DNA matching. If areas of genetic sequence are roughly similar between species, it suggests strongly that they could have an important function. Finding them has been beyond the scope of computer algorithms. But earlier this month, researchers published a study where gamers outsmarted the best computers – they made the best possible DNA sequence match between up to eight species at a time. Active citizens Despite these notable successes, CCC’s Grey is quick to point out that volunteer computing does not provide a universal solution. “There are certain problems you can crack with a supercomputer that would be hopeless with volunteer computing,” he says. Supercomputers are best suited for problems where thousands of processors must communicate with each other and swap data frequently during a calculation, according to Grey. Volunteer computing works best on easily shared problems that are divisible into digestible pieces that can be worked on in any order at any time. That said, the successes highlight how much volunteers want more of an active role in citizen science. Volunteers do not just want to contribute data passively to a study, they want to learn and develop as a result of taking part. Some projects have volunteer-run support, forums and message boards. Scientists, volunteers, and the open-source community gather at hackfests to find volunteer programming and computing solutions to science problems. Cern’s Segal says he has been struck by volunteer’s appetite for learning on projects like LHC@Home, and that volunteer computing seems to attract a lot of retired scientists and teachers, as well as people with a degree in science who wound up doing some other job. “We’ve had a number of cases of people who put in hours of unpaid labour to help newbies,” he says. “The advantage is that it can be self-policing, much like the original Wikipedia.” Getting extreme But the deepest forests of the Congo Basin may provide a glimpse of where citizen science could be heading. An initiative aims to help pygmy tribes fight logging and poaching in this area by allowing them to document destruction and deforestation with games and interactive maps. This initiative is part of the Extreme Citizen Science programme based at University College London, which officially launched in February this year. Headed by computer scientist and geographer Muki Haklay and anthropologist Jerome Lewis, the idea is to allow any community, regardless of their literacy to start, run, and analyse a scientific study – whether it is to advance interests, or to effect policy change. “We want to move citizen science from the educated to everyone,” says Haklay. Working in a part of east London called Deptford, Haklay and his colleagues set up a community project where individuals monitored the noise pollution coming from a local scrapyard. By creating a bank of local data that showed the operation was violating noise limits, the UK Environment Agency revoked the scrapyard’s licence. Lewis meanwhile is working with indigenous people in the Republic of Congo and Cameroon to develop data collection tools that can be used by non-literate people. In the 1990s, vast regions of forest in the Congo Basin were divided up and sold to multinational companies to mine resources. But by the mid-2000s, many of these companies wanted FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification to signify products that are from responsibly harvested and verified sources, and they turned to people like Lewis for help. So Lewis devised ways for monitoring what the indigenous people wanted to preserve, for instance, trees from which they harvest a particularly delicious and tradable species of caterpillar. People are equipped with touchscreen devices with icons for various options like “valuable tree” that they can select and tag with GPS coordinates. “What is good is that these maps will do the talking for communities,” says Lewis. However, there are still several fundamental issues to resolve with these types of projects. One is how you train people adequately for the task. Another is how scientists can ensure that the methods used and quality of data are robust enough when people have a clear stake in the outcome. Making data-collection protocols, instruments and analysis as robust as possible can overcome malicious or accidental bias, says Haklay. “The importance of smartphones as scientific instruments cannot be underestimated in this context: GPS provides accurate time and good location; phone pictures provide location and timestamps (which are unlikely to be tampered by non-literate and technically challenged users), which provide you with evidence; and when they communicate with air pollution sensors or a microphone about noise level, for instance, you have a time stamped observation from an instrument.” Another concern is that there are simply not enough potential volunteers available. CCC’s Grey points out that with only 40% of the population of China hooked up to the internet so far, that means there’s potentially another half-billion about to join. Already a number of citizen science projects are trying to harness the large number of potential volunteers in China, and the first project devised by Chinese scientists launched in 2010. Researchers at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, with the support of IBM’s World Community Grid, set up Computing for Clean Water to use computing power from more than 50,000 volunteers to virtually design better low-cost, low-pressure water filters, which will hopefully make water purification cheaper and more accessible. And this interest will only increase, says Grey. “I did the maths, and every second another Chinese person joins the Internet for the first time – and all of them could potentially donate computing time on their laptop or tablet or phone,” he says. “So, when someone says there are just not enough possible volunteer computers out there, I say that at one new Chinese internet user per second, don’t worry.” If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Yield Spread Analysis,How far can vertical farming go?,2024-09-14,2023-01-12,William Park,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230106-what-if-all-our-food-was-grown-in-indoor-vertical-farms,"Vertical farming promises a future in which our food is grown in pockets of spaces in our cities and beneath our feet. But how far can it really go? When the Pasona Urban Farm opened in the nine-storey office of a Japanese recruitment company in 2010, it promised a future in which food was grown within feet of the people who would eat it. Tomatoes hung down from meeting-room light fittings, a rice paddy filled a large conference space, and mushrooms grew in drawers hidden discreetly under benches. The office looked more like a museum of farming than a place of work. While the modern concept of vertical farming – growing food in trays or pipes stacked on top of one another like a giant plant lasagne – dates from around the 1990s, it could be argued that farmers have sought ways to grow more in less space and with less soil for centuries. Step-over fruit trees – usually apple and pear trees – are grown as low as 1ft (30cm) off the ground and spread laterally to fill thin strips of space in allotments and orchards. The step-over technique is based on espalier training, which might date back to Ancient Roman grape cultivation. But vertical farming in the modern sense is now spreading rapidly. One example is the vertically farmed strawberry brand Oishii, based in New Jersey. In 2021, a punnet of its coveted Japanese Omakase strawberries retailed for $50 (£44) in a high-end New York supermarket. For some, this was evidence that with time vertical farming could rival and ultimately exceed traditional farming for quality. For others, the outlandish price highlighted the huge challenge to make vertical farms commercially viable. While the technology shows much promise, the costs in both money and energy are still high. This means leafy salads, smaller vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and strawberries – high value crops which grow quickly – are about the limit of what is currently available commercially from vertical farms. But where exactly is the limit of what we can actually grow in a vertical farm? And if we did find a way to overcome the problems of cost and energy use, what would a world where all our food is grown in such farms look like? Could we ever move to completely soil-free farming? Farming upwards There is no strict definition of what a vertical farm is, but they typically consist of shallow trays stacked within a building, lit with LED lighting at each level. Many vertical farms have no windows and some are even built underground. These kinds of farms must supply everything – water, nutrients, sunlight and possibly pollinators and pest control too. Others might be built in massive greenhouses – making the most of the Sun's light and heat, but still controlling other inputs like water. What If...? This article is part of ""What If…"", a series which uses real-world evidence to explore hypothetical questions about would-be worlds. You might also like: While sometimes soil is used, increasingly vertical farms use hydroponic or aeroponic systems, where water (for hydroponics) or water vapour (for aeroponics) infused with nutrients is circulated directly around the roots of the plant. ""The water efficiency and nutrient efficiency is really quite high in hydroponics and aeroponics because the roots are able to get those nutrients and water in a lot quicker,"" says Laura Vickers, a plant biologist and head of the Urban Farming Group at Harper Adams University in the UK. ""There's no organic matter, there's nothing else for the plant to compete with or to extract the water from."" This means using vertical farms can considerably reduce both the water and fertilisers needed to grow food. Meanwhile, the closed-off, controlled environment of vertical farms can help to stop pests getting in – in turn possibly reducing the need for pesticides.   The technology can also allow crops to grow in locations where conventional farming is not possible. Astronauts on the International Space Station, for example, are growing their own food in soilless systems under LED lights – with cabbage, mizuna mustard, lettuce and kale among the crops on the menu. More generally, though, the small amount of land needed for vertical farms means food can be grown near to cities, says Natalia Falagan, an engineer from Cranfield University in the UK, which could give huge benefits. Shorter supply chains could improve both food security and the quality of food, since the faster food reaches us, the less its nutrients deteriorate and the less unseen toxins, such as mycotoxins, develop. It would also result in far fewer food miles than many imported alternatives and help to guarantee the provenance of crops, she says, while also reducing the burden on natural resources like soil, water and the atmosphere. What's more, with advanced plant science, the crops could be engineered to be healthier and tastier, she adds. Having vertical farms in the midst of cities could also help to make us more aware of how our food is produced, says Falagan. Pasona Urban Farm, for example, wasn't just for show – it allowed office workers to harvest their own food at work, which the company hoped would improve both their mental and physical health. Falagan says that having a closer connection with where our food comes from might encourage consumers to be more careful with food waste, too. ""If people know how much goes into producing our food,"" she says, ""then maybe they will think twice about throwing it out."" Most vertical farms currently concentrate on low-biomass crops – things like herbs, salads and small fruits and vegetables which weigh less per portion – because there is a greater yield for the amount of heat, light and water that needs to be supplied. They also have short life cycles, so make maximum use of space, says Vickers. A leafy green will grow quickly and be ready to harvest in days or weeks, whereas a pumpkin would take months to grow and needs to cure in sunlight. A meta-analysis of urban farming in a variety of settings across 53 countries found lettuces, kale and broccoli were particularly suited to vertical farms. Crops like spinach can be grown from seed to harvest in 30 days, meaning a vertical farmer could have 12 harvests from the same tray each year. What's more, if the farmer were to stagger planting their crop from one row of trays to the next, they could have an almost continuous supply of food all year round from their farm – something a traditional farmer can only dream of. Lost bees Salads and herbs do not need to flower and be fertilised, which gives them another advantage over other crops when it comes to vertical farming. Most fruits and vegetables do require pollination, and where it is needed for vertical farms it would have to be done artificially at a cost. (Read more about how humans are farming a wider variety of tiny insect livestock than ever before.) Farmers already often rely on commercial bees to encourage pollination and maximise fruiting for both indoor and outdoor farming. For example, the almond industry, of which 85% is based in California's Central Valley, depends on billions of honey bees that are shipped tens of thousands of miles to and from Florida to pollinate the almond blossoms each year. The hives are brought in on trucks and the bees are released into each grove before being moved on to the next farm. In the UK, strawberries grown in polytunnels are also pollinated with commercial honey bees – though, curiously, pollination by wild bees results in larger fruits. Commercial bee pollination has already been applied to indoor farming, says Vickers. But using bees in an indoor environment poses a problem – the artificial lights can make it difficult for bees to navigate. To humans, indoor farms often appear illuminated in neon pinks and purples. This is because plants grow best when exposed to mostly blue and red wavelength light, which to us looks pink or purple from a distance (although other wavelengths such as green light are also used depending on the crop). But bee vision is very different from ours. They cannot see the colour red, but can see in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which humans cannot. Outdoors, plant petals reflect UV to help bees navigate to them. This puts bees at a distinct disadvantage in vertical farms, where UV is currently not used. Adding it could make indoor farms even more expensive, especially considering this same light is completely free for outdoor farmers. ""We think about vertical farming from the plant's perspective,"" says Vickers. ""And we don't think about what the bee sees and how it finds the plants. The bees struggle to navigate under the current LEDs."" Vertical grains Other crops, such as cereals, are pollinated by wind, which could be easily replicated by creating a draught within the vertical farm, says Vickers. But while there are some examples of vertical farms experimenting with growing cereals, it's still rare. ""Barley or wheat, which takes many months to grow, are not currently cost effective,"" says Vickers. The reason for this high cost is the biggest barrier to the widespread use of vertical farms – they require huge amounts of energy and infrastructure. While being able to grow crops year-round increases the efficiency of a vertical farm, the challenge these farms face is to keep energy use down when the alternative – growing outside – comes with free sunlight and rainwater. This reliance on energy can also make vertical farms highly vulnerable to volatile energy prices. In many places, the electricity used to power vertical farms also still comes from fossil fuels, meaning overall greenhouse gas emissions can be far higher than for open-field farming. Switching to renewable energy is the obvious way to reduce this carbon footprint, although, since most renewables themselves require land, this can reduce the land-saving benefits of indoor farming somewhat. Botanically speaking, barley or wheat are quite possible within a vertical farming system due to their short root structure, says Vickers, which is important for growing them in trays. And while it's unlikely we'll ever grow all our grains in vertical farms, it could still prove to be useful in some situations. In 2020, agricultural scientists from several US universities published an article arguing vertical farming might one day play a role in hedging against future unexpected supply chain disruptions. As the ongoing war in Ukraine has highlighted the world's dependence on cereals from eastern Europe and sparked a search for alternative sources, it may be a proposal worth considering. Indoor orchards But Vickers says that it is actually woody crops, such as fruit trees, which would really test the limits of what is possible to grow in a vertical farm, not least because they would require significant support without soil. Botanically, however, there is no reason that indoor orchards are not possible, she says. ""A tree already is a kind of vertical farm,"" says Mark Horler, chair of the UK Urban AgriTech, which represents the country's indoor agriculture community. ""Trees take water with nutrients in it, and distribute it across a series of layers that then grow leaves and fruits. As ever, nature was there first."" Along with Kerstin Schreiber, a geographer at McGill University, Horler is co-founder of the Soya Project, an initiative set up to promote the benefits of vertical farming. He is currently investigating the potential of growing willow saplings indoors in vertical farms to speed up their growth before being planted outside, and so to hopefully increase their survival rate. ""The rate of failure in reforestation and afforestation projects is phenomenal,"" he says, citing how vulnerable saplings are to the elements when they are very small (in one study, 83% of replanted trees died within 10 years). ""Only a really small proportion make it to the final grade."" But if given the head start, Horler hopes the saplings will stand a better chance. And he's not the only one looking to vertical farming to give trees a boost. Zoe M Harris, an environmental scientist from the University of Surrey in the UK, is leading a similar project which has recently been awarded £4m ($4.8m) in UK government funding, while a project propagating apple tree saplings in aeroponic systems started in England last year.  Early trials of a vertical farm project in Scotland managed to grow tree seedlings six times faster than is typical in traditional outdoor sowing. Horler says he sees no reason why trees couldn't be grown permanently indoors for food. A vertical orchard might look a bit different to the ones we are used to seeing, however. ""What you'd want is a series of thin saplings that fruit really often, rather than waiting for one tree which produces all its fruit all at once,"" says Horler. Most apple trees are already dwarf varieties of wild species, he says, so dwarfing them further isn't out of the question. In Asia, dwarf mango trees are being trialled because the smaller variety helps harvesters pick their fruits. And in 2019, a collective of researchers were able to produce a tomato plant that, in Horler's words, ""almost looks like a bunch of grapes"" – the tiny plant was covered in ripe tomatoes. Dwarfing crops makes them more suitable for vertical farming, agrees Vickers. But the variety that performs best outdoors won't necessarily be the variety that performs best within a controlled environment, she adds, so dwarfing an established variety might not always work. For example, certain varieties might perform best outdoors because they are hardy to temperature variations or diseases, which might not be such important factors indoors. Vertically farmed trees and crops that take longer to mature might also be tricky to keep disease-free, says Vickers. Between harvests of herbs and salads, a vertical farmer can sterilise trays before the next crop is planted. However, mango trees, for example, can take years to mature, in which time mould and bacteria can thrive. ""The disease has the time of its life because – just like the plant – it has the perfect environment, perfect temperature, perfect amount of oxygen, perfect nutrients and access to all these lovely plants as well,"" says Vickers. If conditions are ideal, however, Horler says a vertically farmed tree might be able to actually invest more in its fruits. ""A plant will devote its resources to what it thinks it can do best,"" he says. ""If it's being tested, then it will put more effort into protecting itself from harder conditions…[But] if it's in ideal conditions and having an easy life, then it will grow lots of leaves and flowers and fruit, it won't grow these massive metres-long root systems."" There is no botanical reason, then, why all our food couldn't be grown vertically, but plant scientists will need to solve some long-standing problems before this is a reality, says Vickers. And, of course, city planners, renewable energy providers and farmers themselves would all have a huge part to play. It is worth noting, though, that much of the benefits and limitations of vertical farming explained by Vickers and Horler refer to farming on large scales in developed countries. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. Smallholders produce 30-34% of the global food supply. Some nations are heavily dependent on subsistence farming, and it is perhaps unrealistic that this essential food supply would be transformed by vertical farming, which is dependent on secure electricity. However, reducing the land taken up by industrial farming by shifting it to vertical farms could in theory free up space that could be used for restoring ecosystems, or even handed back to these same smallholder farmers or be used for regenerative farming methods, which tend to require more space. Vickers says that vertical farms might one day allow for an ""intellectual supply chain"" in which plants' growth cycles can be sped up or slowed down to react to changes in demand. (Vickers was once approached by a party interested in producing bespoke salad mixes personalised to customers' dietary needs, but says ""the premise is, at the moment, in its infancy"".) Experimenting further with crops in vertical farms could also create other possibilities for how we experience our food, like encouraging the plants to create more taste compounds, vitamins or antioxidants. Falagan says that this can be done by stressing the crops, for example by reducing their water, or exposing the harvested food to certain gases while in storage. But while these innovations could find their place in sustainable farming methods in the future, when money is a consideration it is hard to see all of them happening soon, says Vickers. The Pasona Urban Farm experiment that took over a Tokyo high-rise office, for example, is no longer there. The rice has been cut, the tomatoes picked, and the mushrooms have been taken out of their drawers. For now, we will have to content ourselves with salads, small fruits and vegetables until the time that orchards grow in our cities. * This article was updated on 23 January 2023 to make clear that several wavelengths of light, including green light, are used in vertical farms depending on the plant type. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,Why the world feels so uncertain,2024-09-14,2023-02-06,Tim Palmer,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230203-why-the-world-feels-so-unstable-right-now,"Our lives tend to run smoothly and predictably most of the time, but they are also prone to intermittent instability with devastating consequences. Can we do more to predict these periods and even intervene to prevent them? For many of us, life seems to progress smoothly and predictably for much of the time. Indeed, it seems one of our biggest concerns appears to be getting stuck in a rut. But then, seemingly out of nowhere, our world is turned upside down. A global pandemic strikes us down, killing millions of people and forcing entire countries into lockdown. Then inflation takes off and economic downturn threatens our livelihoods. And (not unrelated) one country invades another and the resulting war affects us all. Whoa! Where on Earth did all that come from? Comment & Analysis Tim Palmer a Royal Society Research Professor in climate physics at the University of Oxford. His book The Primacy of Doubt (Oxford University Press and Basic Books), describes the science of uncertainty across a range of fundamental and applied sciences. There's a generic reason for these sudden unforeseen catastrophes. It's something commonly found in many ""nonlinear systems"" in the physical, biological and social sciences: intermittent instability. That is to say, after long periods of boring and predictable behaviour, these systems suddenly become wildly unpredictable, exhibiting extreme fluctuations. What is a nonlinear system? It's one whose outputs are not in direct proportion to inputs. We humans are nonlinear systems: if we win $1m (or £1m if you prefer) in the lottery, we will likely be very happy indeed. But if we were to win $4m/£4m, we would likely not be four times as happy. Put more viscerally, if doubling our wealth in the lottery would make us happy, losing our wealth through some stupid gamble would not just make us sad, it would devastate us. Nonlinearity is a key ingredient behind the phenomenon of chaos – the process underpinning the famous butterfly effect – how a small uncertainty can grow and make the whole system unpredictable. However, in chaotic systems, the butterfly effect is not fully at play all the time. Sometimes a chaotic system can be predictable for quite a long period into the future. On other occasions, near an intermittent instability, the flap of a butterfly's wings can destroy predictability over a very short period of time. It's all a consequence of nonlinearity. The weather is a nonlinear chaotic system. It's rather boring and predictable for most of the time but occasionally becomes wildly unpredictable and extreme. In October 1987, BBC weather forecaster Michael Fish told viewers not to worry about strong winds that turned out to be the worst storm southern England had experienced in 300 years, just the day before it happened. Meteorologists learned from this experience. It was realised that the evolution of what has become known in some circles as the ""Fish storm"" was exceptionally sensitive to the butterfly effect – much more so than normal. And so, nowadays, when trying to predict the weather, forecast centres run ensembles of 50 simulations, each differing slightly in their initial conditions (by flaps of meteorological butterfly wings). When the atmosphere is very unstable, as it was in October 1987, then the assorted forecasts within the ensemble will differ dramatically from one another: some will show hurricane-strength extreme weather, others will show much more benign weather. All a forecaster can do in such a situation is estimate some probability, or likelihood, that the extreme event will occur. But forecasting a significant probability for an extreme event is much better than forecasting nothing significant, as happened in 1987. And ensemble weather prediction is today revolutionising the way humanitarian and disaster relief agencies send emergency food, shelter, medicine and even finance to regions at risk of extreme weather. Such anticipatory action is taken when the ensemble-based probabilities for extreme weather exceed a pre-determined threshold. Can we humans influence the likelihood of such intermittent instabilities? Yes, we can. By continuing to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, thus warming and moistening the air, we are tilting our nonlinear climate system towards greater intermittent instability. Perhaps one of the most devastating types of instability is associated with a tipping point, for example associated with the disintegration of a large ice sheet, leading to significant sea-level rise. In this situation, we cannot undo the damage caused by simply reversing our emissions; that would be locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. We have the ability to decrease the likelihood of these climatological instabilities by regulating the emission of greenhouse gases. But which actions will be the most effective?  To guide these decisions, climate scientists try to model the climate system and estimate how climate will change as a result of different conceivable future emissions scenarios. But there are uncertainties in these estimates, not least arising from the effect of these emissions on internal atmospheric processes like cloud cover. Climate scientists try to take account of these uncertainties by running ensembles of climate models where, say, uncertain cloud processes are represented in different possible ways. It is vitally important that our ensembles provide reliable probabilities of damaging climate change. My own view is that we have more to do on the latter and should indeed be pooling our resources internationally to create a new type of ""Cern for climate change"" – an intergovernmental research organisation that will focus on climate science rather than particle physics as Cern does. Even our solar system, often thought of as the most clockwork and predictable system of them all, is chaotic and can exhibit intermittent instability. How to think about X This series will change the way you look at the world. Whether it's the concept of ""time"", ""consumerism"", or even ""creativity"", many of us tend to think about – and define – certain ideas in the ways we've been taught. But how did our conceptualisation of these big ideas evolve? How to Think About X searches for new ideas about our lives, the concepts that govern them and our future. Over a hundred years ago, the French physicist Henri Poincaré showed that there was nothing in principle stopping the planets from being ejected very suddenly from the Solar System. Fortunately, based on ensemble forecasts of the solar system, we can be confident that this type of intermittent instability will not happen in the foreseeable future (in this case many millions of years). However, a mini version of this instability is much more likely: that a small asteroid will be unpredictably ejected from the asteroid belt and will hit Earth with effects similar to one or more nuclear bombs. For this reason, Nasa is improving its near-term asteroid prediction capabilities and is designing the means of diverting rogue asteroids if they do suddenly head for Earth. The Dart mission, where a spacecraft was crashed into the asteroid Dimorphos, successfully tested our ability to deal with the intermittent instabilities of the asteroid belt by changing the course of a space rock that could be Earth-bound. In this case, we have the means to partially control the instabilities and prevent their worst effects.   Could we prevent the occurrence of individual weather events, like the 1987 storm that struck England or the hurricanes that annually plague the east coast of the US, by similar types of intervention? In the 1950s, an idea was mooted to explode nuclear bombs in suitably targeted parts of the atmosphere, to move hurricanes away from their predicted paths if they threatened populated regions. However, notwithstanding the obvious problem of radioactive fallout, the weather is much too complex to be able to do this type of weather control reliably. To have any chance of affecting a severe weather system, the explosion would have to be done many days in advance, before the system had become mature. Estimating where to explode the bomb at this range depends very sensitively on the small-scale details of the forecast atmospheric circulation patterns – get the estimated position for explosion wrong by even few kilometres and the bomb may have little impact on the targeted extreme weather system. Our ability to calculate these sensitive locations, at a forecast range where the technique might in principle work, is just not that good. It's an interesting idea – but (fortunately perhaps) is unlikely to work reliably in practice. But extreme weather is not the only non-linear system to be affecting our lives recently. The spread of Covid-19 was not especially well predicted in the early phases of the disease. However, it spurred the development of epidemiological models for predicting death and hospitalisation arising from Covid infection. As with climate change, these are not so much predictions, as projections: estimates predicated on different policy options, from strict lockdowns to no response at all. However, although the earlier disease models were not themselves especially reliable, as more models with different assumptions were developed, so multi-model ensembles of Covid hospitalisations and deaths became possible by pooling the model outputs together in probabilistic form. These gave much more reliable estimates of plausible worst-case scenarios than could ever be provided by single-model predictions. The global economy is another nonlinear system that can have a profound influence on all our lives. According to the former Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, the economists had their Michael Fish moment in 2008 when Queen Elizabeth II famously asked an assembly of economists in the City of London why they hadn't seen the financial crash of that year coming. Haldane realised that the type of economic model used by the Bank of England was simply unable to represent the type of intermittent instability that can occur in the financial system. It's relatively easy to describe the conditions where an intermittent financial instability might occur qualitatively. Most of the time a hedge fund damps volatility in the price of a stock by moving the stock towards its intrinsic worth. However, the banks lend the hedge funds money, and to contain their risk, the banks limit the amount they are prepared to lend. Now suppose a stock's value falls when the hedge fund is fully leveraged. The hedge fund will have to sell its stock to pay off part of the loan. But selling the stock in this way can cause the stock to fall further in value. This makes it even harder for the hedge fund to pay back the loan. Perhaps not only the hedge fund, but also the bank will go broke if this behaviour is widespread. In this way, a sort of death-spiral instability for the whole economy is set in motion, especially if that economy is dependent on the health of its financial sector.   The problem is that traditional neo-classical models of the macroeconomy simply do not include such microscale processes. A new type of model – an agent-based model – seeks to do this. Here the model attempts to integrate the action of individual agents, such as businesses, industries, banks and hedge funds, from the ground up. The philosophy underpinning such models is not much different to a weather forecast model where the individual agents are small grid squares (of a few kilometres in horizontal scale) describing weather variables on some assumed elemental scale. The mathematics of agent-based models is messy, unlike the elegant but less useful mathematics of neo-classical economic models. But that's the way the world can be – rather messy. You might also like to read: Ensemble prediction methods based on agent-based models are being developed to predict probabilistically intermittent instabilities in the financial sector. However, compared with weather and climate prediction, these developments are at a very early stage. And of course, our ability to predict the economy does depend on whether the world is at peace or at war. One of the pioneers of quantitative weather prediction, Lewis Fry Richardson, also developed some of the first quantitative conflict prediction models. Conflict prediction is also starting to develop into a mature field using agent-based models, and again ensemble prediction techniques, where key uncertainties are varied across ensemble members, is vital to produce reliable probabilistic predictions. These models did highlight the Ukraine as a potential hot spot for conflict, ahead of Russia's invasion. Let's put all this together. Intermittent instabilities are a feature of many nonlinear systems in nature and in global society. On the whole their impacts appear to be profoundly negative, disrupting our lives in a bad way. How can we deal with these instabilities? Perhaps we can stop them happening at all. In the case of a rogue asteroid, this indeed seems possible. In the case of weather or indeed the economy, the systems are too complex for this to be feasible. However, for the latter examples, we can make the occurrence of intermittent instabilities less likely even if we cannot eliminate them altogether, such as by regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases on the one hand, or by regulating financial transactions in highly leveraged situations on the other. We can also try to take precautionary actions to mitigate the impacts of instabilities when they are predicted. However, by their nature, these instabilities are difficult to predict and can depend sensitively on uncertain parts of the system. To reliably predict the occurrence of instabilities, ensemble prediction systems must be developed where individual ensemble members differ in the representation of the uncertain parts of the system. The result is not a deterministic but a probabilistic forecast of the instability. Whether it is worth taking precautionary action in the light of such a forecast will then depend on the cost of action, the unmitigated damage caused by the instability, and on the forecast probability of occurrence of the event. If the first is small enough, or the last two large enough, then it will be worth it. (Read more about the tricks you can use to navigate uncertainty.) Ensemble prediction has become a fairly mature field in weather and climate prediction, has accelerated in disease modelling due to Covid-19, and is slowly evolving as a field in economics and conflict prediction, due to the development of agent-based models. Perhaps in future years, the ""Whoa! Where did that come from?"" reaction as another intermittent instability hits us from one of a number of different possible directions, may be heard less often.  * Tim Palmer is a professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford and pioneered the development of probabilistic ensemble forecasting techniques for weather and climate prediction. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,What Springsteen reveals about memory,2024-09-14,2022-11-23,Sanjay Sarma and Luke Yoquinto,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221121-the-benefits-of-being-forgetful,"We've all had those frustrating moments when we struggle to recall someone's name, or a key bit of information stays for too long on the tip of your tongue. It turns out these momentary lapses may actually be good for your memory. On 25 February 1988, at a performance in Worcester, Massachusetts, Bruce Springsteen forgot the opening lines to his all-time greatest hit, Born to Run. According to the conventional wisdom about the nature of forgetting, set down in the decades straddling the turn of 20th Century, this simply should not have happened. Forgetting seems like the inevitable consequence of entropy: where memory formation represents a sort of order in our brains that inevitably turns to disorder. Given enough time, cliffs crumble into the sea, new cars fall to pieces, blue jeans fade. As Springsteen put it in his song Atlantic City: ""Everything dies, baby, that's a fact."" Why should the information in our minds be any different? Comment and Analysis Sanjay Sarma is the Fred Fort Flowers and Daniel Fort Flowers Professor of Mechanical Engineering and head of Open Learning at MIT and Luke Yoquinto is a science writer and a research associate at the MIT AgeLab. They are co-authors of Grasp: The Science Transforming How We Learn (2020, Doubleday/Little, Brown). In such a model, the preservation of information like song lyrics requires constant upkeep – which, in the case of Born to Run, no one could accuse Springsteen of neglecting. By 1988, he had certainly repeated the lyrics to his 1975 hit thousands of times over. And so when he found himself staring out at the expectant Worcester audience at a loss, there was little he could do but confess into the microphone: ""Sung it so damn much I forgot what the words were."" According to the entropic model of forgetting, such a slip-up made little sense. And if that model were wrong (Springsteen hardly being alone in suffering the caprices of a forgetful brain) the import would be of enormous consequence. Schools and education systems around the world had been built based on the best psychological theories of the early 20th Century. If these models of learning – and its supposed opposite number, forgetting – were wrong, who could tell how many learners had been done a disservice? And even outside of school, how many of us would have wasted countless hours of thoughtless repetition – of golf swings, say, or French verbs, or wedding remarks – in a diligent but vain effort? Efforts to explain forgetting date back to the late 1800s, when psychological researchers began – slowly, at first – to incorporate mathematical tools into their experiments. The German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus studied his own powers of recall by memorising long series of nonsense syllables, then recording how well he remembered them as time elapsed. His ability to summon up this meaningless information, he discovered, sloped downward over time in a curved distribution: he lost most of his hard-won syllables quickly, but a small percentage of them persisted in his memory long after his initial memorisation efforts. These results seemed to support the intuitive idea that forgetting was the result of the simple erosion of information. But even in these early efforts, wrinkles appeared in the data suggesting that there might be more to forgetting than met the eye. Importantly, the timing of Ebbinghaus's rehearsals wielded enormous influence over how well he remembered items, with a spaced-out practice schedule outperforming rehearsal sessions that were bunched together. This finding was mysterious, hinting at some unexplained requirements of the memorising mind, but at the same time it was unsurprising. Indeed, the benefits of spacing out one's studies were known to most students. ""The schoolboy,"" he reasoned, ""doesn't force himself to learn his vocabularies and rules altogether at night, but knows that he must impress them again in the morning."" How to think about X This series will change the way you look at the world. Whether it's the concept of ""time"", ""consumerism"", or even ""creativity"", many of us tend to think about – and define – certain ideas in the ways we've been taught. But how did our conceptualisation of these big ideas evolve? How to Think About X searches for new ideas about our lives, the concepts that govern them and our future. In Ebbinghaus's time these sorts of quantitative methods were the exception in psychological research, but a generation later, they were rapidly gaining adherents. Perhaps no psychologist was more responsible for this change than Columbia University's number-loving psychologist Edward L. Thorndike, who argued that: ""If a thing exists, it exists in some amount; and if it exists in some amount, it can be measured."" Thorndike's influence on both research psychology and educational practice is almost impossible to overstate. He was an incredibly prolific author of articles and books – including arithmetic books and a line of student dictionaries that bore his name into the new millennium – as well as early standardised tests. He served as president first of the American Psychological Association, and later of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Perhaps most important, his research laid the groundwork for the influential mid-century movement in psychology known as Behaviorism, which attempts to explain behaviours purely as a function of environmental conditioning, not any intervening mental processes. Thorndike's early research concerned animal learning and frequently featured cats, which he often tasked with escaping from elaborate cages. From his observations he produced three basic laws of learning for human and non-human animals alike. These concerned how the brain ""stamps in"" associations (which he dubbed his Law of Effect); under what conditions learning occurs (his Law of Readiness); and how memories are maintained or forgotten: his Law of Exercise, which breaks down into sub-theories of use and disuse. The theory of disuse was simple: If you don't use a memory, you lose the memory. (Use, meanwhile, could preserve it, albeit only when accompanied by some kind of satisfying reward – the audible appreciation of an adoring crowd, for instance.) Thorndike's theory of forgetting largely aligned with Ebbinghaus's observations, except it didn't account for the still-mysterious fact that spaced rehearsal of information seemed to steel-plate information against forgetfulness. It would take decades for cognitive scientists to come up with a model of forgetting that satisfactorily accounted for this issue. In the meantime, however, Thorndike's trio of learning laws bolstered early-20th Century efforts to standardise education. To be clear, Thorndike was in no way single-handedly responsible for the regularised forms education took around the world in the 20th Century. However, his ideas about learning – that it was quantifiable and that some students were innately better at it than others – supported visions of school where rigidly standardised conditions prevailed, in terms not only of standardised tests but also time spent in seats, classroom sizes and shapes, pedagogy, and metrics of student evaluation. Such interchangeable conditions allowed students to be compared to one another for supposedly meritocratic purposes. In both the standardisation of education and the ongoing research into learning, forgetting became something of a sideshow. Its status began to improve, however, thanks to two separate research traditions begun in the 1960s and 1970s. One operates at the level of neurons and is detectable through tiny electrodes implanted in cells, while the other operates at the level of cognitive psychology and is detectable through cleverly designed quizzes. At the cellular level, Eric Kandel, in a Nobel-winning series of studies, demonstrated that memories are preserved in the form of strengthened connections between neurons. Training regimes, he showed, whether conducted on intact, living, learning animals, or by electrically prodding neurons in a dish, create such beefed-up connections. And, as Ebbinghaus first observed, training (or rehearsal, or study) with extra time scheduled in between led these connections to be longer-lasting. This is a fact that holds true throughout the animal kingdom, from sea slugs to mammals. The cellular machinery responsible for maintaining memories, then, may be prejudiced in favour of preserving information that we animals encounter repeatedly. But what exactly is happening in the gaps in those spaced-out training, practice, or study regimens? At the cellular level, part of the answer may be that some of the mechanisms involved in preserving memories seem to require downtime: recharging periods, in effect, before neurons can get back to the work of strengthening their connections. A different, yet perhaps complementary, answer is forthcoming in the research tradition of cognitive psychology. Here, a variety of studies suggest that gaps in one's rehearsal or study schedule are so helpful because, counterintuitively, they create the opportunity for a salutary bit of forgetting. To understanding how forgetting can be useful, it's important to first recognise that a memory is never simply strong or weak. Rather, the ease with which you can summon up a memory (its retrieval strength) is different from how fully represented it is in your mind (its storage strength). The name of your parent, for instance, would be one example of a memory with both high storage and retrieval strength. A phone number you held in your head only momentarily a decade ago could be said to have low storage and retrieval strength. The name of someone you met a party mere minutes ago might have high retrieval but low storage strength. And finally, the lyrics to a song you've sung thousands of times but which stubbornly elude you, as you gaze out from the stage of the Worcester Centrum, would have high storage but distressingly low retrieval strength. Given the right cue, however – if your audience were to feed you the opening lines, for instance – the retrieval strength would snap right back. Psychologists became aware of the distinction between storage and retrieval as early as the 1930s, when John Alexander McGeoch, a psychologist at the University of Missouri, tasked study subjects with memorising pairs of unrelated words. For example, every time I say pencil, for instance, you say chessboard. That task became far more difficult, he discovered, when, before asking his subjects to recite what they'd memorised, he confronted them with decoy pairs: pencil and cheese, pencil and table. The decoy pairs, it seemed, competed with the true pair for the memoriser's attention. As this line of research gained traction, the metaphor for forgetting changed. Forgetting, it seemed, was less like a cliff slowly collapsing into the sea, and more like a house deep in the woods that becomes harder and harder to find. The house might be perfectly sound – that is, its storage strength remains high – but if the path leading to it becomes surrounded by equally plausible paths leading the wrong way, one's formerly clear mental map can transform into a maze. In Springsteen's case, it's easy to see how his mental wayfinding might have gotten thrown off track. ""The reason for the muff, apparently was that he was concentrating so much on the spoken introduction, telling the audience how the song has assumed a new meaning to him over the years,"" the Los Angeles Times' music critic wrote several days after the event. The new introduction meant he was approaching the same old memory from a different set of cues: a different starting point. Suddenly, the once-reliable path to the opening lines of the song was surrounded by false starts. But soon, the lyrics came roaring back. And assuming this time the memory's heightened accessibility stuck around, it would have been in keeping with then-cutting-edge research around retrieval and storage strength – measures which, though distinct from one another, turned out not to be independent. In a landmark 1992 paper on ""The New Theory of Disuse"" – a title in direct conversation with Thorndike – the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) cognitive psychologists Robert and Elizabeth Bjork described a fascinating level of interplay between storage and retrieval. The retrieval of a memory adds to its storage strength, they showed, but with diminishing returns. You might meet someone at a party and repeat her name to yourself in an attempt to add to the memory's storage strength, but repetition will only take you so far: the sixth repetition won't add much more heft than the fifth. What will add to its storage strength, however, is what the Bjorks call the ""effortful retrieval"" of that memory. Once the name is semi-forgotten, then, ""at some time later, looking across the room and retrieving what that person's name is – that can be a really powerful event in terms of your ability to recall that name later that evening or the next day"", Robert Bjork told us for our book Grasp: The Science Transforming How We Learn. By carrying out a challenging retrieval, you can increase a given memory's storage strength and also increase your chances of retrieving it in the future. In this party example, it is the time gap between when you meet your new acquaintance and, later, when you find yourself in need of her name, that makes for forgetfulness. In a series of earlier experiments starting in the 1970s, however, Robert Bjork found other ways to disorient his research subjects on their paths to a desired memory. For instance, introducing confusing or irrelevant inputs, à la McGeoch, or changing their sensory cues – sights, sounds, and smells that might trigger a memory – by asking them to recall information in new surroundings. Regardless of how forgetfulness came about, when overcome it led to stronger, longer-lasting memories. Today, well-timed forgetting is part of a larger suite of educational approaches that the Bjorks have termed ""desirable difficulties"": strategies that may initially annoy students, but which eventually yield dividends. The sort of forgetting that ultimately leads to stronger, more accessible memories can be produced by spacing out one's study schedule, for instance, and also by interleaving one subject's study sessions with another's. Setting material aside, then revisiting it, can also do away with a student's false sense of command, since memories with momentarily high retrieval strength may prove far less accessible a few days later. In the years following the publication of the New Theory of Disuse, the Bjorks worked to spread the word about forgetting and other desirable difficulties – work necessitated by the simple fact that school is typically not set up to facilitate laudable acts of forgetting. Far from it: as a number of research papers have shown, on exam day, students who cram for exams actually outperform their counterparts who space out their studies. Only weeks and months later do the advantages of a spaced schedule win out, with the ""spacers"" substantially outperforming crammers. But by then, the exam is over. Standardised structures of educational timing and assessment, many of which were established when Thorndike's theories of learning were still new, are to this day disincentivising what we now know to be superior learning practices. That shouldn't stop learners of all ages – including adults in the working world – from making the most of our vast ability to not only take in new information, but to access it at the precise moment we need it. Even knowledge we might consider lost to the sands of time may still be hiding in our brains, waiting for the right cue to resurface. As Springsteen reminds us in ""Atlantic City"", while everything does die, in the next line he continues: ""Maybe everything that dies someday comes back."" * Sanjay Sarma is professor of mechanical engineering and head of Open Learning at MIT (@mitopenlearning).

Yield Spread Analysis,Orcas have a dangerous new hobby,2024-09-14,2023-06-27,Sophie Hardach,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230626-why-are-orcas-suddenly-ramming-boats,"A group of Iberian orcas have a risky new hobby: chasing sailboats and breaking their rudders. Now scientists are finding out what's really behind the fad. In the summer of 2022, Andrea Fantini and his crew mates were sailing towards Tangier on the Moroccan coast at the start of a global regatta, the Globe40 race, when one of them suddenly shouted: ""Orca! Orca!"" Fantini saw a tail in the distance, and then a huge orca rushing straight towards them. ""We saw the first orca coming, then the second, then the third, and then we were surrounded by orcas,"" he recalls. ""There were seven orcas all around us, and they started to attack the rudder. It was super weird, and a bit scary."" Orcas are commonly known as killer whales but are actually part of the dolphin family, and have never been known to be aggressive towards humans in the wild. Since 2020, however, the strange new behaviour of a group of them living in the waters around the Iberian Peninsula, in south-western Europe, has been baffling sailors, scientists and now a global audience. The cetaceans appear to have invented a risky new game: It involves chasing sailboats and pushing the rudders, breaking them in the process. (Read more about some of the incidents in the Atlantic in this special report by Victoria Gill.) Last week, it was widely reported that an orca had rammed a boat in the North Sea. A few days ago an orca pod ""attacked"" racing boats near the Strait of Gibraltar. Scientists prefer to call these clashes ""interactions"", since the orcas' intention may be playful rather than hostile (more on this later). It's an unprecedented phenomenon, says Alfredo López Fernández, an orca researcher at the Atlantic Orca Working Group (GTOA), which is monitoring the Iberian orcas. Historically, there have been some reports of orcas diving under boats, or slamming into them and causing them to sink. But López says those cases tended to be isolated and tied to a specific situation: ""None of them is similar to what's happening now."" The new behaviour sees the orca touching, pushing and even pivoting boats, according to an analysis of the interactions reported in 2020. López cautions that our own perception of this may be biased. What feels like a ramming may just be the orca moving the boat or rudder with their heads and bodies ""because they cannot hold things with their fingers"". A new, ongoing research project by orca specialist Renaud de Stephanis, which involves presenting the wild orcas with dummy rudders and filming them, has revealed fresh insights into these encounters. What appears to be going on is rather than biting the rudders, the orca are pushing them with their noses until they break. ""They're pushing, pushing, pushing – boom! It's a game. Imagine a kid of 6, 7 years, with a weight of three tonnes. That's it, nothing less, nothing more,"" de Stephanis tells the BBC. ""If they wanted to wreck the boat, they would break it in 10 minutes' time."" He has been studying Iberian orcas since the 1990s and is the coordinator and president of Conservation, Information and Research on Cetaceans (CIRCE), a marine conservation organisation. The game appears to be spreading. In 2022, there were 207 interactions, data from the working group showed, up from 197 in 2021, and 52 in 2020. Originally, they mostly happened in and around the Strait of Gibraltar, along the coasts of Portugal, Spain and Gibraltar, but the playing field has widened to include the coasts of Morocco and France. ""The interactions follow the orcas' migratory routes,"" says López. Only about 35 Iberian orcas have been identified, and the total population is thought to number fewer than 50. Of those, 15 are known to be involved in the boat encounters – it's always the same group, says López. According to the Cruising Association, three yachts were sunk in 2022 and 2023 after orca interactions. As Fantini says, breaking the rudder completely can open a hole, and water can rush in, sinking the boat. Even those sailing in sturdy racing boats, with back-up rudders and rescue services close by, can find the experience frightening. ""20 minutes ago we got hit by some orcas,"" says Jelmer van Beek, the skipper of Dutch sailing team JAJO, in a video filmed this summer in the Atlantic Ocean to the west of Gibraltar, during a leg of The Ocean Race. ""Three orcas came at us, straight at us, and they started hitting the rudder. Impressive to see the orcas, first of all, beautiful animals, but also a dangerous moment for us and the team."" In Fantini's encounter during last year's Globe40 Race, the team's underwater camera captured the orcas swimming towards the rudder. ""It seems that they really have a modus operandi, they have a project, they know what to do. They were really well organised,"" he says. As part of a project supported by CIRCE and Spain's Ministry of the Environment, Renaud de Stephanis has been intensely monitoring this group of orcas. He and his team have used a multitude of cameras – underwater, above the water, and even attached to the orca – to understand exactly what's going on between them, and the dummy rudders. ""We discovered what happens, the killer whales push the rudder with their nose, this makes the rudder break by leverage,"" he says. The detailed results are not released yet, but he is hoping to share them publicly soon.   What started this game? And what can be done to stop it? In the fourth summer since the trend began, the mystery has still not been fully solved – but scientists are starting to get there. Here's what we know. Even before 2020, the orca communities in and around the Strait of Gibraltar had developed a feeding strategy that involved swimming up to tuna fishing boats to snatch the hooked fish from the lines. In 2020, nine orcas began approaching sailboats, pushing or bumping them, and at times, breaking the rudder. There were three ""ringleaders"" who were most involved in these interactions: an adult orca called White Gladis, and two young ones, Black Gladis and Grey Gladis. (Scientists chose a name for all interacting orcas: ""gladis"", based on one of the species' old names, ""orca gladiator""). Over the years, more orcas have joined them. They have consistently focused on sailboats, rather than all types of boats, López says.   López cautions against describing the behaviour as attacks: ""They are being judged socially before we even understand what they're doing."" In his view, their intention is not hostile. ""The orcas are not showing an aggressive attitude in all of this, even though they may break something,"" he tells the BBC in an email. ""We know that it's a complex behaviour that has nothing to do with aggression (they don't want to eat anyone, nor harm humans) nor revenge (orcas are not resentful)."" Once the rudder is broken, the orcas swim away – as they did in the case of Fantini, whose boat had two rudders: ""Luckily, they broke just one. And then they went away. They disappeared,"" Fantini says. This leads to the trickiest question: what exactly is their motivation? The working group has come up with two hypotheses, according to López. One might be called the ""fun or fashion hypothesis"". As López puts it, it's the idea that the orcas ""have invented something new and are repeating it"". This behaviour would be more typical of young orcas, he says. In a 2021 report, the working group notes that young orcas have occasionally they have been observed approaching ships, peering at them, following their wakes and jumping on the waves they cause. The other might be called the ""trauma hypothesis"". According to this explanation, ""one or more individuals had a bad experience and are trying to stop the boat in order to prevent a recurrence"", he says. In his view, this would be more in line with adult orca behaviour. ""We don't know which one of these is correct, and even if it's the second one, we don't know what might have been the triggering event,"" says López. However, he lists a few points that support the second, trauma-related explanation. Firstly, White Gladis, an adult, was probably the one who started the interactions. At the time, in 2020, she was the only adult who did this, amid a group of young orcas. Secondly, in 2021 she continued the interactions even though she had her newborn daughter with her, which in his view suggests that ""her drive to interact is even stronger than her protective maternal instinct"". As for what this traumatising experience might have been, he points out that many fishing boats put their lines out at the stern of the boat, which attracts orcas, who come to inspect the lines and snap up some fish. There have been cases of orcas getting tangled in and injured by these lines. It's possible that something like this happened to White Gladis, he believes. Meanwhile, Black Gladis had injuries that may have been caused by humans, and ""we know that Grey Gladis witnessed a friend getting tangled in fishing lines in 2018"", says López. ""All of this makes us think that human activities are at the origin of these behaviours, even if it's in an indirect way,"" says López. What we can learn from their new habit is ""that they are very intelligent, and that we are bothering them a lot"". Lori Marino, a neuroscientist, cetacean expert and president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, says the ""fun"" theory makes the most sense to her. ""These are highly intelligent and inquisitive animals and they seem to be attracted to the underside of the boats and parts that are sticking out. Orcas are cultural beings and they often will start a fad and that fad will spread through the group."" Such cultural traditions include distinctive call types, which have been described as dialects, as well as different feeding strategies. These different behaviours ""all start as fads"", says Marino. ""The fad, if it continues, can become part of their culture and be passed down from one generation to the next,"" she says. Their ability to work in groups helps develop such complex fashions and traditions: ""For instance, they may coordinate their behaviour to wash a seal off an ice floe or enter into different defensive swimming patterns if being chased by a predator… So the capability is there. Orcas show impressive levels of organisation in many other activities,"" she says. Sailors and orca experts agree that it would be best for the risky trend to stop. But how? Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a sure-fire way of preventing or even shortening the interactions. The Orca Working Group recommends avoiding the orcas by checking regularly updated maps of their movements. Renaud de Stephanis' top recommendation is also to avoid the areas where the orcas are, with the help of updated maps based on satellite-tracking the orcas – this is starting to help reduce the interactions, he says. Sailors have also tried scaring them away by banging things. However, this doesn't seem to make much of a difference.  Trying to escape them is futile. According to the working group's 2021 report, orcas usually swim at speeds between 8-11 knots but can reach speeds of up to 29 knots, making them hard to shake off (the boat sailed by Team JAJO, the Dutch team, was doing 12 knots when the orcas struck, and according to the sailors, the animals seemed to find the speed exciting). There is no evidence that other tricks used by some sailors, such as pouring sand on orcas to confuse them, work – and throwing things at them is not a good idea given that Iberian orcas are endangered. Leaving the area quickly helps, says de Stephanis (not because one can out-speed an orca, but because they are less likely to follow the boat once it's outside their preferred area). In Fantini's case, the orcas stayed for around 30 or 40 minutes: ""It felt like forever."" The team waited until the orcas had broken the rudder and left. They knew there was no point trying to speed away: ""They were very fast. Even if you try to go as fast as you can with the boat, they will always be faster. So going fast is not a solution. I don't actually know what the solution would be. Right now, If I have to go again, I don't know what to do."" He laughs.

Yield Spread Analysis,The 77-million-year-old cancers,2024-09-14,2023-02-15,Jocelyn Timperley,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230214-could-dinosaurs-get-cancer,"Scientists have discovered the tell-tale signs of a range of dinosaur diseases – and found that they're remarkably similar to those affecting animals alive today. On a wet, stormy day some 77 million years ago in what is now south-eastern Alberta, Canada, a certain horned dinosaurwas having a very bad time.   The adult Centrosaurus apertus, a medium-sized plant-eating cousin of the larger Triceratops that lived alongside Tyrannosaurus, had an advanced malignant bone cancer in its shin. The cancer may have spread elsewhere in its body and it's thought that it was almost certainly terminal.   But this Centrosaurus probably didn't die from the bone cancer – because before this could happen, it and the thousands of other Centrosaurus in its herd were struck down in a catastrophic flood, thought to be caused by a tropical storm.   Millions of years later, the bonebed preserved after this mass death event helped provide important evidence that these dinosaurs moved in enormous herds. But the diagnosis of this particular dinosaur's osteosarcoma – a rare, malignant bone cancer more commonly found in children and diagnosed in some 25,000 people per year worldwide – only came in 2020. It was the first time a malignant cancer had ever been diagnosed in a dinosaur, and it required a multidisciplinary team of scientists to confirm the case.   For decades, palaeontologists and palaeopathologists – scientists who study ancient diseases and injuries using fossils – have suggested findings of cancer in dinosaurs, although the tumours were usually thought to be benign. But the 2020 osteosarcoma study is part of a fast-growing field of research aimed at diagnosing dinosaur diseases, using similar expertise and equipment we would use to diagnose ailments in humans and animals today. The only difference is they have only fossils to go on.   ""The field initiated as a speculation…but it actually is a scientific endeavour now, and we can scientifically test hypotheses, and develop criteria,"" says Bruce Rothschild, a research associate in vertebrate palaeontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pennsylvania. ""It turns out the diseases that afflicted dinosaurs have essentially the same appearance as those that affect humans or other critters.""   The results of these investigations are revealing previously unknown details of how dinosaurs lived and died. Some argue they could also give medical experts new insights about the diseases still affecting us in the present day.  A rare find   The hunt to decisively diagnose a dinosaur with bone cancer started when David Evans, a palaeontologist at the University of Toronto and a curator at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada, met Mark Crowther, a human haematologist and chair of the faculty of medicine at McMaster University, Canada. They realised they could use their combined expertise to try to find an osteosarcoma.   Still, finding a potential case was no easy task. Pathologies on fossil specimens are often noted, but they aren't really curated – organised according to this characteristic – says Evans. Instead, bones with the hallmarks of disease are usually spread all over collections.   After sifting through hundreds of bones at Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Canada, together with several other scientists including Snezana Popovich, a bone pathologist at McMaster University, they recognised the potential signs of bone cancer on the Centrosaurus apertus's shin bone. ""I'll definitely remember Snezana picking this bone up and being like, 'I think this is bone cancer',"" says Evans.   The bone had a lump on the end of it that was labelled as a fracture callus, but even at first glance it had several tell-tale signs of bone cancer: it was visibly malformed and had large, unnatural foramina (open holes) around the lump.   The team, by now consisting of eight medical experts, including modern cancer specialists, and four palaeontologists, used every means they had to confirm a diagnosis in their 77-million-year-old patient. They compared the bone to both a normal Centrosaurus shin bone and a human calf bonewith a confirmed case of osteosarcoma. But they also used X-rays, high quality computed tomography (CT) scans along with 3D reconstruction tools and histology (thin sectioning of the bone) to create biopsies so they could study it at the cellular level.   ""That allowed us to make a positive diagnosis of cancer that is on par with what the doctors on my team suggested [they would make] in a human patient,"" says Evans. ""We actually got right down to serial sectioning the bone… We were able to actually trace the cancerous tumour winding its way through the bone from the knee to the ankle."" Penélope Cruzado-Caballero, a palaeontologist at the Universidad de La Laguna in Tenerife, Spain, says the study shows the importance of approaching pathologies in this multidisciplinary way, including the relatively new analysis of histology.   A wide search   It's becoming increasingly common in palaeopathology to use modern techniques to make a medical diagnosis in this way, rather than simply visually comparing dinosaur ailments to other examples of diseases in a ""card-matching game"", says Cary Woodruff, curator of vertebrate palaeontology at the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science in Miami, Florida. ""Just because they look similar doesn't mean [they are].""   Cruzado-Caballero recently documented another possible case of osteosarcoma. This time it was on the toe of a 70-million-year-old duck-billed herbivore, Bonapartesaurus rionegrensis, found in Patagonia, Argentina. Her team used imaging data and microscopic analysis, as well as descriptions of the visible shapes to diagnose a tumour.   ""Our studies help us to understand when diseases arise throughout the history of life on Earth,"" she says.   Osteosarcoma has been traced even further back than the Late Cretaceous period. Palaeontologist Yara Haridy and Rothschild diagnosed it in 240-million-year-old stem-turtle from the Triassic period using micro-CT scans, although they did not use as many different techniques as Evans' team.   Scientists are also looking at dinosaur diseases in the context of other archosaurs, a group of reptilian animals that includes today's crocodiles and birds. The approach helps palaeontologists understand how dinosaurs fit into the whole tree of life, says Jennifer Anné, lead palaeontologist at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis.   In her work, Anné often collaborates with veterinary scientists to consider what kind of conditions are found in living birds and crocodilians to compare them with dinosaurs. ""[It's] almost being like a 'palaeozoologist"", she says. ""Like saying, 'Alright, this is an animal, how do I study it as an animal?'"".   This was the approach which led Anné and two colleagues in 2016 to the first ever diagnosis in a dinosaur of septic arthritis – a condition that can occur when microbes get into a joint, often after an injury.   The hadrosaur from New Jersey had an ""eaten away"" elbow that ""looked like a head of cauliflower"", says Anné, so they compared high resolution X-ray microtomography scans of the specimen to known conditions in living avians and reptiles. They ruled out several diseases, including gout and tuberculosis, before settling on the septic arthritis diagnosis due to the bone erosion, reactive bone growth and the fusion of the elements seen on the bones.   These new analyses can end up overturning previous diagnosis. In another example, research led by Ewan Wolff, a vet and palaeontologist at the University of Wisconsin, concluded that sets of smooth-edged lesions seen relatively frequently on the jaws of T. Rex were likely not bite wounds from other tyrannosaurids, as had previously been suggested, but an avian parasitic infection called trichomonosis, which causes similar effects in modern birds.   Sometimes, though, even the vets are stumped by these investigations. In a paper published last year, Anné and her colleagues outlined some unusual lesions they had found on another hadrosaur. But the veterinary scientists she talked to said they had never seen anything like it. ""I sent this to the Royal Veterinary College in London and a picture of this is apparently hanging up in their coffee room, as people try to figure out what it is, because no one's seen it on an extant animal either."" A new approach    The difference with diagnosing living animals today, of course, is that for dinosaurs there is very little to go on bar fossilised bone and other hard tissues like teeth, and sometimes skin, feathers or hair. ""Anything where only one part of the diagnosis is bone, that's really hard,"" says Anné. ""Because we have such limited information that we can use, those limited clues, we are the MacGyvers: we throw everything we can possibly do to try to tease out this information.""   Bone is usually one of the least studied parts of biology, she adds. ""Whereas in palaeontology all we have is bones. So we know all about bones.""   Diagnosing any sort of malady in the fossil record is incredibly hard, agrees Woodruff. ""We can't rely really on any of the sweep of medical testing that we would do today… The way we go about identifying [diseases] has to be radically different.""   Woodruff, who specialises in sauropods – huge long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs like Brachiosaurus – also collaborated with veterinarians and medical doctors in his recent work to diagnose a dinosaur respiratory infection for the first time.   He had noticed something odd about a 150-million-year-old diplodocid sauropod specimen named Dolly – an irregular, lumpy growth on its vertebrae which had fossilised like a broccoli floret. ""I knew enough to know what I was looking at was not normal, but I didn't know enough to be able to identify what I even might be looking at,"" he says.   He posted a picture to social media asking if anyone had seen something similar or knew what could it be, and quickly received a slew of responses, including from his future co-authors. ""The general expert answer was, my gosh, we've never seen this before, but this is exactly what we would predict a respiratory infection in a sauropod to look like,"" he says.   The team he assembled began investigating all the diseases which could have caused this growth. ""It's as important to weed out what it's not sometimes certainly in the first passes than to help you zero in on what it is,"" says Woodruff.   They realised there were protrusions in the exact areas of the bone which would have been attached to Dolly's air sacs – air-filled structures which still occur in today's birds, and which often become infected to cause the respiratory disorder airsacculitis. ""They were similar enough that we were able to suggest that the diagnosis for Dolly was airsacculitis,"" says Woodruff. ""The fossil 'broccoli' coming out [...] was a secondary bone infection.""   It's impossible to say what could have caused this infection, as for obvious reasons the team couldn't do any blood work on Dolly. However, the most common cause in living dinosaurs – birds – today is breathing in fungal spores. ""Odds are, this could have been what occurred in our dinosaur 150 million years ago,"" says Woodruff. ""We know that fungus has a ridiculously long evolutionary history, it would have been a major component of these environments as well.""   Other scientists may have found signs of respiratory infections from even longer ago. A 2018 paper co-authored by Rothschild presented evidence of a tuberculosis-like respiratory infection in 245-million-year-old marine reptile.   Of course, palaeontologists have been studying diseases in dinosaur bones for decades, and some dinosaur ailments have far better records than others. Broken bones that have healed, for example, are ""exceptionally common"", says Evans. Consider, though, that there is only skeletal material for around 32 adult T. rex out of an estimated 2.5 billion that ever lived, and the chances of understanding the prevalence of diseases becomes vanishingly small. ""We really don't have a good handle on the epidemiology,"" says Rothschild. ""All we can say is how far back, and we can trace a lot of these diseases back to the Permian, before the dinosaurs, but that's as much as we can take it at the moment.""   There are also many ailments and diseases that leave no sign at all on what remains of dinosaurs, making it hard to know what killed them in most cases. ""Probably a good chunk of our dinosaurs died from diseases or things like that, that we have no osteological evidence for, so no indicator on the bones,"" says Woodruff.   Still, as science advances, we may get better at recognising clues that point to certain diseases. ""There may be a whole bunch of bones that have diseases that are barely visible on the surface that no one would even think to look at,"" says Evans.   The more these diagnoses are made, the more information palaeontologists can get about the way these dinosaurs lived.   For example, the Centrosaurus apertus's advanced osteosarcoma would likely have affected its movement, making it a prime target for a Tyrannosaurus, the top predator at the time, says Evans. Instead, though, it appears to have died with its herd in a natural disaster, which indicates it was maybe being cared for and protected by the rest of its herd, says Evans. ""It's a really interesting and unique insight into the life of dinosaurs that we didn't have before.""   An unexpected benefit    But the discoveries could also contribute to our modern understanding of diseases. Rothschild, a practising medical rheumatologist, has used his analysis of hadrosaur fossils to help distinguish between osteochondritis and osteochondrosis, two different but similar-looking bone conditions.   Evans was even invited to participate in a symposium for the Osteosarcoma Institute, which focuses on finding a cure for the disease. ""[There were] a bunch of top specialists in bone cancer from around the world [there], and then there was me with dinosaurs,"" says Evans. His paper had diagnosed a giant tumour in the exact same place that you would expect to find the disease in a human. ""It gives us some perspective to think about how ancient these diseases are.""   A cast of the original Centrosaurus apertus shin bone with osteosarcoma was also part of the Cancer Revolution exhibition last year at the Science Museum in London. ""We wanted to showcase that cancer isn't a uniquely human or modern disease,"" says Katie Dabin, lead curator for the exhibition. ""Dinosaurs seemed to be a brilliant example that cancer has been with multi-celled organisms for a long time.""   Evans hopes his paper will get medical doctors, researchers and experts interested in collaborating with palaeontologists and vice versa, prompting other findings about rare diseases that can be found in the fossil record. ""Who knows where those discoveries might lead?"" he says. His team is already working with another set of researchers who think they might have found evidence of osteosarcoma in a meat-eating dinosaur.   But there is also something about diagnosing these diseases in dinosaurs which simply helps us relate to them better, says Woodruff.   ""You can hold that 150-million-year-old bone of Dolly [the diplodocus] in your hands, and, seeing those signs of infection caused by some sort of respiratory disorder, know that 150 million years ago, Dolly felt as crummy when it was sick as we all do when we're sick with these similar things. And I think that's fascinating.""   -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,The unseen 'tracks' of the deep ocean,2024-09-14,2020-12-04,Richard Fisher,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201202-deep-sea-mining-tracks-on-the-ocean-floor,"Far from land, deep sea mining trials have left barren marks that are still there decades later, and as Richard Fisher writes, they symbolise two different timescales colliding. At the base of the Pacific Ocean, hundreds of miles from land, there are some curious marks on the seafloor that no animal could have made. Some of them look like narrow troughs carved into the pale silt. Others could be claw marks, gouged through the ecosystems of the deep by an undersea monster. Humanity has left many signatures on the surface of the Earth, but these long-lived features on the seafloor go largely unseen. Occasionally they are lit by the spotlights of remote submersibles, but afterwards they return to darkness. They have been there for decades. Like the footsteps and tracks that astronauts left on the Moon, they are still visible now, with nothing to wash them away. The track pictured at the top of this article was 37 years old when it was photographed a few years ago, while the marks below date back to 1989. Dating to the 1970s and 1980s, the marks are the first tentative scrapings of deep-sea mining trials, left behind by ships equipped with dredges and ploughs, now long since departed. Recently, scientists have returned with cameras and probes to look at what has happened to the local ecosystems – and what they have found are scars that have never fully healed. Soon, there will be many more tracks like these carved all over the ocean abyss, one of the last untouched wildernesses. What might future generations make of them, and what might they say about humanity's demand for resources in the early 21st Century? You may also like: To understand why these marks are there – and why they matter – we need to dive into a prehistoric sea. One day, a shark shed a tooth, which drifted hundreds of metres to the ocean floor. Gradually, as metals precipitated out of the sea and water within the sediment, the tooth became coated in minerals. And so began one of the slowest geological phenomena on Earth: the growth of a polymetallic nodule. Not all begin with a tooth – others contain fragment of shell, a bone shard, or nothing at all – but the slow pace of accretion is always the same. It takes them millions of years to grow only a few centimetres. But over time, they have become so abundant that they cover large swathes of the ocean’s abyssal plain. The nodules were discovered during the voyage of the HMS Challenger in 1873. When those sailors brought them to the surface, they would have grasped them in their hands like rocky potatoes, crumbling at the edges. To touch, they might have felt smoother on top, but rough on the underside, like pumice, where they had been growing into the surrounding sedimentary grains. If they’d held them to their nose, they’d have detected no scent. The expedition’s chemist was one of the first to note that the nodules were not worthless. They were made of ""manganese peroxide"", he wrote, which is ""one of the principal substances used in the manufacture of bleaching powder"". Their remote location, however, meant ""they could never be made a paying source of supply"".  Little did that chemist know how important they would turn out to be – to the organisms of the deep ocean, and later, to humans. Years later, scientists would discover that these nodules are like islands for some forms of life. The abyssal plain on which they lie makes up 50% of the Earth’s surface – a sublime scale that can be difficult to imagine. If the oceans were suddenly removed, we would see that half our planet is a vast desert of loose sediment. Amid this barren plain, the nodules offer a rare, firm surface for life to cling to. Some sponges and molluscs are unique to them, while nematode worms and crustacean larvae have been found living within their crevices. ""They’re like the rocky areas in a garden – you’re going to have more species living there than you would if you only had soil,"" says Daniel Jones of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, UK, who studies the effects of human interventions on deep-sea life. Yet recently these nodules have also caught the eye of a rapacious land mammal, which needs them for their smartphones. What that expedition chemist in 1873 didn’t identify is that the nodules also contain metals, such as cobalt, nickel, copper, titanium and rare earth elements. These would one day present immense value to human beings. As 21st Century technology surges, so too does the demand for its constituent materials, such as cobalt, which is used in lithium-ion batteries to power cars and electronics. The trouble is that, currently, much the stuff comes from problematic sources. The Democratic Republic of Congo extracts more than 60% of the global cobalt supply from land-based mines, but activity there has been linked to human rights abuses and child labour. That makes oceanic nodules an increasingly appealing target, despite the daunting engineering challenges of getting to them. In one Pacific region – the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) – a conservative estimate suggests there are about 20 billion tonnes, if the nodules there were removed and dried out. While for decades they were considered uneconomic to exploit, a number of mining organisations are now mobilising to remove them, along with other types of subsea mineral deposit. If it goes ahead, hundreds of square kilometres per year will be dredged. What will the impact be? In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers and mining companies made the first tentative steps to assessing both the feasibility and environmental consequences. At various sites within the CCZ, as well as at another location near Peru called Discol (DIS-turbance and re-COL-onisation experiment), ships dragged specialised metal rakes and ploughs over the Pacific floor to scoop up the nodules and pull them to the surface. While it didn’t exactly mimic the dredging machinery planned for future mines, and the scale is much smaller, the effects provide some of the best evidence we have. In some cases, the tracks were left behind by scientists curious about what would happen to an otherwise untouched ecosystem. At others, it was the nascent mining organisations themselves, testing their extraction technologies. One effort even involved the US’s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), a consortium of industry groups led by what is now Lockheed Martin, deployed test extractions on the Hughes Glomar Explorer. This ship would later gain fame for other reasons – it also carried a giant claw designed for a secret attempt to lift a Russian submarine off the seafloor. Years later, as plans for deep-sea mining have accelerated and exploratory permission opens up, researchers have returned to these locations in the Pacific to study the long-term effects. What they found is that, even after decades, life in these artificial trenches still hasn’t returned to normal. (Read more from the BBC about commercial deep-sea mining: ""The secrets of the ocean floor"".) On land, life tends to spring from the ploughed lines of a field, but in the deep sea the trenches are relatively barren. The creatures that relied on the nodules, now removed, cannot re-colonise. And others, which require soft sediment to burrow and find mobilised food, cannot live on the artificially compacted surfaces. ""Communities of these nodule-bearing abyssal plains will be especially vulnerable to the risk of extinction brought about by the efforts to extract them,"" concluded Lara Macheriotou of the University of Ghent and colleagues in a paper published earlier this year. And it’s possible, say scientists, that such effects could linger for hundreds if not thousands of years. Watch a submersible drifting over tracks on the ocean floor at the CCZ and Discol sites: The sociologist Barbara Adam once proposed that the world can be thought of in terms of adjacent ""timescapes"", which are characterised by their pace. She described how industrial or agricultural timescapes move at a much faster clip than natural and ecological ones. All these temporal regimes are interwoven, but when one is forced to move at the pace of another, long-term environmental damage becomes a risk. The timescape of the deep ocean is slow and patient. So when humanity sends its machines down there to remove subsea materials, it is two different regimes of time colliding: the pace of an oceanic abyss versus a fast, short-termist desire for new technology.  The deep ocean couldn’t be further removed from the verdant ecosystems and accelerating societies of Earth's landmasses. Temperatures on the abyssal plain hover close to freezing, the pressure is crushing, and there’s almost no light. The organisms that cling to life survive on a diet of ""marine snow"". This continuous shower of organic detritus, often digested three or four times, rains down from above. ""It’s a low temperature, low food, low energy environment, and this tends to set the pace of life,"" says Jones. ""The animals are not subject to the extremes of physical change you get in shallower waters. This is likely to be an area where any disturbance is long-lasting."" But while these regions might seem like the deserts of the sea – certainly compared with the lively corals of shallow tropical waters – they are major reservoirs of biodiversity, and play a vital role in the carbon cycle via natural sequestration. ""Many of the animals we see are new to science… and some organisms have pharmaceutically active compounds,"" says Jones. Long-term, there's also potential for interaction with fisheries higher up the water column. ""There are functions performed by these communities that might not become valuable for centuries in some cases."" We often can't see the life within this vast space, because it's too small and far too distributed to capture its scale with a photograph. There are no charismatic megafauna to put on a poster. But life exists there in overwhelming diversity, and it covers half our planet. Some might argue that damaging deep ocean life is a sacrifice worth making when weighed against human rights abuses at mines in Africa. Yet it is unlikely that one type of mining will simply displace the other, says David Santillo of Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, who recently co-authored a review of seabed mining and its potential impacts in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. ""There are different companies involved, different markets to some extent, different demand-side pressures and incentives... so if seabed mining does take off, it is more likely that it will simply become an additional source of minerals.""  While the importance of deep-sea life may be difficult to quantify in human moral or economic terms, it does nonetheless have an intrinsic value. And the fact that its slow, long-term timescales are so quick to disrupt should be a reason for caution, according to the scientists I spoke with.  As for those dredged tracks, if future generations one day find them on the ocean floor, they will have persisted long beyond the lifetime of the smartphone, laptop or electric car that helped to carve them. In the words of David Farrier, author of the book Footprints, such traces eventually become ""future fossils"". In the age of the Anthropocene, Farrier argues that we are leaving behind unwanted industrial, chemical and geological heirlooms that will persist for centuries. ""Future fossils are our legacy and therefore our opportunity to choose how we will be remembered,"" he writes. ""They will record whether we carried on heedlessly despite the dangers we knew to lie ahead, or whether we cared enough to change our course. Our footprints will reveal how we lived to anyone still around to discover them, hinting at the things we cherished or neglected, the journeys we made and the direction we chose to take."" It's possible the marks may well be read as a damning signature of our consumption habits in the early 21st Century. ""If we are going to run out of certain minerals unless we destroy a large area of the seabed, then surely this is the signal to look again at how wasteful we are being with those minerals we have,"" says Santillo. ""If what we end up doing by mining the seabed is simply to extend unsustainable consumption patterns for another 30 years, or even accelerate them by bringing yet more materials to market… we won't have changed anything."" Sitting in London as I write this, my world is small and short-term, circumscribed by the restrictions of a UK lockdown and working from home. Yet more than anywhere in recent weeks, my mind has wandered back to the abyssal plain. In a time when many of the maps I look at nowadays plot the spread of the virus, here is a location on Earth that could not be further away from the pandemic.  Perhaps part of what draws me is the sheer extremity of this oceanic wilderness. I’ll probably never get to see it with my own eyes. Even the scientists who study it now use remote cameras, rather than descending to the seafloor themselves. The deep sea, and the life within it, has a scale that defies the imagination, both spatially and temporally. It is unaffected by what is happening on land – and this has been true for millennia. Yet this may be the century where that changes; where we leave much more than one or two scrapings on the ocean floor. When researchers talk of human interventions in the deep sea, one word they often use is ""disturbance"". In scientific language, it refers to a lofting and dispersal of sediment plumes, and the effects on subsea communities. But the word disturbance has another meaning – that of an irrational disorder.  *Richard Fisher is a senior journalist for BBC Future.

Yield Spread Analysis,How China became a PC superpower,2024-09-14,2020-02-20,Leila McNeill,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200219-xia-peisu-the-computer-pioneer-who-built-modern-china,"Isolated from the rest of the world, one woman pushed computing from a geeky obsession into a transformative industry.   In April 1960, China’s first home-grown electronic digital general purpose computer – the Model 107 – went live. Xia Peisu, the machine’s engineer and designer, had just made history.   After decades of war with Japan and the Chinese Civil War in the first half of the 20th Century, the country’s technological innovation had fallen behind much of the developed world. Later, caught in the politics of the Cold War, the newly established People’s Republic of China was cut off from aid and exports from capitalist nations in the West. Chinese scientists relied heavily on hardware and expertise from the Soviet Union to build up their computing power.   But when that relationship dissolved in 1959, China was once again isolated and it had to look inward for a way forward in an increasingly computerised world. Within a year of the Soviet Union withdrawing aid, Xia delivered the 107 – China’s first step on the road to independence in computing.   Today, China is a global leader in computer production. In 2011, China surpassed the US to become the world’s leading market for PCs, and the desktop PC segment of their computer industry alone is projected to bring in a revenue of over $6.4bn (£4.9bn) this year.   But there was more work to be done than making computers. To build a new computer industry – and a new field of computer science to support that industry – China needed trained personnel. Here, too, Xia was essential.   She helped shape some of China’s first computing and computer science institutions and developed their training materials. She taught the first computer theory class in the country. Over her career, she would usher hundreds of students into the country’s burgeoning field of computer science.   In the aftermath of war and political upheaval, Xia shaped a new field of science and a new industry in China. Through both her technological innovations and the many students she taught, Xia‘s influence resonates throughout China’s computing world today.   You might also like: • The female scientist who changed human fertility forever  • The woman who reshaped maths  • The number glitch that can lead to catastrophe   Born into a family of educators in the south-eastern municipality of Chongqing on 28 July 1923, Xia rarely went without an education. First attending primary school aged four and receiving private home tutelage at eight, she went on to excel at Nanyu Secondary School and graduated top of her high school class at National No. Nine in 1940.   China was in the throes of the Second Sino-Japanese War, an eight-year conflict that ravaged China and claimed the lives of millions of Chinese civilians. At the war’s onset in 1937, the Japanese captured Nanjing, the capital city of the Republic of China. Xia’s home of Chongqing became a haven for Nanjing refugees. It also became home to National Central University – an institution which, despite forced relocation from Nanjing, kept teaching students. In 1941, Xia joined as a student in electrical engineering.   Xia graduated with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1945. The same year she met Nanjing war refugee and fellow National Central alumnus Yang Liming, now a professor of physics at the university. They started and maintained a relationship even after Xia left for Shanghai for graduate studies at the Telecommunications Institute of Jiaotong University and Yang left to study under Nobel laureate Max Born at the University of Edinburgh.   Two years later, Xia reunited with Yang when she began to study for her doctorate in electrical engineering at the University of Edinburgh. In her dissertation, “On Parametric Oscillations in Electric Circuits and A Graphical Analysis for Non-Linear Systems”, she developed methodologies that could more accurately predict variations in frequency and amplitude within electronic systems, which led to wide-reaching applications for any system with an electrical frequency, from radios to TV to computers.   In 1950, she was awarded her PhD. Later that same year, she and Yang married in Edinburgh. Both scientifically-minded and deeply invested in putting those minds to work in their home country, the couple returned to China in 1951. They both took up positions at Tsinghua University (or Qinghua University), where Xia worked on telecommunications research. The China that she and Yang returned to, however, was a changed one.   In 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had prevailed over the Kuomintang party (Chinese Nationalist Party) in the Chinese Civil War, driving the Republic of China to Taiwan and replacing it with People’s Republic of China led by Mao Zedong. In the wake of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the transfer of political parties, China’s economy, industry, and infrastructure was languishing and lagging behind many Western nations.   The Second Sino-Japanese War had hit the country particularly hard. “In essence, all institutions of higher learning, all centres of finance, the main centre of industrial production and the government of China has fled, first to the city of Wuhan, and then after Wuhan [was] lost, to the city of Chongqing in [the] more remote and much poorer area of Sichuan,” says Tom Mullaney, historian at Stanford University and author of the forthcoming book The Chinese Computer. “[The government of China is] basically living a kind of survival existence, but it’s definitely not in any kind of position to invest in electrical engineering, weapon design, and so forth.”   When the CCP came to power, they attempted to rebuild the lost infrastructure, but it wasn’t easy. The US had supported the defeated Kuomintang party in the Chinese Civil War, and they, along with other capitalist nations in the West, denied the newly formed communist country assistance and exports. Mao and the CCP turned to their Soviet neighbours to the north. Seeing an opportunity to bring China into the communist block in the East, the Soviet Union entered into a partnership with China, agreeing to assist China in bolstering its economy, science and technology, including computing. Xia became intricately tied to Sino-Soviet partnership when, in 1953, mathematician Hua Luogeng visited her place of work at Tsinghua University and recruited her into his computer research group at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). She was now one of the three founding members of China’s first computer research group. The CAS would become ground zero for computing technology and research and Xia would be at its centre.   Even though Luogeng’s and Xia’s research group had been developing plans of their own to design electronic computers for three years, the CCP didn’t adopt an official in this area of technology until 1956, with the formalisation of the Sino-Soviet agreement “Long-term Protocol for Developing National Sciences and Technology between 1956 and 1967” – also known as the 12-year plan. Together with Soviet experts, the CCP and the CAS identified computing technology as one of four fields in science and technology key to building up China’s national defense.   An electronic computer would have wide-reaching applications in support of China’s infrastructure and national defense, including development and testing of nuclear weapons, management of large-scale complex transportation systems and development of a satellite program or space program, says Mullaney. “All of these things, and more, were domains in which other powers – the Soviet Union, the US, Great Britain and later France – were developing electronic computing in support of. And China knew that it needed to be able to enter that space if it was going to become competitive on the global stage, economically and militarily.”   China had a long way to go before they could produce a computer. For one, rather than having a single field of computer science, the industry’s fundamental parts were spread out over mathematics, engineering and physics. These would need to be consolidated and then taught to a workforce before a computer could be built.   With her knowledge of electronics and mathematics, Xia was an ideal choice for this part of the plan. In 1956, she joined a delegation to Moscow and Leningrad to explore Soviet research, production and education in computing. When she returned that same year, she undertook translation of Soviet computer design from Russian into Chinese, including a 1,000-page manual that became the course text for teaching Chinese students Soviet computing.   That same year, under the auspices of the CAS’s Institute of Mathematics and Institute of Physics, Xia taught the country’s first computer theory class. She also helped the CAS in its first major step in establishing a computer science department with the Institute of Computer Technology (ICT). The ICT was quickly followed by the CAS’s founding of the University of Science and Technology. Xia was involved in developing the computer science courses at both institutions, and as a course developer and lecturer, she oversaw the training of hundreds of students between 1956 and 1962.    “What [China] needed above all was a training program,” Mullaney notes. Xia gave them one.   By 1959, China had succeeded in replicating two Soviet electronic computer designs; the 103 model and the 104 model, each based on the Soviet M-3 and BESM-II computers respectively. But just as China began making progress in producing computers, the Sino-Soviet relationship was in dissolution. The two countries’ leaders sparred over whose nation was the centre of the communist world and whose path to global communism was the right one.   The relationship had become so bad by 1960 that the Soviet Union withdrew all support, both material and advisorial, from China, says Mullaney. After the Soviets withdrew, many other countries assumed that China’s computing industry just stopped.   It didn’t. CAS researchers continued to pursue computing technology and computer science on their own. Xia’s 107 model was the first computer that China developed after Soviet withdrawal, and unlike the 103 and 104 models based on Soviet design, the 107 was the first indigenously designed and developed computer in China. The 107 was soon reproduced and installed in training institutions around China.   Throughout the 1960s, China continued to develop more powerful and sophisticated computers at the CAS in isolation, progressing from tube circuits like that of the 107 to transistors and, in the 70s and early 80s, to integrated circuits. When a delegation of US computer scientists visited China in 1972, they didn’t expect to find China’s computer industry humming along. “All of the members of that delegation, in the few testimonials we have, all express surprise at how far [China had come],” Mullaney says.   Throughout this time, Xia continued a balance of research and development in high processing speed computers and training new computer scientists and engineers. In 1978, Xia helped found the Chinese Journal of Computers as well as the Journal of Computer Science and Technology, the first English-language journal for computing in the country. And in 1981, she developed a high-speed processor array called the 150AP. Compared to the earlier Soviet-based model 104 that performed 10,000 operations per second, her 150AP boosted a computer’s operations to 20 million per second.  Due in large part to Xia, computer science coalesced into an independent field of study in China and the country’s computer industry emerged despite a tumultuous beginning. “In terms of someone who held her position and was such a central actor in a leadership role, I have not come across other women of her stature at that time,” Mullaney says.   Although her design of the 107 made history, it was Xia’s founding of institutions and cultivation of cohort after cohort of students that ultimately made China’s future. “Those are students who… would lay groundwork for what we see today,” says Mullaney.   One of those students later became the chief architect of Loongson CPUs, and in 2002, he personally honored his mentor by naming the processing chip of China’s first CPU computer “Xia 50”.   Dubbed in China the “Mother of Chinese Computing”, Xia is still recognised as a founding member of the country’s computer industry. The China Computer Federation awards the Xia-Peisu Award annually to women scientist and engineers “who have made outstanding contributions and achievements in the computing science, engineering, education and industry”. Chen Zuoning and Huan Lingyi received the award most recently in 2019: Chen for her work in developing domestic high-performance computing systems and Huan for her research in CPUs and other core computer devices. Continuing along the path Xia charted for them, Chen and Huan have strengthened China’s domestic computer technology. -- Missed Genius Ask people to imagine a scientist, and many of us will picture the same thing – a heterosexual white male. Historically, a number of challenges have made it much more difficult for those who don’t fit that stereotype to enter fields like science, math or engineering. There are, however, many individuals from diverse backgrounds who have shaped our understanding of life and the Universe, but whose stories have gone untold – until now.

Yield Spread Analysis,How future historians will study us,2024-09-14,2021-08-19,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210819-what-will-todays-data-tell-future-historians,"Social media posts, algorithms and conspiracy theories might shape how future generations understand the world today. When John Randolph wrote his first book, about the lives of the Bakunin family in 19th-Century Russia, he had mountains of source material to work from. ""I read hundreds, probably thousands, of letters,"" he recalls. ""All of these messages were meticulously preserved and ordered in a family archive."" The Bakunins narrated their lives and relationships in great depth in those letters, bequeathing fascinating details to future historians such as Randolph, director of the Russian, East European and Eurasian Center at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. But what if he had had an archive of social media posts and photographs to work with instead? Inevitably, the form and content of surviving records shapes the perspective of anyone who seeks to explore the past. That raises an interesting question for our age: if digital media survive long enough to be studied by future historians (though there's no guarantee that they will), how will that influence their judgements about us as people? Casual text messages, emails and social media posts offer glimpses of unfolding events and opinions shared. Future historians will also likely have a rich understanding of what life during our time was like, thanks to gazillions of photos and video records. They'll be able to understand the body language and vocal intonations of someone in the 1990s, whereas we have relatively little idea of what these things were actually like in, say, the 1390s. ""One of the amazing things that's happening right now is we're getting a much fuller, rounder vision of the past that has much more material, it has more colour,"" says Randolph. Films and TV shows, as well as personal photos, videos and social media posts, record in exquisite detail how people carry out daily tasks. The pressures they face. How they travel, eat and socialise. Never before in human history have we documented so excessively the minutiae of living. Anyone who studies the history of food, sport, transport, leisure, or any other aspect of our lifestyles will have a field day. You might also like:  But what about how we think? On one hand, many people tweet or post online updates about their thoughts and emotions all the time. On the other, the lengthy, detailed narratives that people sought to write down in letters hundreds of years ago may be considered rarer. Prolific letter writers didn't just preserve what happened, they also narrated events and their personal responses to them – from Mary Montagu, who introduced smallpox inoculation to Britain after witnessing it abroad, to Horace Walpole, whose letters captured all kinds of societal changes, including the Georgian craze for spa-bathing. Blogs, non-fiction books and some longform journalism have arguably taken the place of letters today, though they are by definition less private and potentially less intimate sources of information. Katrin Weller, an information scientist and head of the social analytics and services team at the GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany, says that, given the nature of social media today, future historians may judge our era as a particularly narcissistic one – perhaps rightly. Social capital has always mattered in human society, and vanity is certainly nothing new. However, Weller suggests that the endless posting of selfies and self-promotion in status updates suggests that huge numbers of people today are highly conscious of how they're perceived by others. The fact that people care so much about this might bemuse researchers of the future. ""Imagine galleries or museum collections you wander through and see the most influential Instagrammers of today and what they were posting,"" says Weller. While 17th-Century portraits tend to depict aristocrats and royals, since they were the ones wealthy enough to employ artists who could capture their likenesses, the visual media that survives us may be skewed in its own way – towards those who were most visible and vocal on the web. Class still matters but practically anyone can chronicle their own life on social media today. And future researchers won't just rely on digital records. Where it survives, they'll also pick through the physical artefacts we leave behind. One material in particular will probably endure more widely, and for longer, than any other – plastic. Packaging, for example, retains all kinds of details about the products we buy and also what food we eat, which ingredients are used, and how we store such items. (It's now relatively common to find decades-old plastic littering the environment. My sister found a 30-year-old crisp packet buried in her garden recently.) That's another thing that will be obvious to future generations – we produced copious volumes of waste and didn't really know what to do with it. Here's hoping that people have a better handle on things in the centuries to come. Knowing what daily life was like in the 21st-Century may be relatively easy, then, in the distant future. But Weller notes that one of the other big questions any historian asks about whatever period they're studying is how and why significant historical events unfolded as they did. For instance – why did a particular political movement catch on, and how did it spread? Social media might well record viral memes and messages but that alone won't necessarily explain the popularity of an idea across the wider population. ""This currently is the age where algorithms shape a lot of our lives,"" notes Weller. It's something researchers struggle to fully understand today. Unless the inner workings of algorithmic systems are preserved for retrospective analysis, their impact on the course of history could end up becoming a bit of a mystery, a gigantic black box. It might also be difficult or impossible to know what it was like to actually use a website like Facebook, even if Facebook content from our time is preserved and made accessible in years to come. Alexis Madrigal notes in The Atlantic that the functionality of social media websites is not usually stored every time such sites are updated or redesigned. These updates also tend to happen very frequently. (Read more about how social media is decaying our historical record.) Most of all, the ebb and flow of ideologies and political passions could leave future historians scratching their heads. Given the disinformation that flies about on social media, they may well wonder: why did a small but vocal number of people in the early 21st Century turn to conspiracy theories about the Earth being flat, or vaccines being ""weaponised""? It's arguably hard to fathom even now, let alone in the future when none of us will be around to provide testimony to any of this. Did algorithms of the 21st Century manipulate people to such an extent that a few were brainwashed? Some folk may have been more susceptible than others to the lure of manipulative media – but why, exactly, were they so easily taken in? The same questions that we ask ourselves today may linger for centuries to come. One worrying possibility is that the digital disinformation of today will be taken at face value in the future. Imagine people 100 years from now scouring digital newspaper columns, blogs and tweets, and having the same disagreements over, say, the benefits of Brexit or the behaviour of former US President Donald Trump, because they have huge stores of polarised messaging to pore over. ""People will be able to reach into the box and pull out whatever they want and that is definitely going to be an amplified problem, just because of the scale of the material,"" says Randolph. In other words, today's disinformation could end up distorting history. That possibility is made even greater thanks to digital media because the web functions as a giant ""decontextualisation machine"", adds Randolph. Pictures and video often appear without any information about where they came from, when they were made, or who made them. It's also not always clear whether they were edited, or if they were generated as ""deep fakes"" by artificial intelligence systems. It's a concern shared by Clare Miles, a history blogger who has considered the informational value of memes to future generations. Today's memes could be described as an evolved form of the political cartoon of the 18th Century. They're visually arresting and usually contain some snappy and sardonic observation or caption. However, as with some old cartoons, the creator's identity and motivations are usually unknown. ""When studying memes in the future, we might have to consider that they were created by someone who held a radically different interpretation of a certain event or topic based on information that they truly thought was real,"" writes Miles. And there is simply so much data flying about the web today that wading through it centuries from now in an attempt to find the bits that are genuinely illuminating might be a daunting task. ""I think we're going to present future generations with the archival equivalent of a really rich hoarder's attic in which you have lots of random stuff,"" says Randolph. Historians will probably be forced to rely on data science methods to search and organise archives automatically for the information they require. There is also the converse possibility that the sheer volume of information left behind could make the past seem quite bland. People may, rightly or wrongly, assume that they already have a good idea of what life was like the 2000s, for instance, and obsess about the 1800s instead. But Weller doesn't think this will happen. Future generations might yet marvel at the career of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, or spend decades attempting to understand the rapidly changing lives of people who grew up in developing countries during our age. One wonders whether the tweets and blog posts we leave behind will fully reveal how our society thought about and attempted to address huge challenges such as climate change. What did we do, and why – or why not?

Yield Spread Analysis,Should we name heatwaves like storms?,2024-09-14,2021-08-27,Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210825-why-the-health-risks-of-overheating-go-unnoticed,"By the end of the century, three-quarters of the world could be at risk of deadly heat. And yet, we still struggle to design cities to be heatwave ready. Jennifer Walker spends most of her life on the pavement – which is scorchingly hot in Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley. For the past six months, she's lived out of a tent next to a large shop, surrounded by bags of food, clothes, and many bottles of water. When it gets too hot, she'll sit inside the covered car park, or use the battery-powered fan inside her tent. The heat is oppressive, but Walker is cheerfully thinking about how much worse the climate could feel. And given her lack of good indoor housing options, ""I'm going to stay outside,"" she says. It's grimly clear that due to human-induced climate change, heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense – and affecting many more people than those who live on the streets, like Walker. Presently, 30% of people worldwide are at risk of potentially deadly heat exposure for over 20 days a year. Depending on the rate of human-induced climate change, that proportion could reach 74% by 2100. The good news is that there is a bevy of simple ways to combat health risks from heat. One of the most important aspects is the most basic: simply recognising that high temperatures are a problem. Because heat is a slow-moving, gradually accumulating disaster, its effects can be invisible. Heat is one of the biggest weather-related killers, but no one knows for sure just how many lives it claims. It isn't always mentioned as a factor in death certificates, so coroners and medical professionals can't grasp the full scale of heat as a health hazard. In many places, heat continues to be perceived largely as a blessing, rather than as a threat. For instance, Japanese cities have a custom of competing with each other for the title of ""hottest city in Japan"". This can be a lucrative tourism slogan, but risks understating the dangers of heat-related illnesses – something that should be painfully clear in Japan, where over 1,000 people died in a heatwave in 2018. Earlier and more effective public health warnings can challenge the underestimation of heat risks. In Ahmedabad in India, early heat warnings have been sent to people's phones via WhatsApp, as part of a package of measures that have been found to effectively increase awareness of the risks of heatwaves. Meanwhile, state-appointed ""heat officers"" in Florida have called for a naming system for heatwaves, similar to that used to name hurricanes. Technology may help. Jennifer Runkle, an environmental epidemiologist at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies, researches the emerging field of wearable sensors to track body temperature and signs of heat strain. ""We're really interested in how to use this technology to promote sustained engagement in and response to heat warnings,"" she explains. ""One way to protect against dismissal or inaction is to incorporate these data into electronic health records, and… encourage health providers and support partners to inquire about these data during routine care visits."" Although messaging is important, how those messages are delivered matters. Too frequent warnings, or confusing colour coding, can result in people ignoring advice. Adding more warnings might not have the intended results. ""The real challenge isn't the warning systems, but the behaviour change,"" according to Public Health England consultant Emer O'Connell. And that's if people actually encounter the risk advisories. Older and less-educated people are less likely to receive heat warnings. The elderly make up the majority of people at risk of heat stress. Yet despite being the most vulnerable group, many don't consider themselves in danger. In the UK, the homes of over-75s are more prone to overheating, but these residents are less likely to report overheating. Similarly, a French study found that only 4% of people surveyed in the 65-and-over age group considered themselves at high risk during heatwaves. There are good reasons for this disconnect. Certain medications and health conditions can make it hard to determine body temperature, and to respond swiftly to the dangers. The symptoms of heatstroke – including confusion, cramps and fatigue – can be hard to differentiate from other medical conditions, including Covid-19. Cognitive impairment adds another challenge, as does resistance to changing habits. The dismissal of heat risks isn't just about individuals. Among policymakers in some places, there's a bias toward cold management rather than heat management, and towards addressing more spectacular climate-linked events like floods. Even in Japan – which is so prepared for emergencies that there's a national Disaster Prevention Day, and where many institutions regularly carry out disaster drills – disaster prevention education programs don’t always incorporate excessive heat. One of the most important action areas to reduce soaring temperatures is to increase green space in cities, from roofs to parks. Urban greening works to combat heat, says Gerardo Sanchez Martinez, an environment and health expert at the European Environment Agency. Yet all too often, urban management isn't fully implemented as part of heat-health action plans. Admittedly, tree planting is no panacea, and some urban tree-planting programmes have fallen far short of their goals. Yet it's clear that trees save lives. An analysis of extreme heat in the US city of Baltimore has found that increasing tree cover by 10% averts 83 deaths each year. According to Edith de Guzman, an environmental researcher who heads the Los Angeles Urban Cooling Collaborative, ""we have to be collectively smart about what we plant where"". The wrong tree in the wrong place can lead to problems. Large trees in small spaces can lead to broken sidewalks, making cities unequally accessible, and in desert cities, options for shade trees are limited. Careful selection of tree species, areas for planting, and community partners can also address the persistent inequalities of which neighbourhoods benefit from trees, while reducing the threat of gentrification posed by some tree-planting programmes. In LA, as in many cities, the poorer the neighbourhood, the sparser the tree cover is. Shade and ventilation should be incorporated into other aspects of building and urban design, from covered walkways to cross-ventilation (where outdoor air quality is decent) to shaded panels that move in response to sunlight. When it comes to surfaces, white paint and solar-blocking paint help to reflect sunlight, reducing the need for mechanical cooling. Finding affordable materials to insulate housing, such as in informal settlements in Karachi, in Pakistan, would help to reduce heat transfer. And simply creating more drinking fountains and designating more public toilets would help to keep people hydrated.   There are also some overlooked areas where small innovations could save lives. For instance, UK care homes are typically required under health and safety codes to have window restrictors on upper floors to prevent falls, allowing windows to be opened only a crack. This represents a trade-off between one type of safety (risk of falling) and another type (risk of overheating). ""I think this is an interesting design problem to be solved: how do we design a window that's fall-safe and also allows for ventilation on a hot day? There's a lot of space for design innovation,"" says Anna Mavrogianni, who researches sustainable building and urban design at University College London. There's also enormous room for improved design and take-up of cooling. ""Passive"" isn't usually a positive word, but it is with regard to cooling. Behavioural changes, such as placing blinds over bright windows, are simple, common-sense, cost-saving measures. Of course, these options aren’t available to all. Indeed, much of the world needs more mechanical cooling, not less. While air conditioning is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, it remains an effective heat emergency measure. ""A/C in the short term will prevent heat-related deaths more than anything else, period,"" says Vivek Shandas, a climate change researcher at Portland State University in the US. Changes in driver behaviour can temper the need to crank up the A/C. Parking in the shade, avoiding driving in the hottest parts of the day, carpooling, and switching to public transport will all reduce the need for mobile air conditioning. Na'Taki Osbourne Jelks, an environmental health scientist and community organiser, says of her Atlanta community, ""In some cases, people either don't have air conditioning, or even if they do, there have been certain parts of our community that are heavily burdened by high energy costs."" Even fans can be a luxury to some. Globally, about 3.6 billion cooling appliances are actually being used. This is dwarfed by the number of devices needed to meet people's needs, which could reach 14 billion by 2050. The problem is that air conditioning is indispensable in some places but also contributes to the causes of overheating. And over-relying on A/C could also lead to power disruptions, ironically increasing the death toll of heat, as in Pakistan in 2015 and 2018. ""The impact of cooling on climate change is twofold,"" explains Fionnuala Walravens, a campaigner at the Environmental Investigation Agency. ""Yes, we have the energy used by your cooling system, but one of the often-forgotten sides of cooling is the fact that ironically, cooling products are powered by very potent greenhouse gases called HFCs. These gases often leak out of air conditioners or general cooling products during use, but also at the end of their life. And they have a huge impact on the climate."" Another alternative to HFC-based cooling is solar-powered evaporative cooling, which essentially uses water to cool and can be useful for places that are high in temperature while low in humidity (although it may strain the water supply in drought-stressed areas). Japanese energy researchers have also developed a swirling technology that improves the efficiency of air conditioning. There are some other easy wins. One of Walravens' bugbears is supermarkets leaving refrigerator doors open, or off altogether. Sometimes about half of the energy toll from refrigerated cases comes from the lack of doors, she says.   Just as important as technical measures are addressing social isolation and inequality, given that many elderly and disabled people die of overheating alone in their homes or on the streets. Those with limited technological access or literacy may rely on acquaintances and loved ones checking in during heatwaves. So several US cities are facilitating ""heat ambassadors"". In New York City, the Be a Buddy programme connects neighbourhood volunteers with vulnerable residents during heatwaves. In Phoenix, researchers are testing indoor temperature sensors that send warning messages to the friends or families of vulnerable people. Around the world, the many mutual aid groups that sprang up during the Covid-19 pandemic could be repurposed to respond to heat risks. One whimsical lesson can be taken from Japan, where shochumimai, or summertime greeting cards, are traditionally sent to friends and family during the hottest part of the year. With messages like ""As the fierce heat of summer continues, how are you spending your days?"", this is a low-key way to check on someone’s health in the heat – as well as to spread the vital message that heat can kill. The good news, emerging from the recent news of terrible heatwaves, is that this year may represent a sea change. ""I've been working in this area for probably 15 years now. And I think, again, perception is absolutely key,"" says Mavrogianni. ""I think people's awareness has been increasing. And I just hope that there will be action and adaptation before it is too late."" * Reporting for this article was supported by the Social Science Research Council and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership, through the Abe Fellowship for Journalists. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,The neglected disease killing thousands,2024-09-14,2021-04-14,Richard Gray,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210413-how-rubber-boots-can-save-people-from-snake-bites,"Venomous snake bites are responsible for 138,000 deaths every year around the world, but could some disarmingly simple interventions help to save lives? ""In the monsoon, the fields are overgrown with weeds,"" says Tukaram Rao, a farm labourer from the village of Rathnapuri in Karnataka, south-west India. ""We have to walk out in the midst of those at night to turn on the water pump for the field. Sometimes if the water pipes are disjointed, we walk alongside the water pipe, feeling with our hands to fix it."" Like many farm workers in rural India, Rao and his neighbours tend to get around barefoot. But lurking in the thick undergrowth is something more worrisome than leaking water pipes. This is the perfect habitat for the Russell's viper, a large, earth-coloured and highly venomous snake found across much of India and other parts of South Asia. These snakes are mainly active during the night and are masterful ambush predators, remaining motionless for long periods before striking ferociously at their prey. They mainly hunt rodents or small frogs that scurry into their path in the fields where they forage – these snakes are not interested in humans. Yet they account for more bites and deaths in India than any other species of snake. The Russell's viper is estimated to be responsible for as many as 43% of snake bites in India and is responsible for 30-40% of snake bites in Sri Lanka. Much of the reason for this is how they hunt. Sluggish to the point of immobility, they inch their way through the grass, their green and brown camouflage making them almost invisible in daylight. At night, they are impossible to spot. For farmers working in paddy fields or among overgrown plants, the snakes are easy to step on or disturb. And when they feel threatened, the Russell's viper quickly becomes aggressive, striking out at random with its fangs. ""Sometimes they go away, sometimes we end up getting bit,"" says 48-year-old Rao about the snakes they encounter when working in the fields. Most villagers are scared of the snakes, he says and usually run away when they come across one in the field. This fear is perhaps well founded. There are around 2.8 million cases of snake bites in India each year and 50,000 deaths. In the past two decades, more than 1.2 million people have died from snake bites in India alone, according to one recent analysis. Globally snake bites are thought to cause between 81,000 and 138,000 deaths each year, according to some estimates. But the true impact of snake bites is greater still. A bite from a venomous snake can leave survivors with life-changing injuries. It is something Rao has seen first-hand. ""Another farmer was recently weeding his turmeric field when he accidentally got bit on his leg and the flesh around his ankle rotted away,"" he says. ""The rot spread to his knee. Now he is unable to do any work."" Doctors were eventually forced to amputate part of the unfortunate man's leg and his wife has had to take on extra work to provide for the family, Rao adds. It is not an uncommon story. ""Three times as many victims – around 400,000 per year – are left with long-term disabilities such as limb necrosis leading to amputations, disfigurement and blindness,"" says Laura-Oana Albulescu, who studies snake venom at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK. ""The psychological sequelae are only now being investigated but are significant as people can end up unable to work, destitute from the treatment cost, not fitting into their society – disabled young girls are not able to work or marry."" The global health burden created by snake bites is thought to be huge. Of the estimated 4.5 million people who are bitten by snakes worldwide each year, around 2.7 million men, women and children are left seriously injured, according to the Global Snakebite Initiative, a non-profit organisation aimed at addressing the problem of snake bites. ""Snake bites are a far bigger problem than many people realise,"" explains Leslie Boyer, founding director of the Venom Immunochemistry, Pharmacology and Emergency Response (Viper) Institute at the University of Arizona in the US. The World Health Organization considers snake bites to be such a burden on some communities that they recently classified snake bite envenomation – where venom is injected by a bite – as a neglected tropical disease. You might also be interested in:  Snake bites are now recognised as one of the world's most important neglected health problems and one that disproportionately affects poorer communities. But should snake bites be such a large problem? ""We've known how to make antivenoms for about 120 years,"" says Boyer, referring to some of the early work by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in France, the Lister Institute in England and the Butantan Institute in Brazil. While many antivenoms are relatively effective, the complex nature of snake venom can make treatment difficult. Access to antivenom can be patchy and treatments with it can be expensive. This has led some to seek other ways of tackling the health burden caused by snake bites. Rao and his neighbours are now involved in one such project aimed at helping the communities most at risk from snake bites to protect themselves. And the solution is deceptively simple – they are being given boots. ""Many people in rural parts of India are walking around in the dark without footwear,"" says Sumanth Bindumadhav, senior manager of the wildlife, disaster response and Dharwad program at the Humane Society International in India. ""Over 90% of bites occur when people step on a snake without even seeing them."" His organisation has handed out more than 400 rubber boots and 200 solar lamps to residents in Rao's village and the surrounding area. ""Putting a light in people's hands and footwear that will cover up to the ankle can seem simple, but it makes a big difference,"" says Bindumadhav. ""The Russell's viper has some of the longest fangs of any snake in India, but it is very hard for them to penetrate gumboots. And preventing snake bites is better than treating them."" Snake venom is a complex cocktail of toxins that varies from species to species. Some of the enzymes and small proteins found in snake venom interfere with the signals sent by nerve cells. Depending on the exact toxin, these can lead to rapid, painful muscle contractions or paralysis. Victims often suffocate as the muscles controlling the respiratory system malfunction. Other toxins, such as those found in black mamba venom, bind to heart muscle cells to prevent them from beating. Some toxins often found in viper venom cause victims to bleed to death by preventing blood clotting while others can cause blood cells to break down, starving victims of oxygen. There are toxins that cause the blood to coagulate in a bite victim's veins or attack the cells of key organs in the body. There are also venom toxins that trigger extreme inflammation or lead to necrosis, where the tissue on a limb dies and rots away. Many snakes have a combination of different toxins that can cause a number of these effects at once. It means treating snake bites is no simple task. ""Any one snake bite contains hundreds of toxins in different proportions that vary by individual species,"" says Boyer. ""You can't use a single small molecule drug against something like that."" Fortunately, antivenom is relatively easy to make, provided you have the know-how and access to some horses. At its most basic, antivenom is made by collecting venom from the snake you are interested in (a process known as ""milking""), injecting a small amount into a horse and then collecting the antibodies it then produces. These are then purified and can be injected into bite victims to neutralise any venom toxins they encounter. But it is not always effective and can require large amounts of antivenom as the number of antibodies in each dose can be low. ""Depending on the snake bite, it can take between one and 20 vials of antivenom, and there are cases in the US that have gone to 100 vials,"" says Boyer. In one study in South Africa, for example, snake bite victims received an average of five vials of antivenom each, but at some hospitals that figure was 19 vials per patient. The low levels of antibodies that target venom toxins in antivenom can also lead to other problems such as anaphylactic shock as the patient's immune system reacts to the animal antibodies in the antidote – a condition known as serum sickness. ""Unfortunately, only 15-20% of the antibodies are specific to and will neutralise venom toxins, hence the adverse reactions,"" says Albulescu. Antivenom can also be very expensive. Depending where you are in the world, a single vial can cost anything from $18-200 (£13-£145) in Sub-Saharan Africa to $17,000 (£12,362) in parts of the US. Boyer's own research group was instrumental in developing a rattlesnake antivenom sold in both Mexico and the US. It costs around $100-200 per vial (£73-£145) in Mexico but can cost several thousand dollars in the US. When she analysed the difference in costs between the two countries, Boyer found that much of the difference in price is due to the way healthcare is funded rather than production costs. ""Developing and manufacturing antivenom is a very small piece of the pie,"" she says. In Latin America, where venomous snakes are also a major problem, there has been a long history of domestic antivenom production from countries such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina that has helped to keep prices low and a steady supply, says Boyer. But legal, regulatory and hospital costs, alongside the idiosyncrasies of the US medical insurance system have driven up prices 1,000-fold in the US. Relatively low demand for venom in the US and Europe – around 7,000-8,000 people are bitten by snakes in the US annually – also leads to higher prices. This has knock-on effects for other parts of the world that have to rely on imported antivenom, Boyer adds. ""It is difficult to rear horses in areas where there is African horse sickness, so many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are reliant upon importing antivenom from Europe,"" she says. ""Even though antivenom is cheaper there, it can still cost many times the annual wage of a worker."" India has some of the cheapest antivenom in the world, costing around $6.5-11 (£4.7-8) per vial, but problems with quality and availability often mean patients do not get the treatment they need. ""Every year there is a shortage of antivenom,"" says Bindumadhav. Rural communities particularly struggle to get treatment and are disproportionately hit by the consequences of snake bites due to the wider costs of treatment and loss of income that can result. ""It tends to be the lowest strata of society who are getting bitten in the countries with the highest number of snake bites,"" says Bindumadhav. ""It is farmers and labourers rather than politicians and business leaders who are being bitten."" This means the problem is largely overlooked. Hospitals in India also primarily use a polyvalent (or multipurpose) antivenom as an antidote against the ""big four"" snakes that cause the majority of bites – the spectacled cobra, the common krait, saw-scaled viper and the Russell's viper. It is produced using venom from these four snakes. But India has more than 60 venomous species of snake and there is no specific antivenom against most of them. Instead, the ""big four"" antivenom is often used as a general snake bite treatment. Recent research has found, however, that it is largely ineffective against the venom of other important snakes in the country. To compound the problem further, other research has shown that even among the big four, the toxins in the venom can vary depending on where in the country they are. It means that antivenom produced using snakes in southern India might be less effective against the venom from the same species in the north or those in Sri Lanka or Nepal. Recently the Wellcome Trust launched a major new initiative to develop new drug treatments for snake bites in an effort to address the shortcomings of current antivenom treatments. It estimates that just £57m ($79m) was invested into research on snake bites in the decade between 2008-2017. It has pledged to spend £80m ($110m) over seven years on new research. Some researchers are focused on new antibody-based treatments that work against a wider range of snake venoms or induce less side effects. One approach has been to use camels instead of horses to make antivenom while others are attempting to manufacture human antibodies against snake venom, but both approaches are too expensive to yet be used commercially. Instead, some researchers are turning to other types of drug treatments that can work against some of the nastier components of snake venom. Albulescu is among them. She has found that a drug used to treat heavy metal poisoning in Germany called DMPS could be repurposed to be used as a first line intervention against the venom of saw-scaled vipers. This family of snakes, also known as carpet vipers, are found across Africa, the Middle East, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. When threatened they rub the scales on their body together to produce a distinctive sizzling sound, and they possess a highly toxic venom that contains enzymes known as metalloproteinases. These rely upon a zinc molecule in their structure to degrade the cell membranes of blood vessels and break down the structures there, leading to haemorrhaging that causes victims to bleed to death. Albulescu found that DMPS can capture the zinc in the metalloproteases and stop them from functioning. ""It's formulated as an oral capsule and can be administered easily in the field immediately after a bite,"" she says. ""We propose its use as a first line intervention which can neutralise some of the venom toxicity and prevent the onset of systemic haemorrhage, buying the victim time."" When DMPS was combined with a later antivenom treatment, Albulescu and her colleagues found survival in animal models increased to 100%. Of course, transferring such a treatment into humans and into the imperfect world of real-life situations, where giving such drugs in a timely fashion might be difficult. And saw-scaled viper venoms contain other unpleasant toxins that DMPS does not act against. Drugs that work against a wider range of snakes are also more desirable as often snake bite victims do not know exactly which species they have been bitten by. If the snake is misidentified, it can lead to inappropriate treatment. Albulescu and her team have made some progress, finding a mixture of two other toxin inhibitors that appear to work against a wider range of viper venoms including the Terciopelo, or fer-de-lance, in Central America, the puff adder in Africa and the Indian saw-scaled viper. Another group at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark recently announced that they had developed a drug that works against the neurotoxins found in many snake venoms, including those of cobra. The hope is eventually these could lead to drugs that can be easily stored and carried in first-aid kits as a way of reducing the potency of snake venom to buy victims some time. ""These are never going to be one-size-fits-all treatments,"" says Boyer. ""But they could be a bridge to antivenom. It could help someone survive the trip to a hospital where they stock antivenom or protect a limb from necrotising damage. It might also reduce the amount of antivenom that is needed."" But she adds that many of these small molecule drug treatments have yet to be proved in clinical settings. And they too could suffer from the same economic pitfalls as antivenom unless efforts are taken to keep prices low. Instead, Boyer is more excited about innovations that are taking place outside of the laboratory to keep people safe from snake bites. ""These are more about sharing knowledge so people can take care of their own and educating people about snakes,"" she says. One such example is the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation, an international group of researchers and medical professionals who train local doctors and nurses in Africa to manage snake bites alongside public health initiatives to help protect people from being bitten. They help local people understand where the risk of encountering snakes is high and how they can reduce them, such as moving debris away from houses. They also train motorcycle taxi drivers in basic snakebite first aid so they can transport patients from remote locations to treatment centres. In India, the Humane Society International has also been working to train doctors in the region around Karnataka to deal with snake bites, but it is also trying to educate rural communities with simple ways to reduce their risk too. The Indian krait, for example, is one of the ""big four"" snakes responsible for the majority of venomous bites in India. The venom of the common Indian krait can kill within a few hours and a higher proportion of its victims appear to die compared with other snakes. But it can be thwarted by a few simple steps, says Bindumadhav. ""It has a dubious reputation for biting people while they are asleep on the floor,"" he says. ""A simple solution is to have a mosquito net hung from above and tucked under the mattress. In India a net like this costs a dollar. It is not expensive."" But Bindumadhav says there are other challenges. ""There is still a tendency for some bite victims to be taken to a faith healer rather than to hospital,"" says Bindumadhav. ""The Russell's viper doesn't always inject venom when it bites – these are dry bites but the panic they cause can lead to psychological symptoms instead. Then they appear to get better after a trip to the healer. Unfortunately, in those cases where venom is injected, it means their treatment is delayed."" Knowing whether a bite victim has been envenomed is a challenge, particularly when antivenom treatments are in short supply. Some researchers are working on techniques to help them identify whether a bite victim has been injected with venom by using thermal imaging cameras. ""Most snake venoms, and for that matter many other animal venoms, result in tissue inflammation at the site of a bite,"" says Tamilarasu Kadhiravan, a professor of medicine at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Puducherry, India. ""Venom-induced inflammation is accompanied by an increase in skin temperature, which is seen as hotspots on infrared images."" He has found that the tissue around envenomated bites tends to be between 1-3C higher than the surrounding skin. He and his colleagues have used the technique to help identify which snakebite patients might need most attention. ""We treat 200-250 patients with snake bites every year,"" Kadhiravan says. ""Antivenoms are a precious resource. Typically, in our setting, treatment with 20 vials of antivenom for a single patient costs about $70 (5,278 Indian Rupees/£51)."" He says using an infrared imaging camera costs around $1 (75 Indian Rupees/£0.73) per patient. ""If infrared imaging could prevent wasteful use of antivenom in situations where it is not really indicated, it could be used to treat more patients who actually need it."" Technology is also helping with identification of snake species themselves, which in turn can also help to make treatment more effective. Doctors in Nepal and Switzerland, for example, have been developing genetic testing techniques to help identify the snake species responsible by analysing swabs taken from bite marks. While they found they could identify some of the species responsible, it only worked in around a quarter of cases and the technique still takes too long to be used effectively in an emergency setting to identify snakes. Instead, artificial intelligence could also offer some assistance by helping to identify snake species from photographs taken by eyewitnesses to a snake bite. Many victims of bystanders take images on their mobile phones to assist in identification, but unless a medical professional is trained to tell the difference between species, these can be of little use. Isabelle Bolon, a vet at the University of Geneva, in Switzerland, and her collaborators are developing an app that uses machine vision algorithms to automatically identify snake species. Knowing which species is responsible could not only ensure patients get the right treatment more quickly, but also help to build up a more accurate picture of which snakes are really responsible for bites. In Rathnapuri, India, the Humane Society International in India have been working alongside the conservation initiative The Liana Trust to understand more about the snakes that live around the villages by learning about their behaviour. Working with locals, Bindumadhav and the team have attached radio tags to around 30 snakes, allowing them to track and record the snakes' behaviour over a three-year period. ""Every morning we find the snakes, look at what habitat they are in, whether they are shedding their skin or have just fed,"" he says. ""We are looking at how close they are to where people are working, where they are moving. It is giving us a lot more accurate information that we need to help tell people how to avoid and respect the snakes."" Involving local people in this research has also been crucial as it is helping to overcome local resistance to the interventions they are attempting to introduce, says Bindumadhav. Farmers, for example, often prefer not to use boots or flashlights when working in the field as they impede their ability to move around or to do work quickly. Similar schemes to hand out boots in Africa have failed because villagers found the boots uncomfortable and as the rubber was valuable, they sold them off, says Albulescu. Boyer too has heard of similar problems. For farmers like Tukaram Rao, knowing more about the snakes has helped to dispel much of the fear that surrounds them. ""Before this, we used to be very scared of snakes,"" he says. ""We used to run away on seeing a snake or not work in that area at all. Now we have some basic knowledge. For example, when we go to work, we use a stick to check the area before we start working."" Rao had his own close encounter with a Russell's viper recently while walking from his house to secure his cows. ""I first noticed something shining in the pathway,"" he says. ""I asked my son to fetch a light and we drove it away."" He hopes that as they learn more about Russell's vipers and their behaviour, it could ultimately allow his community to live alongside the snakes rather than in conflict with them. ""Many people used to kill snakes on sight,"" he says. ""But as we understand them better it could lead to fewer snakes being killed."" Bindumadhav's ambitions are greater still. He wants to make the entire district around the village free from snake bite deaths. ""We are starting with a village,"" he says. ""But we hope to scale it out to other districts. Snakes are misunderstood creatures – there is no reason anyone has to die from them."" * This article has been updated on 15 April 2021 to reflect an change in the estimate for spending on venom research.

Yield Spread Analysis,What Springsteen reveals about memory,2024-09-14,2022-11-23,Sanjay Sarma and Luke Yoquinto,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221121-the-benefits-of-being-forgetful,"We've all had those frustrating moments when we struggle to recall someone's name, or a key bit of information stays for too long on the tip of your tongue. It turns out these momentary lapses may actually be good for your memory. On 25 February 1988, at a performance in Worcester, Massachusetts, Bruce Springsteen forgot the opening lines to his all-time greatest hit, Born to Run. According to the conventional wisdom about the nature of forgetting, set down in the decades straddling the turn of 20th Century, this simply should not have happened. Forgetting seems like the inevitable consequence of entropy: where memory formation represents a sort of order in our brains that inevitably turns to disorder. Given enough time, cliffs crumble into the sea, new cars fall to pieces, blue jeans fade. As Springsteen put it in his song Atlantic City: ""Everything dies, baby, that's a fact."" Why should the information in our minds be any different? Comment and Analysis Sanjay Sarma is the Fred Fort Flowers and Daniel Fort Flowers Professor of Mechanical Engineering and head of Open Learning at MIT and Luke Yoquinto is a science writer and a research associate at the MIT AgeLab. They are co-authors of Grasp: The Science Transforming How We Learn (2020, Doubleday/Little, Brown). In such a model, the preservation of information like song lyrics requires constant upkeep – which, in the case of Born to Run, no one could accuse Springsteen of neglecting. By 1988, he had certainly repeated the lyrics to his 1975 hit thousands of times over. And so when he found himself staring out at the expectant Worcester audience at a loss, there was little he could do but confess into the microphone: ""Sung it so damn much I forgot what the words were."" According to the entropic model of forgetting, such a slip-up made little sense. And if that model were wrong (Springsteen hardly being alone in suffering the caprices of a forgetful brain) the import would be of enormous consequence. Schools and education systems around the world had been built based on the best psychological theories of the early 20th Century. If these models of learning – and its supposed opposite number, forgetting – were wrong, who could tell how many learners had been done a disservice? And even outside of school, how many of us would have wasted countless hours of thoughtless repetition – of golf swings, say, or French verbs, or wedding remarks – in a diligent but vain effort? Efforts to explain forgetting date back to the late 1800s, when psychological researchers began – slowly, at first – to incorporate mathematical tools into their experiments. The German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus studied his own powers of recall by memorising long series of nonsense syllables, then recording how well he remembered them as time elapsed. His ability to summon up this meaningless information, he discovered, sloped downward over time in a curved distribution: he lost most of his hard-won syllables quickly, but a small percentage of them persisted in his memory long after his initial memorisation efforts. These results seemed to support the intuitive idea that forgetting was the result of the simple erosion of information. But even in these early efforts, wrinkles appeared in the data suggesting that there might be more to forgetting than met the eye. Importantly, the timing of Ebbinghaus's rehearsals wielded enormous influence over how well he remembered items, with a spaced-out practice schedule outperforming rehearsal sessions that were bunched together. This finding was mysterious, hinting at some unexplained requirements of the memorising mind, but at the same time it was unsurprising. Indeed, the benefits of spacing out one's studies were known to most students. ""The schoolboy,"" he reasoned, ""doesn't force himself to learn his vocabularies and rules altogether at night, but knows that he must impress them again in the morning."" How to think about X This series will change the way you look at the world. Whether it's the concept of ""time"", ""consumerism"", or even ""creativity"", many of us tend to think about – and define – certain ideas in the ways we've been taught. But how did our conceptualisation of these big ideas evolve? How to Think About X searches for new ideas about our lives, the concepts that govern them and our future. In Ebbinghaus's time these sorts of quantitative methods were the exception in psychological research, but a generation later, they were rapidly gaining adherents. Perhaps no psychologist was more responsible for this change than Columbia University's number-loving psychologist Edward L. Thorndike, who argued that: ""If a thing exists, it exists in some amount; and if it exists in some amount, it can be measured."" Thorndike's influence on both research psychology and educational practice is almost impossible to overstate. He was an incredibly prolific author of articles and books – including arithmetic books and a line of student dictionaries that bore his name into the new millennium – as well as early standardised tests. He served as president first of the American Psychological Association, and later of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Perhaps most important, his research laid the groundwork for the influential mid-century movement in psychology known as Behaviorism, which attempts to explain behaviours purely as a function of environmental conditioning, not any intervening mental processes. Thorndike's early research concerned animal learning and frequently featured cats, which he often tasked with escaping from elaborate cages. From his observations he produced three basic laws of learning for human and non-human animals alike. These concerned how the brain ""stamps in"" associations (which he dubbed his Law of Effect); under what conditions learning occurs (his Law of Readiness); and how memories are maintained or forgotten: his Law of Exercise, which breaks down into sub-theories of use and disuse. The theory of disuse was simple: If you don't use a memory, you lose the memory. (Use, meanwhile, could preserve it, albeit only when accompanied by some kind of satisfying reward – the audible appreciation of an adoring crowd, for instance.) Thorndike's theory of forgetting largely aligned with Ebbinghaus's observations, except it didn't account for the still-mysterious fact that spaced rehearsal of information seemed to steel-plate information against forgetfulness. It would take decades for cognitive scientists to come up with a model of forgetting that satisfactorily accounted for this issue. In the meantime, however, Thorndike's trio of learning laws bolstered early-20th Century efforts to standardise education. To be clear, Thorndike was in no way single-handedly responsible for the regularised forms education took around the world in the 20th Century. However, his ideas about learning – that it was quantifiable and that some students were innately better at it than others – supported visions of school where rigidly standardised conditions prevailed, in terms not only of standardised tests but also time spent in seats, classroom sizes and shapes, pedagogy, and metrics of student evaluation. Such interchangeable conditions allowed students to be compared to one another for supposedly meritocratic purposes. In both the standardisation of education and the ongoing research into learning, forgetting became something of a sideshow. Its status began to improve, however, thanks to two separate research traditions begun in the 1960s and 1970s. One operates at the level of neurons and is detectable through tiny electrodes implanted in cells, while the other operates at the level of cognitive psychology and is detectable through cleverly designed quizzes. At the cellular level, Eric Kandel, in a Nobel-winning series of studies, demonstrated that memories are preserved in the form of strengthened connections between neurons. Training regimes, he showed, whether conducted on intact, living, learning animals, or by electrically prodding neurons in a dish, create such beefed-up connections. And, as Ebbinghaus first observed, training (or rehearsal, or study) with extra time scheduled in between led these connections to be longer-lasting. This is a fact that holds true throughout the animal kingdom, from sea slugs to mammals. The cellular machinery responsible for maintaining memories, then, may be prejudiced in favour of preserving information that we animals encounter repeatedly. But what exactly is happening in the gaps in those spaced-out training, practice, or study regimens? At the cellular level, part of the answer may be that some of the mechanisms involved in preserving memories seem to require downtime: recharging periods, in effect, before neurons can get back to the work of strengthening their connections. A different, yet perhaps complementary, answer is forthcoming in the research tradition of cognitive psychology. Here, a variety of studies suggest that gaps in one's rehearsal or study schedule are so helpful because, counterintuitively, they create the opportunity for a salutary bit of forgetting. To understanding how forgetting can be useful, it's important to first recognise that a memory is never simply strong or weak. Rather, the ease with which you can summon up a memory (its retrieval strength) is different from how fully represented it is in your mind (its storage strength). The name of your parent, for instance, would be one example of a memory with both high storage and retrieval strength. A phone number you held in your head only momentarily a decade ago could be said to have low storage and retrieval strength. The name of someone you met a party mere minutes ago might have high retrieval but low storage strength. And finally, the lyrics to a song you've sung thousands of times but which stubbornly elude you, as you gaze out from the stage of the Worcester Centrum, would have high storage but distressingly low retrieval strength. Given the right cue, however – if your audience were to feed you the opening lines, for instance – the retrieval strength would snap right back. Psychologists became aware of the distinction between storage and retrieval as early as the 1930s, when John Alexander McGeoch, a psychologist at the University of Missouri, tasked study subjects with memorising pairs of unrelated words. For example, every time I say pencil, for instance, you say chessboard. That task became far more difficult, he discovered, when, before asking his subjects to recite what they'd memorised, he confronted them with decoy pairs: pencil and cheese, pencil and table. The decoy pairs, it seemed, competed with the true pair for the memoriser's attention. As this line of research gained traction, the metaphor for forgetting changed. Forgetting, it seemed, was less like a cliff slowly collapsing into the sea, and more like a house deep in the woods that becomes harder and harder to find. The house might be perfectly sound – that is, its storage strength remains high – but if the path leading to it becomes surrounded by equally plausible paths leading the wrong way, one's formerly clear mental map can transform into a maze. In Springsteen's case, it's easy to see how his mental wayfinding might have gotten thrown off track. ""The reason for the muff, apparently was that he was concentrating so much on the spoken introduction, telling the audience how the song has assumed a new meaning to him over the years,"" the Los Angeles Times' music critic wrote several days after the event. The new introduction meant he was approaching the same old memory from a different set of cues: a different starting point. Suddenly, the once-reliable path to the opening lines of the song was surrounded by false starts. But soon, the lyrics came roaring back. And assuming this time the memory's heightened accessibility stuck around, it would have been in keeping with then-cutting-edge research around retrieval and storage strength – measures which, though distinct from one another, turned out not to be independent. In a landmark 1992 paper on ""The New Theory of Disuse"" – a title in direct conversation with Thorndike – the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) cognitive psychologists Robert and Elizabeth Bjork described a fascinating level of interplay between storage and retrieval. The retrieval of a memory adds to its storage strength, they showed, but with diminishing returns. You might meet someone at a party and repeat her name to yourself in an attempt to add to the memory's storage strength, but repetition will only take you so far: the sixth repetition won't add much more heft than the fifth. What will add to its storage strength, however, is what the Bjorks call the ""effortful retrieval"" of that memory. Once the name is semi-forgotten, then, ""at some time later, looking across the room and retrieving what that person's name is – that can be a really powerful event in terms of your ability to recall that name later that evening or the next day"", Robert Bjork told us for our book Grasp: The Science Transforming How We Learn. By carrying out a challenging retrieval, you can increase a given memory's storage strength and also increase your chances of retrieving it in the future. In this party example, it is the time gap between when you meet your new acquaintance and, later, when you find yourself in need of her name, that makes for forgetfulness. In a series of earlier experiments starting in the 1970s, however, Robert Bjork found other ways to disorient his research subjects on their paths to a desired memory. For instance, introducing confusing or irrelevant inputs, à la McGeoch, or changing their sensory cues – sights, sounds, and smells that might trigger a memory – by asking them to recall information in new surroundings. Regardless of how forgetfulness came about, when overcome it led to stronger, longer-lasting memories. Today, well-timed forgetting is part of a larger suite of educational approaches that the Bjorks have termed ""desirable difficulties"": strategies that may initially annoy students, but which eventually yield dividends. The sort of forgetting that ultimately leads to stronger, more accessible memories can be produced by spacing out one's study schedule, for instance, and also by interleaving one subject's study sessions with another's. Setting material aside, then revisiting it, can also do away with a student's false sense of command, since memories with momentarily high retrieval strength may prove far less accessible a few days later. In the years following the publication of the New Theory of Disuse, the Bjorks worked to spread the word about forgetting and other desirable difficulties – work necessitated by the simple fact that school is typically not set up to facilitate laudable acts of forgetting. Far from it: as a number of research papers have shown, on exam day, students who cram for exams actually outperform their counterparts who space out their studies. Only weeks and months later do the advantages of a spaced schedule win out, with the ""spacers"" substantially outperforming crammers. But by then, the exam is over. Standardised structures of educational timing and assessment, many of which were established when Thorndike's theories of learning were still new, are to this day disincentivising what we now know to be superior learning practices. That shouldn't stop learners of all ages – including adults in the working world – from making the most of our vast ability to not only take in new information, but to access it at the precise moment we need it. Even knowledge we might consider lost to the sands of time may still be hiding in our brains, waiting for the right cue to resurface. As Springsteen reminds us in ""Atlantic City"", while everything does die, in the next line he continues: ""Maybe everything that dies someday comes back."" * Sanjay Sarma is professor of mechanical engineering and head of Open Learning at MIT (@mitopenlearning).

Yield Spread Analysis,How far can vertical farming go?,2024-09-14,2023-01-12,William Park,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230106-what-if-all-our-food-was-grown-in-indoor-vertical-farms,"Vertical farming promises a future in which our food is grown in pockets of spaces in our cities and beneath our feet. But how far can it really go? When the Pasona Urban Farm opened in the nine-storey office of a Japanese recruitment company in 2010, it promised a future in which food was grown within feet of the people who would eat it. Tomatoes hung down from meeting-room light fittings, a rice paddy filled a large conference space, and mushrooms grew in drawers hidden discreetly under benches. The office looked more like a museum of farming than a place of work. While the modern concept of vertical farming – growing food in trays or pipes stacked on top of one another like a giant plant lasagne – dates from around the 1990s, it could be argued that farmers have sought ways to grow more in less space and with less soil for centuries. Step-over fruit trees – usually apple and pear trees – are grown as low as 1ft (30cm) off the ground and spread laterally to fill thin strips of space in allotments and orchards. The step-over technique is based on espalier training, which might date back to Ancient Roman grape cultivation. But vertical farming in the modern sense is now spreading rapidly. One example is the vertically farmed strawberry brand Oishii, based in New Jersey. In 2021, a punnet of its coveted Japanese Omakase strawberries retailed for $50 (£44) in a high-end New York supermarket. For some, this was evidence that with time vertical farming could rival and ultimately exceed traditional farming for quality. For others, the outlandish price highlighted the huge challenge to make vertical farms commercially viable. While the technology shows much promise, the costs in both money and energy are still high. This means leafy salads, smaller vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes and strawberries – high value crops which grow quickly – are about the limit of what is currently available commercially from vertical farms. But where exactly is the limit of what we can actually grow in a vertical farm? And if we did find a way to overcome the problems of cost and energy use, what would a world where all our food is grown in such farms look like? Could we ever move to completely soil-free farming? Farming upwards There is no strict definition of what a vertical farm is, but they typically consist of shallow trays stacked within a building, lit with LED lighting at each level. Many vertical farms have no windows and some are even built underground. These kinds of farms must supply everything – water, nutrients, sunlight and possibly pollinators and pest control too. Others might be built in massive greenhouses – making the most of the Sun's light and heat, but still controlling other inputs like water. What If...? This article is part of ""What If…"", a series which uses real-world evidence to explore hypothetical questions about would-be worlds. You might also like: While sometimes soil is used, increasingly vertical farms use hydroponic or aeroponic systems, where water (for hydroponics) or water vapour (for aeroponics) infused with nutrients is circulated directly around the roots of the plant. ""The water efficiency and nutrient efficiency is really quite high in hydroponics and aeroponics because the roots are able to get those nutrients and water in a lot quicker,"" says Laura Vickers, a plant biologist and head of the Urban Farming Group at Harper Adams University in the UK. ""There's no organic matter, there's nothing else for the plant to compete with or to extract the water from."" This means using vertical farms can considerably reduce both the water and fertilisers needed to grow food. Meanwhile, the closed-off, controlled environment of vertical farms can help to stop pests getting in – in turn possibly reducing the need for pesticides.   The technology can also allow crops to grow in locations where conventional farming is not possible. Astronauts on the International Space Station, for example, are growing their own food in soilless systems under LED lights – with cabbage, mizuna mustard, lettuce and kale among the crops on the menu. More generally, though, the small amount of land needed for vertical farms means food can be grown near to cities, says Natalia Falagan, an engineer from Cranfield University in the UK, which could give huge benefits. Shorter supply chains could improve both food security and the quality of food, since the faster food reaches us, the less its nutrients deteriorate and the less unseen toxins, such as mycotoxins, develop. It would also result in far fewer food miles than many imported alternatives and help to guarantee the provenance of crops, she says, while also reducing the burden on natural resources like soil, water and the atmosphere. What's more, with advanced plant science, the crops could be engineered to be healthier and tastier, she adds. Having vertical farms in the midst of cities could also help to make us more aware of how our food is produced, says Falagan. Pasona Urban Farm, for example, wasn't just for show – it allowed office workers to harvest their own food at work, which the company hoped would improve both their mental and physical health. Falagan says that having a closer connection with where our food comes from might encourage consumers to be more careful with food waste, too. ""If people know how much goes into producing our food,"" she says, ""then maybe they will think twice about throwing it out."" Most vertical farms currently concentrate on low-biomass crops – things like herbs, salads and small fruits and vegetables which weigh less per portion – because there is a greater yield for the amount of heat, light and water that needs to be supplied. They also have short life cycles, so make maximum use of space, says Vickers. A leafy green will grow quickly and be ready to harvest in days or weeks, whereas a pumpkin would take months to grow and needs to cure in sunlight. A meta-analysis of urban farming in a variety of settings across 53 countries found lettuces, kale and broccoli were particularly suited to vertical farms. Crops like spinach can be grown from seed to harvest in 30 days, meaning a vertical farmer could have 12 harvests from the same tray each year. What's more, if the farmer were to stagger planting their crop from one row of trays to the next, they could have an almost continuous supply of food all year round from their farm – something a traditional farmer can only dream of. Lost bees Salads and herbs do not need to flower and be fertilised, which gives them another advantage over other crops when it comes to vertical farming. Most fruits and vegetables do require pollination, and where it is needed for vertical farms it would have to be done artificially at a cost. (Read more about how humans are farming a wider variety of tiny insect livestock than ever before.) Farmers already often rely on commercial bees to encourage pollination and maximise fruiting for both indoor and outdoor farming. For example, the almond industry, of which 85% is based in California's Central Valley, depends on billions of honey bees that are shipped tens of thousands of miles to and from Florida to pollinate the almond blossoms each year. The hives are brought in on trucks and the bees are released into each grove before being moved on to the next farm. In the UK, strawberries grown in polytunnels are also pollinated with commercial honey bees – though, curiously, pollination by wild bees results in larger fruits. Commercial bee pollination has already been applied to indoor farming, says Vickers. But using bees in an indoor environment poses a problem – the artificial lights can make it difficult for bees to navigate. To humans, indoor farms often appear illuminated in neon pinks and purples. This is because plants grow best when exposed to mostly blue and red wavelength light, which to us looks pink or purple from a distance (although other wavelengths such as green light are also used depending on the crop). But bee vision is very different from ours. They cannot see the colour red, but can see in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which humans cannot. Outdoors, plant petals reflect UV to help bees navigate to them. This puts bees at a distinct disadvantage in vertical farms, where UV is currently not used. Adding it could make indoor farms even more expensive, especially considering this same light is completely free for outdoor farmers. ""We think about vertical farming from the plant's perspective,"" says Vickers. ""And we don't think about what the bee sees and how it finds the plants. The bees struggle to navigate under the current LEDs."" Vertical grains Other crops, such as cereals, are pollinated by wind, which could be easily replicated by creating a draught within the vertical farm, says Vickers. But while there are some examples of vertical farms experimenting with growing cereals, it's still rare. ""Barley or wheat, which takes many months to grow, are not currently cost effective,"" says Vickers. The reason for this high cost is the biggest barrier to the widespread use of vertical farms – they require huge amounts of energy and infrastructure. While being able to grow crops year-round increases the efficiency of a vertical farm, the challenge these farms face is to keep energy use down when the alternative – growing outside – comes with free sunlight and rainwater. This reliance on energy can also make vertical farms highly vulnerable to volatile energy prices. In many places, the electricity used to power vertical farms also still comes from fossil fuels, meaning overall greenhouse gas emissions can be far higher than for open-field farming. Switching to renewable energy is the obvious way to reduce this carbon footprint, although, since most renewables themselves require land, this can reduce the land-saving benefits of indoor farming somewhat. Botanically speaking, barley or wheat are quite possible within a vertical farming system due to their short root structure, says Vickers, which is important for growing them in trays. And while it's unlikely we'll ever grow all our grains in vertical farms, it could still prove to be useful in some situations. In 2020, agricultural scientists from several US universities published an article arguing vertical farming might one day play a role in hedging against future unexpected supply chain disruptions. As the ongoing war in Ukraine has highlighted the world's dependence on cereals from eastern Europe and sparked a search for alternative sources, it may be a proposal worth considering. Indoor orchards But Vickers says that it is actually woody crops, such as fruit trees, which would really test the limits of what is possible to grow in a vertical farm, not least because they would require significant support without soil. Botanically, however, there is no reason that indoor orchards are not possible, she says. ""A tree already is a kind of vertical farm,"" says Mark Horler, chair of the UK Urban AgriTech, which represents the country's indoor agriculture community. ""Trees take water with nutrients in it, and distribute it across a series of layers that then grow leaves and fruits. As ever, nature was there first."" Along with Kerstin Schreiber, a geographer at McGill University, Horler is co-founder of the Soya Project, an initiative set up to promote the benefits of vertical farming. He is currently investigating the potential of growing willow saplings indoors in vertical farms to speed up their growth before being planted outside, and so to hopefully increase their survival rate. ""The rate of failure in reforestation and afforestation projects is phenomenal,"" he says, citing how vulnerable saplings are to the elements when they are very small (in one study, 83% of replanted trees died within 10 years). ""Only a really small proportion make it to the final grade."" But if given the head start, Horler hopes the saplings will stand a better chance. And he's not the only one looking to vertical farming to give trees a boost. Zoe M Harris, an environmental scientist from the University of Surrey in the UK, is leading a similar project which has recently been awarded £4m ($4.8m) in UK government funding, while a project propagating apple tree saplings in aeroponic systems started in England last year.  Early trials of a vertical farm project in Scotland managed to grow tree seedlings six times faster than is typical in traditional outdoor sowing. Horler says he sees no reason why trees couldn't be grown permanently indoors for food. A vertical orchard might look a bit different to the ones we are used to seeing, however. ""What you'd want is a series of thin saplings that fruit really often, rather than waiting for one tree which produces all its fruit all at once,"" says Horler. Most apple trees are already dwarf varieties of wild species, he says, so dwarfing them further isn't out of the question. In Asia, dwarf mango trees are being trialled because the smaller variety helps harvesters pick their fruits. And in 2019, a collective of researchers were able to produce a tomato plant that, in Horler's words, ""almost looks like a bunch of grapes"" – the tiny plant was covered in ripe tomatoes. Dwarfing crops makes them more suitable for vertical farming, agrees Vickers. But the variety that performs best outdoors won't necessarily be the variety that performs best within a controlled environment, she adds, so dwarfing an established variety might not always work. For example, certain varieties might perform best outdoors because they are hardy to temperature variations or diseases, which might not be such important factors indoors. Vertically farmed trees and crops that take longer to mature might also be tricky to keep disease-free, says Vickers. Between harvests of herbs and salads, a vertical farmer can sterilise trays before the next crop is planted. However, mango trees, for example, can take years to mature, in which time mould and bacteria can thrive. ""The disease has the time of its life because – just like the plant – it has the perfect environment, perfect temperature, perfect amount of oxygen, perfect nutrients and access to all these lovely plants as well,"" says Vickers. If conditions are ideal, however, Horler says a vertically farmed tree might be able to actually invest more in its fruits. ""A plant will devote its resources to what it thinks it can do best,"" he says. ""If it's being tested, then it will put more effort into protecting itself from harder conditions…[But] if it's in ideal conditions and having an easy life, then it will grow lots of leaves and flowers and fruit, it won't grow these massive metres-long root systems."" There is no botanical reason, then, why all our food couldn't be grown vertically, but plant scientists will need to solve some long-standing problems before this is a reality, says Vickers. And, of course, city planners, renewable energy providers and farmers themselves would all have a huge part to play. It is worth noting, though, that much of the benefits and limitations of vertical farming explained by Vickers and Horler refer to farming on large scales in developed countries. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. Smallholders produce 30-34% of the global food supply. Some nations are heavily dependent on subsistence farming, and it is perhaps unrealistic that this essential food supply would be transformed by vertical farming, which is dependent on secure electricity. However, reducing the land taken up by industrial farming by shifting it to vertical farms could in theory free up space that could be used for restoring ecosystems, or even handed back to these same smallholder farmers or be used for regenerative farming methods, which tend to require more space. Vickers says that vertical farms might one day allow for an ""intellectual supply chain"" in which plants' growth cycles can be sped up or slowed down to react to changes in demand. (Vickers was once approached by a party interested in producing bespoke salad mixes personalised to customers' dietary needs, but says ""the premise is, at the moment, in its infancy"".) Experimenting further with crops in vertical farms could also create other possibilities for how we experience our food, like encouraging the plants to create more taste compounds, vitamins or antioxidants. Falagan says that this can be done by stressing the crops, for example by reducing their water, or exposing the harvested food to certain gases while in storage. But while these innovations could find their place in sustainable farming methods in the future, when money is a consideration it is hard to see all of them happening soon, says Vickers. The Pasona Urban Farm experiment that took over a Tokyo high-rise office, for example, is no longer there. The rice has been cut, the tomatoes picked, and the mushrooms have been taken out of their drawers. For now, we will have to content ourselves with salads, small fruits and vegetables until the time that orchards grow in our cities. * This article was updated on 23 January 2023 to make clear that several wavelengths of light, including green light, are used in vertical farms depending on the plant type. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,How to save Louisiana from drowning,2024-09-14,2018-08-27,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180822-recycled-shells-of-louisiana-oyster-reef-protect-new-orleans,"From the boat, the salt marsh looks pristine: cloud-dotted sky, brown-blue water, gold-green grass. As we motor along the coast, a flock of egrets flutters into the air, startled by the only humans in sight. Later, I’m equally startled to see an alligator lazing in the shallows. It is easy, if you don’t know any better, to think that the world of the wetlands is simple, steadfast, still. That would be incorrect. A salt marsh is an exquisitely complex ecosystem. It is also a crucial one. In Louisiana, where wetlands make up one-third of the state by area, the landscape plays a pivotal role. These waving grasses along the Gulf of Mexico underpin Louisiana’s seafood industry, the country’s second-largest behind Alaska. They are home to key infrastructure, like the pipes that carry oil and gas from the largest US entry port for waterborne crude oil all the way up to Knoxville, Tennessee and Washington DC. And although the precise magnitude of their effect is still being debated, they are a natural barrier against storm surge, hurricanes and flooding. The wetlands at Biloxi Marsh – a web of bayous, brackish and salt lakes in south-east Louisiana that give way to Eloi Bay, Chandeleur Sound and, finally, to the Gulf of Mexico – help protect even New Orleans, 45 miles away. The salt marsh is also a landscape that is changing, fast. From 1932 to 2016 in Louisiana, on average, open water subsumed a chunk of wetlands the size of a football field every hour. It’s true that the rate of loss has slowed. A football field is now being swallowed every 100 minutes, rather than every 34 minutes, when it was at its peak. This is largely because there hasn’t been a major hurricane since 2008. It’s partly because of restoration activities. And there’s another reason, too. “In recent years it’s reached a slowdown, but that’s because the most vulnerable spots are already gone,” says Seth Blitch, director of coastal and marine conservation at the Nature Conservancy of Louisiana. The slowdown, however, isn’t guaranteed to continue. You might also like: • Miami’s fight against rising seas  • An ambitious plan to stop the land from sinking  • The country that brought a sea back to life The landscape here always has been changeable. But such enormity of land loss is new. Most of it is due to the Mississippi River levee. Since the levee’s construction in the 1930s, the state has lost one-quarter of its wetlands: just under 2,000 square miles (5,100sqkm). That’s the size of Delaware, or Trinidad and Tobago. If nothing changes, Louisiana will lose another 1,000 square miles (2,600sqkm) – that’s a Rhode Island or Luxembourg of land mass – by 2050. “My background is ecology, so it’s my first reaction to think about the wildlife habitat that we’re losing. But if you take a step back, this issue goes way beyond that,” says Deb Abibou, restoration programmes director at the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (CRCL). “The struggle that we’re facing down here doesn’t just mean ‘Oh, we have less land for our houses.’ “It means that we are losing the natural resources that we depend on for our seafood, for our recreation, for our industries, and for our protection of inland communities.” Some 45 minutes after leaving Hopedale Marina, we pull up to a strip of flat grassy marsh. It looks like the rest of the coastline we’ve seen for the last few miles, with two differences. First, a handful of white PVC poles punctuate the area where the mud meets water. Second, and visible only because we’ve come at low tide, a black border surrounds the marshland, about 20 feet offshore, like a fortification edging a moat. Just how effective that fortification is what the team is here to test. Wearing waterproofs and rubber boots, the CRCL’s Christa Russell and Jenny Wolff jump out of the boat, unspooling a measuring tape from one white stick in the grass to one in the water. The one in the water used to be on land, too: now, it’s about two and a half feet off. The land has crumbled away entirely. But the rate at which it has crumbled is good news. “There’s still land loss,” says Blitch as we bob on the boat, watching a mud-spattered Wolff and Russell pick their way through the grass back to us. “But it’s way slower.” Several months of data-gathering later, Russell presents the first year’s worth of findings in a New Orleans conference room. The four protected sites lost an average 0.81m of land. At the four control sites, the coastline lost 1.54m. It is still early days. But so far, their project has halved the rate of erosion. The protection comes from that black ‘wall’ running around the shoreline. But while many man-made seawalls are concrete or rock, this one, about a half mile (0.8km) long in total, is different: it is made up entirely of oyster shells. * Finished in November 2016, the reef – the first built by the CRCL and The Nature Conservancy in Louisiana – was a massive project. The 1.7 million pounds (771,000kg) of shell used were contributed by 26 local restaurants, including a dozen in New Orleans. This isn’t the world’s only oyster shell recycling programme; there are similar projects in Texas, New York, San Francisco and the Chesapeake Bay, as well as in Australia. But given the number of oysters that are shucked around the world, these programmes are relatively few. “In earlier times, when fishermen and their buyers had a closer relationship, the restaurants would give the shell back to their fishermen. There are maybe one or two restaurants that still do that today,” says Abibou. “At shucking houses, there’s usually an end product for the shell: it’ll get ground to chicken feed or used as pavement. But at New Orleans restaurants, for the most part, they were throwing them into the landfill.” Russell, who is CRCL’s coastal scientist, puts it more bluntly. “Usually, we are taking shell out of the water and not putting it back, which is ridiculous,” she says. After being collected, the shells were left in the sun for six months to cure, getting bleached free of food particles and bacteria. More than 300 volunteers organised them into 434 ‘baskets’. Each measures 3ft by 3ft by 6ft (1m by 1m by 2m) and weighs 4,000 pounds (1,815kg). They were seeded with the oyster larvae known as spat. And then, finally, the shells came, via barges, to their new home in the marsh. The process may be more difficult than pouring concrete or laying granite. But it was key. “A flat expanse of concrete does not do the same things for an ecosystem that this does,” Russell tells me. She rattles off the reasons why. By being in the water the shells are, obviously, not in a landfill. The nooks and crannies of oyster shells provide extra surface area, absorbing wave energy and buffering the coastline more than a flat structure. They also offer protection to smaller sea creatures. And the shells allow water, bacteria and algae to flow through them – crucial for the marshes, which use the tidal flow to ‘breathe’. Seeded with spat before they’re built, the oyster reefs also encourage other oysters to grow. In the last year, the spat has become 286 individual live oysters: not much, but something. And expected to multiply. One benefit of having live oysters is that the reefs then grow vertically – and can do so faster than sea level is expected to rise. Another benefit is water filtration. Each tiny creature can clean an impressive 50 gallons a day, making them the ocean’s most effective water filters. They also capture and store nitrogen and phosphorus. All of this is particularly helpful here in the largest estuary system in the US. For 7,000 years, the Mississippi River moved freely. It swept sediment along with it, and as that sediment built up the river would re-route, finding a different path to the Gulf of Mexico. But when the river was leveed, it stayed static. Instead of being deposited in the estuary, all of the sediment now washes out to the Gulf. This means that as the land naturally subsides, as the soft sediment of an estuary does, it is no longer replenished – the main reason for that Delaware-sized disappearance into the Gulf. And the irony is that, although the levee was built to protect communities and industry from the mighty Mississippi, now it is having the opposite effect. The more marsh is lost, the less protection Louisiana’s residents have against floods, storms and sea level rise. For the two-thirds of residents who live near the coast, this can be particularly deadly. Abibou frames it in terms of lines of defence. “At the furthest end, you have your barrier islands as the first buffer. Then you have various types of marshes and coastal forest,” she says. “If you remove all of the natural infrastructure from that, then it’s the sea against our manmade concrete. And nature’s going to win.” The levee also means that the water in the Gulf is turbid and muddy. And that the pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus, staples of agriculture, are increasingly being carried from across the US into the Gulf. The mud and toxins create uninhabitable ‘dead zones’. Fewer plants grow. Fewer roots hold soil together. And so more land is lost. Animals are affected, too: “Submerged aquatic vegetation and algae can’t get access to light in the same way when the water is really muddy like that,” says Russell. “So they don’t grow the same way – which means the species that depend on them go elsewhere.” Oyster reefs help with all of this. So do wetlands. In terms of what the same process would cost with a treatment plant, a single acre soaks up anywhere from $35,000 to $150,000 (£27,000 to £116,000) of pollutants before they get to the Gulf. But the world is losing oyster reefs even more rapidly than it is losing marshland. We have lost between 64% and 71% of the world’s wetlands since 1900. Globally, 85% of natural oyster reefs either have been lost or severely depleted due to overharvesting, disease, pollution and declining habitats. In the Gulf, the numbers are a little better: between 50% and 89% of wild reefs have been lost. * Against this backdrop, building oyster reefs to buffer Louisiana’s wetlands, instead of laying seawalls made of concrete or granite or (more likely still) of doing nothing, no longer seems like an unwieldy undertaking. Instead, as a solution, it seems elegant. Nature usually is. The data has borne this out. One study determined that a hectare of oyster reef was worth up to $99,000 (£77,000) per year in terms of benefits like the habitat it provided for other fish and its effect on water quality – not including the value of those oysters being harvested. In terms of flood and storm protection alone, an oyster reef provides more value for money than even levees or dykes. In April 2018, a team of scientists published a cost-benefit analysis of projects being done across the Gulf, from building dykes to restoring barrier islands. Costs of construction and maintenance were weighed against the effectiveness of flood and storm protection – calculated using economic models developed by reinsurance company Swiss Re with its partners. (Read more about how the financial industry is developing tools to calculate the risk of climate change and what that could mean for climate resilience projects). The findings were stark. Anything with a benefit-to-cost ratio above one is, of course, seen as cost-effective. In terms of reducing risk alone, dykes and levees had a benefit-to-cost ratio of 0.26; beach replenishment in the western Gulf, 0.28. Restoring oyster reefs (7.34) was calculated to be 28 times more beneficial. And restoring wetlands? Thirty-three times more (8.72). The only project with a higher benefit-to-cost ratio was sandbags – but only because of how cheap they were. In terms of overall risk reduction, the benefit was low. As Abibou puts it: “We can’t just build levees and hide behind them. We need to have a healthy marsh and healthy wetlands to provide us with adequate risk reduction.” Then there is the value of the fishing industry in general. Oyster reefs like this one aren’t built to be harvested, of course. But by bolstering the ecosystem, they help. Across the US, about 75% of marketable fish and bivalves rely on salt marshes to survive. In Louisiana, they’re the foundation of the most productive commercial fishing industry of the lower 48 states. Louisiana lands 1.2 billion pounds (544m kg) of fish annually. The next state, Washington, lands 552 million (250m kg). Louisiana’s oysters alone make up one-third of the US oyster industry, crabs one-quarter. It lands more shrimp than Texas, Alabama and Florida put together. If the wetlands were to continue to disappear, if the Gulf were to become a mud- and toxin-logged swamp, it’s reasonable to think that that industry would vanish, too. That would wipe out more than 160,000 fishing jobs alone – never mind the knock-on effect to the food, restaurant and tourism industries. * Often lost in the discussion of economic impacts, of what something like erosion or climate change means for humans, is how this kind of habitat has value all on its own. Non-locals may not recognise the names of the grasses that trip off the tongue: hog cane and three-square, saltgrass and glasswort, cordgrass and black rush. But they are strange, special, of value in their own right. Unusually tenacious, they grow out of the low-oxygen sodden soil towards the sunlight. They survive by the tide. When they’re submerged, the ocean brings nutrients and cleans out decay and allows fish to hide and spawn in safety. The ecosystem nurtures a long list of creatures.The grasses support dozens of fungi and bacteria and more than 80 species of spiders and insects. These feed crabs and shrimps and oysters and speckled trout and black drum and sea turtles and flounder, which feed herons and egrets and spoonbills and wood storks and seaside sparrows and marsh wrens, which help spread the seed for grass. Nutria hide here, and rabbits, and snipe, and ducks. Alligators, too. Losing the coast risks losing them all. We want to put dollar signs on all of it. That’s particularly true before deciding if something is worth saving. And particularly now, with not only industry statistics but with newly sophisticated models for measuring the financial risk of events like coastal erosion and flooding, we can. But that’s only part of the story. The other part is what surrounds us as we head back towards the mainland: egrets fluttering, fish swirling, alligators stalking, grasses waving – and perhaps little oysters moving below us with the tide, searching for a new reef to settle on and thrive.

Yield Spread Analysis,The unseen 'tracks' of the deep ocean,2024-09-14,2020-12-04,Richard Fisher,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201202-deep-sea-mining-tracks-on-the-ocean-floor,"Far from land, deep sea mining trials have left barren marks that are still there decades later, and as Richard Fisher writes, they symbolise two different timescales colliding. At the base of the Pacific Ocean, hundreds of miles from land, there are some curious marks on the seafloor that no animal could have made. Some of them look like narrow troughs carved into the pale silt. Others could be claw marks, gouged through the ecosystems of the deep by an undersea monster. Humanity has left many signatures on the surface of the Earth, but these long-lived features on the seafloor go largely unseen. Occasionally they are lit by the spotlights of remote submersibles, but afterwards they return to darkness. They have been there for decades. Like the footsteps and tracks that astronauts left on the Moon, they are still visible now, with nothing to wash them away. The track pictured at the top of this article was 37 years old when it was photographed a few years ago, while the marks below date back to 1989. Dating to the 1970s and 1980s, the marks are the first tentative scrapings of deep-sea mining trials, left behind by ships equipped with dredges and ploughs, now long since departed. Recently, scientists have returned with cameras and probes to look at what has happened to the local ecosystems – and what they have found are scars that have never fully healed. Soon, there will be many more tracks like these carved all over the ocean abyss, one of the last untouched wildernesses. What might future generations make of them, and what might they say about humanity's demand for resources in the early 21st Century? You may also like: To understand why these marks are there – and why they matter – we need to dive into a prehistoric sea. One day, a shark shed a tooth, which drifted hundreds of metres to the ocean floor. Gradually, as metals precipitated out of the sea and water within the sediment, the tooth became coated in minerals. And so began one of the slowest geological phenomena on Earth: the growth of a polymetallic nodule. Not all begin with a tooth – others contain fragment of shell, a bone shard, or nothing at all – but the slow pace of accretion is always the same. It takes them millions of years to grow only a few centimetres. But over time, they have become so abundant that they cover large swathes of the ocean’s abyssal plain. The nodules were discovered during the voyage of the HMS Challenger in 1873. When those sailors brought them to the surface, they would have grasped them in their hands like rocky potatoes, crumbling at the edges. To touch, they might have felt smoother on top, but rough on the underside, like pumice, where they had been growing into the surrounding sedimentary grains. If they’d held them to their nose, they’d have detected no scent. The expedition’s chemist was one of the first to note that the nodules were not worthless. They were made of ""manganese peroxide"", he wrote, which is ""one of the principal substances used in the manufacture of bleaching powder"". Their remote location, however, meant ""they could never be made a paying source of supply"".  Little did that chemist know how important they would turn out to be – to the organisms of the deep ocean, and later, to humans. Years later, scientists would discover that these nodules are like islands for some forms of life. The abyssal plain on which they lie makes up 50% of the Earth’s surface – a sublime scale that can be difficult to imagine. If the oceans were suddenly removed, we would see that half our planet is a vast desert of loose sediment. Amid this barren plain, the nodules offer a rare, firm surface for life to cling to. Some sponges and molluscs are unique to them, while nematode worms and crustacean larvae have been found living within their crevices. ""They’re like the rocky areas in a garden – you’re going to have more species living there than you would if you only had soil,"" says Daniel Jones of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, UK, who studies the effects of human interventions on deep-sea life. Yet recently these nodules have also caught the eye of a rapacious land mammal, which needs them for their smartphones. What that expedition chemist in 1873 didn’t identify is that the nodules also contain metals, such as cobalt, nickel, copper, titanium and rare earth elements. These would one day present immense value to human beings. As 21st Century technology surges, so too does the demand for its constituent materials, such as cobalt, which is used in lithium-ion batteries to power cars and electronics. The trouble is that, currently, much the stuff comes from problematic sources. The Democratic Republic of Congo extracts more than 60% of the global cobalt supply from land-based mines, but activity there has been linked to human rights abuses and child labour. That makes oceanic nodules an increasingly appealing target, despite the daunting engineering challenges of getting to them. In one Pacific region – the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) – a conservative estimate suggests there are about 20 billion tonnes, if the nodules there were removed and dried out. While for decades they were considered uneconomic to exploit, a number of mining organisations are now mobilising to remove them, along with other types of subsea mineral deposit. If it goes ahead, hundreds of square kilometres per year will be dredged. What will the impact be? In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers and mining companies made the first tentative steps to assessing both the feasibility and environmental consequences. At various sites within the CCZ, as well as at another location near Peru called Discol (DIS-turbance and re-COL-onisation experiment), ships dragged specialised metal rakes and ploughs over the Pacific floor to scoop up the nodules and pull them to the surface. While it didn’t exactly mimic the dredging machinery planned for future mines, and the scale is much smaller, the effects provide some of the best evidence we have. In some cases, the tracks were left behind by scientists curious about what would happen to an otherwise untouched ecosystem. At others, it was the nascent mining organisations themselves, testing their extraction technologies. One effort even involved the US’s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), a consortium of industry groups led by what is now Lockheed Martin, deployed test extractions on the Hughes Glomar Explorer. This ship would later gain fame for other reasons – it also carried a giant claw designed for a secret attempt to lift a Russian submarine off the seafloor. Years later, as plans for deep-sea mining have accelerated and exploratory permission opens up, researchers have returned to these locations in the Pacific to study the long-term effects. What they found is that, even after decades, life in these artificial trenches still hasn’t returned to normal. (Read more from the BBC about commercial deep-sea mining: ""The secrets of the ocean floor"".) On land, life tends to spring from the ploughed lines of a field, but in the deep sea the trenches are relatively barren. The creatures that relied on the nodules, now removed, cannot re-colonise. And others, which require soft sediment to burrow and find mobilised food, cannot live on the artificially compacted surfaces. ""Communities of these nodule-bearing abyssal plains will be especially vulnerable to the risk of extinction brought about by the efforts to extract them,"" concluded Lara Macheriotou of the University of Ghent and colleagues in a paper published earlier this year. And it’s possible, say scientists, that such effects could linger for hundreds if not thousands of years. Watch a submersible drifting over tracks on the ocean floor at the CCZ and Discol sites: The sociologist Barbara Adam once proposed that the world can be thought of in terms of adjacent ""timescapes"", which are characterised by their pace. She described how industrial or agricultural timescapes move at a much faster clip than natural and ecological ones. All these temporal regimes are interwoven, but when one is forced to move at the pace of another, long-term environmental damage becomes a risk. The timescape of the deep ocean is slow and patient. So when humanity sends its machines down there to remove subsea materials, it is two different regimes of time colliding: the pace of an oceanic abyss versus a fast, short-termist desire for new technology.  The deep ocean couldn’t be further removed from the verdant ecosystems and accelerating societies of Earth's landmasses. Temperatures on the abyssal plain hover close to freezing, the pressure is crushing, and there’s almost no light. The organisms that cling to life survive on a diet of ""marine snow"". This continuous shower of organic detritus, often digested three or four times, rains down from above. ""It’s a low temperature, low food, low energy environment, and this tends to set the pace of life,"" says Jones. ""The animals are not subject to the extremes of physical change you get in shallower waters. This is likely to be an area where any disturbance is long-lasting."" But while these regions might seem like the deserts of the sea – certainly compared with the lively corals of shallow tropical waters – they are major reservoirs of biodiversity, and play a vital role in the carbon cycle via natural sequestration. ""Many of the animals we see are new to science… and some organisms have pharmaceutically active compounds,"" says Jones. Long-term, there's also potential for interaction with fisheries higher up the water column. ""There are functions performed by these communities that might not become valuable for centuries in some cases."" We often can't see the life within this vast space, because it's too small and far too distributed to capture its scale with a photograph. There are no charismatic megafauna to put on a poster. But life exists there in overwhelming diversity, and it covers half our planet. Some might argue that damaging deep ocean life is a sacrifice worth making when weighed against human rights abuses at mines in Africa. Yet it is unlikely that one type of mining will simply displace the other, says David Santillo of Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, who recently co-authored a review of seabed mining and its potential impacts in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. ""There are different companies involved, different markets to some extent, different demand-side pressures and incentives... so if seabed mining does take off, it is more likely that it will simply become an additional source of minerals.""  While the importance of deep-sea life may be difficult to quantify in human moral or economic terms, it does nonetheless have an intrinsic value. And the fact that its slow, long-term timescales are so quick to disrupt should be a reason for caution, according to the scientists I spoke with.  As for those dredged tracks, if future generations one day find them on the ocean floor, they will have persisted long beyond the lifetime of the smartphone, laptop or electric car that helped to carve them. In the words of David Farrier, author of the book Footprints, such traces eventually become ""future fossils"". In the age of the Anthropocene, Farrier argues that we are leaving behind unwanted industrial, chemical and geological heirlooms that will persist for centuries. ""Future fossils are our legacy and therefore our opportunity to choose how we will be remembered,"" he writes. ""They will record whether we carried on heedlessly despite the dangers we knew to lie ahead, or whether we cared enough to change our course. Our footprints will reveal how we lived to anyone still around to discover them, hinting at the things we cherished or neglected, the journeys we made and the direction we chose to take."" It's possible the marks may well be read as a damning signature of our consumption habits in the early 21st Century. ""If we are going to run out of certain minerals unless we destroy a large area of the seabed, then surely this is the signal to look again at how wasteful we are being with those minerals we have,"" says Santillo. ""If what we end up doing by mining the seabed is simply to extend unsustainable consumption patterns for another 30 years, or even accelerate them by bringing yet more materials to market… we won't have changed anything."" Sitting in London as I write this, my world is small and short-term, circumscribed by the restrictions of a UK lockdown and working from home. Yet more than anywhere in recent weeks, my mind has wandered back to the abyssal plain. In a time when many of the maps I look at nowadays plot the spread of the virus, here is a location on Earth that could not be further away from the pandemic.  Perhaps part of what draws me is the sheer extremity of this oceanic wilderness. I’ll probably never get to see it with my own eyes. Even the scientists who study it now use remote cameras, rather than descending to the seafloor themselves. The deep sea, and the life within it, has a scale that defies the imagination, both spatially and temporally. It is unaffected by what is happening on land – and this has been true for millennia. Yet this may be the century where that changes; where we leave much more than one or two scrapings on the ocean floor. When researchers talk of human interventions in the deep sea, one word they often use is ""disturbance"". In scientific language, it refers to a lofting and dispersal of sediment plumes, and the effects on subsea communities. But the word disturbance has another meaning – that of an irrational disorder.  *Richard Fisher is a senior journalist for BBC Future.

Yield Spread Analysis,Is civilisation about to collapse?,2024-09-14,2019-02-19,Luke Kemp,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-are-we-on-the-road-to-civilisation-collapse,"Studying the demise of historic civilisations can tell us how much risk we face today, says collapse expert Luke Kemp. Worryingly, the signs are worsening. DEEP CIVILISATION BBC Future has brought you in-depth and rigorous stories to help you navigate the current crisis, but we know that’s not all you want to read. So now we’re dedicating a series to help you escape. We’ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads.    You’ll find everything from the story about the world’s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us, the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long-buried World War Two tanks back to life. What you won’t find is any reference to, well, you-know-what. Enjoy. Great civilisations are not murdered. Instead, they take their own lives. So concluded the historian Arnold Toynbee in his 12-volume magnum opus A Study of History. It was an exploration of the rise and fall of 28 different civilisations. He was right in some respects: civilisations are often responsible for their own decline. However, their self-destruction is usually assisted.   The Roman Empire, for example, was the victim of many ills including overexpansion, climatic change, environmental degradation and poor leadership. But it was also brought to its knees when Rome was sacked by the Visigoths in 410 and the Vandals in 455. Collapse is often quick and greatness provides no immunity. The Roman Empire covered 4.4 million sq km (1.9 million sq miles) in 390. Five years later, it had plummeted to 2 million sq km (770,000 sq miles). By 476, the empire’s reach was zero. Our deep past is marked by recurring failure. As part of my research at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, I am attempting to find out why collapse occurs through a historical autopsy. What can the rise and fall of historic civilisations tell us about our own? What are the forces that precipitate or delay a collapse? And do we see similar patterns today? You might also like: The first way to look at past civilisations is to compare their longevity. This can be difficult, because there is no strict definition of civilisation, nor an overarching database of their births and deaths. In the graphic below, I have compared the lifespan of various civilisations, which I define as a society with agriculture, multiple cities, military dominance in its geographical region and a continuous political structure. Given this definition, all empires are civilisations, but not all civilisations are empires. The data is drawn from two studies on the growth and decline of empires (for 3000-600BC and 600BC-600), and an informal, crowd-sourced survey of ancient civilisations (which I have amended). Click/pinch to enlarge. Here's the full list of the civilisations displayed above. (Credit: Nigel Hawtin) Collapse can be defined as a rapid and enduring loss of population, identity and socio-economic complexity. Public services crumble and disorder ensues as government loses control of its monopoly on violence. Virtually all past civilisations have faced this fate. Some recovered or transformed, such as the Chinese and Egyptian. Other collapses were permanent, as was the case of Easter Island. Sometimes the cities at the epicentre of collapse are revived, as was the case with Rome. In other cases, such as the Mayan ruins, they are left abandoned as a mausoleum for future tourists.  What can this tell us about the future of global modern civilisation? Are the lessons of agrarian empires applicable to our post-18th Century period of industrial capitalism? I would argue that they are. Societies of the past and present are just complex systems composed of people and technology. The theory of “normal accidents” suggests that complex technological systems regularly give way to failure. So collapse may be a normal phenomenon for civilisations, regardless of their size and stage. We may be more technologically advanced now. But this gives little ground to believe that we are immune to the threats that undid our ancestors. Our newfound technological abilities even bring new, unprecedented challenges to the mix. And while our scale may now be global, collapse appears to happen to both sprawling empires and fledgling kingdoms alike. There is no reason to believe that greater size is armour against societal dissolution. Our tightly-coupled, globalised economic system is, if anything, more likely to make crisis spread. If the fate of previous civilisations can be a roadmap to our future, what does it say? One method is to examine the trends that preceded historic collapses and see how they are unfolding today. While there is no single accepted theory for why collapses happen, historians, anthropologists and others have proposed various explanations, including: CLIMATIC CHANGE: When climatic stability changes, the results can be disastrous, resulting in crop failure, starvation and desertification. The collapse of the Anasazi, the Tiwanaku civilisation, the Akkadians, the Mayan, the Roman Empire, and many others have all coincided with abrupt climatic changes, usually droughts. ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION: Collapse can occur when societies overshoot the carrying capacity of their environment. This ecological collapse theory, which has been the subject of bestselling books, points to excessive deforestation, water pollution, soil degradation and the loss of biodiversity as precipitating causes. INEQUALITY AND OLIGARCHY: Wealth and political inequality can be central drivers of social disintegration, as can oligarchy and centralisation of power among leaders. This not only causes social distress, but handicaps a society’s ability to respond to ecological, social and economic problems. The field of cliodynamics models how factors such as equality and demography correlate with political violence. Statistical analysis of previous societies suggests that this happens in cycles. As population increases, the supply of labour outstrips demand, workers become cheap and society becomes top-heavy. This inequality undermines collective solidarity and political turbulence follows. COMPLEXITY: Collapse expert and historian Joseph Tainter has proposed that societies eventually collapse under the weight of their own accumulated complexity and bureaucracy. Societies are problem-solving collectives that grow in complexity in order to overcome new issues. However, the returns from complexity eventually reach a point of diminishing returns. After this point, collapse will eventually ensue. Another measure of increasing complexity is called Energy Return on Investment (EROI). This refers to the ratio between the amount of energy produced by a resource relative to the energy needed to obtain it. Like complexity, EROI appears to have a point of diminishing returns. In his book The Upside of Down, the political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon observed that environmental degradation throughout the Roman Empire led to falling EROI from their staple energy source: crops of wheat and alfalfa. The empire fell alongside their EROI. Tainter also blames it as a chief culprit of collapse, including for the Mayan.  EXTERNAL SHOCKS: In other words, the “four horsemen”: war, natural disasters, famine and plagues. The Aztec Empire, for example, was brought to an end by Spanish invaders. Most early agrarian states were fleeting due to deadly epidemics. The concentration of humans and cattle in walled settlements with poor hygiene made disease outbreaks unavoidable and catastrophic. Sometimes disasters combined, as was the case with the Spanish introducing salmonella to the Americas. RANDOMNESS/BAD LUCK: Statistical analysis on empires suggests that collapse is random and independent of age. Evolutionary biologist and data scientist Indre Zliobaite and her colleagues have observed a similar pattern in the evolutionary record of species. A common explanation of this apparent randomness is the “Red Queen Effect”: if species are constantly fighting for survival in a changing environment with numerous competitors, extinction is a consistent possibility. -- Despite the abundance of books and articles, we don’t have a conclusive explanation as to why civilisations collapse. What we do know is this: the factors highlighted above can all contribute. Collapse is a tipping point phenomena, when compounding stressors overrun societal coping capacity.   We can examine these indicators of danger to see if our chance of collapse is falling or rising. Here are four of those possible metrics, measured over the past few decades: Temperature is a clear metric for climate change, GDP is a proxy for complexity and the ecological footprint is an indicator for environmental degradation. Each of these has been trending steeply upwards. Inequality is more difficult to calculate. The typical measurement of the Gini Index suggests that inequality has decreased slightly globally (although it is increasing within countries). However, the Gini Index can be misleading as it only measures relative changes in income. In other words, if two individuals earning $1 and $100,000 both doubled their income, the Gini would show no change. But the gap between the two would have jumped from $99,999 to $198,998. Because of this, I have also depicted the income share of the global top 1%. The 1% have increased in their share of global income from approximately 16% in 1980 to over 20% today. Importantly, wealth inequality is even worse. The share of global wealth from the 1% has swelled from 25-30% in the 1980s to approximately 40% in 2016. The reality is likely to be starker as these numbers do not capture wealth and income siphoned into overseas tax havens. Studies suggest that the EROI for fossil fuels has been steadily decreasing over time as the easiest to reach and richest reserves are depleted. Unfortunately, most renewable replacements, such as solar, have a markedly lower EROI, largely due to their energy density and the rare earth metals and manufacturing required to produce them. This has led much of the literature to discuss the possibility of an “energy cliff” as EROI declines to a point where current societal levels of affluence can no longer be maintained. The energy cliff need not be terminal if renewable technologies continue to improve and energy efficiency measures are speedily implemented. Measures of resilience  The somewhat reassuring news is that collapse metrics are not the entire picture. Societal resilience may be able to delay or prevent collapse. For example, globally “economic diversity” – a measurement of the diversity and sophistication of country exports ­– is greater today than it was in the 1960s and 1970s, as measured by the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). Nations are, on average, less reliant on single types of exports than they once were. For example, a nation that had diversified beyond only exporting agricultural products would be more likely to weather ecological degradation or the loss of trading partners. The ECI also measures the knowledge-intensity of exports. More skilled populations may have a greater capacity to respond to crises as they arise. Similarly, innovation – as measured by per capita patent applications – is also rising. In theory, a civilisation might be less vulnerable to collapse if new technologies can mitigate against pressures such as climate change. It’s also possible that “collapse” can happen without violent catastrophe. As Rachel Nuwer wrote on BBC Future in 2017, “in some cases, civilisations simply fade out of existence – becoming the stuff of history not with a bang but a whimper”. Still, when we look at all these collapse and resilience indicators as a whole, the message is clear that we should not be complacent. There are some reasons to be optimistic, thanks to our ability to innovate and diversify away from disaster. Yet the world is worsening in areas that have contributed to the collapse of previous societies. The climate is changing, the gap between the rich and poor is widening, the world is becoming increasingly complex, and our demands on the environment are outstripping planetary carrying capacity. The rungless ladder That's not all. Worryingly, the world is now deeply interconnected and interdependent. In the past, collapse was confined to regions – it was a temporary setback, and people often could easily return to agrarian or hunter-gatherer lifestyles. For many, it was even a welcome reprieve from the oppression of early states. Moreover, the weapons available during social disorder were rudimentary: swords, arrows and occasionally guns. Today, societal collapse is a more treacherous prospect. The weapons available to a state, and sometimes even groups, during a breakdown now range from biological agents to nuclear weapons. New instruments of violence, such as lethal autonomous weapons, may be available in the near future. People are increasingly specialised and disconnected from the production of food and basic goods. And a changing climate may irreparably damage our ability to return to simple farming practices. Think of civilisation as a poorly-built ladder. As you climb, each step that you used falls away. A fall from a height of just a few rungs is fine. Yet the higher you climb, the larger the fall. Eventually, once you reach a sufficient height, any drop from the ladder is fatal. With the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we may have already reached this point of civilisational “terminal velocity”. Any collapse – any fall from the ladder – risks being permanent. Nuclear war in itself could result in an existential risk: either the extinction of our species, or a permanent catapult back to the Stone Age.   While we are becoming more economically powerful and resilient, our technological capabilities also present unprecedented threats that no civilisation has had to contend with. For example, the climatic changes we face are of a different nature to what undid the Maya or Anazasi. They are global, human-driven, quicker, and more severe. Assistance in our self-imposed ruin will not come from hostile neighbors, but from our own technological powers. Collapse, in our case, would be a progress trap.  The collapse of our civilisation is not inevitable. History suggests it is likely, but we have the unique advantage of being able to learn from the wreckages of societies past. We know what needs to be done: emissions can be reduced, inequalities levelled, environmental degradation reversed, innovation unleashed and economies diversified. The policy proposals are there. Only the political will is lacking. We can also invest in recovery. There are already well-developed ideas for improving the ability of food and knowledge systems to be recuperated after catastrophe. Avoiding the creation of dangerous and widely-accessible technologies is also critical. Such steps will lessen the chance of a future collapse becoming irreversible. We will only march into collapse if we advance blindly. We are only doomed if we are unwilling to listen to the past. -- Luke Kemp is a researcher based at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. He tweets @lukakemp.

Yield Spread Analysis,What is the 'meat paradox'?,2024-09-14,2019-02-06,Julia Shaw,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190206-what-the-meat-paradox-reveals-about-moral-decision-making,"Many people eat factory-farmed meat while also abhorring animal cruelty. In this adaptation from her new book, the psychological scientist Dr Julia Shaw explains what the “meat paradox” can tell us about moral decision making. Money changes our relationship with morality. The very existence of money, along with complex business and distribution channels, acts as a buffer between ourselves and the origin of our products. This can make us behave in ways that are deeply unethical. I can prove it to you. Do you think animal torture is evil? And do you also eat factory-farmed meat?  Many people who would strongly disagree, in principle, with animal cruelty also eat meat that has been raised in terrible conditions.  I know this myself. I try to eat a mostly plant-based diet, but like the majority of people in most Western countries, I do not eat this diet exclusively. By reframing the same issue and adding a price tag we make some acts seem far less offensive. We can’t see them first hand, so they feel like they are unrelated to us. All we can see is the price. Why? When we understand why we eat meat that we know has been raised in poor conditions, we can begin to understand many other forms of behaviour that conflict with deeply held moral principles. Internal conflictAccording to psychologists Brock Bastian and Steve Loughnan, who do research on the topic in Australia, the “meat paradox” is the “psychological conflict between people’s dietary preference for meat and their moral response to animal suffering”. They argue that “bringing harm to others is inconsistent with a view of oneself as a moral person. As such, meat consumption leads to negative effects for meat-eaters because they are confronted with a view of themselves that is unfavourable: how can I be a good person and also eat meat?”  According to psychologists Brock Bastian and Steve Loughnan, who do research on the topic in Australia, the “meat paradox” is the “psychological conflict between people’s dietary preference for meat and their moral response to animal suffering”. They argue that “bringing harm to others is inconsistent with a view of oneself as a moral person. As such, meat consumption leads to negative effects for meat-eaters because they are confronted with a view of themselves that is unfavourable: how can I be a good person and also eat meat?” This moral conflict doesn’t just threaten our enjoyment of eating meat, it threatens our identity. In order to protect our identities we establish habits and social structures that make us feel better. Meat-eating is tied to social customs, so that holidays are defined as a time to feast on flesh with friends and family. Some people may also use it as a signal of masculinity, claiming that it helps define someone as a real man, or that we humans evolved as super-predators who were meant to eat meat. And despite animal products being linked to all kinds of poor health outcomes, some people tsk when we say that we want to go vegan (“How will you get enough protein?”), and friends start ""forgetting"" to invite us to dinner parties. With many decisions, including the choice to eat meat, the excuses we make are largely post hoc – after we have chosen to indulge we need to justify why the behaviour was OK, and why it is OK to do it again. And we need the excuses, or else we feel like bad people. You might also like:  When we say one thing but do another, or hold inconsistent beliefs, psychologists call it cognitive dissonance. The term was developed by Leon Festinger, who first used it in 1957. The classic experiment in this field was published by Festinger and James Carlsmith in 1959. In it, they asked: “What happens to a person’s private opinion if he is forced to do or say something contrary to that opinion?” In their experiment, they had 71 men complete two tasks. First, the men were asked to put 12 round wooden spools into a tray, empty the tray and put the spools back in the tray, repeatedly, for half an hour. Then the participants were given a board containing 48 square wooden pegs. They were asked to turn each peg by a quarter turn clockwise, then another quarter turn, repeatedly, again for half an hour. While they did this, a researcher watched and wrote things down. These were intentionally boring tasks. Really, really boring. Although the participants thought it was their performance that was being measured, it was actually what came next that interested the researchers. After their two boring tasks, participants were taken back into the waiting room. They were told that the person sitting there was the next participant. For one-third of the participants, they simply sat down without anything else being mentioned. For the other two-thirds, however, the researcher asked whether they would lie to the next participant. They would even be paid for their lie. Half were told that they would be paid $1 for their lie, and the other half were told that they would be paid $20 for their lie (which in the 1950s was a lot). When they said yes, the researcher then handed them a piece of paper, and instructed them to make the points that were written on it: “It was very enjoyable”, “I had a lot of fun”, “I enjoyed myself”, “It was very interesting”, “It was intriguing”, “It was exciting”. What the researchers really wanted to know was what impact this lie, and the compensation for it, would have on participants’ rating of the task. They wondered whether participants would actually come to think they enjoyed the boring task, just because they told someone else it was fun. And how would being paid influence this? Who do you think rated the experiment as the most enjoyable? The control group, who had not been asked to lie, rated the task as boring and said that they would not do it again. The participants paid $20 also rated the task negatively. However, the participants paid $1 rated the experiment as far more enjoyable than the other two groups, and were more likely to say they would sign up to participate in similar experiments in the future. What happened? Being paid $1 was probably not seen by the participants as sufficient incentive to lie. Accordingly, they experienced cognitive dissonance. “Why did I say that it was enjoyable when it wasn’t? Surely not for a measly $1?” Since the participants could not go back and change their behaviour, or un-participate in the experiment, the option available to them was to change their belief – it must have actually been enjoyable.For the $20 condition this was not necessary, as they could explain their behaviour as the result of the hefty and easy financial incentive. This was the first of many experiments to show that we often bring our beliefs in line with our behaviour, and that money can change the way we do this. In 1962 Festinger further formalised his ideas. He stated that although we believe ourselves to be generally consistent – in our behaviours, beliefs and attitudes – sometimes we go rogue. This inconsistency he called dissonance, while consistency he called consonance. He summarised his cognitive dissonance theory as follows: Dissonance in pretty packaging He further explained that, just as hunger motivates us to find food to reduce our hunger, cognitive dissonance motivates us to find situations to reduce the dissonance. For meat-eating, there are two ways to do this: we can change our behaviour or change the belief. We can stop eating meat, or come up with reasons why eating meat is morally OK. In addition to our own attempts to justify meat-eating, advertising and marketing can make it easier for us to do so. According to research by sociologist Liz Grauerholz on images of animals in popular culture, one way to make meat-eating seem acceptable is to dissociate it from the animal it came from. Grauerholz argues that we do this by “transforming animals, which are loved, into meats, which are eaten, so that the concepts of ‘animals’ and ‘meats’ seem distinct and unrelated”. We call it “veal” instead of baby cow, “ham” instead of pig, “game” instead of hunted wild animal. We pack our dead animals in pretty packages – physically, verbally and conceptually distancing ourselves from the real origin of our food. When looking at commercial depictions of meat, she found that this was done in two different ways. The first was showing meat as sanitised, plastic-wrapped, chopped into pieces – making it hard to think that it came from an animal at all. The second had to do with ‘cutification’ – making the animals cuter than they actually are. More than anywhere, this is adopted as a strategy in parts of Asia such as Japan. Adverts there use what ethologist Konrad Lorenz referred to as the Kindchenschema (“baby schema”) – big eyes, petite, round features, like we might expect in children’s books. It’s meant to give the impression that this meat comes from happy, imaginary animals. Both of these serve to distract from the realities of animal cruelty. This isn’t just relevant for meat-eating. When we turn animals or humans into objects, and thereby avoid the discomfort caused by knowing about the suffering behind consumer goods, we make it easier to be cruel. The same processes we see with meat, we see with all kinds of other morally unacceptable but common human behaviours that have to do with money. We know that poverty causes great suffering, yet instead of sharing our wealth we buy another pair of expensive shoes. We fundamentally disagree with the idea of child labour or adults working under horrible conditions, but keep shopping at discount stores. We stay in the dark, to protect our delicate identities, to maintain the illusion that we are consistent and ethically sensible human beings. In this constant effort to reduce cognitive dissonance, we may spread morally questionable behaviour to others. We begin to shape societies in ways to minimise our discomfort, to not remind us of our inconsistencies. We don’t want constant reminders. And, as Bastian and Loughnan argue, “through the process of dissonance reduction, the apparent immorality of certain behaviours can seemingly disappear.” Hypocrisy can flourish in certain social and cultural environments. Social habits can cast a veil over our moral conflicts, by normalising behaviours and making them invisible and resistant to change. It is time for a revolution in how we talk about human beings, animals and the planet, and acknowledge our own hypocrisies. Rather than doing mental gymnastics to justify unethical behaviour, we must consider actually changing it. Identifying and addressing even just a few of your guilt-ridden ethical inconsistencies is likely to make you a happier person, and the planet a better place. -- This text has been adapted from Evil: The Science Behind Humanity’s Dark Side, by Dr Julia Shaw, a psychological scientist at University College London.

Yield Spread Analysis,Hearts win to prevent 10-man Celtic going top,2024-09-14,2024-03-02,Andy Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68395495,"Lawrence Shankland brushed off the disappointment of a disallowed first-half goal to cap a fine display with this goal Hearts beat 10-man Celtic in a VAR-dominated encounter to prevent the defending champions returning to the top of the Scottish Premiership. The visitors' Adam Idah had an early penalty saved and Brendan Rodgers' side soon found themselves depleted. Yang Hyun-jun was initially booked for a high boot on Alex Cochrane but it was upgraded to a red card on review. Jorge Grant put the hosts in front from a VAR-awarded spot-kick before team-mate Lawrence Shankland had a goal ruled out for offside. But Shankland's second-half effort did count and ensured Celtic remain two points behind Rangers, whose loss at home to Motherwell on Saturday had opened the door for Rodgers' team. Hearts, with successive 2-0 wins over Celtic this season, bolster their position in third, restoring a 13-point lead over St Mirren. And for the first time in six years, both halves of the Old Firm have suffered league defeats on the same weekend. Rodgers described the officiating as ""really poor"" and counterpart Steven Naismith felt both penalties were ""soft"". And Rodgers said of the title race: ""It'll be tight. We had a chance to go a point ahead, we couldn't manage that. Everything we want to achieve this year is with us. We have to get over this today and we will do."" Celtic loss 'refereed outside the field' - Rodgers Keep up to date with Hearts The latest Celtic news While Celtic were without captain Callum McGregor, nursing an Achilles strain, they started brightly and the first flashpoint between Yang and Cochrane came on 11 minutes. The in-form Celtic winger got in behind the Hearts defender and was tripped, prompting referee Don Robertson's first big call of the day. Idah, after three goals in two games, stepped up and struck down the middle only for Zander Clark to sweep away with his feet. And then, midway inside the Hearts half, Yang's elevated foot appeared to catch Cochrane's shoulder, resulting in a quick flash of the yellow card by Robertson. However, the referee was advised to give the challenge a second look and Yang's game was over after 16 minutes. There was little let-up in the first-half drama as Matt O'Riley netted via both posts, only for Idah's offside earlier in the move to cut short the Celtic celebrations. And VAR was once again involved in the next twist as Tomoki Iwata's contact with a falling ball was reviewed. Iwata and team-mate Alistair Johnston leapt together with Stephen Kingsley and the ball appeared to strike Iwata's outstretched arm. Captain Shankland, who netted from the spot against Hibernian in midweek, stepped aside for Grant to send the ball firmly into the net to Joe Hart's right. Iwata's day threatened to go from bad to worse as he was robbed by Beni Baningime and Alan Forrest played in Shankland to net. But Iwata was able to breathe a sigh of relief as the striker had gone a little too early as Liam Scales held his defensive line. The eight added minutes alone told a story about just how eventful the first half had been. When the teams reappeared, Celtic's Kyogo Furuhashi was on in place of Paulo Bernardo. The pace of the game dropped and Hearts reverted to a patient approach to eke out an opening. It duly arrived when Calem Nieuwenhof slipped in the inside right channel but somehow managed to tee up Shankland for a smart finish - a 27th goal of the season. Celtic needed something and almost found the net when Kyogo connected with O'Riley's low ball, Clark making another astute save. The goalkeeper had further says in proceedings as he denied Idah from close range after Kyogo's enterprising run and then again after the former got in behind the Hearts defence. Like club and international team-mate Shankland, Clark showed his best in full view of Scotland manager Steve Clarke in the stand One-nil down to Motherwell at half-time last Sunday, Celtic faced the prospect of being five points behind Rangers. Ten goals in 135 minutes later and Rodgers' side travelled to Edinburgh aiming to be top. The missed penalty and Yang's dismissal changed the nature of their task and VAR continues to add unpredictability - and controversy - to the Scottish game. Striker Kyogo's introduction for a midfielder showed ambition and the revamped attack would have registered but for Clark's alertness. Celtic's title destiny remains in their own hands with two meetings against Rangers still to be played this term. Hearts' impressive league season hit a major speed bump with last weekend's 5-0 defeat at Ibrox and a draw at home to city rivals Hibs in midweek could only partially raise their spirits. This victory, a second win over Celtic in a league season for the first time since 2006-07, gets their campaign firmly back on track with third all but secure and a Scottish Cup run still ongoing. Hearts head coach Steven Naismith: ""I'm happy - happy with a professional, good performance. We controlled a lot of the game. We continued to create chances. The way the game played out, every moment and every turning point that could've been, we dealt with it perfectly. ""[For Celtic's penalty] Alex plants his foot in the ground and the forward has kicked him. Credit to Zander, who had a really good game when he needed to. The [red card] decision's right because other red cards that are similar have been given as red cards."" Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: ""We wanted the three points, we didn't get it, so we move on. Credit to my players because they kept going and fighting until the very end.  ""However, the overall game is influenced by the officials. I never come and speak about officials because I understand we all make mistakes, we're all human, but it felt like really poor officiating today."" The Scottish Cup quarter-finals. Holders Celtic host fellow top-flight side Livingston next Sunday (14:30 GMT) with Hearts away to second-tier Greenock Morton the following evening (19:45) on BBC Scotland.

Yield Spread Analysis,The neglected disease killing thousands,2024-09-14,2021-04-14,Richard Gray,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210413-how-rubber-boots-can-save-people-from-snake-bites,"Venomous snake bites are responsible for 138,000 deaths every year around the world, but could some disarmingly simple interventions help to save lives? ""In the monsoon, the fields are overgrown with weeds,"" says Tukaram Rao, a farm labourer from the village of Rathnapuri in Karnataka, south-west India. ""We have to walk out in the midst of those at night to turn on the water pump for the field. Sometimes if the water pipes are disjointed, we walk alongside the water pipe, feeling with our hands to fix it."" Like many farm workers in rural India, Rao and his neighbours tend to get around barefoot. But lurking in the thick undergrowth is something more worrisome than leaking water pipes. This is the perfect habitat for the Russell's viper, a large, earth-coloured and highly venomous snake found across much of India and other parts of South Asia. These snakes are mainly active during the night and are masterful ambush predators, remaining motionless for long periods before striking ferociously at their prey. They mainly hunt rodents or small frogs that scurry into their path in the fields where they forage – these snakes are not interested in humans. Yet they account for more bites and deaths in India than any other species of snake. The Russell's viper is estimated to be responsible for as many as 43% of snake bites in India and is responsible for 30-40% of snake bites in Sri Lanka. Much of the reason for this is how they hunt. Sluggish to the point of immobility, they inch their way through the grass, their green and brown camouflage making them almost invisible in daylight. At night, they are impossible to spot. For farmers working in paddy fields or among overgrown plants, the snakes are easy to step on or disturb. And when they feel threatened, the Russell's viper quickly becomes aggressive, striking out at random with its fangs. ""Sometimes they go away, sometimes we end up getting bit,"" says 48-year-old Rao about the snakes they encounter when working in the fields. Most villagers are scared of the snakes, he says and usually run away when they come across one in the field. This fear is perhaps well founded. There are around 2.8 million cases of snake bites in India each year and 50,000 deaths. In the past two decades, more than 1.2 million people have died from snake bites in India alone, according to one recent analysis. Globally snake bites are thought to cause between 81,000 and 138,000 deaths each year, according to some estimates. But the true impact of snake bites is greater still. A bite from a venomous snake can leave survivors with life-changing injuries. It is something Rao has seen first-hand. ""Another farmer was recently weeding his turmeric field when he accidentally got bit on his leg and the flesh around his ankle rotted away,"" he says. ""The rot spread to his knee. Now he is unable to do any work."" Doctors were eventually forced to amputate part of the unfortunate man's leg and his wife has had to take on extra work to provide for the family, Rao adds. It is not an uncommon story. ""Three times as many victims – around 400,000 per year – are left with long-term disabilities such as limb necrosis leading to amputations, disfigurement and blindness,"" says Laura-Oana Albulescu, who studies snake venom at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK. ""The psychological sequelae are only now being investigated but are significant as people can end up unable to work, destitute from the treatment cost, not fitting into their society – disabled young girls are not able to work or marry."" The global health burden created by snake bites is thought to be huge. Of the estimated 4.5 million people who are bitten by snakes worldwide each year, around 2.7 million men, women and children are left seriously injured, according to the Global Snakebite Initiative, a non-profit organisation aimed at addressing the problem of snake bites. ""Snake bites are a far bigger problem than many people realise,"" explains Leslie Boyer, founding director of the Venom Immunochemistry, Pharmacology and Emergency Response (Viper) Institute at the University of Arizona in the US. The World Health Organization considers snake bites to be such a burden on some communities that they recently classified snake bite envenomation – where venom is injected by a bite – as a neglected tropical disease. You might also be interested in:  Snake bites are now recognised as one of the world's most important neglected health problems and one that disproportionately affects poorer communities. But should snake bites be such a large problem? ""We've known how to make antivenoms for about 120 years,"" says Boyer, referring to some of the early work by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in France, the Lister Institute in England and the Butantan Institute in Brazil. While many antivenoms are relatively effective, the complex nature of snake venom can make treatment difficult. Access to antivenom can be patchy and treatments with it can be expensive. This has led some to seek other ways of tackling the health burden caused by snake bites. Rao and his neighbours are now involved in one such project aimed at helping the communities most at risk from snake bites to protect themselves. And the solution is deceptively simple – they are being given boots. ""Many people in rural parts of India are walking around in the dark without footwear,"" says Sumanth Bindumadhav, senior manager of the wildlife, disaster response and Dharwad program at the Humane Society International in India. ""Over 90% of bites occur when people step on a snake without even seeing them."" His organisation has handed out more than 400 rubber boots and 200 solar lamps to residents in Rao's village and the surrounding area. ""Putting a light in people's hands and footwear that will cover up to the ankle can seem simple, but it makes a big difference,"" says Bindumadhav. ""The Russell's viper has some of the longest fangs of any snake in India, but it is very hard for them to penetrate gumboots. And preventing snake bites is better than treating them."" Snake venom is a complex cocktail of toxins that varies from species to species. Some of the enzymes and small proteins found in snake venom interfere with the signals sent by nerve cells. Depending on the exact toxin, these can lead to rapid, painful muscle contractions or paralysis. Victims often suffocate as the muscles controlling the respiratory system malfunction. Other toxins, such as those found in black mamba venom, bind to heart muscle cells to prevent them from beating. Some toxins often found in viper venom cause victims to bleed to death by preventing blood clotting while others can cause blood cells to break down, starving victims of oxygen. There are toxins that cause the blood to coagulate in a bite victim's veins or attack the cells of key organs in the body. There are also venom toxins that trigger extreme inflammation or lead to necrosis, where the tissue on a limb dies and rots away. Many snakes have a combination of different toxins that can cause a number of these effects at once. It means treating snake bites is no simple task. ""Any one snake bite contains hundreds of toxins in different proportions that vary by individual species,"" says Boyer. ""You can't use a single small molecule drug against something like that."" Fortunately, antivenom is relatively easy to make, provided you have the know-how and access to some horses. At its most basic, antivenom is made by collecting venom from the snake you are interested in (a process known as ""milking""), injecting a small amount into a horse and then collecting the antibodies it then produces. These are then purified and can be injected into bite victims to neutralise any venom toxins they encounter. But it is not always effective and can require large amounts of antivenom as the number of antibodies in each dose can be low. ""Depending on the snake bite, it can take between one and 20 vials of antivenom, and there are cases in the US that have gone to 100 vials,"" says Boyer. In one study in South Africa, for example, snake bite victims received an average of five vials of antivenom each, but at some hospitals that figure was 19 vials per patient. The low levels of antibodies that target venom toxins in antivenom can also lead to other problems such as anaphylactic shock as the patient's immune system reacts to the animal antibodies in the antidote – a condition known as serum sickness. ""Unfortunately, only 15-20% of the antibodies are specific to and will neutralise venom toxins, hence the adverse reactions,"" says Albulescu. Antivenom can also be very expensive. Depending where you are in the world, a single vial can cost anything from $18-200 (£13-£145) in Sub-Saharan Africa to $17,000 (£12,362) in parts of the US. Boyer's own research group was instrumental in developing a rattlesnake antivenom sold in both Mexico and the US. It costs around $100-200 per vial (£73-£145) in Mexico but can cost several thousand dollars in the US. When she analysed the difference in costs between the two countries, Boyer found that much of the difference in price is due to the way healthcare is funded rather than production costs. ""Developing and manufacturing antivenom is a very small piece of the pie,"" she says. In Latin America, where venomous snakes are also a major problem, there has been a long history of domestic antivenom production from countries such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina that has helped to keep prices low and a steady supply, says Boyer. But legal, regulatory and hospital costs, alongside the idiosyncrasies of the US medical insurance system have driven up prices 1,000-fold in the US. Relatively low demand for venom in the US and Europe – around 7,000-8,000 people are bitten by snakes in the US annually – also leads to higher prices. This has knock-on effects for other parts of the world that have to rely on imported antivenom, Boyer adds. ""It is difficult to rear horses in areas where there is African horse sickness, so many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are reliant upon importing antivenom from Europe,"" she says. ""Even though antivenom is cheaper there, it can still cost many times the annual wage of a worker."" India has some of the cheapest antivenom in the world, costing around $6.5-11 (£4.7-8) per vial, but problems with quality and availability often mean patients do not get the treatment they need. ""Every year there is a shortage of antivenom,"" says Bindumadhav. Rural communities particularly struggle to get treatment and are disproportionately hit by the consequences of snake bites due to the wider costs of treatment and loss of income that can result. ""It tends to be the lowest strata of society who are getting bitten in the countries with the highest number of snake bites,"" says Bindumadhav. ""It is farmers and labourers rather than politicians and business leaders who are being bitten."" This means the problem is largely overlooked. Hospitals in India also primarily use a polyvalent (or multipurpose) antivenom as an antidote against the ""big four"" snakes that cause the majority of bites – the spectacled cobra, the common krait, saw-scaled viper and the Russell's viper. It is produced using venom from these four snakes. But India has more than 60 venomous species of snake and there is no specific antivenom against most of them. Instead, the ""big four"" antivenom is often used as a general snake bite treatment. Recent research has found, however, that it is largely ineffective against the venom of other important snakes in the country. To compound the problem further, other research has shown that even among the big four, the toxins in the venom can vary depending on where in the country they are. It means that antivenom produced using snakes in southern India might be less effective against the venom from the same species in the north or those in Sri Lanka or Nepal. Recently the Wellcome Trust launched a major new initiative to develop new drug treatments for snake bites in an effort to address the shortcomings of current antivenom treatments. It estimates that just £57m ($79m) was invested into research on snake bites in the decade between 2008-2017. It has pledged to spend £80m ($110m) over seven years on new research. Some researchers are focused on new antibody-based treatments that work against a wider range of snake venoms or induce less side effects. One approach has been to use camels instead of horses to make antivenom while others are attempting to manufacture human antibodies against snake venom, but both approaches are too expensive to yet be used commercially. Instead, some researchers are turning to other types of drug treatments that can work against some of the nastier components of snake venom. Albulescu is among them. She has found that a drug used to treat heavy metal poisoning in Germany called DMPS could be repurposed to be used as a first line intervention against the venom of saw-scaled vipers. This family of snakes, also known as carpet vipers, are found across Africa, the Middle East, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. When threatened they rub the scales on their body together to produce a distinctive sizzling sound, and they possess a highly toxic venom that contains enzymes known as metalloproteinases. These rely upon a zinc molecule in their structure to degrade the cell membranes of blood vessels and break down the structures there, leading to haemorrhaging that causes victims to bleed to death. Albulescu found that DMPS can capture the zinc in the metalloproteases and stop them from functioning. ""It's formulated as an oral capsule and can be administered easily in the field immediately after a bite,"" she says. ""We propose its use as a first line intervention which can neutralise some of the venom toxicity and prevent the onset of systemic haemorrhage, buying the victim time."" When DMPS was combined with a later antivenom treatment, Albulescu and her colleagues found survival in animal models increased to 100%. Of course, transferring such a treatment into humans and into the imperfect world of real-life situations, where giving such drugs in a timely fashion might be difficult. And saw-scaled viper venoms contain other unpleasant toxins that DMPS does not act against. Drugs that work against a wider range of snakes are also more desirable as often snake bite victims do not know exactly which species they have been bitten by. If the snake is misidentified, it can lead to inappropriate treatment. Albulescu and her team have made some progress, finding a mixture of two other toxin inhibitors that appear to work against a wider range of viper venoms including the Terciopelo, or fer-de-lance, in Central America, the puff adder in Africa and the Indian saw-scaled viper. Another group at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark recently announced that they had developed a drug that works against the neurotoxins found in many snake venoms, including those of cobra. The hope is eventually these could lead to drugs that can be easily stored and carried in first-aid kits as a way of reducing the potency of snake venom to buy victims some time. ""These are never going to be one-size-fits-all treatments,"" says Boyer. ""But they could be a bridge to antivenom. It could help someone survive the trip to a hospital where they stock antivenom or protect a limb from necrotising damage. It might also reduce the amount of antivenom that is needed."" But she adds that many of these small molecule drug treatments have yet to be proved in clinical settings. And they too could suffer from the same economic pitfalls as antivenom unless efforts are taken to keep prices low. Instead, Boyer is more excited about innovations that are taking place outside of the laboratory to keep people safe from snake bites. ""These are more about sharing knowledge so people can take care of their own and educating people about snakes,"" she says. One such example is the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation, an international group of researchers and medical professionals who train local doctors and nurses in Africa to manage snake bites alongside public health initiatives to help protect people from being bitten. They help local people understand where the risk of encountering snakes is high and how they can reduce them, such as moving debris away from houses. They also train motorcycle taxi drivers in basic snakebite first aid so they can transport patients from remote locations to treatment centres. In India, the Humane Society International has also been working to train doctors in the region around Karnataka to deal with snake bites, but it is also trying to educate rural communities with simple ways to reduce their risk too. The Indian krait, for example, is one of the ""big four"" snakes responsible for the majority of venomous bites in India. The venom of the common Indian krait can kill within a few hours and a higher proportion of its victims appear to die compared with other snakes. But it can be thwarted by a few simple steps, says Bindumadhav. ""It has a dubious reputation for biting people while they are asleep on the floor,"" he says. ""A simple solution is to have a mosquito net hung from above and tucked under the mattress. In India a net like this costs a dollar. It is not expensive."" But Bindumadhav says there are other challenges. ""There is still a tendency for some bite victims to be taken to a faith healer rather than to hospital,"" says Bindumadhav. ""The Russell's viper doesn't always inject venom when it bites – these are dry bites but the panic they cause can lead to psychological symptoms instead. Then they appear to get better after a trip to the healer. Unfortunately, in those cases where venom is injected, it means their treatment is delayed."" Knowing whether a bite victim has been envenomed is a challenge, particularly when antivenom treatments are in short supply. Some researchers are working on techniques to help them identify whether a bite victim has been injected with venom by using thermal imaging cameras. ""Most snake venoms, and for that matter many other animal venoms, result in tissue inflammation at the site of a bite,"" says Tamilarasu Kadhiravan, a professor of medicine at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Puducherry, India. ""Venom-induced inflammation is accompanied by an increase in skin temperature, which is seen as hotspots on infrared images."" He has found that the tissue around envenomated bites tends to be between 1-3C higher than the surrounding skin. He and his colleagues have used the technique to help identify which snakebite patients might need most attention. ""We treat 200-250 patients with snake bites every year,"" Kadhiravan says. ""Antivenoms are a precious resource. Typically, in our setting, treatment with 20 vials of antivenom for a single patient costs about $70 (5,278 Indian Rupees/£51)."" He says using an infrared imaging camera costs around $1 (75 Indian Rupees/£0.73) per patient. ""If infrared imaging could prevent wasteful use of antivenom in situations where it is not really indicated, it could be used to treat more patients who actually need it."" Technology is also helping with identification of snake species themselves, which in turn can also help to make treatment more effective. Doctors in Nepal and Switzerland, for example, have been developing genetic testing techniques to help identify the snake species responsible by analysing swabs taken from bite marks. While they found they could identify some of the species responsible, it only worked in around a quarter of cases and the technique still takes too long to be used effectively in an emergency setting to identify snakes. Instead, artificial intelligence could also offer some assistance by helping to identify snake species from photographs taken by eyewitnesses to a snake bite. Many victims of bystanders take images on their mobile phones to assist in identification, but unless a medical professional is trained to tell the difference between species, these can be of little use. Isabelle Bolon, a vet at the University of Geneva, in Switzerland, and her collaborators are developing an app that uses machine vision algorithms to automatically identify snake species. Knowing which species is responsible could not only ensure patients get the right treatment more quickly, but also help to build up a more accurate picture of which snakes are really responsible for bites. In Rathnapuri, India, the Humane Society International in India have been working alongside the conservation initiative The Liana Trust to understand more about the snakes that live around the villages by learning about their behaviour. Working with locals, Bindumadhav and the team have attached radio tags to around 30 snakes, allowing them to track and record the snakes' behaviour over a three-year period. ""Every morning we find the snakes, look at what habitat they are in, whether they are shedding their skin or have just fed,"" he says. ""We are looking at how close they are to where people are working, where they are moving. It is giving us a lot more accurate information that we need to help tell people how to avoid and respect the snakes."" Involving local people in this research has also been crucial as it is helping to overcome local resistance to the interventions they are attempting to introduce, says Bindumadhav. Farmers, for example, often prefer not to use boots or flashlights when working in the field as they impede their ability to move around or to do work quickly. Similar schemes to hand out boots in Africa have failed because villagers found the boots uncomfortable and as the rubber was valuable, they sold them off, says Albulescu. Boyer too has heard of similar problems. For farmers like Tukaram Rao, knowing more about the snakes has helped to dispel much of the fear that surrounds them. ""Before this, we used to be very scared of snakes,"" he says. ""We used to run away on seeing a snake or not work in that area at all. Now we have some basic knowledge. For example, when we go to work, we use a stick to check the area before we start working."" Rao had his own close encounter with a Russell's viper recently while walking from his house to secure his cows. ""I first noticed something shining in the pathway,"" he says. ""I asked my son to fetch a light and we drove it away."" He hopes that as they learn more about Russell's vipers and their behaviour, it could ultimately allow his community to live alongside the snakes rather than in conflict with them. ""Many people used to kill snakes on sight,"" he says. ""But as we understand them better it could lead to fewer snakes being killed."" Bindumadhav's ambitions are greater still. He wants to make the entire district around the village free from snake bite deaths. ""We are starting with a village,"" he says. ""But we hope to scale it out to other districts. Snakes are misunderstood creatures – there is no reason anyone has to die from them."" * This article has been updated on 15 April 2021 to reflect an change in the estimate for spending on venom research.

Yield Spread Analysis,Solving the puzzle of long Covid,2024-09-14,2021-06-10,David Cox,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210609-how-long-will-long-covid-last,"Many months after their initial infection, some Covid-19 patients are still suffering a baffling constellation of symptoms. More than a year since the pandemic began, scientists are starting to unravel what is causing long Covid and how they can treat it. When Melissa Heightman set up the UK's first post-Covid-19 clinic at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) in May 2020, she expected that the bulk of her time would be filled helping patients recover from the after-effects of spending many weeks on a ventilator. For the majority of these patients, she hoped the road to full recovery would be swift. ""At the beginning of the pandemic, we didn't know what the long-term sequelae of a Covid infection would be,"" says Heightman, a consultant respiratory specialist. ""We thought it would be like flu, it would all just go away, and be fine."" Little did she know that a year on, a third of the clinic's patients would still be unwell, and largely unable to work. More than half were never admitted to hospital for Covid-19. Almost as soon as the clinic opened, Heightman began fielding calls from puzzled local GPs, confused at a sudden influx of patients – often relatively young and with no underlying health conditions – who were experiencing chronic symptoms. Their stories all followed a recurring pattern, beginning with an apparently mild infection, before a strange constellation of ailments started to emerge. Rather than subsiding, these symptoms continued to persist for weeks and even months after the virus had supposedly left their bodies. It was a conundrum that the medical world was not expecting. ""These patients were initially left behind,"" says Heightman. ""Most hospitals weren't able to see them easily, because they didn't have the budget to open a dedicated post-Covid clinic. But they're now our main focus."" The most common symptom, which Heightman says was experienced by more than 80% of patients in her clinic, is a deadening fatigue which impairs their life, making it difficult to complete the simplest of daily tasks. Research studies have found persistent fatigue to be present in at least 62% of long Covid patients. Such cases are now known as long Covid or post-acute Covid-19 syndrome, a post-viral illness which has proven to be more prevalent than anyone initially imagined. The general scientific consensus is that around one in 10 Covid-19 patients will still have symptoms 12 weeks later. But to fully understand the subtleties of this complex condition, it is necessary to consider long Covid as encompassing two very disparate patient groups – those who were admitted to hospital and those who weren't – each with different underlying causes. The former group has proven far more straightforward for doctors to manage. Typically their lungs or heart have been damaged by either the acute viral infection, or the resulting cytokine storm – the severe inflammatory response that can cause a patient's immune system to attack their own tissues. Computerised tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans swiftly reveal the extent of the damage, while drugs such as colchicine can be used to dampen down any lingering inflammation in the internal organs. Heightman says that two thirds of the UCLH clinic's long Covid patients admitted to hospital are now recovering well, while the remaining third have seen improvements in their scans after six months. You might also want to read: ""We expect the vast majority of these patients will improve to the point that they shouldn't be left with damage that limits their life,"" she says. ""We hope that less than 10%, those who were in the ICU for a long time, will be left with any permanent heart or lung abnormality."" But the non-hospital patients with long-term symptoms have proven far more perplexing. According to Heightman, the peak age tends to be between 35 and 49, and they report a mysterious range of symptoms. Some surveys of patients have identified up to 98 different symptoms, while an international study published in July 2021 reported more than 200 symptoms across 10 organ systems including the cardiovascular system, the nervous system, the brain and the respiratory system. The most common symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, migraines, chest pain, skin rashes, new sensitivities to smells and tastes, and dysautonomia, a normally rare condition which causes an uncomfortable and rapid increase in heartbeat when they attempt any form of activity. Heightman says that while 50% of UCLH's long Covid patients who were not admitted to hospital have improved over the course of a year to the point that they can manage their symptoms alone, the remaining half are still unwell. Much of the information we have about the long-term prognosis and symptoms experienced by this group of patients has come from a handful of dedicated clinics like Heightman's around the world, along with the efforts of virtual long Covid communities such as the Patient-Led Research Collaborative (PLRC). While half of Heightman's patients have made a good recovery, others have not been so fortunate. A recent survey from the PLRC painted a bleaker picture. Out of 3,762 long Covid patients, 77% were still experiencing fatigue after six months, 72% were struggling with post-exertional malaise, 55% were suffering from cognitive dysfunction, while 36% of female patients experienced menstrual cycle issues. ""My own cycle disappeared for three months,"" says Hannah Wei, part of the PLRC leadership team, who herself suffered from long Covid over the past year. The survey identified that for many long Covid patients who were not admitted to hospital, symptoms come and go in three separate waves. This pattern begins with a dry cough and fever, followed swiftly by a second wave of new symptoms such as dysautonomia, which peak after two months and then taper off. A month after the initial infection, a third wave of symptoms appears, including skin rashes, muscle pain, new allergies, and brain fog. ""This is the most concerning, because this wave of symptoms just continues to get gradually worse, peaking at around four months, and then just keeps going,"" says Wei. But why is it that Covid-19 impacts these patients in this way, and how is it that some people who were first infected a year ago are still yet to recover? One of the major challenges for doctors attempting to treat long Covid is that there are likely to be a variety of underlying triggers or causes, depending on the patient. Recent epidemics have provided one way of gaining crucial clues about what these underlying causes might be. Far from being unique to Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – some scientists believe almost all infectious outbreaks leave behind a proportion of patients who remain chronically unwell with symptom patterns similar to long Covid. This is known as the ""long tail"" of epidemics. By studying survivors of the Sars coronavirus outbreaks of the early 2000s, and the West Africa Ebola crisis of the past decade, a handful of scientists think they know why it happens. The Long Tail In 2004, Harvey Moldofsky, a neuroscientist at the University of Toronto, received a call from an old friend. A year earlier, Sars had briefly spread from Asia to Canada, infecting 251 people, mainly healthcare workers in the Toronto area. But more than 12 months later, 50 of them were still unwell, and John Patcai, a consultant at Toronto General Hospital, wanted to try and find out why. ""It was a mystery because even though there didn't seem to be any evidence of lingering lung inflammation, or the Sars virus, they had all these symptoms,"" says Moldofsky. ""They felt weak, extremely fatigued, had aches and pains all over their body, and they were completely unable to work. We called it post-Sars syndrome, and because I had a history of studying fatigue, John asked me to have a look at them."" Moldofsky soon identified that those suffering from the condition were sleeping extremely poorly. He suspected this, along with the other symptoms, was a sign of widespread inflammation in the brain, but lacked the funding to investigate further. But then came a breakthrough. Scientists in China reported discovering fragments of the Sars virus' genetic material in various brain cells in patients with post-Sars syndrome. For Moldofsky, this finding explained much of their malaise. ""We know there's a direct connection from our nose to the brain, called the olfactory nerve, and this is probably how the virus got directly into the circulation of the brain,"" he says. ""I believe these viral fragments were interfering with how their brains were functioning, which would explain the poor sleep quality and other issues."" Amy Proal, a microbiologist who runs the PolyBio Research Foundation, which studies the causes of chronic inflammatory diseases, believes that small amounts of pathogens that linger beyond the reach of the immune system in remote pockets of the body, known as reservoirs or anatomical sanctuaries, are at least partially responsible for a whole range of post-infectious syndromes. This includes long Covid, but also a number of mysterious illnesses which have puzzled scientists for decades, such as chronic Lyme disease, and also ME/CFS, a condition which has long been speculated to have infectious origins although some scientists feel there could be a range of potential causes, and bears a number of similarities to long Covid. ""The phenomenon of people developing chronic symptoms after an infectious outbreak is not new,"" she says. ""If the Sars-CoV-2 virus didn't do this, it would pretty much be the only documented time where a major pathogen didn't result in chronic cases. There's a huge amount of studies, which have been neglected by the mainstream medical community, showing how infectious organisms can persist in tissue, and contribute to disease processes. Some viruses are highly neurotrophic, meaning they can burrow into nerves, and hide out there, and there's evidence that Sars-CoV-2 is capable of this."" Proal says that in the past, many doctors have been quick to attribute post-infectious syndromes to psychological factors, rather than the latent effects of a pathogen still causing harm somewhere in the body. However over the past decade, outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, and now Covid-19 have all resulted in long-term chronic illness in a proportion of survivors, resulting in an increased openness to this idea. In particular, Ebola has already taught scientists a lot about the capacity of viruses to linger in the body, for months and sometimes even years. Since 2013, Georgios Pollakis, a microbiologist at the University of Liverpool, has been working with hospitals across West Africa, monitoring reported cases of long Ebola, where survivors report pain, fatigue and a range of neurological symptoms including headaches and dizziness. Intrigued by research that indicates a high proportion of Ebola survivors experience a resurgence in antibody levels to the virus up to a year after their infection, Pollakis and others have detected the presence of its genetic material in a reservoirs throughout the body, from the eye to the lymph nodes, and even in body fluids like breast milk and semen. While scientists had previously thought that these viral traces might be relatively benign, long Ebola has shown that a virus can remain active in these reservoir sites for months or even years. Earlier this year, a new genetic analysis, published as a preprint, suggested that a recent outbreak in Guinea even originated from an Ebola survivor who initially contracted the infection between 2014 and 2016. The man spread the virus by infecting a sexual partner, after it had lain dormant in his testes for at least five years. Pollakis believes that the symptoms of both long Ebola and long Covid occur because the body fails to completely clear the virus. Instead, remnants of the viruses' genetic material hide in reservoirs where they induce local inflammation. Periodically the viruses back into the bloodstream, and trigger an immune reaction, along with other symptoms. He points out that Sars-CoV-2 has been shown to be capable of infecting a wide range of tissues in the body, from the brain to the testes.  ""With Covid-19, it's shown that the virus can be measured in semen over longer periods of time,"" he says. ""So we already have suspicions that it can linger in these immunoprivileged sites."" But rogue fragments of the Sars-CoV-2 virus are unlikely to be the sole cause of long Covid. The sudden appearances of allergies that were previously not suffered, as well as the muscle and joint pains experienced by some patients, suggest the virus may trigger an autoimmune reaction in a proportion of cases. ""We think that in some patients, something about Covid stimulates the immune system to attack the body's own tissue, in a similar manner to autoimmune diseases like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis,"" says Heightman. This could help explain the relatively high proportion of women who suffer from long Covid. Heightman says that 66% of the UCLH clinic's patients are female, and similar gender skews have been reported in ME/CFS. Women are also known to be more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases. The PRLC are currently working with a number of research groups to identify long Covid patients with autoantibodies – antibodies that attack their own proteins – which could be driving some of their symptoms. An autoimmune response to the initial viral infection could also be linked to another prevailing theory, which might explain some of the odder long Covid symptoms such as the dysautonomia and blood clots. Some scientists perceive Covid-19 as an endothelial disease, where the inflammation generated against the virus ends up damaging the vascular endothelium, a fragile layer which acts as an interface between the blood and the body's tissues. Earlier this year, scientists at the University of Copenhagen proposed that in some Long Covid patients, the body might end up attacking its own vascular structures.     But in another sub-group of patients, something even stranger may be happening. A number of studies have reported reactivation of the herpes zoster virus – most commonly known as the cause of chickenpox – as well as the Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus in acute Covid-19 patients. These are all viruses that are known to be retained in the body for life as they can remain inactive inside cells. Some researchers have speculated that Covid-19 could be triggering the reactivation of viruses that have lain dormant in the body for years or even decades, leading to the development of chronic symptoms. ""One of the things that the Sars-CoV-2 virus does, is it blunts interferon signaling, and interferons are part of the immune system which keeps viruses in check,"" says Proal. ""So, if you already had the Epstein-Barr virus lying dormant in your body, it might then reactivate, and infect a new nerve or new tissue, maybe get into the central nervous system, and that could result in these chronic symptoms."" But this very complexity of long Covid, with its numerous symptoms and multiple possible causes, creates a major challenge for clinicians as they try to work out how to treat patients. While governments have been scrambling to dedicate funding to further our understanding of the disease – in February, the National Institute for Health Research and UK Research and Innovation awarded scientists at the University of Birmingham £2.2 million to study long Covid – clinical trials examining different treatment possibilities are still yet to get underway. For doctors and patients alike, this delay is proving difficult to accept. ""You feel a bit helpless because for both long Covid clinicians and patients, we don't have time, we need answers now,"" Heightman says. ""You have patients out there who are trying all kinds of things in desperation."" Examples of the alternative medicines being tried range from quercetin – a plant pigment found in green tea, onions and various berries – to niacin, a form of vitamin B with antioxidant properties. The evidence base for either of these therapies remains negligible, but as Heightman points out, patients are turning to them because doctors can offer few alternatives. Because of this some specialists believe that patients should be treated based on what we know from other, comparable illnesses. The road to treatment For long Covid, and other post-infectious syndromes, the fatigue, pain and brain fog are some of the most persistent and troubling symptoms. ""When I was really struggling with long Covid last summer, there were days where I just didn't know what I was doing,"" remembers Wei. ""I struggled to think clearly, and I had a moment in September where I realised I couldn't remember much at all from the summer. For me that was quite scary, as I normally have very vivid memories."" This kind of memory loss and confusion is often seen in ME/CFS, and over the past eight years scientists researching the illness have come to the conclusion that one of the key underlying causes is neuroinflammation, driven by immune cells in the brain called microglia. In healthy individuals, microglia play a key role in keeping the brain's neurons functioning normally, but they are vulnerable to disruption. Surges of inflammation in the bloodstream, either from an autoimmune reaction triggered by an infection, or the lingering presence of a virus, can cause these cells to pump out their own inflammatory molecules, which then disperse rapidly through the brain. Imaging studies conducted by Japanese scientists have revealed chronic neuroinflammation in a number of ME/CFS patients, while similar microglial disruption is thought to occur in a number of psychiatric disorders like depression and schizophrenia. As a result, Valeria Mondelli, an immunologist at Kings College London, is advocating trials of anti-inflammatory medications for long Covid patients. ""Either anti-inflammatories like minocycline – an antibiotic which seems to work for patients with higher levels of inflammation in the blood – or cytokine inhibitors, could be potential treatment options,"" she says. David Kaufman, a ME/CFS doctor who has treated around 1,000 patients in Mountain View, California, over the last eight years, feels that long Covid clinicians should also look for evidence of dysfunction in the microbiome, which could be making these patients more vulnerable to suffering long-term problems from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While ME/CFS is often regarded as an illness where sufferers rarely get better, Kaufman has an unusually high success rate, declaring that 15-20% of his patients have made a full recovery, although this claim is purely anecdotal. He says that this is in part this is due to his persistence in looking for and treating signs of a leaky gut an increased permeability of the intestinal lining, which is thought to make genetically susceptible people more prone to developing autoimmune conditions in response to an external trigger, such as a viral infection. This is because the gut is allowing toxins and bacteria to enter the bloodstream, causing a range of underlying issues from chronic inflammation to mast cell activation syndrome – a condition which typically occurs during an allergic reaction. These can be further exacerbated by a subsequent infection. ""80% of the ME/CFS patients I've tested have small intestinal bacteria overgrowth, otherwise as a leaky gut,"" Kaufman says. ""Because the gut is a major immune organ, this leads them down a road to autoimmune problems."" Some preliminary studies have already suggested that imbalances in the microbiome of long Covid patients could be contributing towards their persistent inflammatory symptoms. But while more research is likely to be needed before medications like prebiotics or anti-inflammatories are recommended for long Covid patients as part of general clinical practice, some individual symptoms are already proving more treatable than others. Heightman says that long Covid patients displaying allergic-type reactions tend to respond well to anti-histamines, while Amy Kontorovich, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai who specialises in treating dysautonomia, has developed a novel physical therapy programme known as Autonomic Conditioning Therapy (ACT) which has shown the ability to reduce fatigue symptoms in some long Covid patients, and has since been adopted by 53 physical therapy centres across the New York area. Kontorovich explains that ACT begins with range of motion exercises, before progressing to different aerobic exercises which slowly increase in intensity, but never allow the patient to exceed 85% of their maximum heart rate. This is inspired by a similar reconditioning programme, which has been shown to be effective in treating a form of dysautonomia, known as POTS. ""It seems to program the autonomic nervous system to kind of rewire things,"" she says. ""One of the interesting trends I've seen in many of the long Covid patients I've treated, is that they were previously very active, and during the time of their acute illness, they were either laid up in bed or mainly sedentary. That period of inactivity may be a contributing factor for the post Covid dysautonomia pattern, because we know that that can happen with deconditioning."" ACT is not a complete panacea – Kontorovich points out that some patients with particularly severe dysautonomia are often unable to complete the programme, because they feel too unwell – but her early results show that it can benefit patients who are able to finish it. Heightman adds many long Covid patients also simply get better over the course of time, as their body recovers and heals. As SARS-CoV-2 has still only been around for a little over a year and a half, it remains too early to say how long chronic symptoms may last. ""I don't want anyone who's got long Covid symptoms to feel really frightened that this is never going away, because a very significant proportion of people do get better within the first year,"" she says. For those who continue to struggle, however, the hope is that the millions of dollars of research grants being handed out will yield some viable treatment possibilities, otherwise long Covid may leave indelible social and economic consequences on society. ""If we don't find answers, you could be talking millions of people who are not going to be able to work the same way,"" says Kaufman. ""A very significant proportion of long Covid patients are healthcare workers. These are educated, active, highly productive people who now can't function. The impact of that is going to be huge."" * This article was updated on 23 August 2021 to include details of an international study published in the Lancet's EclinicalMedicine journal detailing 200 symptoms associated with long Covid. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,How future historians will study us,2024-09-14,2021-08-19,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210819-what-will-todays-data-tell-future-historians,"Social media posts, algorithms and conspiracy theories might shape how future generations understand the world today. When John Randolph wrote his first book, about the lives of the Bakunin family in 19th-Century Russia, he had mountains of source material to work from. ""I read hundreds, probably thousands, of letters,"" he recalls. ""All of these messages were meticulously preserved and ordered in a family archive."" The Bakunins narrated their lives and relationships in great depth in those letters, bequeathing fascinating details to future historians such as Randolph, director of the Russian, East European and Eurasian Center at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. But what if he had had an archive of social media posts and photographs to work with instead? Inevitably, the form and content of surviving records shapes the perspective of anyone who seeks to explore the past. That raises an interesting question for our age: if digital media survive long enough to be studied by future historians (though there's no guarantee that they will), how will that influence their judgements about us as people? Casual text messages, emails and social media posts offer glimpses of unfolding events and opinions shared. Future historians will also likely have a rich understanding of what life during our time was like, thanks to gazillions of photos and video records. They'll be able to understand the body language and vocal intonations of someone in the 1990s, whereas we have relatively little idea of what these things were actually like in, say, the 1390s. ""One of the amazing things that's happening right now is we're getting a much fuller, rounder vision of the past that has much more material, it has more colour,"" says Randolph. Films and TV shows, as well as personal photos, videos and social media posts, record in exquisite detail how people carry out daily tasks. The pressures they face. How they travel, eat and socialise. Never before in human history have we documented so excessively the minutiae of living. Anyone who studies the history of food, sport, transport, leisure, or any other aspect of our lifestyles will have a field day. You might also like:  But what about how we think? On one hand, many people tweet or post online updates about their thoughts and emotions all the time. On the other, the lengthy, detailed narratives that people sought to write down in letters hundreds of years ago may be considered rarer. Prolific letter writers didn't just preserve what happened, they also narrated events and their personal responses to them – from Mary Montagu, who introduced smallpox inoculation to Britain after witnessing it abroad, to Horace Walpole, whose letters captured all kinds of societal changes, including the Georgian craze for spa-bathing. Blogs, non-fiction books and some longform journalism have arguably taken the place of letters today, though they are by definition less private and potentially less intimate sources of information. Katrin Weller, an information scientist and head of the social analytics and services team at the GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany, says that, given the nature of social media today, future historians may judge our era as a particularly narcissistic one – perhaps rightly. Social capital has always mattered in human society, and vanity is certainly nothing new. However, Weller suggests that the endless posting of selfies and self-promotion in status updates suggests that huge numbers of people today are highly conscious of how they're perceived by others. The fact that people care so much about this might bemuse researchers of the future. ""Imagine galleries or museum collections you wander through and see the most influential Instagrammers of today and what they were posting,"" says Weller. While 17th-Century portraits tend to depict aristocrats and royals, since they were the ones wealthy enough to employ artists who could capture their likenesses, the visual media that survives us may be skewed in its own way – towards those who were most visible and vocal on the web. Class still matters but practically anyone can chronicle their own life on social media today. And future researchers won't just rely on digital records. Where it survives, they'll also pick through the physical artefacts we leave behind. One material in particular will probably endure more widely, and for longer, than any other – plastic. Packaging, for example, retains all kinds of details about the products we buy and also what food we eat, which ingredients are used, and how we store such items. (It's now relatively common to find decades-old plastic littering the environment. My sister found a 30-year-old crisp packet buried in her garden recently.) That's another thing that will be obvious to future generations – we produced copious volumes of waste and didn't really know what to do with it. Here's hoping that people have a better handle on things in the centuries to come. Knowing what daily life was like in the 21st-Century may be relatively easy, then, in the distant future. But Weller notes that one of the other big questions any historian asks about whatever period they're studying is how and why significant historical events unfolded as they did. For instance – why did a particular political movement catch on, and how did it spread? Social media might well record viral memes and messages but that alone won't necessarily explain the popularity of an idea across the wider population. ""This currently is the age where algorithms shape a lot of our lives,"" notes Weller. It's something researchers struggle to fully understand today. Unless the inner workings of algorithmic systems are preserved for retrospective analysis, their impact on the course of history could end up becoming a bit of a mystery, a gigantic black box. It might also be difficult or impossible to know what it was like to actually use a website like Facebook, even if Facebook content from our time is preserved and made accessible in years to come. Alexis Madrigal notes in The Atlantic that the functionality of social media websites is not usually stored every time such sites are updated or redesigned. These updates also tend to happen very frequently. (Read more about how social media is decaying our historical record.) Most of all, the ebb and flow of ideologies and political passions could leave future historians scratching their heads. Given the disinformation that flies about on social media, they may well wonder: why did a small but vocal number of people in the early 21st Century turn to conspiracy theories about the Earth being flat, or vaccines being ""weaponised""? It's arguably hard to fathom even now, let alone in the future when none of us will be around to provide testimony to any of this. Did algorithms of the 21st Century manipulate people to such an extent that a few were brainwashed? Some folk may have been more susceptible than others to the lure of manipulative media – but why, exactly, were they so easily taken in? The same questions that we ask ourselves today may linger for centuries to come. One worrying possibility is that the digital disinformation of today will be taken at face value in the future. Imagine people 100 years from now scouring digital newspaper columns, blogs and tweets, and having the same disagreements over, say, the benefits of Brexit or the behaviour of former US President Donald Trump, because they have huge stores of polarised messaging to pore over. ""People will be able to reach into the box and pull out whatever they want and that is definitely going to be an amplified problem, just because of the scale of the material,"" says Randolph. In other words, today's disinformation could end up distorting history. That possibility is made even greater thanks to digital media because the web functions as a giant ""decontextualisation machine"", adds Randolph. Pictures and video often appear without any information about where they came from, when they were made, or who made them. It's also not always clear whether they were edited, or if they were generated as ""deep fakes"" by artificial intelligence systems. It's a concern shared by Clare Miles, a history blogger who has considered the informational value of memes to future generations. Today's memes could be described as an evolved form of the political cartoon of the 18th Century. They're visually arresting and usually contain some snappy and sardonic observation or caption. However, as with some old cartoons, the creator's identity and motivations are usually unknown. ""When studying memes in the future, we might have to consider that they were created by someone who held a radically different interpretation of a certain event or topic based on information that they truly thought was real,"" writes Miles. And there is simply so much data flying about the web today that wading through it centuries from now in an attempt to find the bits that are genuinely illuminating might be a daunting task. ""I think we're going to present future generations with the archival equivalent of a really rich hoarder's attic in which you have lots of random stuff,"" says Randolph. Historians will probably be forced to rely on data science methods to search and organise archives automatically for the information they require. There is also the converse possibility that the sheer volume of information left behind could make the past seem quite bland. People may, rightly or wrongly, assume that they already have a good idea of what life was like the 2000s, for instance, and obsess about the 1800s instead. But Weller doesn't think this will happen. Future generations might yet marvel at the career of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, or spend decades attempting to understand the rapidly changing lives of people who grew up in developing countries during our age. One wonders whether the tweets and blog posts we leave behind will fully reveal how our society thought about and attempted to address huge challenges such as climate change. What did we do, and why – or why not? As Weller says: ""Interesting stories will appear, no matter what."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,Should we name heatwaves like storms?,2024-09-14,2021-08-27,Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210825-why-the-health-risks-of-overheating-go-unnoticed,"By the end of the century, three-quarters of the world could be at risk of deadly heat. And yet, we still struggle to design cities to be heatwave ready. Jennifer Walker spends most of her life on the pavement – which is scorchingly hot in Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley. For the past six months, she's lived out of a tent next to a large shop, surrounded by bags of food, clothes, and many bottles of water. When it gets too hot, she'll sit inside the covered car park, or use the battery-powered fan inside her tent. The heat is oppressive, but Walker is cheerfully thinking about how much worse the climate could feel. And given her lack of good indoor housing options, ""I'm going to stay outside,"" she says. It's grimly clear that due to human-induced climate change, heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense – and affecting many more people than those who live on the streets, like Walker. Presently, 30% of people worldwide are at risk of potentially deadly heat exposure for over 20 days a year. Depending on the rate of human-induced climate change, that proportion could reach 74% by 2100. The good news is that there is a bevy of simple ways to combat health risks from heat. One of the most important aspects is the most basic: simply recognising that high temperatures are a problem. Because heat is a slow-moving, gradually accumulating disaster, its effects can be invisible. Heat is one of the biggest weather-related killers, but no one knows for sure just how many lives it claims. It isn't always mentioned as a factor in death certificates, so coroners and medical professionals can't grasp the full scale of heat as a health hazard. In many places, heat continues to be perceived largely as a blessing, rather than as a threat. For instance, Japanese cities have a custom of competing with each other for the title of ""hottest city in Japan"". This can be a lucrative tourism slogan, but risks understating the dangers of heat-related illnesses – something that should be painfully clear in Japan, where over 1,000 people died in a heatwave in 2018. Earlier and more effective public health warnings can challenge the underestimation of heat risks. In Ahmedabad in India, early heat warnings have been sent to people's phones via WhatsApp, as part of a package of measures that have been found to effectively increase awareness of the risks of heatwaves. Meanwhile, state-appointed ""heat officers"" in Florida have called for a naming system for heatwaves, similar to that used to name hurricanes. Technology may help. Jennifer Runkle, an environmental epidemiologist at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies, researches the emerging field of wearable sensors to track body temperature and signs of heat strain. ""We're really interested in how to use this technology to promote sustained engagement in and response to heat warnings,"" she explains. ""One way to protect against dismissal or inaction is to incorporate these data into electronic health records, and… encourage health providers and support partners to inquire about these data during routine care visits."" Although messaging is important, how those messages are delivered matters. Too frequent warnings, or confusing colour coding, can result in people ignoring advice. Adding more warnings might not have the intended results. ""The real challenge isn't the warning systems, but the behaviour change,"" according to Public Health England consultant Emer O'Connell. And that's if people actually encounter the risk advisories. Older and less-educated people are less likely to receive heat warnings. The elderly make up the majority of people at risk of heat stress. Yet despite being the most vulnerable group, many don't consider themselves in danger. In the UK, the homes of over-75s are more prone to overheating, but these residents are less likely to report overheating. Similarly, a French study found that only 4% of people surveyed in the 65-and-over age group considered themselves at high risk during heatwaves. There are good reasons for this disconnect. Certain medications and health conditions can make it hard to determine body temperature, and to respond swiftly to the dangers. The symptoms of heatstroke – including confusion, cramps and fatigue – can be hard to differentiate from other medical conditions, including Covid-19. Cognitive impairment adds another challenge, as does resistance to changing habits. The dismissal of heat risks isn't just about individuals. Among policymakers in some places, there's a bias toward cold management rather than heat management, and towards addressing more spectacular climate-linked events like floods. Even in Japan – which is so prepared for emergencies that there's a national Disaster Prevention Day, and where many institutions regularly carry out disaster drills – disaster prevention education programs don’t always incorporate excessive heat. One of the most important action areas to reduce soaring temperatures is to increase green space in cities, from roofs to parks. Urban greening works to combat heat, says Gerardo Sanchez Martinez, an environment and health expert at the European Environment Agency. Yet all too often, urban management isn't fully implemented as part of heat-health action plans. Admittedly, tree planting is no panacea, and some urban tree-planting programmes have fallen far short of their goals. Yet it's clear that trees save lives. An analysis of extreme heat in the US city of Baltimore has found that increasing tree cover by 10% averts 83 deaths each year. According to Edith de Guzman, an environmental researcher who heads the Los Angeles Urban Cooling Collaborative, ""we have to be collectively smart about what we plant where"". The wrong tree in the wrong place can lead to problems. Large trees in small spaces can lead to broken sidewalks, making cities unequally accessible, and in desert cities, options for shade trees are limited. Careful selection of tree species, areas for planting, and community partners can also address the persistent inequalities of which neighbourhoods benefit from trees, while reducing the threat of gentrification posed by some tree-planting programmes. In LA, as in many cities, the poorer the neighbourhood, the sparser the tree cover is. Shade and ventilation should be incorporated into other aspects of building and urban design, from covered walkways to cross-ventilation (where outdoor air quality is decent) to shaded panels that move in response to sunlight. When it comes to surfaces, white paint and solar-blocking paint help to reflect sunlight, reducing the need for mechanical cooling. Finding affordable materials to insulate housing, such as in informal settlements in Karachi, in Pakistan, would help to reduce heat transfer. And simply creating more drinking fountains and designating more public toilets would help to keep people hydrated.   There are also some overlooked areas where small innovations could save lives. For instance, UK care homes are typically required under health and safety codes to have window restrictors on upper floors to prevent falls, allowing windows to be opened only a crack. This represents a trade-off between one type of safety (risk of falling) and another type (risk of overheating). ""I think this is an interesting design problem to be solved: how do we design a window that's fall-safe and also allows for ventilation on a hot day? There's a lot of space for design innovation,"" says Anna Mavrogianni, who researches sustainable building and urban design at University College London. There's also enormous room for improved design and take-up of cooling. ""Passive"" isn't usually a positive word, but it is with regard to cooling. Behavioural changes, such as placing blinds over bright windows, are simple, common-sense, cost-saving measures. Of course, these options aren’t available to all. Indeed, much of the world needs more mechanical cooling, not less. While air conditioning is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, it remains an effective heat emergency measure. ""A/C in the short term will prevent heat-related deaths more than anything else, period,"" says Vivek Shandas, a climate change researcher at Portland State University in the US. Changes in driver behaviour can temper the need to crank up the A/C. Parking in the shade, avoiding driving in the hottest parts of the day, carpooling, and switching to public transport will all reduce the need for mobile air conditioning. Na'Taki Osbourne Jelks, an environmental health scientist and community organiser, says of her Atlanta community, ""In some cases, people either don't have air conditioning, or even if they do, there have been certain parts of our community that are heavily burdened by high energy costs."" Even fans can be a luxury to some. Globally, about 3.6 billion cooling appliances are actually being used. This is dwarfed by the number of devices needed to meet people's needs, which could reach 14 billion by 2050. The problem is that air conditioning is indispensable in some places but also contributes to the causes of overheating. And over-relying on A/C could also lead to power disruptions, ironically increasing the death toll of heat, as in Pakistan in 2015 and 2018. ""The impact of cooling on climate change is twofold,"" explains Fionnuala Walravens, a campaigner at the Environmental Investigation Agency. ""Yes, we have the energy used by your cooling system, but one of the often-forgotten sides of cooling is the fact that ironically, cooling products are powered by very potent greenhouse gases called HFCs. These gases often leak out of air conditioners or general cooling products during use, but also at the end of their life. And they have a huge impact on the climate."" Another alternative to HFC-based cooling is solar-powered evaporative cooling, which essentially uses water to cool and can be useful for places that are high in temperature while low in humidity (although it may strain the water supply in drought-stressed areas). Japanese energy researchers have also developed a swirling technology that improves the efficiency of air conditioning. There are some other easy wins. One of Walravens' bugbears is supermarkets leaving refrigerator doors open, or off altogether. Sometimes about half of the energy toll from refrigerated cases comes from the lack of doors, she says.   Just as important as technical measures are addressing social isolation and inequality, given that many elderly and disabled people die of overheating alone in their homes or on the streets. Those with limited technological access or literacy may rely on acquaintances and loved ones checking in during heatwaves. So several US cities are facilitating ""heat ambassadors"". In New York City, the Be a Buddy programme connects neighbourhood volunteers with vulnerable residents during heatwaves. In Phoenix, researchers are testing indoor temperature sensors that send warning messages to the friends or families of vulnerable people. Around the world, the many mutual aid groups that sprang up during the Covid-19 pandemic could be repurposed to respond to heat risks. One whimsical lesson can be taken from Japan, where shochumimai, or summertime greeting cards, are traditionally sent to friends and family during the hottest part of the year. With messages like ""As the fierce heat of summer continues, how are you spending your days?"", this is a low-key way to check on someone’s health in the heat – as well as to spread the vital message that heat can kill. The good news, emerging from the recent news of terrible heatwaves, is that this year may represent a sea change. ""I've been working in this area for probably 15 years now. And I think, again, perception is absolutely key,"" says Mavrogianni. ""I think people's awareness has been increasing. And I just hope that there will be action and adaptation before it is too late."" * Reporting for this article was supported by the Social Science Research Council and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership, through the Abe Fellowship for Journalists. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Analysis,The subtle ways your friends change you,2024-09-14,2019-05-20,William Park,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190520-how-your-friends-change-your-habits---for-better-and-worse,"Our health choices are constantly influenced by our friends, both consciously or unconsciously. We often think that self-control comes from within, yet many of our actions depend just as much on our friends and family as ourselves. Those we surround ourselves with have the power to make us fatter, drink more alcohol, care less about the environment and be more risky with sun protection, among many things. This is not simply peer pressure, in which you deliberately act in a certain way to fit in with the group. Instead, it is largely unconscious. Beneath your awareness, your brain is constantly picking up on cues from the people around you to inform your behaviour. And the consequences can be serious. It is now well accepted that our personal sense of self is derived from other people. “The more of your identity you draw from a group, even when you’re not around that group, the more likely you are to uphold those values,” says Amber Gaffney, a social psychologist from Humboldt State University. “If a big part of how you identify is as a student from a certain university, or like me an academic, then that’s what you take with you into most interactions with others. I see things first through my lens as an academic.” Students, for instance, tend to have stronger attitudes towards things like legalising drugs or supporting environmental sustainability than the rest of the population. These are called social norms. And while these norms are usually stable, some interesting things happen if just one person in the associated group acts out of character. Consider the following study, which found that people were likely to change their opinion on green travel if they found out their peers were acting hypocritically. The students from Humboldt State University reside in a small, socially liberal town in northern California which takes pride in its environmental credentials. The students there are largely very environmentally conscious, too. You would expect that a peer’s disregard for carbon emissions would not go down well. After listening to an interview with a student at the university who stressed the importance of walking or cycling short distances rather than taking a car, and then later admitting to driving to the interview, the participants were asked about their own environmental views. They did this while sat next to an actor. The actor took the role of either a third student wearing a university sweatshirt, or a professional in smart clothing. When the hypocrisy of the interviewee was revealed, the actor either made a negative remark about their behaviour or stayed quiet. You might also enjoy: How the participants judged the importance of walking or cycling short distances was dependent on who they listened to the interview with, and how that person reacted. When sat with someone they thought was another student, and who shared their environmental values, the participants reiterated the importance of cycling. When sat with an outsider it wasn’t so clear cut.   An outsider who commented on the hypocrisy of the interviewee elicited the strongest environmental feelings in the participants. By defending the interviewee from criticism, they reinforced their own view that cycling was important. This is perhaps because they felt the interviewee might normally be more environmentally responsible. Conversely, if the outsider stayed quiet, the participants judged the importance of cycling the lowest. So, how an outsider judges our peers has a big impact on whether we back them up or not. “This was an interesting study,” adds Gaffney, “because we were able to make some people care less about the environment. Normally this isn’t something that we would actively want to do, but understanding where these views come from could help us to nudge people in the other direction.” In the face of criticism by a stranger, we might come to the aid of our peers. But if left to form our own opinions, we interpret the hypocritical behaviour as a sign that we can relax our own views. This is called vicarious dissonance. “Vicarious dissonance is when you see someone behave in a way inconsistent with your attitudes, so you change your attitudes,” says Gaffney. “I should be embarrassed by seeing you act in a non-environmental way, but that doesn’t always happen. I won’t necessarily start copying you, but I will change my attitudes to reflect your behaviour because I feel similar to you and I see you as an extension of myself.” This study was inspired by several pieces of work in Australia on vicarious dissonance around sun protection use. Again, someone acting hypocritically would relax people’s attitudes around applying protection, where the norm is to be extremely vigilant. How we talk about our health choices with friends can also have a significant impact on our decisions, both positively and negatively. Talking about an anti-smoking campaign with friends reduced people’s cigarette intake, perhaps because those conversations gave smokers the opportunity to work out which information was most relevant to their lifestyles – and then act on it. This is supported by a meta-analysis of 28 studies totalling 139,000 participants. “The leading cause of death is preventable health behaviours like smoking and obesity, and we have access to a vast amount of information online but we still smoke and we still don’t exercise,” says Christin Scholz of the University of Amsterdam. “Anything our friends do influences us in ways that we are conscious of or not. Their presence can decide whether we act on that health information or ignore it.” Scholz asked college students in the US if they had talked to anyone about a recent experience involving alcohol, and whether those conversations were positive or negative. If they had talked positively about alcohol consumption they were more likely to drink more the next day, and vice versa. These patterns are highly influenced, though, by the social circumstances that we find ourselves in. When we make decisions we are constantly reassessing the value we might get from each choice – a process called value maximisation. Our decision to take the stairs rather than a lift is dependent on how much we ate at lunch, if we have already been for our daily run and whether we walked into the building with our triathlete colleague. No effect of a conversation with friends can ever be viewed in isolation. And that is why our willpower fluctuates. “Say I have a conversation with a friend the day before about some of the negative sides of alcohol but the next day I am in a bar with other people – I would still argue that conversation has some form of influence on me,” says Scholz. “However, it’s a pretty simple representation of human decision making. We’re not always [very] rational – we make these decisions pretty quickly. The importance of certain types of information changes through the day.” Our choices are influenced by who we are with when we are asked the question, how those people reacted, any conversations we might have had beforehand and our fundamental understanding of what is normal for that group of friends. But, if we’re still in doubt, the easiest thing to do is to look at what others are doing and copy them. We do this all the time, and we might not realise the impact it has. “When we eat with others we have a natural tendency to use their behaviour as a guide,” says Suzanne Higgs, who studies the psychobiology of appetite at the University of Birmingham. “Lots of studies have shown that when we eat with people who eat a lot, we eat more. People aren’t often aware they are being influenced in that way. They might say it was the taste or the price or hunger levels rather than the people around them.”   The phenomenon was first described based on an analysis of food diaries by John de Castro in the 1980s. These detailed diaries listed what people ate, but also where, when and who with. He was then able to control for the effects of celebratory meals, whether alcohol was consumed, if the meal took place at the weekend and any other factors that might have influenced the amount of food eaten. These effects have since been repeated in laboratories. Higgs asked students to eat lunch either with a friend or in isolation in a lab. It appears to happen even when you are eating with one other friend in a very controlled environment. But, this effect only occurs with people that you know well. Higgs suggests that the presence of another person clouds our ability to pick up on cues from our bodies that we are satisfied. The normal process of feeling full is disrupted by feeling stimulated by our friends. Other distractions, like watching TV, have been shown to increase food consumption. Next, Higgs took her research into the field to see if eating behaviours could be influenced by other social cues. She wanted to encourage people to choose vegetable side dishes by providing information about the choices of other diners using posters. “Of course we know that explicitly saying ‘Vegetables are good for you’ doesn’t work,” says Higgs. Instead, the posters displayed fabricated data about which side dishes most customers bought. Higgs put a vegetable side dish at the top. “These posters just described the behaviour of other people – and that’s enough for some,” says Higgs. “When we enter a new environment, we look for cues about how to behave. So, to see that a certain choice is the most popular really helps us out.” The effect was seen even after the posters were taken down. Higgs had created a new norm. “There is good reason to believe that when we use normative behaviour it makes us feel good because we’re connecting with a social group,” says Higgs. “If you are with a new social group, you are more likely to imitate behaviours.” Our decisions might not always be in our hands. But this also means we can use our influence for good. “The same way a negative behaviour can spread through a network of people a positive one can spread through a network,” says Scholz. “We’ve evolved to live in a group to spread positive actions and to seek the approval of others.” -- William Park is @williamhpark on Twitter.

Yield Spread Analysis,What is the 'meat paradox'?,2024-09-14,2019-02-06,Julia Shaw,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190206-what-the-meat-paradox-reveals-about-moral-decision-making,"Many people eat factory-farmed meat while also abhorring animal cruelty. In this adaptation from her new book, the psychological scientist Dr Julia Shaw explains what the “meat paradox” can tell us about moral decision making. Money changes our relationship with morality. The very existence of money, along with complex business and distribution channels, acts as a buffer between ourselves and the origin of our products. This can make us behave in ways that are deeply unethical. I can prove it to you. Do you think animal torture is evil? And do you also eat factory-farmed meat?  Many people who would strongly disagree, in principle, with animal cruelty also eat meat that has been raised in terrible conditions.  I know this myself. I try to eat a mostly plant-based diet, but like the majority of people in most Western countries, I do not eat this diet exclusively. By reframing the same issue and adding a price tag we make some acts seem far less offensive. We can’t see them first hand, so they feel like they are unrelated to us. All we can see is the price. Why? When we understand why we eat meat that we know has been raised in poor conditions, we can begin to understand many other forms of behaviour that conflict with deeply held moral principles. Internal conflictAccording to psychologists Brock Bastian and Steve Loughnan, who do research on the topic in Australia, the “meat paradox” is the “psychological conflict between people’s dietary preference for meat and their moral response to animal suffering”. They argue that “bringing harm to others is inconsistent with a view of oneself as a moral person. As such, meat consumption leads to negative effects for meat-eaters because they are confronted with a view of themselves that is unfavourable: how can I be a good person and also eat meat?”  According to psychologists Brock Bastian and Steve Loughnan, who do research on the topic in Australia, the “meat paradox” is the “psychological conflict between people’s dietary preference for meat and their moral response to animal suffering”. They argue that “bringing harm to others is inconsistent with a view of oneself as a moral person. As such, meat consumption leads to negative effects for meat-eaters because they are confronted with a view of themselves that is unfavourable: how can I be a good person and also eat meat?” This moral conflict doesn’t just threaten our enjoyment of eating meat, it threatens our identity. In order to protect our identities we establish habits and social structures that make us feel better. Meat-eating is tied to social customs, so that holidays are defined as a time to feast on flesh with friends and family. Some people may also use it as a signal of masculinity, claiming that it helps define someone as a real man, or that we humans evolved as super-predators who were meant to eat meat. And despite animal products being linked to all kinds of poor health outcomes, some people tsk when we say that we want to go vegan (“How will you get enough protein?”), and friends start ""forgetting"" to invite us to dinner parties. With many decisions, including the choice to eat meat, the excuses we make are largely post hoc – after we have chosen to indulge we need to justify why the behaviour was OK, and why it is OK to do it again. And we need the excuses, or else we feel like bad people. You might also like:  When we say one thing but do another, or hold inconsistent beliefs, psychologists call it cognitive dissonance. The term was developed by Leon Festinger, who first used it in 1957. The classic experiment in this field was published by Festinger and James Carlsmith in 1959. In it, they asked: “What happens to a person’s private opinion if he is forced to do or say something contrary to that opinion?” In their experiment, they had 71 men complete two tasks. First, the men were asked to put 12 round wooden spools into a tray, empty the tray and put the spools back in the tray, repeatedly, for half an hour. Then the participants were given a board containing 48 square wooden pegs. They were asked to turn each peg by a quarter turn clockwise, then another quarter turn, repeatedly, again for half an hour. While they did this, a researcher watched and wrote things down. These were intentionally boring tasks. Really, really boring. Although the participants thought it was their performance that was being measured, it was actually what came next that interested the researchers. After their two boring tasks, participants were taken back into the waiting room. They were told that the person sitting there was the next participant. For one-third of the participants, they simply sat down without anything else being mentioned. For the other two-thirds, however, the researcher asked whether they would lie to the next participant. They would even be paid for their lie. Half were told that they would be paid $1 for their lie, and the other half were told that they would be paid $20 for their lie (which in the 1950s was a lot). When they said yes, the researcher then handed them a piece of paper, and instructed them to make the points that were written on it: “It was very enjoyable”, “I had a lot of fun”, “I enjoyed myself”, “It was very interesting”, “It was intriguing”, “It was exciting”. What the researchers really wanted to know was what impact this lie, and the compensation for it, would have on participants’ rating of the task. They wondered whether participants would actually come to think they enjoyed the boring task, just because they told someone else it was fun. And how would being paid influence this? Who do you think rated the experiment as the most enjoyable? The control group, who had not been asked to lie, rated the task as boring and said that they would not do it again. The participants paid $20 also rated the task negatively. However, the participants paid $1 rated the experiment as far more enjoyable than the other two groups, and were more likely to say they would sign up to participate in similar experiments in the future. What happened? Being paid $1 was probably not seen by the participants as sufficient incentive to lie. Accordingly, they experienced cognitive dissonance. “Why did I say that it was enjoyable when it wasn’t? Surely not for a measly $1?” Since the participants could not go back and change their behaviour, or un-participate in the experiment, the option available to them was to change their belief – it must have actually been enjoyable.For the $20 condition this was not necessary, as they could explain their behaviour as the result of the hefty and easy financial incentive. This was the first of many experiments to show that we often bring our beliefs in line with our behaviour, and that money can change the way we do this. In 1962 Festinger further formalised his ideas. He stated that although we believe ourselves to be generally consistent – in our behaviours, beliefs and attitudes – sometimes we go rogue. This inconsistency he called dissonance, while consistency he called consonance. He summarised his cognitive dissonance theory as follows: Dissonance in pretty packaging He further explained that, just as hunger motivates us to find food to reduce our hunger, cognitive dissonance motivates us to find situations to reduce the dissonance. For meat-eating, there are two ways to do this: we can change our behaviour or change the belief. We can stop eating meat, or come up with reasons why eating meat is morally OK. In addition to our own attempts to justify meat-eating, advertising and marketing can make it easier for us to do so. According to research by sociologist Liz Grauerholz on images of animals in popular culture, one way to make meat-eating seem acceptable is to dissociate it from the animal it came from. Grauerholz argues that we do this by “transforming animals, which are loved, into meats, which are eaten, so that the concepts of ‘animals’ and ‘meats’ seem distinct and unrelated”. We call it “veal” instead of baby cow, “ham” instead of pig, “game” instead of hunted wild animal. We pack our dead animals in pretty packages – physically, verbally and conceptually distancing ourselves from the real origin of our food. When looking at commercial depictions of meat, she found that this was done in two different ways. The first was showing meat as sanitised, plastic-wrapped, chopped into pieces – making it hard to think that it came from an animal at all. The second had to do with ‘cutification’ – making the animals cuter than they actually are. More than anywhere, this is adopted as a strategy in parts of Asia such as Japan. Adverts there use what ethologist Konrad Lorenz referred to as the Kindchenschema (“baby schema”) – big eyes, petite, round features, like we might expect in children’s books. It’s meant to give the impression that this meat comes from happy, imaginary animals. Both of these serve to distract from the realities of animal cruelty. This isn’t just relevant for meat-eating. When we turn animals or humans into objects, and thereby avoid the discomfort caused by knowing about the suffering behind consumer goods, we make it easier to be cruel. The same processes we see with meat, we see with all kinds of other morally unacceptable but common human behaviours that have to do with money. We know that poverty causes great suffering, yet instead of sharing our wealth we buy another pair of expensive shoes. We fundamentally disagree with the idea of child labour or adults working under horrible conditions, but keep shopping at discount stores. We stay in the dark, to protect our delicate identities, to maintain the illusion that we are consistent and ethically sensible human beings. In this constant effort to reduce cognitive dissonance, we may spread morally questionable behaviour to others. We begin to shape societies in ways to minimise our discomfort, to not remind us of our inconsistencies. We don’t want constant reminders. And, as Bastian and Loughnan argue, “through the process of dissonance reduction, the apparent immorality of certain behaviours can seemingly disappear.” Hypocrisy can flourish in certain social and cultural environments. Social habits can cast a veil over our moral conflicts, by normalising behaviours and making them invisible and resistant to change. It is time for a revolution in how we talk about human beings, animals and the planet, and acknowledge our own hypocrisies. Rather than doing mental gymnastics to justify unethical behaviour, we must consider actually changing it. Identifying and addressing even just a few of your guilt-ridden ethical inconsistencies is likely to make you a happier person, and the planet a better place. -- This text has been adapted from Evil: The Science Behind Humanity’s Dark Side, by Dr Julia Shaw, a psychological scientist at University College London.

Yield Spread Analysis,Is civilisation about to collapse?,2024-09-14,2019-02-19,Luke Kemp,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-are-we-on-the-road-to-civilisation-collapse,"Studying the demise of historic civilisations can tell us how much risk we face today, says collapse expert Luke Kemp. Worryingly, the signs are worsening. DEEP CIVILISATION BBC Future has brought you in-depth and rigorous stories to help you navigate the current crisis, but we know that’s not all you want to read. So now we’re dedicating a series to help you escape. We’ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads.    You’ll find everything from the story about the world’s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us, the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long-buried World War Two tanks back to life. What you won’t find is any reference to, well, you-know-what. Enjoy. Great civilisations are not murdered. Instead, they take their own lives. So concluded the historian Arnold Toynbee in his 12-volume magnum opus A Study of History. It was an exploration of the rise and fall of 28 different civilisations. He was right in some respects: civilisations are often responsible for their own decline. However, their self-destruction is usually assisted.   The Roman Empire, for example, was the victim of many ills including overexpansion, climatic change, environmental degradation and poor leadership. But it was also brought to its knees when Rome was sacked by the Visigoths in 410 and the Vandals in 455. Collapse is often quick and greatness provides no immunity. The Roman Empire covered 4.4 million sq km (1.9 million sq miles) in 390. Five years later, it had plummeted to 2 million sq km (770,000 sq miles). By 476, the empire’s reach was zero. Our deep past is marked by recurring failure. As part of my research at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, I am attempting to find out why collapse occurs through a historical autopsy. What can the rise and fall of historic civilisations tell us about our own? What are the forces that precipitate or delay a collapse? And do we see similar patterns today? You might also like: The first way to look at past civilisations is to compare their longevity. This can be difficult, because there is no strict definition of civilisation, nor an overarching database of their births and deaths. In the graphic below, I have compared the lifespan of various civilisations, which I define as a society with agriculture, multiple cities, military dominance in its geographical region and a continuous political structure. Given this definition, all empires are civilisations, but not all civilisations are empires. The data is drawn from two studies on the growth and decline of empires (for 3000-600BC and 600BC-600), and an informal, crowd-sourced survey of ancient civilisations (which I have amended). Click/pinch to enlarge. Here's the full list of the civilisations displayed above. (Credit: Nigel Hawtin) Collapse can be defined as a rapid and enduring loss of population, identity and socio-economic complexity. Public services crumble and disorder ensues as government loses control of its monopoly on violence. Virtually all past civilisations have faced this fate. Some recovered or transformed, such as the Chinese and Egyptian. Other collapses were permanent, as was the case of Easter Island. Sometimes the cities at the epicentre of collapse are revived, as was the case with Rome. In other cases, such as the Mayan ruins, they are left abandoned as a mausoleum for future tourists.  What can this tell us about the future of global modern civilisation? Are the lessons of agrarian empires applicable to our post-18th Century period of industrial capitalism? I would argue that they are. Societies of the past and present are just complex systems composed of people and technology. The theory of “normal accidents” suggests that complex technological systems regularly give way to failure. So collapse may be a normal phenomenon for civilisations, regardless of their size and stage. We may be more technologically advanced now. But this gives little ground to believe that we are immune to the threats that undid our ancestors. Our newfound technological abilities even bring new, unprecedented challenges to the mix. And while our scale may now be global, collapse appears to happen to both sprawling empires and fledgling kingdoms alike. There is no reason to believe that greater size is armour against societal dissolution. Our tightly-coupled, globalised economic system is, if anything, more likely to make crisis spread. If the fate of previous civilisations can be a roadmap to our future, what does it say? One method is to examine the trends that preceded historic collapses and see how they are unfolding today. While there is no single accepted theory for why collapses happen, historians, anthropologists and others have proposed various explanations, including: CLIMATIC CHANGE: When climatic stability changes, the results can be disastrous, resulting in crop failure, starvation and desertification. The collapse of the Anasazi, the Tiwanaku civilisation, the Akkadians, the Mayan, the Roman Empire, and many others have all coincided with abrupt climatic changes, usually droughts. ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION: Collapse can occur when societies overshoot the carrying capacity of their environment. This ecological collapse theory, which has been the subject of bestselling books, points to excessive deforestation, water pollution, soil degradation and the loss of biodiversity as precipitating causes. INEQUALITY AND OLIGARCHY: Wealth and political inequality can be central drivers of social disintegration, as can oligarchy and centralisation of power among leaders. This not only causes social distress, but handicaps a society’s ability to respond to ecological, social and economic problems. The field of cliodynamics models how factors such as equality and demography correlate with political violence. Statistical analysis of previous societies suggests that this happens in cycles. As population increases, the supply of labour outstrips demand, workers become cheap and society becomes top-heavy. This inequality undermines collective solidarity and political turbulence follows. COMPLEXITY: Collapse expert and historian Joseph Tainter has proposed that societies eventually collapse under the weight of their own accumulated complexity and bureaucracy. Societies are problem-solving collectives that grow in complexity in order to overcome new issues. However, the returns from complexity eventually reach a point of diminishing returns. After this point, collapse will eventually ensue. Another measure of increasing complexity is called Energy Return on Investment (EROI). This refers to the ratio between the amount of energy produced by a resource relative to the energy needed to obtain it. Like complexity, EROI appears to have a point of diminishing returns. In his book The Upside of Down, the political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon observed that environmental degradation throughout the Roman Empire led to falling EROI from their staple energy source: crops of wheat and alfalfa. The empire fell alongside their EROI. Tainter also blames it as a chief culprit of collapse, including for the Mayan.  EXTERNAL SHOCKS: In other words, the “four horsemen”: war, natural disasters, famine and plagues. The Aztec Empire, for example, was brought to an end by Spanish invaders. Most early agrarian states were fleeting due to deadly epidemics. The concentration of humans and cattle in walled settlements with poor hygiene made disease outbreaks unavoidable and catastrophic. Sometimes disasters combined, as was the case with the Spanish introducing salmonella to the Americas. RANDOMNESS/BAD LUCK: Statistical analysis on empires suggests that collapse is random and independent of age. Evolutionary biologist and data scientist Indre Zliobaite and her colleagues have observed a similar pattern in the evolutionary record of species. A common explanation of this apparent randomness is the “Red Queen Effect”: if species are constantly fighting for survival in a changing environment with numerous competitors, extinction is a consistent possibility. -- Despite the abundance of books and articles, we don’t have a conclusive explanation as to why civilisations collapse. What we do know is this: the factors highlighted above can all contribute. Collapse is a tipping point phenomena, when compounding stressors overrun societal coping capacity.   We can examine these indicators of danger to see if our chance of collapse is falling or rising. Here are four of those possible metrics, measured over the past few decades: Temperature is a clear metric for climate change, GDP is a proxy for complexity and the ecological footprint is an indicator for environmental degradation. Each of these has been trending steeply upwards. Inequality is more difficult to calculate. The typical measurement of the Gini Index suggests that inequality has decreased slightly globally (although it is increasing within countries). However, the Gini Index can be misleading as it only measures relative changes in income. In other words, if two individuals earning $1 and $100,000 both doubled their income, the Gini would show no change. But the gap between the two would have jumped from $99,999 to $198,998. Because of this, I have also depicted the income share of the global top 1%. The 1% have increased in their share of global income from approximately 16% in 1980 to over 20% today. Importantly, wealth inequality is even worse. The share of global wealth from the 1% has swelled from 25-30% in the 1980s to approximately 40% in 2016. The reality is likely to be starker as these numbers do not capture wealth and income siphoned into overseas tax havens. Studies suggest that the EROI for fossil fuels has been steadily decreasing over time as the easiest to reach and richest reserves are depleted. Unfortunately, most renewable replacements, such as solar, have a markedly lower EROI, largely due to their energy density and the rare earth metals and manufacturing required to produce them. This has led much of the literature to discuss the possibility of an “energy cliff” as EROI declines to a point where current societal levels of affluence can no longer be maintained. The energy cliff need not be terminal if renewable technologies continue to improve and energy efficiency measures are speedily implemented. Measures of resilience  The somewhat reassuring news is that collapse metrics are not the entire picture. Societal resilience may be able to delay or prevent collapse. For example, globally “economic diversity” – a measurement of the diversity and sophistication of country exports ­– is greater today than it was in the 1960s and 1970s, as measured by the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). Nations are, on average, less reliant on single types of exports than they once were. For example, a nation that had diversified beyond only exporting agricultural products would be more likely to weather ecological degradation or the loss of trading partners. The ECI also measures the knowledge-intensity of exports. More skilled populations may have a greater capacity to respond to crises as they arise. Similarly, innovation – as measured by per capita patent applications – is also rising. In theory, a civilisation might be less vulnerable to collapse if new technologies can mitigate against pressures such as climate change. It’s also possible that “collapse” can happen without violent catastrophe. As Rachel Nuwer wrote on BBC Future in 2017, “in some cases, civilisations simply fade out of existence – becoming the stuff of history not with a bang but a whimper”. Still, when we look at all these collapse and resilience indicators as a whole, the message is clear that we should not be complacent. There are some reasons to be optimistic, thanks to our ability to innovate and diversify away from disaster. Yet the world is worsening in areas that have contributed to the collapse of previous societies. The climate is changing, the gap between the rich and poor is widening, the world is becoming increasingly complex, and our demands on the environment are outstripping planetary carrying capacity. The rungless ladder That's not all. Worryingly, the world is now deeply interconnected and interdependent. In the past, collapse was confined to regions – it was a temporary setback, and people often could easily return to agrarian or hunter-gatherer lifestyles. For many, it was even a welcome reprieve from the oppression of early states. Moreover, the weapons available during social disorder were rudimentary: swords, arrows and occasionally guns. Today, societal collapse is a more treacherous prospect. The weapons available to a state, and sometimes even groups, during a breakdown now range from biological agents to nuclear weapons. New instruments of violence, such as lethal autonomous weapons, may be available in the near future. People are increasingly specialised and disconnected from the production of food and basic goods. And a changing climate may irreparably damage our ability to return to simple farming practices. Think of civilisation as a poorly-built ladder. As you climb, each step that you used falls away. A fall from a height of just a few rungs is fine. Yet the higher you climb, the larger the fall. Eventually, once you reach a sufficient height, any drop from the ladder is fatal. With the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we may have already reached this point of civilisational “terminal velocity”. Any collapse – any fall from the ladder – risks being permanent. Nuclear war in itself could result in an existential risk: either the extinction of our species, or a permanent catapult back to the Stone Age.   While we are becoming more economically powerful and resilient, our technological capabilities also present unprecedented threats that no civilisation has had to contend with. For example, the climatic changes we face are of a different nature to what undid the Maya or Anazasi. They are global, human-driven, quicker, and more severe. Assistance in our self-imposed ruin will not come from hostile neighbors, but from our own technological powers. Collapse, in our case, would be a progress trap.  The collapse of our civilisation is not inevitable. History suggests it is likely, but we have the unique advantage of being able to learn from the wreckages of societies past. We know what needs to be done: emissions can be reduced, inequalities levelled, environmental degradation reversed, innovation unleashed and economies diversified. The policy proposals are there. Only the political will is lacking. We can also invest in recovery. There are already well-developed ideas for improving the ability of food and knowledge systems to be recuperated after catastrophe. Avoiding the creation of dangerous and widely-accessible technologies is also critical. Such steps will lessen the chance of a future collapse becoming irreversible. We will only march into collapse if we advance blindly. We are only doomed if we are unwilling to listen to the past. -- Luke Kemp is a researcher based at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. He tweets @lukakemp.

Yield Spread Analysis,Will Russia ever leave oil behind?,2024-09-14,2021-11-24,Angelina Davydova,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211115-climate-change-can-russia-leave-fossil-fuels-behind,"In Russia, oil and natural gas provide both wealth and deep national pride. With global demand for fossil fuels set to decline, how will Russia adapt? The small West Siberian city of Khanty-Mansiysk, home to just over 100,000 people, is Russia's unofficial capital of oil. The town is surrounded by some of the most extensive oilfields in the world, which shape not only the region's geology but its economy and identity. The relatively short history of oil in Khanty-Mansiysk has transformed this part of Russia. The Samotlor oil field, Russia's largest, was discovered in the 1960s to the east of the city and fast became the source of the area's considerable wealth. Khanty-Mansiysk sits within the Tyumen region, which often ranks second in Russia for wellbeing and socioeconomic development, after only Moscow. In this part of Russia, oil is an important source of not only money, but pride. Since the 1960s, oil workers and engineers have been praised and featured as heroes in novels and movies. The local Museum of Geology, Oil and Gas is a major architectural landmark of the city. In the city's airport, one can see photographs of oil workers and engineers from various decades through the 20th Century, including of Russia's first president, Boris Yeltzin, meeting workers on an oil field. Amid such a celebration of this fossil fuel, one could imagine that the realities of climate change haven't yet percolated to the heartland of Russia's oil. But in the last few years, that has begun to change. This year, one of the city's major oil forums, ""Oil Capital"", which took place in March, paid particular attention to climate, with panels and discussions dedicated to decarbonisation. Local officials, companies and scientists tried to understand what the future of Khanty-Mansiysk, and of Russia, might be in a new low-carbon world. ""The climate agenda has been a topic here for a few years by now, ever since Russia's Climate Doctrine was adopted in 2009,"" says Irina Akhmedova, associate professor at the Oil and Gas Institute of the Yugra State University. The Climate Doctine was Russia's first political document to outline a basis for climate regulation. ""However, it is not an easy topic, especially as we are such a mono-specialised region."" Deep oil Oil and gas make up 80% of Khanty-Mansiysk's economy. Overall in Russia, oil and gas provided 39% of the federal budget revenue and made up 60% of Russian exports in 2019. The share of all fossil fuel rents (the price of fossil fuels minus the cost of producing them) amounted to 14% of GDP that year, according to a forthcoming paper by Igor Makarov, a researcher at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Despite the deep entrenchment of oil and gas in its economy, Russia is very much aware of the climate crisis and has made some moves to integrate it into current and future policies. In late September, the government created a number of special cross-ministerial working groups to prepare the economy for the global energy transition. These groups will forecast risks and opportunities for Russia, with their findings feeding into an action plan to be created by the end of 2021. ""The global economy is focused on a gradual transition to low-carbon energy,"" said Russia's prime minister Mikhail Mushustin, during a meeting with ministers in late September. ""This is already a new reality. We need to prepare for a phased reduction in the use of traditional fuels – oil, gas, coal."" Shortly before world leaders gathered for the United Nations' recent climate talks in Glasgow (COP26), the government adopted a long-term low carbon development strategy which foresees the country reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 or before. Obligatory carbon reporting for large emitting companies was introduced earlier in 2021. Companies within Russia can also now adopt voluntary emission reduction projects and trade their emissions. (The only exception so far is the Sakhalin region in the Far East of Russia, where a more legally binding emission trading scheme is being drafted.) Slow transition At the same time, many climate experts warn that Russia's emission reduction target for 2030 remains very weak. This target foresees an emissions ""reduction"" of 25-30% by 2030 from 1990 levels, but Russia's current levels of emissions are already around 30% below the 1990 levels if forest sinks are not included, and about 50% if forests are included. This means that in reality, Russia's low-carbon development strategy plans at least a 0.6% increase in emissions from today's levels by 2030. The international research group Climate Action Tracker says Russia's policies and actions are ""highly insufficient"" for a 1.5C pathway, and closer in line with a 4C world. Both the government and companies are taking an optimistic view of the prospects of oil and gas sectors in the short-term. ""In the next 20 to 30 years, industries related to oil and gas will remain one of the pillars of Russia's economy,"" says Alexey Miroshnichenko, first deputy chairman of Russia's state development bank, VEB. ""Even in the long term, renewable and conventional energy sources will coexist."" Nevertheless, traditional industries will have to undergo ""a serious transformation"" in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, Miroshnichenko adds. Together with the Ministry of Economic Development, the VEB created Russia's first system of green finance in September, which aims to help financiers decide which projects are sustainable. It comes as little surprise that there is a reluctance in the oil and gas industry towards a fast phase-out of the fuels. Speaking at a side-event at COP26, Sergey Vakulenko, a representative of one of Russia's largest oil companies, Gazprom Neft, argued that oil and gas would still be needed even in the new low-carbon economy. Renewables might be enough to cover the majority of demand, he said, but traditional fuels would still be used as a back-up.   Peaking pressure Some experts question how long Russia's fossil fuel industry will remain a viable prospect. ""Gas, which many are pinning their hopes on as a transitional fuel, will last for 10 to 15 years [as an economically viable fuel],"" says Evgeny Kuznetsov, a Russian venture investor and chief executive of Orbita Capital Partners. ""This period may not be enough to return investments in new large-scale gas projects."" But others say the industry is not likely to abate any time soon. Thane Gustafson, professor of political science at Georgetown University in the US and author of the book Klimat: Russia in the Age of Climate Change, expects that world demand for fossil fuels will continue to grow through the 2020s. At the same time, supply constraints arising from decreasing investment in fossil fuels will keep energy prices high, punctuated by periodic spikes in prices, as we are seeing today. But in the early 2030s that picture will begin to change, he says, with the influence of climate politics, technological change and the clean energy transition becoming dominant. He expects world demand for oil to peak and begin to decline around this time due to the spread of electric vehicles and political limits on petrochemicals. Renewables will increasingly displace coal, he says, while gas demand will remain high but cease to grow. ""The impact of climate change [action] on Russia over the next 30 years is going to be very largely external,"" says Gustafson. ""It will rise because of trends and forces that are running outside Russia and over which Russia has in fact very little leverage."" Changes inside Russia, such as the increasing cost of oil extraction as oil fields deplete, will have some impact, he adds. But the growth of electric vehicles, the continued spread of renewable energy and the progress of green legislation particularly in Europe, such as the European Green Deal, will all put external pressure on Russia, he says. ""Russia has very little control over that,"" says Gustafson. ""Russia will be a 'taker' of world trends, rather than a 'maker'. And that must be, of course, a difficult realisation."" This puts Russia in a vulnerable position, says Kuznetsov. He believes that after the current energy crisis, a drop in demand will accelerate Europe's planned reduction in fossil fuel consumption. The result could be a large number of competitors vying for a shrinking market, driving prices down. Vladimir Chuprov, a project director at Greenpeace in Russia, agrees that if other countries follow up with real actions on their Paris Agreement pledges, Russia will experience declining demand for coal and oil before 2030. However, in 2050 the Russian economy is still likely to be based on at least some revenue from natural gas exports, he says. Within Russia's domestic supply, he sees gas, along with nuclear, playing a leading role. But by 2050, the Russian economy will no longer be able to rely on oil and gas exports and will need to find new sources of income, adds Chuprov. ""That would be especially hard for the regional economies,"" he says. ""People will start migrating within Russia."" Energy after oil The question is, what could be the basis of the new, post-fossil fuel economy in Russia? ""This is definitely the billion-dollar – and more – question,"" says Anna Korppoo, a research professor at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway. Korppoo has been researching Russia's climate policy for more than 10 years and recently co-authored a report on a just transition away from coal in Russia. There are several contenders that could take the place of fossil fuels in a clean Russian economy. One option would be new sources of energy for export such as renewables, hydrogen or nuclear and potentially even decarbonised fossil energy with carbon capture and storage. Speaking at Russia's side-event at COP26, the Russian Ministry of Energy representative Pavel Sorokin touted increasing forest sinks and carbon capture and storage as priorities for the Russian fossil fuel companies, followed by further reduction of emissions. Sorokinalso emphasised the importance of producing green hydrogen (hydrogen made cleanly by splitting water using an electric current) as well as ""blue"" hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas but uses carbon capture and storage to attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, scientists have doubts about how sustainable blue hydrogen actually is, warning that greenhouse gas emissions from blue hydrogen can be high, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane. (Read more about the growth of sustainable hydrogen.)  As the world's largest producer of nuclear power plants, with plans to develop new nuclear technologies for export, Gustafson is optimistic about the prospects for Russia's nuclear industry. ""That has been quite a story – the creation and revival of [the state corporation] Rosatom has led to a very big rise in the construction and sales [of nuclear technologies] outside Russia,"" he says. ""Russia currently has strong advantages in civilian nuclear technology compared to the United States or France or the UK."" Environmental activists in Russia, however, are more sceptical about plans to develop nuclear energy further as a climate solution, emphasising that nuclear energy is expensive, and that spent nuclear fuels and waste are currently stored and not further dealt with. The Russian Social Ecological Union has also said that Rosatom and Russian authorities have put pressure on environmental activists, who have faced charges and persecution for anti-nuclear campaigns. Responding to these claims, a spokesperson for Rosatom says that ""Rosatom is open to dialogue and cooperation with different environmental organisations"", and that representatives of Russia's largest environmental organisations take part in Rosatom's Public Council. ""Nuclear energy is indispensable for achieving carbon neutral goals,"" Rosatom's spokesperson says, adding that technological solutions to process spent nuclear fuel and turn it into new fuel for nuclear power plants are ""at an advanced stage"" in Russia. They give the example of Rosatom's Proryv project, a fast neutron nuclear reactor and a facility to process the spent fuel will be built on the same site. After reprocessing, the spent fuel will be turned into fresh fuel, in a system intended to gradually become independent of external energy supplies. Nature's resources There are many other options besides nuclear for decarbonising Russia's economy. Kuznetsov says that Russia could become competitive in the production of other low carbon technologies, such as equipment for smart energy grids and new heating systems. Another avenue is agriculture. ""That's really been a remarkable story for anybody who remembers the state of agriculture in the Soviet period,"" says Gustafson. ""Right now, Russia is once again the world's largest exporter of wheat."" Total revenues were about $25bn (£19bn) in 2019, he adds, and Russia aims to increase that to $45bn (£34bn) by 2024 through agricultural reforms. ""That seems entirely realistic, or plausible at any rate,"" says Gustafson. Another option could be expanding into sustainable forestry and wood-based products, given its ample woodland resources. Russia is home to more than one-fifth of the world's forests (approximately 7.6 million sq km/2.9 million sq miles), and the country's boreal forests, known in Russia as the taiga, represent the largest forested region on Earth, at approximately 12 million sq km (4.5 million sq miles), larger than the Amazon. Russia is already an exporter of wood and wood products such as sawn wood and veneer sheets, though there has been criticism that these products are not sourced in a sustainable way. But sustainable wood-based packaging and textile materials could become an important new sector for the Russian economy, said Paola Deda, the director of forest, land and housing division at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, speaking during a forestry-themed event at COP26. Greenpeace Russia's Chuprov also sees the potential in sustainable forestry, including use of trees which grew on abandoned agricultural lands in the last decades, following the demise of the Soviet Union. According to Greenpeace estimates, since 1985 around 760,000 sq km (290,000 sq miles – an area larger than France) of former agricultural land suitable for forest growth has been abandoned in Russia for economic reasons. Much of this abandoned agricultural land (around 500,000 sq km/190,000 sq miles) could be used for diverse kinds of forestry, according to Greenpeace. Around 60% of that land is already overgrown with forests, but Greenpeace argues the remainder could be used to grow more trees. Forests growing on former agricultural land are one of the most important resources for the potential development of rural areas, through the creation of jobs and the sustainable production of economically valuable timber, according to a recent study published by a Paris-based think-tank Climate Chance, of which this reporter was also an author. They can also provide environmental benefits, such as increasing local resilience against natural disasters. Using planted forests for economic purposes might also help save intact primary (old-growth) forests from deforestation and unsustainable logging. With the world facing increasing global shortages of fresh water, forests, fish and arable land Russia's resources could provide a whole range of important ecosystem services, says Makarov, from biotechnologies and sustainable fish farming to responsible tourism to regenerative agriculture. Mining minerals needed for the development of renewable energy could also become a new source of wealth for Russia, he adds. To make all this possible, though, more changes are needed, says Nelya Rakhimova, coordinator of Coalition for Sustainable Development of Russia who led a civil society review of the implementation of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals in Russia in 2020. ""If Russia decides to follow the clean energy and economic transition, it will not be possible without the implementation of all aspects of sustainable development – economic, environmental and social."" To make the most of not just Russia's natural resources, but its people, ""we need fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and open courts"", says Rakhimova.   Rakhimova considers this a ""main barrier"" to the development of Russia. ""If we had an open dialogue with the state, if the basic rules for the adoption of laws and their implementation were in place, then the process of the energy transition itself and the formation of future Russia would be at a completely different stage,"" she says.   If one thing is certain, it is that if Russia is to adapt to the global trends in clean energy, new industries are going to have to take centre stage in its economy. With their experience of economic transformation based on natural resources, Russia's oil regions may soon find themselves with another role to play. ""Here in Khanty-Mansiysk, we need to develop a new economy, based on knowledge and science,"" says Tatiana Minayeva, a researcher at the Center of Wetlands Conservation and Restoration, at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Forest Science.

Yield Spread Analysis,How to save Louisiana from drowning,2024-09-14,2018-08-27,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180822-recycled-shells-of-louisiana-oyster-reef-protect-new-orleans,"From the boat, the salt marsh looks pristine: cloud-dotted sky, brown-blue water, gold-green grass. As we motor along the coast, a flock of egrets flutters into the air, startled by the only humans in sight. Later, I’m equally startled to see an alligator lazing in the shallows. It is easy, if you don’t know any better, to think that the world of the wetlands is simple, steadfast, still. That would be incorrect. A salt marsh is an exquisitely complex ecosystem. It is also a crucial one. In Louisiana, where wetlands make up one-third of the state by area, the landscape plays a pivotal role. These waving grasses along the Gulf of Mexico underpin Louisiana’s seafood industry, the country’s second-largest behind Alaska. They are home to key infrastructure, like the pipes that carry oil and gas from the largest US entry port for waterborne crude oil all the way up to Knoxville, Tennessee and Washington DC. And although the precise magnitude of their effect is still being debated, they are a natural barrier against storm surge, hurricanes and flooding. The wetlands at Biloxi Marsh – a web of bayous, brackish and salt lakes in south-east Louisiana that give way to Eloi Bay, Chandeleur Sound and, finally, to the Gulf of Mexico – help protect even New Orleans, 45 miles away. The salt marsh is also a landscape that is changing, fast. From 1932 to 2016 in Louisiana, on average, open water subsumed a chunk of wetlands the size of a football field every hour. It’s true that the rate of loss has slowed. A football field is now being swallowed every 100 minutes, rather than every 34 minutes, when it was at its peak. This is largely because there hasn’t been a major hurricane since 2008. It’s partly because of restoration activities. And there’s another reason, too. “In recent years it’s reached a slowdown, but that’s because the most vulnerable spots are already gone,” says Seth Blitch, director of coastal and marine conservation at the Nature Conservancy of Louisiana. The slowdown, however, isn’t guaranteed to continue. You might also like: • Miami’s fight against rising seas  • An ambitious plan to stop the land from sinking  • The country that brought a sea back to life The landscape here always has been changeable. But such enormity of land loss is new. Most of it is due to the Mississippi River levee. Since the levee’s construction in the 1930s, the state has lost one-quarter of its wetlands: just under 2,000 square miles (5,100sqkm). That’s the size of Delaware, or Trinidad and Tobago. If nothing changes, Louisiana will lose another 1,000 square miles (2,600sqkm) – that’s a Rhode Island or Luxembourg of land mass – by 2050. “My background is ecology, so it’s my first reaction to think about the wildlife habitat that we’re losing. But if you take a step back, this issue goes way beyond that,” says Deb Abibou, restoration programmes director at the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (CRCL). “The struggle that we’re facing down here doesn’t just mean ‘Oh, we have less land for our houses.’ “It means that we are losing the natural resources that we depend on for our seafood, for our recreation, for our industries, and for our protection of inland communities.” Some 45 minutes after leaving Hopedale Marina, we pull up to a strip of flat grassy marsh. It looks like the rest of the coastline we’ve seen for the last few miles, with two differences. First, a handful of white PVC poles punctuate the area where the mud meets water. Second, and visible only because we’ve come at low tide, a black border surrounds the marshland, about 20 feet offshore, like a fortification edging a moat. Just how effective that fortification is what the team is here to test. Wearing waterproofs and rubber boots, the CRCL’s Christa Russell and Jenny Wolff jump out of the boat, unspooling a measuring tape from one white stick in the grass to one in the water. The one in the water used to be on land, too: now, it’s about two and a half feet off. The land has crumbled away entirely. But the rate at which it has crumbled is good news. “There’s still land loss,” says Blitch as we bob on the boat, watching a mud-spattered Wolff and Russell pick their way through the grass back to us. “But it’s way slower.” Several months of data-gathering later, Russell presents the first year’s worth of findings in a New Orleans conference room. The four protected sites lost an average 0.81m of land. At the four control sites, the coastline lost 1.54m. It is still early days. But so far, their project has halved the rate of erosion. The protection comes from that black ‘wall’ running around the shoreline. But while many man-made seawalls are concrete or rock, this one, about a half mile (0.8km) long in total, is different: it is made up entirely of oyster shells. * Finished in November 2016, the reef – the first built by the CRCL and The Nature Conservancy in Louisiana – was a massive project. The 1.7 million pounds (771,000kg) of shell used were contributed by 26 local restaurants, including a dozen in New Orleans. This isn’t the world’s only oyster shell recycling programme; there are similar projects in Texas, New York, San Francisco and the Chesapeake Bay, as well as in Australia. But given the number of oysters that are shucked around the world, these programmes are relatively few. “In earlier times, when fishermen and their buyers had a closer relationship, the restaurants would give the shell back to their fishermen. There are maybe one or two restaurants that still do that today,” says Abibou. “At shucking houses, there’s usually an end product for the shell: it’ll get ground to chicken feed or used as pavement. But at New Orleans restaurants, for the most part, they were throwing them into the landfill.” Russell, who is CRCL’s coastal scientist, puts it more bluntly. “Usually, we are taking shell out of the water and not putting it back, which is ridiculous,” she says. After being collected, the shells were left in the sun for six months to cure, getting bleached free of food particles and bacteria. More than 300 volunteers organised them into 434 ‘baskets’. Each measures 3ft by 3ft by 6ft (1m by 1m by 2m) and weighs 4,000 pounds (1,815kg). They were seeded with the oyster larvae known as spat. And then, finally, the shells came, via barges, to their new home in the marsh. The process may be more difficult than pouring concrete or laying granite. But it was key. “A flat expanse of concrete does not do the same things for an ecosystem that this does,” Russell tells me. She rattles off the reasons why. By being in the water the shells are, obviously, not in a landfill. The nooks and crannies of oyster shells provide extra surface area, absorbing wave energy and buffering the coastline more than a flat structure. They also offer protection to smaller sea creatures. And the shells allow water, bacteria and algae to flow through them – crucial for the marshes, which use the tidal flow to ‘breathe’. Seeded with spat before they’re built, the oyster reefs also encourage other oysters to grow. In the last year, the spat has become 286 individual live oysters: not much, but something. And expected to multiply. One benefit of having live oysters is that the reefs then grow vertically – and can do so faster than sea level is expected to rise. Another benefit is water filtration. Each tiny creature can clean an impressive 50 gallons a day, making them the ocean’s most effective water filters. They also capture and store nitrogen and phosphorus. All of this is particularly helpful here in the largest estuary system in the US. For 7,000 years, the Mississippi River moved freely. It swept sediment along with it, and as that sediment built up the river would re-route, finding a different path to the Gulf of Mexico. But when the river was leveed, it stayed static. Instead of being deposited in the estuary, all of the sediment now washes out to the Gulf. This means that as the land naturally subsides, as the soft sediment of an estuary does, it is no longer replenished – the main reason for that Delaware-sized disappearance into the Gulf. And the irony is that, although the levee was built to protect communities and industry from the mighty Mississippi, now it is having the opposite effect. The more marsh is lost, the less protection Louisiana’s residents have against floods, storms and sea level rise. For the two-thirds of residents who live near the coast, this can be particularly deadly. Abibou frames it in terms of lines of defence. “At the furthest end, you have your barrier islands as the first buffer. Then you have various types of marshes and coastal forest,” she says. “If you remove all of the natural infrastructure from that, then it’s the sea against our manmade concrete. And nature’s going to win.” The levee also means that the water in the Gulf is turbid and muddy. And that the pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus, staples of agriculture, are increasingly being carried from across the US into the Gulf. The mud and toxins create uninhabitable ‘dead zones’. Fewer plants grow. Fewer roots hold soil together. And so more land is lost. Animals are affected, too: “Submerged aquatic vegetation and algae can’t get access to light in the same way when the water is really muddy like that,” says Russell. “So they don’t grow the same way – which means the species that depend on them go elsewhere.” Oyster reefs help with all of this. So do wetlands. In terms of what the same process would cost with a treatment plant, a single acre soaks up anywhere from $35,000 to $150,000 (£27,000 to £116,000) of pollutants before they get to the Gulf. But the world is losing oyster reefs even more rapidly than it is losing marshland. We have lost between 64% and 71% of the world’s wetlands since 1900. Globally, 85% of natural oyster reefs either have been lost or severely depleted due to overharvesting, disease, pollution and declining habitats. In the Gulf, the numbers are a little better: between 50% and 89% of wild reefs have been lost. * Against this backdrop, building oyster reefs to buffer Louisiana’s wetlands, instead of laying seawalls made of concrete or granite or (more likely still) of doing nothing, no longer seems like an unwieldy undertaking. Instead, as a solution, it seems elegant. Nature usually is. The data has borne this out. One study determined that a hectare of oyster reef was worth up to $99,000 (£77,000) per year in terms of benefits like the habitat it provided for other fish and its effect on water quality – not including the value of those oysters being harvested. In terms of flood and storm protection alone, an oyster reef provides more value for money than even levees or dykes. In April 2018, a team of scientists published a cost-benefit analysis of projects being done across the Gulf, from building dykes to restoring barrier islands. Costs of construction and maintenance were weighed against the effectiveness of flood and storm protection – calculated using economic models developed by reinsurance company Swiss Re with its partners. (Read more about how the financial industry is developing tools to calculate the risk of climate change and what that could mean for climate resilience projects). The findings were stark. Anything with a benefit-to-cost ratio above one is, of course, seen as cost-effective. In terms of reducing risk alone, dykes and levees had a benefit-to-cost ratio of 0.26; beach replenishment in the western Gulf, 0.28. Restoring oyster reefs (7.34) was calculated to be 28 times more beneficial. And restoring wetlands? Thirty-three times more (8.72). The only project with a higher benefit-to-cost ratio was sandbags – but only because of how cheap they were. In terms of overall risk reduction, the benefit was low. As Abibou puts it: “We can’t just build levees and hide behind them. We need to have a healthy marsh and healthy wetlands to provide us with adequate risk reduction.” Then there is the value of the fishing industry in general. Oyster reefs like this one aren’t built to be harvested, of course. But by bolstering the ecosystem, they help. Across the US, about 75% of marketable fish and bivalves rely on salt marshes to survive. In Louisiana, they’re the foundation of the most productive commercial fishing industry of the lower 48 states. Louisiana lands 1.2 billion pounds (544m kg) of fish annually. The next state, Washington, lands 552 million (250m kg). Louisiana’s oysters alone make up one-third of the US oyster industry, crabs one-quarter. It lands more shrimp than Texas, Alabama and Florida put together. If the wetlands were to continue to disappear, if the Gulf were to become a mud- and toxin-logged swamp, it’s reasonable to think that that industry would vanish, too. That would wipe out more than 160,000 fishing jobs alone – never mind the knock-on effect to the food, restaurant and tourism industries. * Often lost in the discussion of economic impacts, of what something like erosion or climate change means for humans, is how this kind of habitat has value all on its own. Non-locals may not recognise the names of the grasses that trip off the tongue: hog cane and three-square, saltgrass and glasswort, cordgrass and black rush. But they are strange, special, of value in their own right. Unusually tenacious, they grow out of the low-oxygen sodden soil towards the sunlight. They survive by the tide. When they’re submerged, the ocean brings nutrients and cleans out decay and allows fish to hide and spawn in safety. The ecosystem nurtures a long list of creatures.The grasses support dozens of fungi and bacteria and more than 80 species of spiders and insects. These feed crabs and shrimps and oysters and speckled trout and black drum and sea turtles and flounder, which feed herons and egrets and spoonbills and wood storks and seaside sparrows and marsh wrens, which help spread the seed for grass. Nutria hide here, and rabbits, and snipe, and ducks. Alligators, too. Losing the coast risks losing them all. We want to put dollar signs on all of it. That’s particularly true before deciding if something is worth saving. And particularly now, with not only industry statistics but with newly sophisticated models for measuring the financial risk of events like coastal erosion and flooding, we can. But that’s only part of the story. The other part is what surrounds us as we head back towards the mainland: egrets fluttering, fish swirling, alligators stalking, grasses waving – and perhaps little oysters moving below us with the tide, searching for a new reef to settle on and thrive.

Yield Spread Analysis,Maeda treble helps 'uncomfortable' Celtic beat Livi,2024-09-14,2024-03-09,Clive Lindsay,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68460886,"Daizen Maeda headed his own - and Celtic's - second goal Holders Celtic were given an almighty fright by Livingston before reaching their ninth Scottish Cup semi-final in 10 years, with manager Brendan Rodgers conceding he ""wasn't comfortable"" until two late goals. Daizen Maeda completed his hat-trick before Kyogo Furuhashi made the scoreline more convincing. Celtic were looking to recover from last weekend's league defeat by Hearts and Rodgers admitted ""today, we didn't play well, but we won and that makes me very happy"". Indeed, the Premiership's bottom side threatened another shock as they twice came from behind to level in search of their first-ever win at Celtic Park. Daniel MacKay's fine finish was sandwiched between two Maeda goals within an action-packed opening 22 minutes. Tete Yengi superbly fired Livingston level again 10 minutes after the break, but Celtic's Japanese forward was on hand to ease home nerves as extra-time loomed before his international colleague added the final flourish. Follow Celtic news on BBC Scotland Latest Livingston updates on BBC The talk just before kick-off was more about who was not in the respective starting line-ups rather than who was playing. Livingston boss David Martindale admitted he was depressing himself explaining why he had made five, mainly forced, changes but saw a chink of light in the absence of Callum McGregor and Cameron Carter-Vickers. It looked like any optimism would be misplaced when Celtic forged ahead after only seven minutes. Nicolas Kuhn, handed a start in place of the suspended Yang Hyun-jun, turned in from the touchline and delivered a superb ball behind the visiting defence and fellow winger Maeda provided the clinical finish. Seven minutes gone and a long day for Livi looked in prospect, but they were soon level when MacKay was found by a long ball and the on-loan Hibernian midfielder thumped it high past goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, hesitancy as they tried to clear their penalty box meant the visitors were only level for another 10 minutes. Matt O'Riley pounced to fire a shot off the legs of McGovern and, although the veteran goalkeeper did well to deny the midfielder, he was unable to get enough on Maeda's diving header on the rebound to deny the Japanese international. Yengi had already headed just wide before the former Ipswich Town forward pounced on lost Celtic possession, turned O'Riley inside out, and fired superbly into the far corner. Celtic looked shaken and were thankful for Hart's legs as Michael Nottingham's header was cleared off the line. At the other end, McGovern was performing heroics of his own to thwart Celtic until two substitutes made the difference - James Forrest setting up Maeda for his fourth and Kyogo slotting in the killer fourth. There were a few candidates - Livingston goalkeeper McGovern, goalscoring team-mate Yengi and Celtic's Kuhn - but how can you ignore anyone scoring a hat-trick and coming close to scoring more? Maeda it is. The pressure was back on Rodgers and his side after they fell short when given the opportunity to go back to the top of the Premiership last weekend. Defeat by Hearts was compounded by the loss of captain McGregor and Carter-Vickers through injury and their leadership was clearly missing. Rodgers' side enjoyed their traditional lions' share of possession, but they looked vulnerable at the back before their superior resources off the bench proved the difference and kept them in the hunt to lift the cup for a 42nd time. The Northern Irishman suggested that Celtic, more than any other team in the country, are expected to not only win but also put in a show, but on this occasion he will simply be pleased to have made it 15 wins in 15 Scottish Cup ties as the club's manager. Martindale had bemoaned his need to field a ""makeshift"" midfield such were Livingston's absences, but he has made his name from making the most of the players at his disposal - and so it was again. They will be disappointed to exit the cup considering they came close to going ahead at 2-2, but the league remains their priority. Martindale has found a bit of a gem in Yengi and the big striker could yet be the difference between staying up and going down as the West Lothian side look to show similar battling qualities and clinical finishing in the Premiership run-in. This video can not be played Celtic 'gave Livingston too many possibilities' Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: ""We got ourselves into the semi-final and you can see the players we had missing and the difference that makes. We gave them too many possibilities and the centre-halves need to be higher up the pitch. ""But you've still got to show that mentality and that drive and that ambition to keep wanting to get there.  ""Also a big credit to Livingston because it's been a really difficult year for David and his team, but they came here and they fought and made us work right to the very end to get to the semi-final."" Livingston manager David Martindale: ""It was a good game, but it was disappointing at the same time because I thought we had a wee opportunity. ""We get sucker-punched into the third goal. Fourth goal, I'm not really too fussed about. We just threw caution to the wind.  ""It's probably one of the few occasions we've come here and we've genuinely been in the game."" Second-top Celtic host St Johnstone next Saturday in the Scottish Premiership (15:00 GMT) at the same time bottom-of-the-table Livingston visit Hibernian."
Yield Spread Analysis,Ruthless St Mirren pick up rare away win at Aberdeen,2024-09-14,2023-12-30,Andrew Petrie,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67809532,"Mark O'Hara has struggled for form this year but put in an improved showing against Aberdeen St Mirren picked up a rare away win at an unhappy Pittodrie as they beat Aberdeen in wicked conditions to win in the Scottish Premiership.  Mark O'Hara rifled in from close range after 12 minutes, before missing a penalty that would have made the game far more comfortable for the Paisley side. It didn't matter in the end, as Jonah Ayunga and Greg Kiltie scored late on, the latter from the spot, to make it a comfortable victory for Stephen Robinson's side. The win ends a dreadful away run St Mirren, who had lost their last six on the road and not won on their travels since mid-September. They stay fifth, while Aberdeen drop to ninth, albeit with games in hand. Keep up to date with Aberdeen The latest St Mirren news It's been three days since St Mirren played and 10 since Aberdeen took the field. The hosts started brightly, invigorated by the rest, but their confidence was soon rocked when O'Hara scored the first. The visitors' first attack saw Mikael Mandron's shot blocked at close range, before O'Hara raced in and lashed the ball goalward via a deflection off Slobodan Rubezic. O'Hara's missed penalty was a shock. Usually reliable from the spot, he was given a chance when Lewis Jamieson's shot hit Richard Jensen's hand. The St Mirren captain skipped and stuttered, and rolled his effort two yards wide. Despite that reprieve, the Pittodrie crowd booed, unhappy with the fare offered up. Their side reacted, forcing a few good saves from Hemming, but the fans would still jeer the hosts off at half-time. The weather worsened considerably in the second-half. The rain lashed down, the wind swirled around and St Mirren soaked up the pressure like a sponge. Corner after corner was whipped in, Aberdeen edged closer and closer, but there was no way through the visiting rearguard. They were punished for their profligacy when Scott Tanser whipped a delightful ball to the back post, where Jonah Ayunga made the most of the conditions to slide and divert the ball in. It would get worse for the remaining Aberdeen fans. Stefan Gartenmann brought down Toyosi Olusanya in the box and, after a VAR check, Kiltie slotted away the penalty. Aberdeen had plenty of chances but they rarely looked like beating the on-loan Middlesbrough goalkeeper The Pittodrie crowd made their feelings clear at the end of either half. This was a disastrous way to end 2023. They played more passes, sent in more crosses, than they have in any game this season. Despite that, they could not find a route to goal for the ninth time this season. To make matters worse, the defence looked vulnerable and frail, easily undone by St Mirren who scored with the majority of their chances. Remember, this is a St Mirren side who hadn't scored in their last three, and yet they were full of confidence and swagger every time they went forward. The bigger picture looks a little bleak for Barry Robson. He's under pressure, having been beaten comfortably at home. He needs wins quickly. Aberdeen manager Barry Robson: ""That is nowhere near the standard I expect. I've told the players that. They understand that. The message was clear. We were short all over the pitch, it wasn't good enough. ""We looked off it. We looked slow. We didn't win first or second balls and I'm angry. It's not often I'm angry with them. They need to come back fighting and perform for the fans."" St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: ""It's been coming, we've put those kind of performances in in the last six games and not had our rewards. We took our chances when they came, we were really disciplined defensively. ""The big difference for me was how we defended set plays really well. Aberdeen are a big threat, they have a super delivery from Leighton Clarkson but our organisation was fantastic."" Aberdeen are away to Ross County on Tuesday 2 January (15:00 GMT), while St Mirren host Celtic on the same day (17:00). BBC Sport Scottish Football SPFL"
Yield Spread Analysis,Ukraine round-up: Taking stock of the war,2024-09-14,2022-04-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61043817,"At least 50 people, including women and children, have been killed when rockets hit a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, where thousands were preparing to flee ahead of an expected major Russian offensive. Ukraine accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians, but Russia denied it was behind the attack - instead saying that Kyiv was responsible. US President Joe Biden - like a number of other Western leaders - put the blame squarely on Russia, accusing it of committing a ""horrific atrocity"". Meanwhile, the UK said it was sending more anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. And Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, visited the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, where bodies of civilians were found lying in the streets after Russia's withdrawal. ""We have seen the cruel face of Putin's army,"" she said. Let's start this summary with that attack at Kramatorsk. The railway station was hit at about 10:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Friday, Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko told the BBC. He added this happened as the crowds were ""waiting for the first train"" to be evacuated to safer regions in central and western Ukraine. Oleksandr Kamyshyn, who heads Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia state railway company, said two rockets struck the area. Meanwhile, Nathan Mook, an aid worker who saw people crowding at the station, counted between five and 10 explosions: ""Two minutes after we had driven by, you feel it before you hear it: the boom, the explosion."" Ukraine's prosecutor general's office later said that nearly 4,000 people - mainly women and children - were at the station at the time. Both Ukraine and Russia said Tochka-U missiles - which are known to be extremely inaccurate - were used. On Day 44 of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen took stock of the key battlefield events so far. Predictions at the start of a quick Russian victory have been upended by the Ukrainians' willingness to fight, he says, but the war is settling into a long struggle that could still endanger the wider world. It is ironic that one of Russia President Vladimir Putin's arguments for Ukraine to be in Russia's orbit is that it is not a proper country. His own actions, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's well-judged messages as he leads a remarkable feat of mobilisation, are sharpening the national identity of Ukrainians. Russia suffered a serious defeat around Kyiv and had to pull back. But it has not lost the war, and is grinding out territorial gains in the east and south. Read Jeremy's article in full here Civilians who have managed to flee Mariupol in recent days have described to the BBC's Tom Bateman the increasingly desperate situation inside the besieged city, including accounts of bodies buried in shallow graves, looting by Chechen fighters, and starving residents being killed when they ventured out of shelters to find water. The evacuees' accounts are emerging as they reach the town of Zaporizhzhia, which is acting as a hub for refugees. They have risked journeys through Russian and Ukrainian lines that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) describes as an evacuation ""from hell"". Waiting inside one aid facility was Yuliia, her two daughters and her mother Tatiana. They finally managed to escape the city on Monday. ""There are starving people,"" said Yuliia, who spoke to the BBC on condition that her surname was not used, a frequent request from residents still concerned about their safety. ""People are having mental breakdowns. There is a woman we knew who hanged herself. People are being buried in the streets."" Read evacuees' harrowing accounts in full here The Ukraine war led to a ""giant leap"" in food prices last month to another record high, the UN says. The war has cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil - which means the costs of alternatives have also climbed. Ukraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat, which have risen sharply in price, too. The UN said ""war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils"". The UN Food Prices Index tracks the world's most-traded food commodities measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar. Food prices are at their highest since records began 60 years ago according to the index, which jumped nearly 13% in March, following February's record high. Pink Floyd have reunited to record their first new material in 28 years - a protest song against the Ukraine war. Hey Hey, Rise Up! features David Gilmour and Nick Mason alongside long-time Floyd bassist Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on keyboards. But the song is built around a spine-tingling refrain from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band Boombox. Gilmour says the song is a show of ""anger at a superpower invading a peaceful nation"". But it is also intended as a morale booster for the people of Ukraine, and a call ""for peace""."
Yield Spread Analysis,Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?,2024-09-14,2020-04-23,Steve Duffy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-52380643,"What can statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales? Here we assess some of the figures showing the pandemic over its peak years and also give some of the remaining indicators as they stood in May 2024. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in May 2023 that Covid-19 was no longer a global health emergency, but said it did not mean the danger was over. In Wales, while some hospital and mortality data was still being published in autumn 2024, other surveillance measures had been scaled back or discontinued. There was a peak in people testing positive for Covid in hospitals in late January 2024 and numbers then settled into a pattern of rising and falling. Other indicators around waste water monitoring and people contacting their GPs last winter showed lower levels than the same period the year before. Mortality figures involving Covid in the eight months to the end of August 2024 were about 60% of the total we saw in the same period of 2023 - about 13 deaths a week compared with 22 deaths a week.  Digital Health and Care Wales stopped its weekly Covid snapshot figures in the summer of 2023, although Public Health Wales (PHW) was still publishing some hospital and testing data in autumn 2024. Positive tests for Covid appear to follow a more cyclical pattern than flu or other winter viruses, which show a seasonal peak. Numbers of inpatients with Covid started to drop again by early February 2024 but followed a rising and falling pattern in the next few months. There were 192 in-patients testing positive for Covid, including 15 patients in critical care in the week ending 8 September. We might expect to see more elderly people in hospital and around half of those testing positive for Covid were over 80 and 89% were over 60. We no longer know how many of these patients are being treated primarily for Covid or happen to be incidentally testing positive while in hospital for other things. PHW was still publishing weekly data on patients who test positive for Covid in hospitals - and where they were likely to have acquired it. There were 91 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 8 September. Figures showed ""probably"" or ""definitely"" hospital-acquired infections in patients made up 59% of those with Covid in beds, compared with those patients who came with Covid or the origin cannot be determined.  Hospital-acquired infections stood at 54. There have been nearly 25,000 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic.  The issue of patients catching Covid while in hospital was a particularly acute feature during the early days of the pandemic, when there was no vaccine. The pattern of acute respiratory infections over the past two winters suggest seasonal peaks for flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). But Covid infections among those in hospital show more of an undulating pattern over the course of the year. The peaks were not as high in the winter of 2023-24 as they were in the previous winter. RSV had started to rise amongst mostly young children to very high intensity levels but dropped back.  Flu cases in the community rose in early February but only to low intensity before falling back. Patients testing positive for flu in hospital fell from mid-February. Health officials kept a close eye on Covid over the winter period in 2023-24, in case it added to pressures on the NHS with more seasonal viruses. This winter, there was a realistic worst scenario of just under 1,200 Covid patients in late December and a ""most likely"" of 620 patients in the early modelling from Welsh government scientists. The actual figures in late December were close to the optimistic scenario - 380 patients - but moved closer to the worst-case scenario at the end of the first week of 2024. For about half the winter period, the actual number of patients testing positive for Covid was greater than the most likely scenario. By the end of March, it was below the most likely and optimistic scenarios. In winter 2022-23, the peak when it came in late December reached about 650 patients, three weeks after the modelled peak for a reasonable worst scenario of 1,800 patients. The actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests by the end of the modelling period in March 2023 was tracking with the ""most likely"" scenario after following a more undulating pattern, which had taken it closer to the ""optimistic"" scenario at one point. Another snapshot of how Covid and other viruses are present is sample tests from up to 1,500 patients attending hospital each week. These tests are for a range of respiratory viruses and showed around 13% testing positive for Covid at the winter peak in mid-January and 16% for flu when it peaked in early February. By the end of June, fewer than 2% were testing for flu but 18% were for Covid on these random tests - the highest proportion since the previous October. This is separate from testing for Covid or flu only or those showing symptoms. The rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and had fallen back to extremely low levels, around one or two per 100,000 in the first quarter of 2024.  Another measure had been analysing samples of waste water, which was re-started for the winter of 2023/24. Early results showed samples indicating presence of Covid were not close to to the levels seen in the autumn and winter of 2022-23, reflecting indicators elsewhere. Surveillance involving testing for infection of blood donors was also stopped at the same time. Wales did not join a scaled-down relaunch of the long-running ONS swab survey, which had been discontinued in early 2023. The number of people who have died with Covid as a contributory factor had reached 12,902 in Wales by the end of August 2024. Deaths in 2023 ran at around half the number we saw in 2022. In the most recent week, up 30 August, 10 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it mentioned on their death certificate, according to the ONS. Six of these deaths had Covid as the underlying cause of death.   Up to 30 August 2024, there had been around 10,476 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death. ONS also now records so-called ""expected deaths"". This is a change from a previous ""excess deaths "" approach, which looked at an average for deaths from all causes across five non-pandemic years. This now adjusts for population changes and age trends and so it has revised down estimates we saw under the previous method. So between January 2020 and August 2024, there had been around 7,000 more deaths than we might have expected to see. During 2020, there were around 3,216 more deaths than expected - compared to around 3,500 when measured as ""excess deaths"". Over the eight months to late August 2024, deaths have been running below expected levels in all but 12 weeks. There were 508 deaths from all causes - 108 fewer than we might expect to see in week ending 30 August2024. Covid accounted for 1.3% of all deaths in Wales in the first eight months of 2024. Nearly a fifth (17%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes. The first occurred in Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly in the last week of March 2020 and eventually totalled around 1,650 Covid deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic. There were 16 deaths involving Covid among care home residents registered between January and late August 2024.  Care Inspectorate Wales reported that deaths peaked in May 2020 and before it stopped publishing data it was notified of 2,339 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid up to the end of June 2023. There were 726 deaths above the five-year average in care homes in Wales in April 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. There were also high numbers of excess deaths in the winter of 2020-21, when the vaccination programme was only just starting. Altogether, in the three-year period from January 2020 there were nearly 1,500 excess deaths in care homes in Wales. ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021 found mortality rates lower in Wales in male residents than in England or any English region. The same occurred in 2022. The two peaks for Covid deaths in care homes came in weeks in April 2020 (125 deaths) and January 2021 (129 deaths). Covid was the second leading cause of death in care home residents after dementia in 2021, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths. In 2022, Covid dropped to being the fifth leading cause of death in care home residents in 2022, accounting for 4.5% of deaths. Meanwhile, up to the end of February 2022, 120 people working in health and social care in Wales had died, with Covid a factor. Of these, 62 were care workers and 58 worked for the health service. There were nearly twice as many deaths due to flu and pneumonia in Wales than due to Covid in 2023. There have been more Covid than flu deaths in only three weeks over the last year and four times as many flu deaths than Covid deaths in 2024 up to the start of May. Covid-19 was the 32nd leading cause of death in Wales in July 2023, after being the 19th leading cause in June. This was the lowest ranking as cause of death for two years and the third lowest since the pandemic began. It was behind accidental poisoning and appendicitis. Monthly mortality analysis - which was also discontinued at the end of July - showed there were 21 deaths due to Covid in July 2023 - 0.8% of all registered deaths.  Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 29 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 1.1% of all deaths registered in July. Heart disease was again the leading cause of death in July 2023 in Wales.  Flu and pneumonia again ranked sixth but below normal levels.  Covid was the leading cause of death at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and then the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease in 2021. It was the seventh leading cause of death in 2022, with a mortality rate of 38.5 deaths per 100,000. It was the sixth leading cause of death in men in 2022 (4%) and fifth leading cause in men over 80 (5.1%) but did not feature as a leading cause of death in women. Up to the end of July 2023, heart disease was the leading cause of death - although still below average - and Covid was the ninth leading cause.  Across England and Wales in the whole of 2023, deaths due to Covid were 2% of all cause deaths. This compared to 4.2% from flu and pneumonia Heart disease ranked as the leading cause of death for 2022 and in England and Wales it was dementia and Alzheimer's disease in 2023, closely followed by heart disease.  Analysis of mortality from the start of the pandemic until the end of July 2023 shows the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is slightly higher in Wales (102.2 deaths per 100,000), than England on 101.5 deaths per 100,000. Scotland (9.56) and Northern Ireland (93.2) are both lower in the 41 months to the end of July. The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales. It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England. When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales. Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 70% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in 2023.  It has been as high as 94% and on average since the outbreak of the pandemic until the end of August 2024, 82% of deaths with Covid on death certificates could be said to be due to Covid. So, there had been around 10,429 deaths due to Covid by 30 August 2024 in Wales. Covid has been ""suspected"" by doctors in around 4% of cases.  A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution.  Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and Merthyr Tydfil had the highest crude mortality rates over the course of the pandemic in Wales. By 29 December 2023, RCT had reached a total of 1,235 deaths, with the highest crude mortality rate - 516.7 deaths per 100,000. This was the seventh highest crude mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales. Deaths involving Covid can also be shown to be hitting people living in deprived areas, usually associated with poorer health, harder than in the least deprived areas of Wales. When deaths from Covid as the underlying cause and adjusted for age are looked at, then Rhondda Cynon Taf, Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr had the highest mortality rates in 2020. Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate in 2021, including the peak of the pandemic's second wave. Conwy had a relatively higher mortality rate in the third year of the pandemic.  Six of RCT's communities were in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further. At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 127 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the three years of the pandemic up to the end of July 2023.  This is the highest in Wales, the lowest being 55.5 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 84.3. For 2023, Conwy, Bridgend and Powys had the highest Covid mortality rates in Wales, based on the sizes of their populations. The community with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West (RCT) with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid. This was followed by Sandfields in Neath Port Talbot and Porth East and Ynyshir in RCT (55 deaths each), by the end of 2021. When translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Gwersyllt West and Summerhill in Wrexham was the highest at 742.6 deaths per 100,000 - or 44 deaths over the two years. This was followed by Tonyrefail West, Port Talbot East and Llanelli Bigyn in Carmarthenshire. All communities of Wales have now had at least two deaths during the pandemic. The lowest number of deaths at a community level were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llansanffraid Glan Conwy. At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales. In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000; this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales. The first wave of the pandemic brought early clusters of deaths in the old Gwent valleys, around Pontnewydd and Upper Cwmbran, Cross Keys and Ebbw Vale, followed by Tonyrefail East in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llanberis in Gwynedd also had early clusters in north Wales, according to data analysis. These were adjusted for age or deprivation and so other factors such as travel patterns or occupations may have come into play to explain the spread of infection. The highest rate by the end of March - a few days after lockdown - was around Caerphilly and the valleys to the north and was more than 11 times what would be expected compared with the whole of Wales. By mid-April, higher mortality rates had spread to Welsh border counties and expanded into Cardiff and Swansea and other valleys areas. By the end of the first wave, the only clusters of higher mortality were showing in parts of north Wales.  ONS said there was higher mortality in more deprived areas of south east Wales, but consistently high mortality was also seen in some rural areas after accounting for known risk factors. There are figures to compare relative excess deaths in different European countries. Bulgaria has the highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate - 18.2% higher than normal - and Norway the lowest, 4.1% below average. Wales was 3.7% above average in June 2021 and then 2.1% above average in July 2022 - ranked 21st out of 33 nations. For those aged under 65, Wales was 4.8% above average (ranked 12th) and 1.5% above average (joint 24th) in the over-65s. Wales also saw excess mortality in more than half of weeks over the period. Covid vaccinations passed the 10m mark as the spring 2024 booster programme progressed in April 2024. The autumn-winter booster programme reached more than 742,500 people in 2023-24. That included nearly three quarters of over 65s and 85% of care home residents. Numbers of NHS staff who took up offers of a vaccine booster was down on earlier stages of the programme. Just over half of all those eligible across different groups had taken up the offer, perhaps reflecting numbers who felt they had immunity from having had the virus more than once. The 2024 spring programme - targeting mainly the over 75s - reached 147,481 doses by early May. Analysis of vaccine uptake has consistently found gaps between people living in deprived areas and also people from black, Asian and mixed groups.  The offers of the primary course of vaccine to anyone over five, available since December 2020, ended in June 2023.  The dominant variant in Wales has been Omicron for more than two years and 357 positive test results had been sequenced in the month ending 21 May 2024. Because of the ending of mass testing in April 2022, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more. Nearly all of those analysed in the last month have been the JN.1 sub-variant. From summer 2020, the ONS organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which latterly saw people being sent test kits by post. It became the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing in March 2022. By this measure, infections were estimated to have peaked in Wales in April 2022 with 232,000 (around 8%) estimated to be affected. However, the survey was ""paused"" at the end of March 2023, as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) worked to confirm a surveillance approach which was ""proportionate and cost effective"" to living with Covid. The health minister expressed her ""deep disappointment and concern"" about the ""loss of this important source of surveillance"". and the break in data gathering at a time infections were still being recorded in Wales. But the Welsh government decided not to re-join a scaled-down version of the survey, which was relaunched in winter 2023, testing around 29,000 people. This suggested 2.7% of people in England and Scotland had Covid in the week ending 3 January 2024. Data from the infection survey, before it was wound up, also suggested 94.6% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection. The estimate was 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies in February 2023. At the higher threshold, 79.5% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and nearly three quarters in those aged 16 to 24 and 92.3% of the 75-79 age group. A test of blood donors in Wales found more than 80% prevalence of the N antibody, indicating a natural infection from having Covid, and a 99.9% prevalence of the S antibody from either infection or having had the Covid vaccine.  The number of people who were reporting they had long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected in early March 2023 was estimated to be around 57,000. This was just under 2% of the population who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid. A total of 94,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, 24% said it had ""a lot"" of impact on their daily lives and 52% said it had little impact. An estimated 3.14% of people in Wales reported having long Covid - this was slightly less than in Scotland and the West Midlands and north west and north east of England. Just under 2% reported long Covid after a year - fewer than England and most of its regions and Scotland. Two thirds in Wales reporting long Covid said they had symptoms of weakness and tiredness and more than half a shortness of breath. Nearly half had muscle ache. This data set has now been curtailed, with the end of the ONS infection survey. A separate survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50. Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks. Fatigue, ""brain fog"" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate that potentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid. In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid. But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales. This analysis was used to develop a ""social cost"" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic. With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from £21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to £5,769 per case by January 2022. Of this, more than £4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid. The first Welsh patient to be admitted to a hospital with Covid was on 2 March 2020. Waves of the pandemic saw dozens of patients in critical care with Covid.  This reached 164 patients at the first wave peak in April 2020, while the second wave peak in January peaked at 150 patients. As the vaccination programme kicked in, there were only 40 patients at the winter peak of 2021-22 and then 24 patients with Covid in critical care at the peak of winter 2022-23. For the final Digital Health and Care Wales figures, there were five patients in critical care with Covid on 12 July 2023, with one of those recovering from Covid. A long-running study of more than 500 Welsh critical care patients with Covid gave insights into the virus. The mortality rate was about 34%, including those who died later on a general ward. About 63% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived were spending less time in critical care - an average of seven days - than early in the pandemic.  Around 60% of patients had been admitted to critical care with Covid the primary reason for treatment. The average age of those admitted in 2022-23 was 58, and just over half were men. Half were from more deprived parts of Wales. About 26% were under 50. At its peaks, there were between 120 and 140 admissions a day on average to hospitals for patients with Covid. By the time Digital Health and Care Wales halted their data gathering, there were five admissions of people testing positive for Covid on 12 July 2023, with numbers in single figures for the previous three months. Figures had been low and, for the first time since the pandemic began, no Covid admissions were recorded on 24 January 2023. The previous low had been just one admission on two days in May and June 2022. Over 18 months from the start of 2022, hospitals in Wales were asked to track how many of their patients testing positively for Covid were actually being primarily treated for it. Over this period, 13% of patients on average with Covid were being actively or primarily treated for it.   There were some differences between health boards over definitions so care needs to be taken in how we interpret this. But since the autumn of 2022, the proportion of ""active"" Covid cases was usually in single figures. The Icnarc intensive care study has found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus during 2022 (41%), compared with the period before (nearly 86%). The mortality rate was 31% for those with ""primary"" Covid, compared with 25% for those with incidental Covid. In the autumn of 2020, a series of local lockdowns - which began in Caerphilly in early September 2020 - were introduced to try to stop a rise in cases. These eventually covered most local authority areas in Wales but only had a short term impact. This measure was followed by a Wales-wide ""firebreak"" lockdown on 23 October 2020.  The case rate then rose to a second wave peak in winter 2020. When we look at infections at a community level, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas. This is noticeable when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes. At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate - the number of positive results from all PCR tests taken - reached 51.6%. Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest. Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high. There was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021. Between January and March 2022 there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive.  In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results in winter 2021-22. Nearly 8.9 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out since the start of the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020. For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020.  This ended at the start of April 2022, although it is still taking place in hospitals and also for some vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes. There are around 2,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, about half in the over 60s. This compares to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak. Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes.  Testing that was processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place. There have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy. Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020. Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow tests will only be provided in limited circumstances. School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded.  We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid. Absenteeism for any reason continued to rise, including those persistently absent. The percentage of secondary school pupils who were persistently absent had tripled to 16.3% from 2018-19 - the last full academic year before Covid - and 2022-23. This was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years. Analysis of these figures showed 10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds. The so-called R-number - the reproduction number - had been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid. However, it is has now been phased out as a measure. Expressed within a range, if it was above 1, this indicated that infections were growing.  The range for the last estimate in December 2022 was between 0.9 and 1.2, suggesting infections were rising. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another nine and 12 people would be infected. In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by £373 million. That worked out at £156 per person in Wales, or just under 6% of all NHS Wales spending. The costing of treating patients with Covid and managing the virus was put at £628m. Spending also included field hospitals and operating the track and trace system."
