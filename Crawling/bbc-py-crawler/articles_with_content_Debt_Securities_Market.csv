Debt Securities Market,UK accounting giant PwC faces six-month China ban,2024-09-14,2024-09-13,Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje2ejnwwx9o,"PwC's Chinese auditing arm has been suspended from the country for six months over its work on the collapsed Chinese property giant Evergrande. The Big Four accountancy firm is also being fined more than $62m (£47m) after Chinese authorities said it had helped cover up fraud at Evergrande. The real estate firm collapsed in January under a mountain of debt. PwC China admitted the work had fallen ""unacceptably below the standards"" expected within the firm and apologised for the impact on its clients. The Chinese authorities said PwC knew there were ""major misstatements"" in Evergrande's financial statements when it audited the firm.  As a result, the Chinese Ministry of Finance has imposed ""administrative penalties"" and suspended the operations of PwC's auditing business PwC ZhongTian for six months. Other PwC operations providing non-audit services in China are not affected. In addition, China's securities regulator has confiscated the revenue PwC earned auditing Evergrande and has also issued a fine.  An investigation by the regulator said PwC had ""seriously eroded the basis of law and good faith, and damaged investors' interest"". In response to the penalties, PwC said it had taken ""a number of accountability and remedial actions"", including the sacking of six partners and the launch of a process to fine responsible team leaders. An additional five staff have also left, and Hemione Hudson, PwC's global risk and regulatory leader, has been parachuted in to run the Chinese unit on an interim basis. PwC admitted the work done on the Evergrande audit had been ""well below"" standards expected at the firm. “It is not representative of what we stand for as a network and there is no room for this at PwC,"" the firm’s global chair Mohamed Kande said. “That is why, following a thorough investigation, we ensured that actions were taken to hold those responsible to account. “I remain confident in the China firm’s partners and staff as we work together to rebuild trust with stakeholders,” he added. PwC China said in a statement: ""We deeply regret and apologise for the impact this has had on our clients and people. We will work tirelessly to regain their trust."" Evergrande, which built property in more than 280 Chinese cities and branched out into other business sectors, teetered, then finally went into liquidation in January.  The Chinese authorities have accused Evergrande and its founder, Hui Ka Yan, of falsely inflating revenues at the firm to the tune of $78bn (£61.6bn) and imposed fines and bans on him personally as well as the business."
Debt Securities Market,Venezuela's economy runs on oil - and music,2024-09-14,2024-07-28,Robert Plummer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y9r0jgxno,"Venezuela's battered economy is one of the key battlegrounds in Sunday's presidential election, with President Nicolás Maduro hoping to convince voters that the country has turned the corner after years of strife. Thanks to his recent efforts to push down the cost of living, the outlook is slightly rosier. In February, Venezuela finally said goodbye to the rampant hyperinflation that had seen price rises peak at more than 400,000% a year in 2019. Now annual inflation is more manageable, but still high at about 50%.  Mr Maduro has been keen to take credit for the fall, saying it shows that he has ""the correct policies"". Unfortunately, however, those policies have done little or nothing to tackle the economy's underlying structural problems - chiefly, its historic dependence on oil, to the detriment of other sectors. ""Since it was discovered in the country in the 1920s, oil has taken Venezuela on an exhilarating but dangerous boom-and-bust ride,"" as the US Council on Foreign Relations think tank puts it. Now opponents of President Maduro are pinning their hopes of economic revival on a change of leader, and a new beginning under his electoral rival, Edmundo González. ""An opposition victory would lead to a renewed opening of Venezuela’s trade and financial ties with the rest of the world,"" says Jason Tuvey, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. That would also mean the end of US economic sanctions imposed after Mr Maduro's victory in the 2018 presidential election, which was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. These have made it difficult for state-run oil company PDVSA to sell its crude oil internationally, forcing it to resort to black market deals at big discounts. But Mr Tuvey cautions that reversing the economic collapse of the past decade will be a tall order, given the enormous investment needed to raise oil production and with peak oil demand approaching. ""Venezuela's economy can never get back to where it was 15 to 20 years ago,"" he tells the BBC. ""It will be starting by and large from square one."" Venezuela's 25-year-old Bolivarian Revolution - the name that the late President Hugo Chávez gave to his political movement - promised many things, but has failed to deliver what the country arguably most needed: a broad-based economy. Instead of diversifying away from the oil industry, the governments of Chávez and Mr Maduro doubled down on Venezuela's mineral wealth. Paying little heed to the future, they treated PDVSA as a cash cow, milking its funds to finance social spending on housing, healthcare and transport. But at the same time, they neglected to invest in maintaining the level of oil production, which has plummeted in recent years - partly, but not solely, as a result of US sanctions. These problems were already evident when President Chávez died in 2013, but have grown worse on his successor's watch. ""Under Chávez, Venezuela was able to ride on the coat-tails of an oil boom, up until the global financial crisis,"" Mr Tuvey says. ""Fifteen to 20 years ago, Venezuela was a major oil producer. It used to produce three-and-a-half million barrels a day, along the lines of some of the smaller Gulf states. ""Now the oil sector has been completely hollowed out, and it produces less than a million barrels a day."" GDP declined rapidly, down by 70% since 2013. But Mr Maduro resorted to compensating for lower oil prices by printing money to fund spending, resulting in the runaway inflation which the country has only recently curbed. Economic hardship has taken its toll on the Venezuelan population, with more than 7.7 million people fleeing in search of a better life - about a quarter of the population. But for those left behind, there have been signs of improvement. While the bolívar is still the official currency, an informal dollarisation has taken place, with US greenbacks increasingly the payment method of choice in retail transactions - at least, for those who have access to them. That has stabilised the economy - but it has brought with it a social cost. Residents in the capital, Caracas, now find themselves subject to a two-tier economy. While US dollars are fuelling a consumption boom in high-end shops and restaurants, those paid in bolívars feel increasingly excluded. One symbolic event that highlighted these changes was Colombian reggaeton superstar Karol G's recent appearance in Caracas as part of her current world tour. Few major artists perform in Venezuela these days, but she had no trouble selling out two nights in March at the 50,000-capacity Estadio Monumental, despite ticket prices ranging from $30 to $500 (£23 to £390). At the same time, according to Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalítica, about 65% of Venezuelans earn less than $100 a month, while only eight or nine million of the country's 28 million people can be seen as consumers with actual purchasing power. ""Those with a very close connection to the regime or to PDVSA have been barely affected by all this,"" says Mr Tuvey. As well as the need to raise living standards and reduce inequality, another big economic challenge for Venezuela is what to do about its massive foreign debt. The country owes an estimated $150bn to bondholders and other foreign creditors. It has been in partial default since 2017, and although Mr Maduro has repeatedly promised talks on a restructuring, none have yet taken place. The issue has been complicated by the fact that some of the bonds were issued by PDVSA using the company's US refiner, Citgo, as collateral. As a result, bondholders have been able to pursue the issue through the New York courts. Bruno Gennari, emerging markets strategist at investment bank KNG Securities, tells the BBC that because the US does not recognise Mr Maduro as president after the 2018 election, this leaves Venezuela with a ""legitimacy crisis"". This means that whoever wins Sunday's election would have to be acceptable to Washington if a US-approved debt restructuring is to take place. Mr Gennari does not rule out that the US ""could turn a blind eye"" if Mr Maduro wins the election under dubious conditions, but he believes that is rather unlikely. “This election will have a sizeable impact on Venezuela’s future. If restructuring can go ahead, we could see the beginning of a very complex recovery process,"" says Mr Gennari. Once the richest country in South America, Venezuela now has a possible path back to stability - but whatever happens, its economic glory days are firmly behind it."
Debt Securities Market,Carillion on the brink as talks continue,2024-09-14,2018-01-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42683745,"Carillion's key creditors are due to meet government officials on Monday in a last ditch bid to prevent the construction giant's collapse. It comes as the chairman of a key group of MPs says there may need to be an inquiry into how public contracts are awarded to companies like Carillion. Labour and unions say warnings about the firm's financial woes were ignored. Carillion is involved in major projects like the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons. It has debts of £1.5bn and a £587m pensions shortfall. Without a financial restructuring, the UK's second largest construction company, which has 43,000 staff worldwide - 20,000 in the UK - looks set to go into administration.  Accountancy firm EY has been put on notice to step in to run the company if the talks fail.  Carillion's main bank creditors - including RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander UK - are owed about £900m.  They have indicated an unwillingness to put more money into the company without direct intervention from the government. Talks involving government officials and company bosses were held throughout the weekend. The officials are expected to meet key creditors early on Monday, the BBC has been told. It is understood that the creditors want the government to guarantee some of Carillion's debt payments. But that would be, in effect, helping to bail out a private company.  Carillion's crisis has put a spotlight on how major public contracts are outsourced to private companies. The Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Public Administration select committee said he may launch in inquiry into government procurement and contracting. Bernard Jenkin said: ""We would want to look at Carillion's relationship with Whitehall, as a test case. ""We have long been interested in projects and contracts which are 'too big to fail' and how Whitehall and the private sector must improve  how they work together."" Labour said it would seek answers as to why the government continued to place contracts with Carillion despite the company issuing three profits warnings that should have flagged up problems. ""Alarm bells have been ringing for over six months about the state of Carillion's finances, so the government must come forward and answer questions on exactly what due diligence measures were undertaken,"" said Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister. Carillion's banks are owed about £900m, in the form of overdrafts as well as credit card facilities and other loans.  The banks will likely show forbearance for a few weeks if a sustainable solution to this debt can be found. But they would also like the government to get involved when it comes to managing its key public contracts. This could mean that they would need taxpayers to act as guarantor on future payments from Carillion or that the important contracts to maintain schools and hospitals be taken back in house by Whitehall officials. The government is in a bind. Let Carillion fail and risk thousands of job losses, or bail it out and risk propping up a private company with public money - only a few months after it paid out dividends to its shareholders. Labour peer Lord Adonis, who last month quit as head of the National Infrastructure Commission, tweeted that the government has ""got questions to answer about propping up Carillion with contracts long after its problems clear. Looks like another Grayling bailout!"" Last summer, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling awarded Carillion part of the contract to build HS2, a week after the company issued a profits warning and its chief executive had departed.  New Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""It [Carillion] is a going concern, it's a very commercially sensitive situation so I wouldn't comment further than to say it is a going concern. ""I would hope to see that the working capital they need will be there, working with their partners."" Alastair Stewart, a construction and property analyst at Stockdale Securities, said none of the solutions involving the government were ""particularly palatable"". ""The biggest intervention they could make is actually take a stake in the company as part of raising a large amount of capital, but they'll look back and look at the background of Lloyds and RBS,"" he said. As recently as 2016, Carillion had sales of £5.2bn, and until July 2017, its market capitalisation was close to £1bn. Since then, its share price has plummeted and it is now worth just £61m. Carillion's problems stem, in part, from a string of risky contracts which have proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East. Carillion is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail, and it maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence."
Debt Securities Market,Fed raises for second time this year,2024-09-14,2017-06-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40282066,"The US Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate by 0.25%, the second increase this year. The central bank voted to raise its key rate target to a range of 1% to 1.25%. That's the highest level since 2008, when policymakers cut rates to encourage borrowing and spending after the financial crisis. The bank also said it would begin cutting its bond holdings and other securities this year. It cited continued US economic growth and job market strength as reasons for raising its benchmark interest rate. ""Our decision ... reflects the progress the economy has made and is expected to make,"" said Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. The rise was widely anticipated after a low unemployment rate, but other economic indicators, including inflation, have been weaker. Data on Wednesday showed US consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months. This has raised questions about the bank's future course. US stock markets the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged down at the close. But the rate increase was already priced into most stocks. Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker Should the Fed have done it? The case against is inflation. The Fed's statement noted that price rises have slowed recently. Inflation is below the target of 2%. But then Fed Chair Janet Yellen thinks a large part of that is down to falls in specific prices. She mentioned cell-phone plans and prescription drug prices. Over time their impact will drop out, and she and the committee expect inflation to get to the target in time.  The rate rise continues the Fed's slow return to normality after the financial crisis. The journey is not over.  The Fed's policy makers think about 3% is the new normal. There's also the legacy of quantitative easing and the $4.2trn portfolio of financial assets. Really normal will mean running that down - though perhaps not to pre-crisis levels. It will take a long time and it hasn't begun yet, but the Fed does expect to make a start later this year. Federal Reserve policymakers have been grappling with when and how to alter the policies put in place after the 2008 financial crisis to boost economic activity. At the time, they slashed interest rates and bought up US treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to keep rates low. The Fed has a $4.2trn portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the financial crisis and recession. In 2014 the bank stopped its bond purchase program, known as quantitative easing, but it has continued to reinvest the assets on its books. On Wednesday, policymakers said they aim to reduce that balance sheet, by reinvesting payments from those securities only above certain caps, totalling $10bn. The cap would escalate in three month intervals. It would start implementing those policies this year, assuming economic growth continues. Ms Yellen said she's not sure how far the committee will want to reduce the holdings over the long run, but she said they would be levels ""appreciably below"" those seen in recent years though larger than before the financial crisis. The Fed raised interest rates for the first time since the crisis in December 2015. Policymakers acted in December 2016 and again in March. Wednesday's decision was made with an 8-1 vote, with Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, dissenting. Mr Kashkari also voted against the March rise.   Interest rates remain low by historic standards. The board expects to raise rates at least three times this year. The moves depend on the strength of the economy, which has been mixed. On Wednesday, the US Labor Department reported that prices for goods excluding food and energy increased by 1.7% from May 2016, slowing steadily from earlier in the year. That fell short of the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Ms Yellen said the bank is aware of the shortfall and it was ""essential"" to move back to the target. But she said this year's data may be skewed by one-off factors, such as lower prices on cell phone plans. ""It's important not to overreact to a few readings,"" Ms Yellen said. ""Data on inflation can be noisy."" For US consumers, interest rate increases tend to lead to increased borrowing costs. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com, said the cumulative effect of recent rate increases on consumers is ""mounting"". ""The combination of rising debt burdens and rising interest rates is straining some households, with delinquencies picking up from recent lows,"" he said. In broader terms, the economic impact includes a stronger dollar and higher bank profits."
Debt Securities Market,Deripaska float funds blacklisted bank,2024-09-14,2017-11-13,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41962811,"Tensions between Russia and the West are running high.  In the US, the Senate intelligence committee has said it is confident that Russia intervened in the US election.  In the UK, Damian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee has written to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to provide them with any information it has on politically-divisive advertisements purchased by Russian actors which may have influenced the Brexit vote.  A former British ambassador to Moscow, Sir Tony Brenton, said in July that in his long experience, the relationship between Russia and the West has ""never been as dangerous as it is today"".  Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, a sanctions regime against certain individuals and organisations has been in place, so it may seem curious that some business transactions and practices are getting a green light which many would imagine would be shown a red in the current climate.   For example, cash from the first sale of shares in a Russian company in London since the Crimea invasion in 2014 will be used to pay back debt to a bank that is sanctioned by both the US and European Union.  En+ is a Russian metals and energy company controlled by Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch and Putin associate who was embroiled in controversy after entertaining George Osborne and Peter Mandelson on his yacht in 2008.  According to En+, the proceeds of the London share offering is expected to raise about £1bn. Mr Deripaska is not a sanctioned individual. However, he has said publicly those funds will be used primarily to reduce the company's debts.  The Russian bank VTB is EN+ biggest creditor and also owns 4.35% of its shares.    VTB has been on the US and EU list of sanctioned organisations since 2014, which means it is prohibited from raising money in London.  The relevant bit of sanctions law is this. VTB Bank is subject to EU sanctions which say it cannot ""directly or indirectly purchase, sell, provide brokering or assistance in the issuance of, or otherwise deal with transferable securities and money-market instruments with a maturity exceeding 90 days"" issued by VTB Bank. This rule was designed to limit certain Russian organisations and individuals access to New York and London, the world's fundraising capitals. When contacted by the BBC, the London Stock Exchange reiterated its view that VTB was only subject to EU sanctions on its own capital-raising.  An EN+ Group spokesperson said: ""The intended use of proceeds by En+ does not breach US and EU sanctions... and complies with all relevant listing regulations."" While compliant with the sanctions, this IPO means funds raised from international investors in London by a Russian company will find their way to a sanctioned Russian bank.  Some will say this demonstrates the inadequacy of the sanctions regime. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC it will not comment on individual cases. The FCA is already under fire for its proposed relaxation of rules pertaining to state-owned enterprises such as Saudi Aramco.  Such moves were widely seen as accommodating the needs of the Saudi oil giant, which is looking for a potential foreign listing in a float that may value the company at up to $2 trillion.  The proposals also followed a visit to Saudi Arabia by the prime minister, accompanied by the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. The head of the FCA, Andrew Bailey, recently told MPs he had also met company officials. Big financial centres are trying hard to impress in this lucrative beauty parade - too hard for some.  In an open letter, the Institute of Directors said it was concerned that ""if implemented, the proposed changes could exert a detrimental impact on the reputation of the UK for sound corporate governance"". Other investor groups point to the experience of ENRC - the Kazakh mining company that the UK Listings Authority allowed to list its shares in London, even though the ""free float"" of shares - that portion available to be bought and sold by anyone - was below the usual 25% threshold.  ENRC ended up crashing out of the FTSE 100 amid allegations of corruption and is the subject of a Serious Fraud Office probe.  The sanctions regime is complex and allows for this listing just as it allows companies such as BP to partner with the giant, state-owned, Russian, sanctioned oil and gas producer Rosneft.  Nevertheless, the flow of funds from London to a sanctioned Russian bank may add to an already bulging in-tray of tricky questions for Andrew Bailey.  He has so far refused to publish the full report into allegations that Royal Bank of Scotland mistreated businesses that ran into difficulties after the financial crisis - despite intense pressure from the Treasury select committee chair, Nicky Morgan, and groups representing the businesses involved. Mr Bailey oversaw the proposed changes to listing requirement for Saudi Aramco-type entities and is currently reviewing the conduct of Barclays chief executive Jes Staley for attempting to uncover the identity of a whistleblower.  As the ENRC episode illustrates, previous attempts to make London a go-to venue for international capital by offering so-called ""light touch regulation"" are seen by many to have been a mistake.  The Institute of Directors and other bodies say such a mistake risks being repeated - particularly if London has to try even harder to woo big international listings in a post-Brexit world.  When critics such as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warn of the UK becoming a bargain-basement financial centre off the shores of Europe, they do not mean bargain prices. They mean cuts to regulation. No wrongdoing is alleged on the part of Mr Deripaska or En+, but this IPO comes at a time when Mr Bailey is under wider pressure to demonstrate that being ""open for business"" to the world does not come at the cost of softer regulation.

Debt Securities Market,Are Botox gift vouchers normalising procedures?,2024-09-14,2022-12-23,By Lola Mayor,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63892691,"How would you feel if someone got you a voucher towards Botox for Christmas? Well for some, it's exactly what they want with ""more and more"" gift vouchers on the market, according to the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation (BDDF). One aesthetician said procedures had stigma because people associated them with the excess of some celebrities. However, the BDDF worries ""normalising"" gifting non-surgical treatments could have a negative impact on young people's mental health. Cosmetic procedures can include facials, cosmetic tattoos on areas like eyebrows, and Botox - beloved by those seeking a wrinkle-free face. One study in 2022 found an estimated 900,000 facial injections of Botox are carried out every year in the UK. However, Sara Chenney, who works at a clinic in Wrexham, said the confidence that can come from procedures is more than skin deep, claiming it was ""no different"" to buying someone a voucher for a hairdresser, as long as a proper consultation has taken place. Her clinic, like many others, offers monetary vouchers that can be used towards the non-surgical procedures they offer, such as Botox. Dr Kathryn Lloyd-Thomas has been a doctor for over 22 years and started her aesthetic clinic in Cardiff five years ago. She thinks gift vouchers are a good thing because it means people can afford to have the procedures they want with qualified professionals and ""it'll stop people from going to places they really shouldn't to get stuff done on the cheap"". She said women were made to feel a lot of shame still and as long as the vouchers were from a reputable clinic, it was the same as buying a voucher towards any other large purchase. ""People don't have an opinion or comment on if you go and have your haircut, or if you have your nails done,"" she said. ""But I feel that there's a lot of stigma still around people potentially having anti-wrinkle injections or lip fillers."" She said older women especially felt ""racked with guilt"" but were often ""just wanting a boost"". ""We always tend to see celebrities who have had things done badly and that's what people associate it with,"" she said. ""Women a certain age shouldn't feel guilty about wanting to look nice and I think if that is normalising it, then that's not a bad thing."" She added there was a misconception that it was younger people wanting unsuitable procedures but ""the whole industry needs to be a little bit more regulated"". ""I don't mean to be negative, but possibly there are beauticians out there who shouldn't be doing it but I don't know if that will actually ever change,"" she said. ""I can understand how there may be some potential for some criticism [about gift vouchers] but I'd like to think that if you go to a reputable person or clinic, that they would still only ever perform a procedure on someone after a medical questionnaire and a consent form."" She said in her experience, vouchers were given on a ""very individual basis"", with an increase at Christmas. ""Everyone wants to look nice and for the parties beforehand"", she said, adding her number one request was anti-wrinkle injections and filler."" Ms Chenney, who is clinical director of Pure Perfection Clinic, said people still associated cosmetic procures with ""overfilled lips"" like some celebrities. ""Every patient who walks in our door has a consultation before we do anything,"" she said. She added it was not just procedures such as filler as people gifted treatments for acne and rosacea that can ""change the lives"" of people with insecurities. She said seeing people's mental transformation was ""what gives me the massive job satisfaction"". Ms Chenney said now with longer NHS wait times, people may be asking for vouchers to help deal with skin conditions rather than wait. She added, however, it was down to individuals to make sure they were purchasing responsibly. Kitty Wallace, from the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, said ""normalising"" gifting procedures could have a real impact on people's mental health. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. In more extreme cases it can lead to depression and suicide and the charity said one in 50 people have it. So gift vouchers for cosmetic procedures could, she said, be damaging for a number of reasons. ""When we start talking about things like cosmetic treatments, in my mind it is always the worst case scenario,"" she said. ""For the vast majority of people getting these treatments it can boost how you feel about yourself."" But, she said, it creates a stigma around aging which is particularly concerning for people in their early twenties ""getting a lot of Botox or filler really altering their appearance before they've necessarily matured into how they look"". ""If those young people are getting these treatments because they are trying to suppress a huge amount of anxiety about their appearance they might do that without considering the consequences of what could go wrong."" She added vouchers ""trivialise how large that impact could be on someone"" and often loved ones can mistakenly think they are just helping help their confidence and anxiety. ""It can actually play into fears"" and ""inadvertently play into people's obsession about appearance,"" she said. Ms Wallace said she was also concerned about how young people might afford the procedures once the voucher runs out, having worked with people who had gotten into so much debt they could not afford Christmas presents. ""Treatments aren't often a one-off and require maintenance,"" she said. ""Does that person have the ability to continue this on? And is it fair to start them on that journey?"" Ms Wallace, who herself has BDD, said she was grateful she got treatment for it before the influx of cosmetic procedures by influencers on platforms such as Instagram as it means people see more and more warped images ""It's important that people are educated. We can't make a decision for people about what they choose to do,"" she added. ""But more people need to know what BDD is and what the risks are.""

Debt Securities Market,Carillion: Banks call for government help,2024-09-14,2018-01-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42680585,"The troubled government contractor Carillion has held talks with its creditor banks this weekend and further meetings are planned for Monday, the BBC understands. The construction firm owes £900m to RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander. The banks may be able to show Carillion more leniency if the government is able to do its part, according to sources. The firm's future is also being discussed by government officials.   Carillion is involved in major public projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons.  How exactly the banks want the government to intervene is unclear. They could want the government to offer some guarantees in case Carillion cannot pay back its debts. Or they may want the government to take some of Carillion's key projects back into the public sector.  The TUC has called on the government to ""step in"" to ""guarantee jobs and services"". Deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: ""Tens of thousands of jobs are now at risk, along with vital public services and major infrastructure projects across the country.""

It is also the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail and maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages roads and prisons. The concern is that if it were to collapse these key public sector services could suffer a lot of disruption. "
Debt Securities Market,What is the US Federal Reserve doing?,2024-09-14,2017-09-20,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41320675,"The US Federal Reserve has decided to start running down the stock of financial assets it bought in its quantitative easing scheme. Quantitative easing was a policy that the Fed, and other central banks, used to prevent the recession that followed the financial crisis from becoming an even deeper downturn.  It involved buying financial assets with money newly created by the central bank. In the US the assets were bonds or debts issued by the Federal government and by official agencies that support lending to home buyers. One aim of the policy was to reduce the interest rates paid by businesses and households borrowing money.  Normally central banks try to do that by using their own interest rate policies, which in the case of the Fed means a target it sets for overnight borrowing between commercial banks, known as the Federal Funds Rate. But when that official rate got to almost zero, as it did in December 2008, the Fed's policy makers thought that it couldn't, or shouldn't go any lower.  The Fed's own research suggests that its QE policy has helped reduce long term interest rates. The consequence of all that QE is that the Fed now holds about four and a half trillion dollars of assets. Before it started the programme the figure was less than a quarter of that amount.  Assessments of the impact of QE vary, but many economists take the view that it has helped the US economy.  Many also fear it has created a new danger of financial market instability.  Share and bond prices are high. Some argue that there is a bubble that could burst and trigger a new financial crisis.  The Fed's asset purchases mean there has been more demand for the assets it is buying which tends to push the prices up. In addition, the sellers of those assets need to do something with the money they receive. They may repay debt, but in many cases they buy other assets, often assets with more risk of losing money - such as shares or assets in emerging economies. That in turn tends to push their prices up.  That is what lies behind the concerns about possible financial instability.  All the major developed world central banks, apart from Canada's, have used quantitative easing and several are still actively buying financial assets. In the US however, the Fed stopped in 2014.  But that doesn't mean that it stopped buying assets at the time.   Bonds are debts which (mostly) have a repayment or maturity date when the holder receives the face value of the bond from the borrower or issuer of the bond.  The debt is in effect repaid to whoever owns the bond on the date it matures. In the case of US government bond, it's the Treasury that would repay the central bank.  So far, the Fed has used the proceeds of these repayments to buy more bonds in the financial markets keeping its holdings roughly constant.  Now it is going to reduce the amount that it 'reinvests' in that way. So over time, as more bonds mature its holdings of them will decline.  It also means that over time the extra money it created in the first place to buy the bonds will decline.  As an aside it's worth emphasising that the newly created money is not something that can be spent on goods and services. It is money called reserves, which is held in accounts owned by commercial banks at the central bank.  It's used for transactions between banks and is an important part of the financial and monetary system. But other types of business and households can't use this type of money. Having said that, adding to the total amount of reserves can lead to an increase in money held by the public but it is an indirect effect.  Running down the Fed's holdings of assets will also mean that the amount of reserves held by the banks will decline too.  As with interest rate increases the Fed's approach is cautious. There is no hurry to get things back to what might be considered normal. The decline in its bond holdings in the first month will be no more than ten billion dollars, rising gradually over the course of the following year.  We haven't been told what the ultimate level will be. But the Fed has said that the amount of reserves held by the banks when this process is complete is likely to be higher than before the crisis. All the time there is a degree of wariness among central bankers in the US and other developed economies that they could set back the recovery if they were to raise interest rates or change their QE policies too quickly.  There was a warning in 2013 with an episode that came to be known as the ""taper tantrum"". That was a time when the Fed's QE bond purchases were in full swing. The then Chair of the Fed, Ben Bernanke suggested that it might start to slow down the purchases - or taper its QE. That led to significant volatility in financial markets.  It most likely didn't too much lasting economic damage, but it has probably reinforced the cautious instincts of the current Fed Chair Janet Yellen. She certainly doesn't want to see another tantrum. She has said she wants the Fed's unwinding of its QE to be like ""watching paint dry"". "
Debt Securities Market,India watchdog probing Adani fraud allegations,2024-09-14,2023-02-14,By Annabelle Liang & Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64633419,"India's markets regulator has confirmed that it is investigating allegations made by Hindenburg Research against companies owned by multi-billionaire Gautam Adani. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also says it is examining market activity around the report. Mr Adani's business empire had over $100bn (£82.3bn) wiped off its stock market value after the claims of market manipulation and financial fraud. Adani Group has denied the claims. On Monday, SEBI said in a Supreme Court filing that it was studying the allegations and ""the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report"". ""SEBI is strongly and adequately empowered to put in place regulatory frameworks for effecting stable operations and development of the securities markets,"" it added in a filing to the Supreme Court. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. But the group did tell the Reuters news agency that it had strong cashflows and its business plans were fully funded. ""We are confident in the continued ability of our portfolio to deliver superior returns to shareholders,"" it said. Meanwhile, the conglomerate's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, reported a net profit of nearly $100m for the October to December quarter, against a loss of $1.5m in the same period a year earlier. Its total revenue jumped by 42% to $3.3bn, owing to a strong performance in its airports, coal trading and new energy businesses.  ""Our fundamental strength lies in mega-scale infrastructure project execution capabilities… the current market volatility is temporary,"" said Mr Adani in the results statement. The company did not announce any cutback in growth projections or investment plans, or comment on the decision by France's TotalEnergies to put its partnership with Adani for a green hydrogen project on hold following the Hindenburg report. Shares in Adani Enterprises were up 5% on Mumbai's stock exchange after plunging nearly 50% over the past month.  Mr Adani's group has seven publicly-traded companies which operate across a wide range of sectors, including commodities trading, airports, utilities, ports and renewable energy.  Last month, a report by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that Adani Group companies had engaged in decades of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud. It also claimed its companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". Short-selling is betting that the value of an asset will fall. Adani Group has categorically denied the allegations. It has said previously that the Hindenburg report was intended to enable the US-based short seller to book gains, without citing evidence."
Debt Securities Market,Russia doubles interest rate after rouble slumps,2024-09-14,2022-02-28,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60550992,"Russia has more than doubled its interest rate to 20% in a bid to halt a slump in the value of its currency. The Bank of Russia raised the rate from 9.5% after the rouble sank 30% after new Western sanctions. The currency then eased back to about 20% down. The collapse in value erodes the currency's buying power and could wipe out the savings of ordinary Russians. Amid pictures at the weekend of queues at cash machines, Russia said it had the resources to ride out sanctions. President Vladimir Putin on Monday responded to the sanctions with an order barring citizens from transferring money outside of Russia, including for debt payments. Moscow's stock market, which saw heavy losses last week as investors sold, is to be closed for a second day on Tuesday. Ahead of an emergency meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his economic advisers on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""These are heavy sanctions, they're problematic, but Russia has the necessary potential to compensate the damage from these sanctions.""  The UK, along with the US and EU, cut off major Russian banks from financial markets in the West, prohibiting dealings with the central bank, state-owned investment funds and the finance ministry. The moves sent the rouble tumbling. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the measures demonstrated the UK's ""determination to apply severe economic sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine"". Russia has about $630bn (£470bn) in reserves - a stockpile of savings - built up from soaring oil and gas prices.  But because a lot of this money is stored in foreign currencies like the dollar, the euro and sterling as well as gold, the Western ban on dealing with Russia's central bank restricts Moscow from accessing the cash. Last week, Russia's central bank was forced to increase the amount of money it supplies to ATMs after demand for cash reached the highest level since March 2020. Videos on social media on Sunday appeared to show long queues forming at cash machines and money exchanges in Moscow, with people worried that their bank cards may stop working or that limits will be placed on the amount of cash they can withdraw. Chris Weafer, chief executive at consultancy firm Micro-Advisory and based in Moscow, said on Monday he was seeing some queues in food stores. ""You are beginning to see a little bit of queuing in some grocery stores, particularly people buying some goods that they think might come into short supply due to trade restrictions or maybe will be subject to big price increases because of the rouble devaluation. ""This set of sanctions is hitting ordinary Russians to an extent that previous sanctions have not and people are now becoming aware of that.  ""People are a lot more fearful. There is already talk about some companies having to either go on reduced working hours, or even suspend production because they're not able to access maybe key parts from the West due to sanctions or due to trade limitations, so there's a great deal of concern on the street.""  Moscow resident Anastasia told Reuters that she expected her economic situation to get worse.  ""It's inevitable in these circumstances,"" she added. Whilst another Moscow resident Sergey said he was already seeing an impact. ""Prices are rising, of course, savings are shrinking and stocks are falling."" On Monday, the central bank said it had ordered brokers to suspend the execution of all orders by foreign legal entities and individuals to sell Russian investments. The sanctions that have been imposed by the EU, the US, the UK and others are unprecedented. It's one thing to block the foreign reserves of a country like Iran or Venezuela, quite another to act against Russia - a country with a major role in global trade and a very significant supplier of oil and gas.  The reaction on the currency markets has been dramatic - with the rouble plummeting, despite the central bank's efforts to prop it up using interest rates. There may already have been a rush to the foreign currency ATMs in Russian cities, but citizens there have yet to feel the full impact.   At the very least prices will rise dramatically; banking collapses, hyperinflation and a deep recession are all potential consequences.  But sanctions are a two-way street. Cutting the central bank off from its reserves and limiting Russian institutions' access to the Swift network will not only hurt Russia - western institutions also face losses from debts that cannot or will not be repaid, for example. And then there is the risk of countermeasures from Russia - potentially hitting energy exports.  Such sweeping sanctions being imposed in such a unified way is remarkable. It's also a very big gamble.   Attempts to put a stranglehold around Russia's finances reverberated across the financial and corporate world:  Will Walker-Arnott, senior investment manager at Charles Stanley, told the BBC's Today programme that ""it looks like Russia is increasingly becoming an economic pariah, increasingly isolated from the global financial system"". Cutting some Russian banks from international payments system Swift is among the harshest measure so far imposed to date on Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. The assets of Russia's central bank will also be frozen, limiting the country's ability to access its overseas reserves. Russia is heavily reliant on the Swift system for its key oil and gas exports. It was not clear whether those deals would be exempt from the bans. The intention is to ""further isolate Russia from the international financial system"", a joint statement said. On Monday, the European Central Bank (ECB) said several European subsidiaries of Sberbank Russia, which is Russia's largest bank and majority owned by the Russian government, were failing or likely to fail due to reputational cost of the war in Ukraine. Sberbank Europe AG, which had total assets of €13.64bn (£11.4bn) at the end of last year, along with its Croatian and Slovenian units, suffered a rapid deposit outflow in recent days and is likely to fail to pay its debts or other liabilities, said the ECB, which is the lenders' supervisor.

Debt Securities Market,Spotify closes in on stock market listing,2024-09-14,2018-01-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42559194,"Music streaming company Spotify has reportedly filed papers with US regulators to list its shares publicly on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The firm hopes to launch its shares in the first three months of the year, say reports by Axios and Bloomberg.  Spotify, which declined to comment, has been preparing for the listing for months. It plans to list shares directly on the NYSE, bypassing the traditional stock offering process. Spotify is the world's biggest music streaming company, ahead of rivals like Apple and Amazon. Founded in Sweden, the firm has more than 140 million active users in 61 countries, but it has continued to report losses. It raised $1bn (£740m) in a debt deal with private equity companies in 2016, an agreement with terms linked to an eventual public offering. Those terms, which include escalating interest rates and the ability to convert debt to discounted shares, make it expensive for Spotify to wait before going public, said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages funds focused on IPOs. But she said the decision to list directly could make for a shaky launch. ""It's going to be probably a choppy beginning to find its value,"" she said. In a typical public offering, companies issue new shares, with the initial price underwritten by investment banks. With a direct listing, current Spotify shareholders will take their shares directly to the market. News outlets Axios and Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Spotify sent papers in late December to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in preparation for such a move. The SEC declined to comment. Eventually, more information about the company and its plans will be disclosed.  Ms Smith said the presence of insiders among initial stock sellers could raise doubts about the firm's prospects. Lawsuits accusing Spotify of infringing on songwriter rights could also raise questions for investors, she added."
Debt Securities Market,Are Botox gift vouchers normalising procedures?,2024-09-14,2022-12-23,By Lola Mayor,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63892691,"How would you feel if someone got you a voucher towards Botox for Christmas? Well for some, it's exactly what they want with ""more and more"" gift vouchers on the market, according to the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation (BDDF). One aesthetician said procedures had stigma because people associated them with the excess of some celebrities. However, the BDDF worries ""normalising"" gifting non-surgical treatments could have a negative impact on young people's mental health. Cosmetic procedures can include facials, cosmetic tattoos on areas like eyebrows, and Botox - beloved by those seeking a wrinkle-free face. One study in 2022 found an estimated 900,000 facial injections of Botox are carried out every year in the UK. However, Sara Chenney, who works at a clinic in Wrexham, said the confidence that can come from procedures is more than skin deep, claiming it was ""no different"" to buying someone a voucher for a hairdresser, as long as a proper consultation has taken place. Her clinic, like many others, offers monetary vouchers that can be used towards the non-surgical procedures they offer, such as Botox. Dr Kathryn Lloyd-Thomas has been a doctor for over 22 years and started her aesthetic clinic in Cardiff five years ago. She thinks gift vouchers are a good thing because it means people can afford to have the procedures they want with qualified professionals and ""it'll stop people from going to places they really shouldn't to get stuff done on the cheap"". She said women were made to feel a lot of shame still and as long as the vouchers were from a reputable clinic, it was the same as buying a voucher towards any other large purchase. ""People don't have an opinion or comment on if you go and have your haircut, or if you have your nails done,"" she said. ""But I feel that there's a lot of stigma still around people potentially having anti-wrinkle injections or lip fillers."" She said older women especially felt ""racked with guilt"" but were often ""just wanting a boost"". ""We always tend to see celebrities who have had things done badly and that's what people associate it with,"" she said. ""Women a certain age shouldn't feel guilty about wanting to look nice and I think if that is normalising it, then that's not a bad thing."" She added there was a misconception that it was younger people wanting unsuitable procedures but ""the whole industry needs to be a little bit more regulated"". ""I don't mean to be negative, but possibly there are beauticians out there who shouldn't be doing it but I don't know if that will actually ever change,"" she said. ""I can understand how there may be some potential for some criticism [about gift vouchers] but I'd like to think that if you go to a reputable person or clinic, that they would still only ever perform a procedure on someone after a medical questionnaire and a consent form."" She said in her experience, vouchers were given on a ""very individual basis"", with an increase at Christmas. ""Everyone wants to look nice and for the parties beforehand"", she said, adding her number one request was anti-wrinkle injections and filler."" Ms Chenney, who is clinical director of Pure Perfection Clinic, said people still associated cosmetic procures with ""overfilled lips"" like some celebrities. ""Every patient who walks in our door has a consultation before we do anything,"" she said. She added it was not just procedures such as filler as people gifted treatments for acne and rosacea that can ""change the lives"" of people with insecurities. She said seeing people's mental transformation was ""what gives me the massive job satisfaction"". Ms Chenney said now with longer NHS wait times, people may be asking for vouchers to help deal with skin conditions rather than wait. She added, however, it was down to individuals to make sure they were purchasing responsibly. Kitty Wallace, from the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, said ""normalising"" gifting procedures could have a real impact on people's mental health. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. In more extreme cases it can lead to depression and suicide and the charity said one in 50 people have it. So gift vouchers for cosmetic procedures could, she said, be damaging for a number of reasons. ""When we start talking about things like cosmetic treatments, in my mind it is always the worst case scenario,"" she said. ""For the vast majority of people getting these treatments it can boost how you feel about yourself."" But, she said, it creates a stigma around aging which is particularly concerning for people in their early twenties ""getting a lot of Botox or filler really altering their appearance before they've necessarily matured into how they look"". ""If those young people are getting these treatments because they are trying to suppress a huge amount of anxiety about their appearance they might do that without considering the consequences of what could go wrong."" She added vouchers ""trivialise how large that impact could be on someone"" and often loved ones can mistakenly think they are just helping help their confidence and anxiety. ""It can actually play into fears"" and ""inadvertently play into people's obsession about appearance,"" she said. Ms Wallace said she was also concerned about how young people might afford the procedures once the voucher runs out, having worked with people who had gotten into so much debt they could not afford Christmas presents. ""Treatments aren't often a one-off and require maintenance,"" she said. ""Does that person have the ability to continue this on? And is it fair to start them on that journey?"" Ms Wallace, who herself has BDD, said she was grateful she got treatment for it before the influx of cosmetic procedures by influencers on platforms such as Instagram as it means people see more and more warped images ""It's important that people are educated. We can't make a decision for people about what they choose to do,"" she added. ""But more people need to know what BDD is and what the risks are.""

Debt Securities Market,Deripaska float funds blacklisted bank,2024-09-14,2017-11-13,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41962811,"Tensions between Russia and the West are running high.  In the US, the Senate intelligence committee has said it is confident that Russia intervened in the US election.  In the UK, Damian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee has written to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to provide them with any information it has on politically-divisive advertisements purchased by Russian actors which may have influenced the Brexit vote.  A former British ambassador to Moscow, Sir Tony Brenton, said in July that in his long experience, the relationship between Russia and the West has ""never been as dangerous as it is today"".  Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, a sanctions regime against certain individuals and organisations has been in place, so it may seem curious that some business transactions and practices are getting a green light which many would imagine would be shown a red in the current climate.   For example, cash from the first sale of shares in a Russian company in London since the Crimea invasion in 2014 will be used to pay back debt to a bank that is sanctioned by both the US and European Union.  En+ is a Russian metals and energy company controlled by Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch and Putin associate who was embroiled in controversy after entertaining George Osborne and Peter Mandelson on his yacht in 2008.  According to En+, the proceeds of the London share offering is expected to raise about £1bn. Mr Deripaska is not a sanctioned individual. However, he has said publicly those funds will be used primarily to reduce the company's debts.  The Russian bank VTB is EN+ biggest creditor and also owns 4.35% of its shares.    VTB has been on the US and EU list of sanctioned organisations since 2014, which means it is prohibited from raising money in London.  The relevant bit of sanctions law is this. VTB Bank is subject to EU sanctions which say it cannot ""directly or indirectly purchase, sell, provide brokering or assistance in the issuance of, or otherwise deal with transferable securities and money-market instruments with a maturity exceeding 90 days"" issued by VTB Bank. This rule was designed to limit certain Russian organisations and individuals access to New York and London, the world's fundraising capitals. When contacted by the BBC, the London Stock Exchange reiterated its view that VTB was only subject to EU sanctions on its own capital-raising.  An EN+ Group spokesperson said: ""The intended use of proceeds by En+ does not breach US and EU sanctions... and complies with all relevant listing regulations."" While compliant with the sanctions, this IPO means funds raised from international investors in London by a Russian company will find their way to a sanctioned Russian bank.  Some will say this demonstrates the inadequacy of the sanctions regime. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC it will not comment on individual cases. The FCA is already under fire for its proposed relaxation of rules pertaining to state-owned enterprises such as Saudi Aramco.  Such moves were widely seen as accommodating the needs of the Saudi oil giant, which is looking for a potential foreign listing in a float that may value the company at up to $2 trillion.  The proposals also followed a visit to Saudi Arabia by the prime minister, accompanied by the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. The head of the FCA, Andrew Bailey, recently told MPs he had also met company officials. Big financial centres are trying hard to impress in this lucrative beauty parade - too hard for some.  In an open letter, the Institute of Directors said it was concerned that ""if implemented, the proposed changes could exert a detrimental impact on the reputation of the UK for sound corporate governance"". Other investor groups point to the experience of ENRC - the Kazakh mining company that the UK Listings Authority allowed to list its shares in London, even though the ""free float"" of shares - that portion available to be bought and sold by anyone - was below the usual 25% threshold.  ENRC ended up crashing out of the FTSE 100 amid allegations of corruption and is the subject of a Serious Fraud Office probe.  The sanctions regime is complex and allows for this listing just as it allows companies such as BP to partner with the giant, state-owned, Russian, sanctioned oil and gas producer Rosneft.  Nevertheless, the flow of funds from London to a sanctioned Russian bank may add to an already bulging in-tray of tricky questions for Andrew Bailey.  He has so far refused to publish the full report into allegations that Royal Bank of Scotland mistreated businesses that ran into difficulties after the financial crisis - despite intense pressure from the Treasury select committee chair, Nicky Morgan, and groups representing the businesses involved. Mr Bailey oversaw the proposed changes to listing requirement for Saudi Aramco-type entities and is currently reviewing the conduct of Barclays chief executive Jes Staley for attempting to uncover the identity of a whistleblower.  As the ENRC episode illustrates, previous attempts to make London a go-to venue for international capital by offering so-called ""light touch regulation"" are seen by many to have been a mistake.  The Institute of Directors and other bodies say such a mistake risks being repeated - particularly if London has to try even harder to woo big international listings in a post-Brexit world.  When critics such as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warn of the UK becoming a bargain-basement financial centre off the shores of Europe, they do not mean bargain prices. They mean cuts to regulation. No wrongdoing is alleged on the part of Mr Deripaska or En+, but this IPO comes at a time when Mr Bailey is under wider pressure to demonstrate that being ""open for business"" to the world does not come at the cost of softer regulation.

Debt Securities Market,Russia reopens bond market to friendly traders,2024-09-14,2022-08-15,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62544941,"The Moscow Exchange will be partially reopened to foreign investors from Monday after a nearly six-month suspension during the Ukraine war. It says only investors from ""countries that are not hostile"" will be allowed to trade bonds. The move excludes many of Russia's largest investors that have imposed sanctions on its economy. Russia had sealed off its markets in February to restrict money from leaving the country during the war. In a statement, the Moscow Exchange said it would be reopening its bond market to ""non-resident clients from countries that are not hostile, as well as non-residents whose ultimate beneficiaries are Russian legal entities or individuals"".  China and Turkey are likely to be among these nations, as they have not imposed sanctions against Russia.  It added that banks, brokers and investment management companies had started registering their foreign clients with the exchange. Russia closed its stock and bond markets hours after President Vladimir Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February. In March, it began a phased re-opening which was limited to bonds issued by the Russian government. Monday's resumption of trading excludes investors from ""hostile"" countries, who remain banned from selling Russian securities. These countries include members of the European Union, Canada and Japan. The group accounted for 90% of investments into Russia last year. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions imposed by Western governments have taken a toll on its economy. The country is believed to have defaulted on its debt in June for the first time since 1998. While it had money to make a $100m (£82.5m) payment, sanctions made it impossible to get the sum to international creditors. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said an intermediary bank had withheld the money and that the reserves were blocked ""unlawfully"". You may also be interested in:"
Debt Securities Market,AMC cinema chain issues warning to small investors,2024-09-14,2021-06-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57334264,"US cinema chain AMC has put out a blunt warning to smaller investors as it launched a new share sale. It warned against buying ""unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" On Thursday it unveiled plans to sell up to 11.6 million shares off the back of surging prices in the ""meme"" stock popularised on social media. AMC stock was lower by more than 20% at the end of Thursday's trading. It comes a day after the company updated its offer for retail investors, who can now claim a tub of free popcorn if they sign up to a regular newsletter. A number of Wall Street analysts have said AMC is already heavily overvalued and many institutional traders have said they were steering clear of the stock, the latest target of a number of small-time traders organised on Reddit and other social media. On Thursday, it said in a filing that it would sell up to 11.55 million shares of common stock, with money raised going towards ""general corporate purposes,"" which could cover paying off current debts or buying new cinemas. Its shares fell after the announcement. This marks its second share sale in three days, having raised $230.5m (£163.3m) by selling 8.5 million new shares to the hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management, which later sold those shares at a profit. The cinema chain operator said it believed current prices reflected ""market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business"". In the year to date, shares in AMC have soared 2,421% - despite its cinemas being largely shut during the pandemic. But it is the latest example of small investors trying to seize power from Wall Street giants.  Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop and AMC's shares would fall.  They have since faced huge losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites like Reddit or Twitter, drove prices up in so-called ""meme"" stocks. AMC said on Thursday that it did not know ""how long these dynamics will last. ""Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment,"" it said. Analysts have also warned that the stock may be overvalued due to the rise of streaming and competition from other entertainment companies. David Trainer, chief executive of investment research firm New Constructs, said: ""AMC's business was trending in the wrong direction even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic... We think AMC's stock is worth $0 per share, given its weak earnings, dilution from recent stock offerings and mountain of debt."" Despite that, AMC has been among the biggest winners from a spike of interest in meme stocks, fuelled in part by a new generation of social media-centric small traders. On Wednesday, #AMCstock was trending on Twitter in the US as investors discussed their holdings and the share price nearly doubled. The Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler said at a hearing last month that it will report on issues around volatile ""meme"" stocks this summer. He said that although online forums such as Reddit can serve as a ""real community"", he is concerned about ""the risks that nefarious actors may try to send signals to manipulate the market""."
Debt Securities Market,Carillion on the brink as talks continue,2024-09-14,2018-01-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42683745,"Carillion's key creditors are due to meet government officials on Monday in a last ditch bid to prevent the construction giant's collapse. It comes as the chairman of a key group of MPs says there may need to be an inquiry into how public contracts are awarded to companies like Carillion. Labour and unions say warnings about the firm's financial woes were ignored. Carillion is involved in major projects like the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons. It has debts of £1.5bn and a £587m pensions shortfall. Without a financial restructuring, the UK's second largest construction company, which has 43,000 staff worldwide - 20,000 in the UK - looks set to go into administration.  Accountancy firm EY has been put on notice to step in to run the company if the talks fail.  Carillion's main bank creditors - including RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander UK - are owed about £900m.  They have indicated an unwillingness to put more money into the company without direct intervention from the government. Talks involving government officials and company bosses were held throughout the weekend. The officials are expected to meet key creditors early on Monday, the BBC has been told. It is understood that the creditors want the government to guarantee some of Carillion's debt payments. But that would be, in effect, helping to bail out a private company.  Carillion's crisis has put a spotlight on how major public contracts are outsourced to private companies. The Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Public Administration select committee said he may launch in inquiry into government procurement and contracting. Bernard Jenkin said: ""We would want to look at Carillion's relationship with Whitehall, as a test case. ""We have long been interested in projects and contracts which are 'too big to fail' and how Whitehall and the private sector must improve  how they work together."" Labour said it would seek answers as to why the government continued to place contracts with Carillion despite the company issuing three profits warnings that should have flagged up problems. ""Alarm bells have been ringing for over six months about the state of Carillion's finances, so the government must come forward and answer questions on exactly what due diligence measures were undertaken,"" said Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister. Carillion's banks are owed about £900m, in the form of overdrafts as well as credit card facilities and other loans.  The banks will likely show forbearance for a few weeks if a sustainable solution to this debt can be found. But they would also like the government to get involved when it comes to managing its key public contracts. This could mean that they would need taxpayers to act as guarantor on future payments from Carillion or that the important contracts to maintain schools and hospitals be taken back in house by Whitehall officials. The government is in a bind. Let Carillion fail and risk thousands of job losses, or bail it out and risk propping up a private company with public money - only a few months after it paid out dividends to its shareholders. Labour peer Lord Adonis, who last month quit as head of the National Infrastructure Commission, tweeted that the government has ""got questions to answer about propping up Carillion with contracts long after its problems clear. Looks like another Grayling bailout!"" Last summer, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling awarded Carillion part of the contract to build HS2, a week after the company issued a profits warning and its chief executive had departed.  New Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""It [Carillion] is a going concern, it's a very commercially sensitive situation so I wouldn't comment further than to say it is a going concern. ""I would hope to see that the working capital they need will be there, working with their partners."" Alastair Stewart, a construction and property analyst at Stockdale Securities, said none of the solutions involving the government were ""particularly palatable"". ""The biggest intervention they could make is actually take a stake in the company as part of raising a large amount of capital, but they'll look back and look at the background of Lloyds and RBS,"" he said. As recently as 2016, Carillion had sales of £5.2bn, and until July 2017, its market capitalisation was close to £1bn. Since then, its share price has plummeted and it is now worth just £61m. Carillion's problems stem, in part, from a string of risky contracts which have proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East. Carillion is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail, and it maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence."
Debt Securities Market,India economy records worst slump in decades,2024-09-14,2020-08-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53973772,"India's economy contracted sharply in the three months to the end of June, official data shows. It shrank by 23.9%, its worst slump since the country started releasing quarterly data in 1996. The coronavirus pandemic and a grinding lockdown caused massive disruptions to economic activity during the quarter. Experts fear that India is staring at a recession - that will happen only if it reports contraction in the next quarter as well, which experts say is likely. A country is considered to be in recession if it reports contraction for two successive quarters. India was last in recession in 1980, its fourth one since independence.  India has recorded more than 3.6 million Covid-19 cases so far - on Sunday it reported 78,761 new cases in 24 hours, the world's highest  single-day increase.  But the country continues to reopen because, experts say, a second lockdown is economically unviable. And the effects of the first lockdown are evident in the latest GDP figures.   The numbers aren't surprising given that the lockdown was in effect for most of the quarter in question - April to June.  By Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News' India business correspondent While India's GDP saw the sharpest contraction on record, the number is expected to undergo further revisions as data collection was severely impaired during the lockdown.  The headline figure is at the upper end of what most analysts were estimating, but some have cautioned that in the absence of real time data, the number doesn't reflect the gravity of the economic distress.  From hotels to trade, electricity generation, manufacturing and construction, almost every segment of the Indian economy showed a sharp contraction during the first three months of the financial year. The only sector that posted positive growth was agriculture, at 3.4%.  By all accounts, a quick recovery is unlikely in India, and it is only in the last three months of the year that growth is expected to return to positive territory. Cases continue to spike and lockdowns are ongoing in several areas. As a result, consumer demand, which determines 60% of GDP, is unlikely to return in a hurry as most people are stepping out only to buy essentials.  ""We expect further fiscal and liquidity stimulus,"" Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at IIFL Securities, told the BBC. But with the government's tax and non-tax revenues down sharply and expenditure going up, the fiscal space to revive the economy remains limited. India's economy was already faltering when Covid-19 struck. Last year, unemployment touched a 45-year high and growth dipped to 4.7%, the lowest in six years. Output was shrinking as demand fell and banks were burdened by a mountain of debt.  Then came a global pandemic, which only worsened the situation. An unprecedented lockdown at the end of March forced many factories and businesses to shut temporarily, brining most economic activity to a halt.  One month into the lockdown, 121 million Indians had lost their jobs, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank. But CMIE also estimates that tens of millions of those jobs have since returned, mainly due to a resumption of economic activity as the country reopened from June onwards.  Experts, however, believe that many of these jobs are in the informal sector, largely agriculture, the mainstay of India's economy.  While most industries, from manufacturing to services to retail contracted, agriculture and agri-businesses have bucked the trend.  Exemptions from the lockdown, a bumper harvest and the delayed arrival of Covid-19 in rural areas seems to have helped."
Debt Securities Market,Adani says fraud claim 'calculated attack on India',2024-09-14,2023-01-30,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64448880,"The company owned by Asia's richest man Gautam Adani has issued a detailed rebuttal of allegations of wrongdoing by short seller Hindenburg Research. In a document, which runs to more than 400 pages, Adani Group says the report is a ""calculated attack on India"". Later on Sunday, Hindenburg said ""Adani failed to specifically answer 62 of our 88 questions"" detailed in its report. Adani Group, an Indian conglomerate, had more than $50bn (£40.4bn) wiped off its stock market value last week. It also said that it had complied with all local laws and had made the necessary regulatory disclosures. ""All transactions entered into by us with entities who qualify as 'related parties' under Indian laws and accounting standards have been duly disclosed by us,"" Adani Group said in a 413-page document issued late on Sunday. It went on to accuse the Hindenburg report of being intended to enable the US-based short seller to book gains, without citing evidence. ""This is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities to enable Hindenburg, an admitted short seller, to book massive financial gain through wrongful means at the cost of countless investors,"" it added. ""Short-selling"" is when someone bets against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall. In response Hindenburg said: ""To be clear, we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future."" ""We also believe India's future is being held back by the Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation."" It comes as Adani Group's flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, is this week pushing ahead with a $2.5bn share sale. Last week, a report published by Hindenburg questioned the Adani Group's ownership of companies in offshore tax havens such as Mauritius and the Caribbean.  It also claimed Adani companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". But on Thursday, Adani Group said it was evaluating ""remedial and punitive action"" against Hindenburg Research in the US and India. Adani said it had always been ""in compliance with all laws"". Also on Thursday, Hindenburg responded to Adani's comments, saying the firm had not addressed ""a single substantive issue we had raised""."

Debt Securities Market,The hidden links between slavery and Wall Street,2024-09-14,2019-08-28,By Zoe Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49476247,"This month marks 400 years since enslaved Africans were first brought to what is now the United States of America. Slavery was officially abolished in the US in 1865, but historians say the legacy of slavery cannot be untangled from its economic impact.    On a hot August day, 25 people are gathered around a small commemorative sign in New York's financial district. Their tour guide explains that this was the site of one of the US' largest slave markets.  Just two streets away from the current site of the New York Stock Exchange, men, women and children were bought and sold.  ""This is not black history,"" says Damaris Obi who leads the tour. ""This is not New York City or American history. This is world history."" It is also economic history.  Stacey Toussaint, the boss of Inside Out Tours, which runs the NYC Slavery and Underground Railroad tour, says people are often surprised by how important slavery was to New York City.  ""They don't realise that enslaved people built the wall after which Wall Street is named,"" she says. By some estimates, New York received 40% of US cotton revenue through money its financial firms, shipping businesses and insurance companies earned. But scholars differ on just how direct a line can be drawn between slavery and modern economic practices in the US.  ""People in non-slave areas - Britain and free US states - routinely did business with slave owners and  slave commerce,"" says Gavin Wright, professor emeritus of economic history at Stanford University. But he says the ""uniqueness"" of slavery's economic contribution has been ""exaggerated"" by some.  Slavery thrived under colonial rule. British and Dutch settlers relied on enslaved people to help establish farms and build the new towns and cities that would eventually become the United States. Enslaved people were brought to work on the cotton, sugar and tobacco plantations. The crops they grew were sent to Europe or to the northern colonies, to be turned into finished products. Those finished goods were used to fund trips to Africa to obtain more slaves who were then trafficked back to America. This triangular trading route was profitable for investors.  To raise the money to start many future plantation owners turned to capital markets in London - selling debt that was used to purchase boats, goods and eventually people.  Later in the 19th Century, US banks and southern states would sell securities that helped fund the expansion of slave run plantations.   To balance the risk that came with forcibly bringing humans from Africa to America insurance policies were purchased.   These policies protected against the risk of a boat sinking, and the risks of losing individual slaves once they made it to America.  Some of the largest insurance firms in the US - New York Life, AIG and Aetna - sold policies that insured slave owners would be compensated if the slaves they owned were injured or killed.  By the mid 19th Century, exports of raw cotton accounted for more than half of US oversees shipments. What wasn't sold abroad was sent to mills in northern states including Massachusetts and Rhode Island to be turned into fabric.  The money southern plantation owners earned couldn't be kept under mattresses or behind loose floorboards.  American banks accepted their deposits and counted enslaved people as assets when assessing a person's wealth.  In recent years, US banks have made public apologies for the role they played in slavery.  In 2005, JP Morgan Chase, currently the biggest bank in the US, admitted that two of its subsidiaries - Citizens' Bank and Canal Bank in Louisiana - accepted enslaved people as collateral for loans. If plantation owners defaulted on loan payment the banks took ownership of these slaves.  JP Morgan was not alone. The predecessors that made up Citibank, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are among a list of well-known US financial firms that benefited from the slave trade.  ""Slavery was an overwhelmingly important fact of the American economy,"" explains Sven Beckert, Laird Bell Professor of American History at Harvard University.  Prof Beckert points out that while cities like Boston never played a large role in the slave trade, they benefited from the connections to slave driven economies. New England merchants made money selling timber and ice to the south and the Caribbean. In turn, northern merchants bought raw cotton and sugar.    New England's fabric mills played a key role in the US industrial revolution, but their supply of cotton came from the slave-reliant south.  Brands like Brooks Brothers, the oldest men's clothier in the US, turned southern cotton into high-end fashion. Domino's Sugar, once the largest sugar refiner in the US, processed slave-grown sugar cane.  America's railroads also benefited from money earned through slave businesses. In the south, trains were built specifically to move agricultural goods farmed by enslaved people, and slaves were also used as labour to build the lines.   Some scholars even argue the use of slavery shaped modern accounting. Historian Caitlin Rosenthal points to enslavers who depreciated or lowered the recorded value of slaves over time as a way to keep track of costs.   More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: In the century and a half since slavery was abolished in the US, laws that prevented former slaves and their descents from full engagement in the US economy have shaped the country.  Following the country's Civil War, efforts to pay reparations to the newly freed slaves were squashed. President Andrew Johnson, who took over after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, did not want to alienate white southerners during the period of reconstruction.  A series of laws that economically and politically disenfranchised formerly enslaved people led to many of today's inequalities, according to historians.  New efforts to find ways to pay reparations are finding traction in the 2020 race for president.  New Jersey Senator Corey Booker, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, has proposed a bill to set up a committee that would consider how reparations might be paid.  Many Democratic candidates say they support the idea of exploring proposals. There are few specific proposals though, and polls show a majority of Americans don't support the idea. Just 50m (160ft) from the sign marking the city's slave market, New York's stock market was formed.  While politicians differ on how to address America's legacy of slavery, historians agree that the proximity of the two markets is at least an indication of the connection between its economic legacy and its legacy of slavery.

Debt Securities Market,US bank Silvergate hit with $8bn crypto withdrawals,2024-09-14,2023-01-06,By Tom Gerken,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64176446,"Customers of US bank Silvergate, which provides cryptocurrency services, have withdrawn over $8bn (£6.7bn) of their crypto-linked deposits. Around two-thirds of the bank's customers pulled their deposits in the final three months of 2022. The bank has sold $5.2bn in assets to cover the cost and remain liquid. It came as three US regulators warned banks that issuing or holding crypto was ""highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices"". Silvergate is a bank listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and is therefore regulated within the financial sector. It is one of a small handful of businesses within this sector that provides cryptocurrency services. The withdrawals followed the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, which was once valued at $32bn before its bankruptcy filing in November. Former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to charges that he defrauded customers and investors. Prosecutors say as many as one million creditors may have lost their money.  The case has shaken the entire crypto industry, sparking bankruptcy filings at other firms and declines in crypto values. Alan Lane, chief executive of Silvergate, said the bank was selling assets to cover the withdrawals by customers ""in response to the rapid changes in the digital asset industry"". Silvergate is the latest victim of the chilling ""crypto winter"" that's been whipping through the industry since last spring.  The so-called crypto bank occupied a fairly unique position in the market acting as a bank for cryptocurrency companies which struggled to get banking services from traditional sources. One of its customers was the now bankrupt Alameda Research - owned by Sam Bankman-Fried who awaits trial in the US accused of fraud. That in itself is a blow for Silvergate but Bankman-Fried's downfall has delivered a bigger blow to the company - market confidence. Since Bankman-Fried's empire collapsed, investors large and small have been pulling their money out of crypto companies with billions transferred from companies that store crypto funds. So far the biggest companies in the space like Binance and Coinbase have survived the unprecedented withdrawals and it appears as though Silvergate is weathering the storm too for now but at a huge cost to its balance sheet. Silvergate was a small US bank before it entered the world of cryptocurrency, and went public in November 2019. At the market's peak in 2021, its shares had grown by more than 1,500%, in no small part due to the massive growth of crypto in this period. During this time it tried to launch its own stablecoin - a form of cryptocurrency which is directly tied to an asset such as gold, the US dollar or other cryptocurrencies. And in January 2022, Silvergate spent $182m to acquire the technology behind Meta's proposed Diem (formerly Libra) stablecoin that never saw the light of day. In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank said it had sold debt to cover the withdrawals and had written off the Diem purchase, meaning it is no longer counted as an asset. It has also reduced its staff by 40% - around 200 people - and altogether the withdrawals have caused the bank to lose $718m, a total higher than its profit since 2013."
Debt Securities Market,'My mum was a courtesan - and not ashamed of it',2024-09-14,2023-07-18,By Cherylann Mollan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66220507,"""I danced in the dark. I used to light up the room with candles and perform. In the blackout, my naseeb (fate) was going to shine."" The year was 1962. War had broken out between India and China over a disputed border and the Indian government had declared a state of national emergency. Fear gripped people as wailing sirens and days-long blackouts became a part of daily life. The future seemed uncertain. But Rekhabai wouldn't let the fear of dying dictate her destiny. Instead of shutting shop like the other courtesans (women entertainers), she would dress up in a beautiful sari night after night and sing and dance for the groups of men who came to watch her in the kotha - a Hindi word for a place where professional female dancers performed for men, or sometimes, even a brothel. Her life had taught her that hardship was often a gateway to opportunity, or at least, survival. Rekhabai's tumultuous life is now the subject of a book, The Last Courtesan - Writing My Mother's Memoir, authored by her son Manish Gaekwad.  ""My mother always wanted to tell her story,"" Gaekwad says and adds that he felt no shame or embarrassment in narrating it as, having lived with her in the kotha up until his late teens, her life was no secret to him. ""Growing up in a kotha, a child sees a lot more than he should. My mother knew this and didn't feel the need to hide anything,"" says Gaekwad. His book - written from the memories his mother narrated to him - gives the reader a shockingly honest look into the life of an Indian courtesan is the mid-1900s. Courtesans, also known as tawaifs in popular culture, have been around since 2BC in the Indian subcontinent, says Madhur Gupta, an Odissi dancer and author of Courting Hindustan: The Consuming Passions of Iconic Women Performers of India.  ""They were women entertainers whose function was to entertain and pleasure royalty and the Gods,"" says Mr Gupta. Before India came under British rule, courtesans were viewed as respected performers; they were highly trained in the arts, wealthy and enjoyed the patronage of some of the most powerful men of their times.   ""But they also faced exploitation at the hands of men and society,"" Mr Gupta says. India's courtesan culture began to decline after the British - who saw them as ""nautch girls"" (dance girls) or merely sex workers - enacted laws aimed at curbing the practice. Their status declined further after India gained independence in 1947 and many courtesans were forced to turn to prostitution to survive. The practice has completely died out now, but stories of famous courtesans and their fascinating lives live on in books and films.  And one such story is that of Rekhabai. She was born in a poor family in the western city of Pune as the sixth among 10 siblings. Rekhabai doesn't remember the exact year or date, her memory about time is hazy. Tired of siring five girls, her drunk father allegedly tried to drown her in a pond after she was born. At the age of nine or 10, she was married off to settle a family debt, and was later sold by her in-laws to a kotha in Bowbazar area in the eastern city of Kolkata.  She was not yet a teenager when she began training as a tawaif, learning to sing and dance. But her life and earnings were controlled by a female relative who was also a courtesan there. During the India-China war, the relative left and Rekhabai got a chance to take charge of her own life. Her candlelight performances helped her become independent and left her with the realisation that she could be her own provider and protector if she was brave enough. This would become her guiding principle for the rest of her life. Rekhabai - unlike her famous Bollywood counterparts in the films Umrao Jaan and Pakeezah - never pined after a man. She chose not to remarry, despite having a long list of patrons who courted her - from small-time criminals to rich sheikhs and renowned musicians - as it would mean having to give up her life as a tawaif and leave the kotha. The kotha - the small space in which she performed, lived, raised her child and sheltered various members of her family at different times - ironically became a symbol of freedom and power for her.  Yet, it was also a space fraught with conflict and hardship, where circumstance ate away at innocence, stripped away humanity and evoked destructive emotions like rage, fear and despair. In the book, Gaekwad narrates some deeply distressing memories his mother recounts, like when a thug pulled out a gun to shoot her after she refused to marry him. In another place, Rekhabai recounts the abuse she faced from courtesans who were jealous of her success. Some tried to intimidate her by hiring gangsters to lurk outside her room; others called her a prostitute when she wasn't one.  But the kotha also forged her into the steely woman she became eventually. It's where she discovered her talent as a dancer, and the power it wielded over men looking to escape their own insecurities or the tedium and melancholia of life. It's where she learnt to read men by the way they treated her and to placate egos when needed, or shred them to bits if they threatened to destroy her own.  ""I had mastered the language of the kotha. I had to speak it if required,"" she says. But along with this feisty, charming, street-smart performer, the kotha also saw Rekhabai transform into a doting, fiercely-protective mother who did everything in her power to give her son a better life. As a baby, she kept him close to her in the kotha. She recalls how she would run to check up on him between performances if she thought she heard him cry. Later, she sent him to a boarding school and then bought an apartment so that he could invite his friends over without feeling embarrassed. She took pride in the man her son was growing into - even though his English medium-education and more refined upbringing in the boarding school made him different from her in many ways. In a heart-warming anecdote, she recalls a time her son, who was visiting during vacations, asks for a fork and spoon to eat with.  ""I knew of forks [kaanta in Hindi], but I had never heard what it was called in English before… I had to go to the market to buy them when you explained [what it was],"" she says in the book. In the late 2000s, the courtesan culture had completely vanished and Rekhabai left the kotha to live in her apartment in Kolkata. She died in the western city of Mumbai in February. Gaekwad says he will always remain in awe of his mother, her fortitude, talent and zest for life. ""I hope men read this book,"" he says, and adds that Indian men have these ""constructs around the mother figure, where she has to be a paragon of purity"". ""But I hope this book helps people identify the individuality of their mothers and accept who they are as people, independent from their relationship with us."" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Debt Securities Market,Microsoft in blockbuster $20bn takeover of AI firm,2024-09-14,2021-04-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56722862,"Microsoft Corp plans to buy a tech firm known for helping to develop Apple's Siri speech recognition software in a deal valued at $19.7bn (£13.3bn). The purchase of Nuance Communications is the second largest in Microsoft's history, after its acquisition of networking site LinkedIn in 2016. Microsoft said it would bolster its software and artificial intelligence expertise for healthcare companies. So-called ""telehealth"" and remote doctor visits have boomed in lockdown. This growth is forecast to continue after the pandemic.  ""Nuance provides the AI layer at the healthcare point of delivery,"" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a statement. ""AI is technology's most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application."" The deal, which includes Nuance debt, is expected to be completed this year.  Nuance, based in Massachusetts, was founded in 1992. It employs more than 1,600 people globally and is active in 28 countries.  Known as a speech recognition pioneer, it has more recently focused on providing software to the healthcare industry, such as software that helps to automate radiology reports and makes it easier for doctors to create patient notes by dictation. Nearly 80% of US hospitals are already Nuance customers, Mr Nadella said. Purchasing the firm will dramatically expand Microsoft's potential market in the health care industry. Nuance executives said joining forces with Microsoft would help deepen its cloud-based offerings and allow it to tap into Microsoft's existing global customer base. The acquisition builds on a partnership the two companies formed in 2019 to automate clinical administrative work such as documentation.  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the deal was ""a strategic no brainer in our opinion for [Microsoft] and fits like a glove into its healthcare endeavours at a time in which hospitals and doctors are embracing next generation AI capabilities from thought leaders such as Nuance"".  ""Clearly, [Microsoft] is on the ""offensive"" around M&A with the company in a clear position of strength to capitalize on its entrenched position in the cloud going forward,"" he added, calling Nuance ""another feather in its cap"". Microsoft is to pay $56 per share to bring the firm under its own roof. That price is about 23% higher than where Nuance shares were trading on Friday. Shares in Microsoft were flat following the announcement, while Nuance gained more than 16%. The boards of both companies have approved the transaction. "
Debt Securities Market,JP Morgan snaps up troubled US bank First Republic,2024-09-14,2023-05-01,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65445427,"JP Morgan Chase has taken over the troubled US bank First Republic in a deal brokered by regulators. The Wall Street giant said it would pay $10.6bn (£8.5bn) to the Federal Insurance Deposit Corp (FIDC), after officials shut down the smaller bank.  First Republic had been under pressure since last month, when the collapse of two other US lenders sparked fears about the state of the banking system. Authorities said they hoped the deal would resolve the panic. The failure of San Francisco-based First Republic is the second-largest in US history and the third in the country since March. Worth more than $20bn at the beginning of last month, the bank was known for its big home loan business and for its stable of wealthy clients. It was ranked as the 14th largest lender in the US at the end of last year.  The bank's 84 offices in eight states reopened on Monday as branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank after regulators seized control and sold it to the Wall Street institution. In a scramble to come up with a rescue package, US officials were understood to have contacted six banks before landing on America's largest lender, according to news agency AFP. US President Joe Biden said the actions would ensure that the banking system was ""safe and sound"". But the deal appeared poised to renew political debate about financial regulation and the power of America's biggest banks.  Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said the government had ""invited"" the banking giant, along with others, to ""step up, and we did"" and offered assurances about the industry.  ""This part of the crisis is over,"" he said, noting that few other banks were at risk of customers withdrawing deposits on mass, which caused the problems at First Republic and the two other lenders: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.  ""Down the road - rates going up, recession, real estate - that's a whole different issue. For now, we should take a deep breath,"" he added. Fears over the health of the US's banking system first erupted after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March. The demise a few days later of another US lender, Signature Bank sparked panic among investors and bank customers.  US authorities stepped in to guarantee deposits beyond typical limits at SVB and Signature in an effort to head off further runs on bank deposits. But that did not immediately prevent concerns from spreading.  In Europe, Swiss officials were forced to broker a rescue for troubled banking giant Credit Suisse, which saw 61.2bn Swiss francs ($69bn; £55.2bn) leave the bank in the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, a group of America's biggest banks, including JP Morgan, pumped $30bn into First Republic in a bid to stabilise the business, which was seen as vulnerable because its assets had been hurt by the rise of interest rates last year and its wealthy customers were likely to transfer funds.  First Republic's disclosure last week that it had lost roughly $100bn in deposits reignited concerns. Investors, who had already been dumping shares, bolted. The firm's shares - worth more than $120 apiece at the beginning of March - were trading for less than $4 on Friday. Mr Dimon said the big banks' deposit influx, which will now be repaid, had bought time and allowed regulators to close the firm without having to guarantee all deposits.  Shares in JP Morgan gained more than 2% following the deal, which will see it take on all $92bn deposits remaining at First Republic and ""substantially all"" of its assets, including $173bn of loans and about $30bn of securities. As part of the agreement, the FDIC will share losses on some loans with the JP Morgan and provide it with $50bn in financing. It has estimated that its insurance fund would take a hit of about $13bn in the deal. Mr Biden emphasised that under the current deal the insurance fund - which gets money from banks - would bear the costs, not taxpayers.  ""Shareholders are losing their investments and critically taxpayers are not the ones that are on the hook,"" he said. Repeating earlier calls for stronger regulation, the President said: ""We have to make sure that we're not back in this position again."" A spokesperson for the US Treasury Department said it was ""encouraged"" that the deal was carried out in a way ""that protected all depositors"". Meanwhile, the FDIC also released a proposal to change how the government insures bank deposits so that business accounts are protected beyond the current $250,000 limit, citing a need to respond to questions raised by the recent events. Betsey Stevenson, professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said First Republic did not have ""systemic problems"" but failed because customers panicked.  The takeover by JP Morgan was better than the alternative - a fire sale of First Republic's holdings, she added.   The turmoil in the banking sector is seen as part of the fallout after central banks around the world, including the US, raised interest rates sharply last year.  Those moves have hurt the value of debt with lower interest rates. Analysts have said the current issues are distinct from the 2008 financial crisis, when bad loans in the US housing market hit banks around the world, leading to enormous government bailouts and a global economic recession.  ""What's different this go-round, is that it's not credit quality that's bringing these banks down, it's been the interest rate risk,"" said David Chiaverini, managing director at Wedbush Securities. He said the most at-risk banks had now fallen but warned banks were ""not completely out of the woods"", adding others could be hurt as higher borrowing costs slow the economy and unemployment and loan defaults rise."
Debt Securities Market,What 2008 recession can teach us about this one,2024-09-14,2020-06-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52815357,"Layoffs, stock market crashes and bailouts - America has been through this before. Can we learn from the Great Recession of 2008, or are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past? The Great Recession was not caused by a deus ex machina or a stroke of bad luck - it was caused by some fundamentally poor choices made by Wall Street. During the housing boom, bankers had given mortgages to people with credit and income challenges.  Many banks then sold these mortgages off as investments called mortgage securities to other banks, who bundled the debt with other similar loans. The idea was that these bundles would make the bank more money when the loans were paid off, but when foreclosures rose, many banks began to fail. In order to fix the problem, the government passed reforms - like the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 - and created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp), a $700bn programme to let the government bail out failing banks. At the time, bailing out big banks and failing industries like the auto sector was highly controversial - many felt it was rewarding companies for making bad decisions.  But ultimately, increased oversight, coupled with financial support from the government, has been credited with keeping the financial system from completely collapsing. The current recession is not caused by a broken link within the system, but from an external threat, a worldwide pandemic. In order to keep the disease from spreading, many governments forced non-essential businesses to close and brought in lockdown orders, bringing many industries to a grinding halt.  But luckily, the overall financial system is in much better shape this time around - in part because of some of the policy changes made in response to the 2008 the recession. Markets have already partially recovered, and the Dodd-Frank act has helped make banks much healthier and able to withstand the market downturn, says Todd Knoop, an economist who researches the history of recessions at Cornell College. ""Policy makers have developed a script - while details of that script has changed over time, they have a much better idea of what to do during a crisis than they did during the Great Depression, or even in 2008,"" he says. But helping businesses has proven trickier, says Duke University economist Campbell Harvey. ""I don't even call it a bailout. A bailout to me means you're bailing out somebody that's done a bad job. Whereas this is more like aid,"" he says. The scale and the complexity of delivering this aid has proved a challenge as well. In the US, about 40% of the population is employed by over 30m small businesses. ""In the Great Recession, the policy makers could summon the CEOs of the top 25 financial institutions into a room and literally hand out their bailout cheques,"" he says. ""Whereas this recession, it's not really the financial institutions that are being hit, but (millions of) small and medium-sized businesses."" Prior to 2008, the prevailing attitude amongst economists and regulators was that markets would take care of themselves. It seemed to be working - just months before the economy began to shrink, the stock market had reached an all-time high. But the palace was built on quicksand. When foreclosures began to rise, banks that had heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities, which are investments tied to other people's home mortgages, began to fail. People lost their retirement savings, and companies completely unrelated to either banking or real estate lost investments they needed to keep their businesses afloat.  It took many by surprise. ""I think the reason why most economists didn't understand how bad this was, is most economists couldn't wrap their mind around how stupid some of the players were being,"" Mr Knoop says. To fix the problem, the US officials unveiled a number of programmes and policies aimed at getting the country back on its feet, including passing two separate stimulus packages worth approximately $1 trillion (£800bn) between 2008-2009. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero and launched a quantitative easing programme, which is when the Fed buys investments to increase cash flow. It's still early days, but politicians seem to have learned some of the lessons of 2008. ""Now we expect the government to take a very active role,"" Mr Knoop says. It took over six months from the collapse of the 85-year-old investment bank Bear Sterns - one of the earlier bank busts in the recession - for the Fed to drop the interest rate to zero in 2008. This time around, the Fed slashed interest rates to zero within days of President Trump declaring coronavirus a national emergency and spent $700bn on a new quantitative easing programme. Just two weeks later, Congress passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to help the millions of Americans out of work, and a second stimulus may be on its way. But how we go about our day-to-day lives, from taking public transport to working from an office, has completely transformed and the ""new normal"" could be here to stay for a while. Some companies like Canadian tech giant Shopify may get rid of offices altogether, while others may look into automating certain jobs. ""This is really destroying people and it's destroying human systems, in the way we share ideas and technology and interacting with each other,"" Mr Knoop says.  One of the defining aspects of the Great Recession was its length. The National Bureau of Economic Research retroactively noted that the economy first began shrinking in December 2007.  Bear Sterns investment bank collapsed in February 2008, but it wasn't until September that the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 777.68 - its largest point crash in history, until 2020. Meanwhile, jobs began to slowly disappear. By October 2010, the unemployment rate had peaked at 10%. Recessions are fuelled by uncertainty - uncertainty that the financial system can really recover, uncertainty that one's job is safe. ""If there's a lot of uncertainty, companies don't make capital investments and consumers don't spend,"" Mr Harvey says. During the Great Recession, this uncertainty dragged on. Even after the stock market recovered, and production increased, employment lagged, and it wasn't until 2017 that it returned to its pre-recession lows.  If the Great Recession was a long-term degenerative illness, then the coronavirus economic downturn is like a natural disaster that takes out everything at once, says Mr Harvey. ""You just can't pull out the playbook of 2008 and apply it to 2020,"" he says. ""With a pandemic, there's no place to really hide - everyone is affected around the world."" Between March and April, the unemployment rate jumped 10 points to over 14%. GDP - the value of goods and services made in the US - dropped by nearly 5%. But there is a silver lining, Mr Harvey says.  The uncertainty of this recession is mostly biological - in the beginning, we didn't know how deadly the disease was, what its side effects were, or what kinds of treatments might be effective. But as time goes on, science advances.  As soon as a vaccine is developed, companies will be able to reopen without fear, which means they can rehire people, Mr Harvey says. Whereas in 2008, it wasn't clear when it was going to end. There are signs the economy is already starting to recover - data from May released on Friday shows that the unemployment rate has gone down to 13%, a slight decline from April's high of 14.7%. Everyone won't make it, Mr Harvey says - some will close their doors permanently. ""The key thing for policy makers is to minimise the collateral damage,"" he says. That means ensuring that stimulus packages are hearty enough to keep good businesses on life support until they can reopen their doors. But some are sceptical everything will start right back up again. ""When the economy starts up, when social distancing comes to an end, when we have a vaccine, will employment go right back up to where it was the day before the pandemic hit?"" asks Mr Knoop. ""Who knows, maybe, but I think it's kind of unlikely."""
Debt Securities Market,Spotify closes in on stock market listing,2024-09-14,2018-01-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42559194,"Music streaming company Spotify has reportedly filed papers with US regulators to list its shares publicly on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The firm hopes to launch its shares in the first three months of the year, say reports by Axios and Bloomberg.  Spotify, which declined to comment, has been preparing for the listing for months. It plans to list shares directly on the NYSE, bypassing the traditional stock offering process. Spotify is the world's biggest music streaming company, ahead of rivals like Apple and Amazon. Founded in Sweden, the firm has more than 140 million active users in 61 countries, but it has continued to report losses. It raised $1bn (£740m) in a debt deal with private equity companies in 2016, an agreement with terms linked to an eventual public offering. Those terms, which include escalating interest rates and the ability to convert debt to discounted shares, make it expensive for Spotify to wait before going public, said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages funds focused on IPOs. But she said the decision to list directly could make for a shaky launch. ""It's going to be probably a choppy beginning to find its value,"" she said. In a typical public offering, companies issue new shares, with the initial price underwritten by investment banks. With a direct listing, current Spotify shareholders will take their shares directly to the market. News outlets Axios and Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Spotify sent papers in late December to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in preparation for such a move. The SEC declined to comment. Eventually, more information about the company and its plans will be disclosed.  Ms Smith said the presence of insiders among initial stock sellers could raise doubts about the firm's prospects. Lawsuits accusing Spotify of infringing on songwriter rights could also raise questions for investors, she added."
Debt Securities Market,The best TV shows of 2021,2024-09-14,2021-12-17,Hugh Montgomery and Eddie Mullan and Amy Charles,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210415-the-best-tv-shows-of-2021-so-far,"From Squid Game to Succession, Ted Lasso, Mare of Easttown and Maid, Hugh Montgomery, Amy Charles and Eddie Mullan pick the year’s greatest programmes to binge right now. Yellowjackets It's a risky endeavour putting a show on the ""best of the year"" list when only half of its first season has aired so far – and yet, however it pans out, Yellowjackets is a show that already demands recognition for its verve, style and ferocity. A horror-meets-black-comedy-meets-teen-drama, it tells a split-timeline story, with both parts full of intrigue. In the mid-1990s, a plane containing a girls' high-school soccer team from New Jersey crashes in the Canadian wilderness, leading to Lord of the Flies-style power battles among the stranded survivors. And then in the present day, we catch up with some of those survivors, now in their 40s, as they are forced to reckon with exactly what happened all those years ago. Many critics have compared it to Lost, and it certainly shares the narrative lure of that series, but it is also very much its own beast, as well as a gleefully perverse nostalgia-hit for many millennials, with its 1990s-rock soundtrack and casting of some of that era's spikiest young stars Christina Ricci and Juliette Lewis among the grown-up versions of the characters. And unlike Lost, which of course lost the plot as it went on, I have a feeling some satisfactory – if nasty – answers are coming. Available on Sky/Now TV in the UK and on Showtime in the US. Maid Amid TV's ongoing obsession with the lives of the super-rich or aspirationally affluent, it hardly needs saying that not enough attention is paid to those on the other end of the socio-economic spectrum: the have-nots rather than the haves. Which is what made this Netflix limited series, an adaptation of Stephanie Land's bestselling memoir about her life as a single mother on the breadline, so welcome. Margaret Qualley plays Alex, a young woman living in the US Pacific Northwest and struggling to get a footing in society. When we first see her, she is fleeing from her abusive and alcoholic boyfriend with their young daughter, which leads her down a path of nightmare bureaucracy, as she tries to find both accommodation for the two of them and a job that might allow her to pay the bills. One of the great things about the show is the detail with which it shades in the financial and administrative obstacles of Alex's situation, at some points offering a tally of her incomings and outgoings that flashes up on screen, while it's equally strong on the emotional realities of dealing with abusive partners and loved ones with mental health issues – in this case, a bipolar mother, played by Qualley's own mum Andie MacDowell. And while there is some irony in Hollywood mother-daughter royalty like MacDowell and Qualley leading a story like this, the power of their performances cannot be doubted. Altogether, it manages to hit a sweet spot between sobering authenticity and skilfully-played sentimentality that means for all that its subject matter may be harrowing, you wish you could live with these characters for a while longer. Available on Netflix internationally. Squid Game For a rather more surreal take on the rich-poor divide, meanwhile, there was the one show that swept all before it this year: Squid Game. This South Korean drama is about desperate people in debt who sign up to compete in a series of sadistic, life-or-death takes on old playground games in order to try and win a huge cash prize. Three months on from its premiere, it is odd to think how a show that is a merciless critique of capitalism became collectively reconstituted as a kind of benignly-amusing pop cultural product, with people dressing up in the contestants' green tracksuits for Halloween and sales in the Korean honeycomb candy – featured as the centrepiece of one trial – booming. But leaving that irony aside, the show in itself is a brilliantly-conceived near-masterpiece, whose surreal production design and twisted childhood references conspire to make it feel like something dredged from one's subconscious, and whose writing is on occasion as beautiful as its violence is brutal. Inevitably, the fact it has become Netflix's biggest show of all time means a second series is in the works, though whether its high-concept can sustain one is questionable. But, beyond its own future, it has impacted the future of the whole TV ecosystem by definitively proving the global reach that non-English language content can have – and for that we should all be thankful. Available on Netflix internationally. Succession After two years away thanks to the pandemic, this critical darling returned this autumn with what was undoubtedly a difficult third series – the chief difficulty being, where did this tale of corporate amorality and diseased democracy have left to run? The answer is, in many ways, nowhere: what we saw was more of the same endless cycle of power-plays among the Roy family, which led more than one critic to conclude that the show, in its sheer stasis, was really a sitcom disguised as a prestige drama. Except set against that was the genuinely tortured and tortuous-to-watch performance of Jeremy Strong (dissected in a now-infamous New Yorker profile), his staring into the emotional abyss coming to a head in a finale which saw him collapsed on the ground outside a Tuscan palazzo, ruined by the weight of his guilt and self-loathing. This run undoubtedly showed up the show's limitations and deficiencies, notably its decision to marginalise the real-world consequences of the Roys' diseased reign, which seemed smartly reflective of its characters self-absorption at first, but now risks appearing glib. But it seems churlish to complain too much about a show that is still as exquisitely refined in its artistry as its characters are obscene. Available on Sky/Now TV in the UK and HBO Max in the US.   Only Murders in the Building Amid all the epic television with something important to say out there, it's nice to find a show that makes a virtue of its smallness – something like this murder mystery comedy, as sweet, moreish and easily digestible as a petit four. Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez play the unlikely trio of amateur sleuths investigating a murder in their Upper West Side New York apartment block – with the 21st- Century conceit that they also decide to turn the case into a true-crime podcast. With its peppy, neurotic badinage, the whole thing is a little Woody Allen, though it has a sincere, open-hearted quality all of its own, while the two Martins' familiar chemistry (founded on a long friendship and co-starring in films like The Three Amigos and Father of the Bride) is complemented perfectly by Gomez's spiky charm. And as it rolls towards its denouement, it continues to be light on its feet, while being just consequential enough, in exploring themes like loss, loneliness, and friendship, to feel not altogether frivolous. The finale baldly sets up a new series – and in this case, there's something about the show's self-assurance of tone and character that means you don't doubt that a second run will be just as much of a delight. Available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally. We are Lady Parts Forget abstract conversations about representation and diversity in TV – and instead turn to this comedy about an all-female, all-Muslim punk band in East London for a showcase in how giving a platform to hitherto unheard voices and experiences is not only right, but can result in singularly exhilarating TV. Written by Nida Manzoor and inspired by aspects of her own life and upbringing, through its six episodes it is a total blast from start to finish. Anchored by an astonishingly deft and expressive comic performance from Anjana Vasan as Amina, the band's new-recruit guitarist, it also features some inspired and rip-roaring tunes written by Manzoor and her siblings. Arguably, no show this year was quite as joyous. Available on All4 in the UK and Peacock in the US.   Starstruck Starstruck begins, as most romantic comedies do, with a meet-cute. Jessie – juggling two jobs in London to scrape a living – hooks up with Tom, after meeting him in a nightclub on New Year's Eve. But what she doesn’t realise is that Tom is an internationally-famous actor. After being mistaken for his cleaner by the paparazzi camped outside his house, Jessie (New Zealand comic Rose Matafeo, who also created and co-wrote the series) must confront her deepest insecurities, and come to terms with the surreal situation of having a relationship with a megastar, all while making terrible life decisions. This rom-com hits all the right notes, Matafeo is a turbulent but loveable hero you can't help but root for, and Nikesh Patel is convincing as an uncomfortable star yearning for normality. Aside from the main storyline about the couple, one of this series' greatest attributes is its exploration of friendship. Being from New Zealand, Jessie has been forced to create an alternative family in London, and her relationship with housemate Kate (Emma Sidi) is a delightful portrait of modern female friendship, with all the highs and lows involved. Shortly after its debut, Matafeo announced on Twitter that filming had already begun for the second series, so expect to see more of this hilarious and endearing sitcom soon. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK and HBO Max in the US. Shrill The third and final season of this quietly revolutionary comedy once again takes on huge topics, including racism, privilege and fatphobia, with a deft hand. Aidy Bryant's Annie Easton, the protagonist based on writer Lindy West, from whose memoir the show is adapted, is finally comfortable in her own skin, able to express herself through her writing and empowered in her love life. But this self-assurance comes at a cost when Annie writes an opinion piece that appears to excuse racism, causing a deep rift between her and long-time best friend Fran (the inimitable Lolly Adefope). One of the best things about this series has been seeing Fran growing into the co-lead, with the show sympathetically exploring her relationship with Em (E R Fightmaster), as well as her personal growth as a standalone character. The supporting ensemble has continued to delight, with John Cameron Mitchell's excruciating editor Gabe and Patti Harrison's hilarious, one-liner-producing PA Ruthie stealing the whole show. During its three-season run, Shrill has pulled off what so many other comedies fail to do: be genuinely funny, heartwarming and diverse all at once. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK and Hulu in the US.   Bo Burnham: Inside In the face of lockdowns in March 2020, many made resolutions to use the extra time on their hands to ""create"". And if Shakespeare wrote King Lear during a plague, so  someone would conjure up a similar masterpiece this time around, it was pondered. Now, whether anyone thought said masterpiece would see comic Bo Burnham singing ""I made you some content, daddy made you your favourite, open wide"" while sat in his underwear, a head-torch lighting a disco ball, is doubtful, but a masterpiece his Netflix film Inside surely is. Burnham first made comedic waves on YouTube, writing and performing funny songs to audiences of millions throughout his high school years, before taking to stand-up, film direction (the brilliant Eighth Grade), and acting (Promising Young Woman). Inside marked Burnham's first return to musical comedy performance since 2016, but instead of being on stage in front of a crowd of thousands, he wrote, shot, directed and edited this project entirely alone, in a single room, serving up an exploration of the horrors of both lockdown, specifically, and modernity, more generally. The sheer brilliance of the songwriting coupled with Burnham's meticulously-crafted performances, which reflected the surreal nature of the last couple of years, made Inside potentially one of the defining pieces of pandemic art. Available on Netflix internationally. Hellbound In a year which felt like a turning point for mainstream popularity of non-English language TV drama, two South Korean dystopian dramas stood head and shoulders above the crowd. The first was the aforementioned Squid Game, and the other was Hellbound, a bizarre horror in which people suddenly receive a ""declaration"" from a disembodied face, telling them exactly when they will die and that they are destined for Hell. When the moment of their demise then comes, three hulking, smoking monsters appear out of thin air, kill the ""sinner"" in a spectacularly gruesome fashion, destroying whatever's in their way, and burn the sinner to a crisp before disappearing seconds later. The sudden emergence of these terrifying monsters sees the equally terrifying rise of The New Truth, a religious organisation which claim to have the answers to who is chosen and why. Yoo Ah-in delivers one of the performances of the year as Chairman Jung, the frighteningly compelling leader of The New Truth, while Kim Hyun-joo's Min Hye-jin is a consistently sympathetic heroine. Created by Yeon Sang-ho (Train to Busan), this horror series is much more than brutal monster gore; it's a clever study of power, social media and misinformation and what fear will do to people. Here's hoping a second season will be announced. Available on Netflix internationally. Time This magnificent three-parter takes a clear-eyed look at the harsh realities of prison life from the perspective of both prisoner and guard: Mark (Sean Bean) is a former teacher serving a four-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving in a prison where Eric (Stephen Graham) is a rule-abiding officer. It's not an easy watch; the programme unflinchingly covers a myriad of devastating topics including mental illness, suicide, addiction and violent bullying, and forces the viewer to reckon with their own preconceptions of prisoners. Ben is earth-shattering in his  portrayal of a broken man who is trying to pick up the pieces of his life,  while Graham's offers a compelling portrait of the fragility of power, and the pain of trying to do the right thing. Time is British drama at its grittiest best: looking squarely in the face of one of the hidden parts of society and creating compelling, devastating art from it. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK and Britbox in the US. The Underground Railroad After a year in which many of us have gravitated towards ""comfort TV"" as a salve for the tumult around us, The Underground Railroad was perhaps the necessary counterbalance: a profound piece of art, as beautiful as it is uncompromising, that urges the very deepest engagement. Based on Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer-prize winning novel of the same name, its alt-history narrative follows Cora, a young woman in antebellum America who escapes from the plantation where she is enslaved via the titular underground railroad, a literal manifestation of something which in reality was a metaphor for the social networks that helped enslaved people to their freedom. What follows, as she ventures Gulliver's Travel-like from region to region, is a stunning survey of the spectrum of racism, inequity, forced compromises and false dawns that black people in America faced, and continue to face, as intellectually detailed as it is viscerally brutal. Every element is perfectly judged, from the coiled intensity of Thuso Mbedu's lead performance to the jarringly beautiful, gliding camerawork that somehow reflects the callous indifference of a society to the violence it sanctions – it is, quite simply, essential viewing, though we would advise taking it slowly, so as to let each of the 10 episodes really sink in. Available on Amazon Prime internationally.      The White Lotus There is a select group of people (including this writer) who have been banging on for years about the underappreciation and premature cancellation of Enlightened, the HBO comedy-drama from 2011-2013, starring Laura Dern as a middle-ranking executive for a conglomerate, driven to upset the applecart after a breakdown and a trip to a Hawaiian retreat. Well, clearly creator Mike White was simply a decade ahead of the curve, as his new show has comparable themes, elements and tonality, but has ended up being one of the summer's great talking points. Where previously White focused on the after-effects of a tropical getaway, here the drama is firmly centred on the getaway itself: a luxury resort, again in Hawaii, where a group of mostly white, wealthy tourists are trying, and failing, to relax. As they project their unprocessed neuroses onto each other, and the endlessly trying-to-be-patient staff, it is clear that this holiday is not going to end well for anyone involved – something, to be fair, already given away by an introductory flash-forward scene featuring someone in a body bag. It's a series that works on many different, interconnected planes at once – as a wincingly effective cringe comedy, a satire of American imperialism, and, complete with ​​Cristobal Tapia de Veer's eerie ""Hawaiian Hitchcock"" score, a nightmarish social horror. Perhaps its closest companion overall, in its trenchant study of unchecked privilege, is its HBO stablemate Succession – though White has made the distinction that ""[with Succession] you can kind of otherize them. They’re billionaires. With White Lotus, I wanted it to be more, like, this is your next-door-neighbor rich person who is part of the system."" Certainly, though, it provokes similarly queasy laughter. Available on Sky/Now TV in the UK and HBO Max in the US.   Feel Good  It takes confidence to really shift the direction of a show from one series to the next, but that is what the brilliant comedian-writer Mae Martin has done with the second series of their semi-autobiographical comedy-drama. Where the first run set itself up as a romantic comedy centred on the contrasting lives, chemistry and combustions of nascent couple Mae and George (Charlotte Ritchie), the second is much more tightly-focused on a particular theme, as Mae faces up to the shadow cast by the harassment and abuse she has suffered – most centrally her grooming as a teenager by an older man who is now a friend. In exploring a reckoning with historic abuse, it feels timely, but in no way calculatedly so, and the fact it is rooted in autobiography is evident in the nuance with which it depicts Mae's conflicting emotions. Indeed, for all the disarming charm of both its writing and its star, it feels of a piece with Michaela Coel's I May Destroy You in its very singular study of trauma and its effects. Sadly – but probably rightly – there will be no more, but Martin, a gifted stand-up, surely has a big screen future ahead: indeed, they already have another Netflix show in the works. Available on Netflix internationally.   Ted Lasso Sometimes a TV show benefits from landing at just the right moment. Such was the case when Ted Lasso launched on Apple TV+ at the tail end of last summer: an unassuming sitcom on a still-novice platform, initially this tale of a supernaturally chirpy American football coach (Jason Sudeikis) taking charge of a British soccer team didn't make much noise. But over a period of months, it grew to become a genuine word-of-mouth hit as audiences craved what it was offering amid the continuing real-world bleakness: not so much its humour as its sincerity, warmth and milk of human kindness. This year, it returned for a second series with a great deal more expectation in tow – but what's great is how unaffected by such pressure it seems. Instead, it continues in the same beguilingly easy groove, and if it's rarely laugh-out-loud funny, that doesn't really matter. This is a show that leaves you with that inimitable fuzzy feeling, for its enveloping spirit of camaraderie, its unfettered love for its characters and its satisfying (if not unpredictable) subversion of stereotypes, from seemingly-hyper-macho-but-secretly-softie retired captain Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) to sharp-as-a-tack glamour model-influencer Keeley (Juno Temple). And it also knows how to stage a crowd-pleasing moment, such as in this series' third episode, with the team's eminently admirable stand against an unethical sponsor. With its haul of Emmys in September, it may no longer be the plucky underdog, but it's a worthy champ. Available on Apple TV+ internationally. I Think You Should Leave By contrast, if you’re looking for a comedy that takes a rather dimmer view of humankind, then US comic Tim Robinson's surreally electric sketch show I Think You Should Leave, now on its second series, is just the ticket: like much sketch comedy, it's scattershot enough that it is difficult to quite distil the essence of its genius, but if it nails one thing repeatedly, it's the fragility of the social contract: from using needlessly crude language on a haunted house tour to stealing someone's dinner across the restaurant table, characters repeatedly drive scenes of spiralling awkwardness with a breathtaking lack of self-awareness that is both excruciating and exhilarating in equal measure. Overall, there's something perversely refreshing about its misanthropy: not only that of its characters, with their inability to behave graciously when interacting with their fellow humans, but that of the show itself, with its transgressive belief that, if truth be told, we are a species mired in our pettinesses and our pomposities. And as for the already infamous ""Coffin Flop"" sketch? Assuredly, once you've seen it, you will not even be able to read those two words together without a Pavlovian attack of the hysterics. Available on Netflix internationally. Mare of Easttown  Both mesmerising and believable as a small-town Pennsylvania detective, Kate Winslet has made an unglamorous return to TV, a decade on from her only other small-screen appearance in Mildred Pierce, and it marks a career-best for the star. Set in the hometown region where screenwriter Brad Ingelsby grew up, the HBO crime series is essentially an old-fashioned whodunnit located within a close-knit working-class community that is weighed down by traumatic events. The story follows detective Mare Sheehan (Winslet) as she investigates the murder of a local girl while trying to cope with her own bereavement and divorce. Disappearing into the hard-boiled role, complete with an unbroken Delaware county ""Delco"" accent, Winslet shows us a woman who will do anything to protect her family and doesn't suffer fools. Sure, there are red herrings aplenty, and jaw-dropping moments that lesser shows would simply end the series on, but aside from the Twin Peaks-style murder mystery element (hidden double lives, strange goings-on in the woods), the success of Mare is testament to Ingelsby's writing allowing time for us to get to know the characters, as Mare and her tough-as-nails mother (Jean Smart) flit in and out of their neighbours' lives, chatting with a beer around a dinner table, or chasing down every detail to find justice and help a town in turmoil heal. Available on Now TV/Sky Atlantic in the UK and HBO Max in the US. Loki Following the success of the wonderful, oddball WandaVision earlier in the year, this latest much-anticipated Marvel series on Disney+ once again delivers, with a chaotic, time-hopping misadventure focused on Tom Hiddleston’s God of Mischief. Following on from the events of Avengers: Endgame, prince of Asgard, Loki, escapes imprisonment through a time portal using the powerful Tesseract, only to find himself in the clutches of the Minutemen, an elite team of soldiers working for the mysterious Time Variance Authority to track down any pesky variants disrupting the flow of time. Occupying a drab 1950s retro-futuristic style office, the TVA's bureaucrats govern what they call ""the sacred timeline"" and eradicate or ""prune"" anyone who messes with reality. Loki comes to the attention of senior TVA agent Mobius (Owen Wilson), who arranges a reprieve from the court of Judge Renslayer (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), persuading her instead to allow him to recruit the not-entirely-trustworthy Loki to help repair the issues he has created in the timeline. Available internationally on Disney+. Katla A supernatural mystery from Icelandic co-creators Sigurjón Kjartansson and Baltasar Kormákur who worked together on 2015 hit Trapped, Katla tells the story of a small community struggling to survive in the shadow of an active subglacial volcano. Rescue worker Gríma (Guðrún Eyfjörð), searches for her sister who disappeared the day Katla's eruption started, over a year ago. Just as hope of ever finding her body fades, the remaining residents within the restricted area of Vík start to receive visits from unexpected guests from their past. An ash-caked woman appears on the glacier, but when taken to hospital it's revealed she's a Swedish woman named Gunhild (Aliette Opheim), who worked at a local hotel 20 years previous.Then another person materialises: Ása, Grima's sister, thought to have been dead. The intriguing premise behind this series could so easily have devolved into derivative horror storytelling, but Katla's blend of folklore, sci-fi and isolated, bleak setting allows for a series that is more than anything an exploration of loss, and whose deep mystery unravels slowly. Available on Netflix internationally. Unforgotten Such is the glut of crime dramas, it's difficult for any new show in the genre to truly stand out, but this exceptional British effort makes it look easy – proving that what you really need to elevate your procedural is not high concepts or clever-clever twists, but just beautiful and humane writing. Through three series, creator Chris Lang has used the premise of coppers DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and DS Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) investigating a years-old but newly-unearthed murder as a way to tell powerful stories of guilt, shame and regret – and this year's fourth run, focusing on the discovery of a body on that links four former friends, who were all once trainee police officers, is  no less powerful. Meanwhile the real highlight of the show again is the incredible central performance by Walker, one of the very most natural and organic screen actors there is. Extraordinary for being so ordinary, Stuart is not a tortured detective type but an exceptional, sympathetic yet understandably harried professional trying to do her best – and without giving anything way, this series makes us value her, and Walker, more than ever. Available on ITV Hub in the UK and on Amazon Prime worldwide. Framing Britney Spears Rare is it that a piece of television comes along that feels quite as important as this New York Times-produced documentary about the pop icon, and her mistreatment over her two-decade long career from all sides: the press and paparazzi, the music industry, her own family and associates and everyone who has readily consumed her very public suffering as entertainment. When it premiered in February, it was the catalyst for a much wider discussion about the collective, abject sexism directed at young women in the public eye – a conversation that continued with Spears' singing superstar peer Demi Lovato's YouTube series Dancing with the Devil. And then, only last month, Spears finally escaped the conversatorship that had taken away her rights to make decisions about her life and career for the last 14 years. In light of this happy ending of a kind, this documentary nevertheless stands as an important historic testimony of one of the grimmest episodes in 21st century pop culture. Available on Sky Documentaries in the UK and Hulu in the US. It’s a Sin From The Normal Heart to Angels in America, there have been a number of landmark works about the US Aids crisis of the 1980s, but not enough depicting the scourge of the pandemic elsewhere – which is what makes Russell T Davies' six-part exploration of what was happening in the UK at the time so welcome. A co-production with HBO, it is a masterful blend of comedy, tragedy, and pop hits, which perhaps showcases Davies' unique brilliance as a writer better than any show he's done before: that is, his particular ability to combine the immense warmth and homeliness of a classic British soap with a righteous anger that gradually, then suddenly unfurls itself. A fine young ensemble includes Olly Alexander, Callum Scott Howells, and Omari Douglas as the central trio of young gay men, moving to the big city and with no idea what's in store, while they're supported by a fine selection of more experienced names, the best of all being Neil Patrick Harris as an impish Savile Row tailor. And if it's depiction of how the victims of a pandemic were turned into pariahs would have cut deeply at any time, right now its resonance is even more gut-wrenching. Available on All4 in the UK and HBO Max in the US. WandaVision With Disney extending its Marvel Cinematic Universe to the small screen, it couldn't really have created a better advert for the added creative possibilities therein. This marvellously surreal nine-episode limited series centres on Avenger Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), as she finds herself living in an ever-evolving alternate universe, modelled on various sitcoms through the eras, alongside her hitherto thought-to-be-destroyed robot husband Vision (Paul Bettany). Early episodes were such joyfully pinpoint pastiches of sitcom form that it is almost a shame when the show devolves into more typical Marvel fare in its latter stages. Nevertheless, it still counts as the MCU's most daring move yet, a piece that both offers sharp meta-commentary on the medium of TV and a poignant exploration of grief. Olsen and Bettany navigate the tonal shifts masterfully as the titular couple, though it is long-time indie favourite Kathryn Hahn who steals the show – and furnished the memes – as jarringly enthusiastic neighbour Agnes. Available on Disney+ internationally. Call My Agent French TV is having a bit of a moment, with a number of series becoming international talking points – and chief among them is this stiletto-sharp comedy-drama about a Paris talent agency, whose fourth series premiered internationally on Netflix in January after broadcasting in France late last year. Its central conceit is that each episode features a particular client, who is in fact a real-life star playing themselves - and for the first time, this new run looked beyond France for its cameos, with a special appearance by Hollywood’s finest, Sigourney Weaver. Other than that, however, it is deliciously acerbic business as usual; as the BBC's Will Gompertz noted it “maintains the same rarefied heights of excellence of the previous three, as our bold and increasingly beleaguered agents do battle with the corporate ogre that is StarMédia, an array of recalcitrant actors, and – mostly – each other. But though it was also purported to be the final series, fans will be glad to know that there has been a stay of execution: a fifth series and a standalone film have been confirmed. Available on Netflix internationally. The Investigation Over six detailed and sober episodes we never meet the killer – and we don't hear his name. In this retelling of the real-life investigation into the murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, Borgen actor Søren Malling leads the cast as Jens Møller, the stern Head of Homicide for Copenhagen police. Alongside chief prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen (fellow Borgen star Pilou Asbæk), Møller works non-stop to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Wall, last seen going to interview an inventor for a story on a homemade submarine in Copenhagen harbour, was indeed murdered. In telling the story of how people worked together to solve a crime, without reproducing the gruesome crime itself, director Tobias Lindholm's understated dramatisation of the ‘submarine case’ became a radical reinvention of the true-crime genre. In a behind-the-scenes podcast, Lindholm explained that in focusing on the professionals – the divers, forensics, investigators – making sacrifices and missing important time with family to tirelessly do get the job done, it was a way to “humanise the dehumanised… and offer a confrontation with our behaviours as media consumers”. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK and HBO Max in the US. Can’t Get You Out of My Head In a sprawling six-part series for BBC iPlayer, British journalist Adam Curtis reflects on how in the age of the individual, fundamental power structures governing us all haven't gone away. Tracing the different forces that have led to now, over eight hours the wide-ranging films chronicle the growing anger and anxieties in China, Russia and the Western world, and how this came about. Featuring off-beat archival footage of figures in politics and culture – soundtracked with Curtis's signature choice selection of pop music – the montage of film essays focuses on the loosely interconnected stories of historical revolutionaries. Telling the individual tales of Jiang Qing, Afeni Shakur, Edward Limonov, and Michael X, filmmaker Curtis sets out the argument that it was all of us – self-expressing individuals, politicians and technocrats – who together made these strange times we're living through. It doesn't provide any answers, but through his typical dazzling, yet untraditional collage documentary format, Curtis does at least offer us an explanation of the dynamics of our time. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK. Resident Alien Far funnier than its farcical premise should allow, this comedy-drama based on the Dark Horse comic series provided much-needed escapism and so became Syfy's highest-rated new drama in recent years. Alan Tudyk (Firefly) stars as Harry Vanderspeegle – real name unpronounceable – an alien who, after crash-landing in the mountains outside the small town of Patience, Colorado, has killed and taken the physical form of the first man he encounters. After a stint alone in a fishing cabin learning English by watching Law & Order reruns, we learn that Harry's secret mission on Earth is to destroy humanity – but he's lost his detonation device in the mountains, so he needs to assimilate into his new home to buy some time to uncover it. Tudyk brilliantly reveals the alien's flawed personality, flicking between comedy and menace with ease, as we follow Harry posing unconvincingly as a human doctor. Things, however, are going to plan, until Harry gets embroiled in solving a local murder (""Chung chung!""), bringing him closer to the townsfolk and especially workmate Asta (Sara Tomko), while he also discovers a love of pizza. As time goes on, Harry begins to wrestle with the moral dilemma of his mission. Available on Sky/Now TV in the UK and SyFy in the US. Lupin One of the year's first hit shows was the delightful high-energy French heist comedy, inspired by classic stories of gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, written in the early 1900s. Many binged the slick and fast-moving series, released in two halves of five episodes each, and it's not difficult to see why: Actor Omar Sy oozes charm as Assane Diop, a towering con artist with the smooth style of Bond and the wits of Sherlock, who sets out to avenge his father for an injustice inflicted by a wealthy family. As the only son of an immigrant from Senegal who had come to France to seek a better life, his father is framed over the theft of a diamond necklace by his powerful employer, Hubert Pellegrini. After his father dies in prison, teenager Assane is left an orphan. When we meet Assane 25 years on, inspired by a book about a certain gentleman thief his father had given him on his birthday, our hero sets out to right a wrong, using his mastery of disguise and subterfuge.

Debt Securities Market,"Study this, harm your credit",2024-09-14,2014-11-03,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131015-study-this-harm-your-credit,"When it comes to economics, a little knowledge may truly be a dangerous thing. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff report suggests that high school students exposed to economics education develop worse credit habits than those taught in math and financial literacy. That might sound odd, since economics is steeped in lessons of costs and benefits, supply and demand, and inflation and interest rates — not to mention historical lessons. But it’s possible that such lessons in markets and macro just aren’t relevant to scores of teens who just need to learn about budgeting, debt and saving before they hit adulthood. In “Financial Education and the Debt Behavior of the Young,” the working paper’s authors — looking to test whether mathematics, financial literacy or economics education in US secondary schools affected a student’s approach to taking on debt in early adulthood — found that economics education was, effectively, bad for your credit health. (See the end of this story for how the study was conducted.) Meanwhile, more mathematics education had no bearing on whether a student would take on debt and, actually, people with more exposure to math had “improved credit scores, a lower likelihood of delinquencies, and a lower likelihood of debt use.”  Mandatory financial literacy, which is not standardised across states, but generally focuses on core curricula of decision-making, career planning, personal budgeting, borrowing and investing, had a positive effect on students’ credit later on, including the likelihood of “higher credit scores, fewer delinquencies, and lower debt, particularly debt that is used to support consumption, such as credit card and auto debt.” So, what about economics courses? These courses teach about the world around us; how and why markets behave like they do; why things costs what they do; and how markets and people behave in times of abundance or scarcity. They teach about luxury goods and commodities. Surely, these are real-life lessons to take home? Well, students with mandatory high-school instruction in economics had more delinquent accounts, more accounts in collections and lower risk scores. So what gives? The authors surmise that “exposure to basic economic concepts may make students more comfortable with debt and increase their participation in the credit markets.” Essentially, taking on debt seems like less of a big deal once you know how it works. Unlike theoretical concepts in mathematics or the more personal lessons of responsible debt use common in financial literacy course, economics courses — macro and micro — are focused more on nation-states and product markets than your back pocket.  The study’s findings — both positive and negative — were magnified for older participants. The beneficial impact of more math education increased with age. Financial literacy showed similar results, with one exception, that older subjects were more likely to declare bankruptcy (seen in this study as a positive use of the clean-slate approach to dealing with debt.) On the other hand, those with economics backgrounds ended up having lower risk scores and greater delinquent accounts. Why does all of this matter? Immediately following the dot-com crash and the financial crisis, policy-makers and market observers were searching for answers to head off the next crisis. But the implementation of secondary education courses on financial literacy and economics, without outcomes testing, could (and perhaps has) lead us to the conclusion that we’re teaching people just enough to be dangerous. Of course, views on the study’s conclusions will be influenced by your own perception of debt and borrowing. Some see debt as simply a lifestyle-enabler in early adulthood (buying a car or house); others may view it as a necessity (student loans). Additionally, the study did not isolate demographics (income or family financial situation) or tendencies among a demographic group for certain types of education or spending dynamics. The study also did not break down the content in each course or how they were taught to attempt to isolate particular weaknesses.  But the results still provide a valuable reality check. Following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the US created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to lead a national effort on financial awareness and sponsor financial research, adding to efforts already put forth by the US Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, the Securities and Exchange Commission, industry lobbying groups, private institutions and not-for-profits which have financial literacy and education as their sole focus. While no one would ever expect standardisation of early financial literacy education, research like this FRBNY study may show that economics education could produce better outcomes when layered in with financial literacy rather than seen as a proxy for it. How the study was conducted: The researchers looked at increases in state-level mandates for more advanced mathematics courses, economics education and financial literacy across US states that made changes to curriculum between 1999 and 2012. They looked at credit profiles and risk scores in those states for 22- to 28-year-olds before and after curriculum changes. They also tested for “false positives” by time-shifting the data: what if the new courses started five years earlier? "
Debt Securities Market,Why citizenship is now a commodity,2024-09-14,2017-05-30,Katie Beck,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170530-why-citizenship-is-now-a-commodity,"As more people are willing to move countries for opportunity and stability, anti-immigration policies and tightened borders are prompting a rise in ‘citizenship for sale’. On a recent flight, I was idly flipping through the inflight magazine, when I came across an unusual advert promising “a unique strategy to safeguard your future prosperity and security.” The advert was plugging what it called “citizenship by investment.” I’d heard of citizenship-for-sale initiatives in the past, and – prompted by the ad – I briefly wondered whether a second citizenship beyond my American one was something I might need. Is this something that people other than the uber rich are considering, and for reasons other than tax optimisation? And if so, why? “The global rise of populist movements, together with an ever-increasing sentiment towards the creation of insular societies have all contributed to the unpredictability of our rapidly changing world,” explained the advert. As more countries tighten their borders and paths to immigration, a new industry is working to bypass those restrictions – for a hefty fee. A desire to stay global Investment citizenship programmes are not new. They’ve been around for decades, primarily as a way for countries to boost their incomes. Canada and the Caribbean island of St Kitts and Nevis started theirs in the 1980s and the US and UK began similar ones in the 1990s. The specifics of different investment citizenship programmes vary by country. They allow foreigners to invest in real-estate projects and businesses, buy property, or to donate money directly to a country’s government in exchange for a visa or passport. St. Kitts and Nevis launched its initiative in 1984, one year after the fledgling country claimed independence from the UK. The aim was to get more money flowing in from entrepreneurs who saw value in tropical beaches and low taxes. It only attracted a few hundred participants in the beginning. But, by 2009, backed by a marketing campaign, passport holders of the island nation were given visa-free access to the 26 Schengen area countries and demand increased rapidly. The industry has seen huge growth in recent years. 2014 marked the first year that the US ran out of immigrant-investor visas before the end of the fiscal year. London-based CS Global Partners, the consultancy firm that made the inflight-magazine advert I read, shepherds investors through the legal process of procuring a passport through investment. The firm says interest in their services has grown fourfold in the past year. “We are definitely seeing big shifts,” says CEO Micha Emmett. “The traditional market still exists – very much so – but we’ve seen [people from] countries that were never interested in second citizenship by investment options before now coming online making inquiries. For example, we saw a 400% increase in enquiries from Turkey in March.” Events including the decision by Britain to leave the European Union and the 2016 US Presidential election are driving new interest. UK citizens are now seriously weighing their options, Emmett says. “In terms of what happened in the UK with Brexit, on the day that the vote was announced, our phones rang off the hook, I was approached in the street by people, there was a very apparent panic,” she adds. A changing clientele  Wealthy, private investors from emerging market economies are driving the trend, according to The International Monetary Fund. Data from the controversial EB-5 visa programme in the US, which allows foreigners to invest in real-estate projects in exchange for a fast-tracked green card application, shows the demographics are shifting, according to Peter Joseph, executive director of Invest In USA, an industry trade organisation for the programme. “We are seeing a few countries adding to a diversifying trend. China is the predominate source [of applicants], making up about 80%, but places like Vietnam, India and Brazil have been sources of growth in the past few years,” he says. Paul Williams of La Vida Golden Visas, which specialises in second residency and citizenship within Europe, works with clients from over 50 countries. Since Britain voted for Brexit, he says, he has seen an interest from UK citizens for the first time. Citizenship: a hot commodity The most well-known programmes are in the Caribbean, where white sand beaches, low investment minimums, non-restrictive residency requirements and quick processing times combine to attract investors. For example, to become a citizen of the Caribbean island of Dominica, which sits between Guadeloupe and Martinique, you’ll need an investment of $100,000, with no requirement to spend any time on the island and no wait-time. And, such programmes are important economic drivers. In St. Kitts and Nevis, passports are the country’s largest export and the money generated from the programme is seen as responsible for lifting the nation out of debt and fuelling a construction boom. The IMF says Citizenship by investment programmes amounted to 14% of St Kitt’s GDP in 2014, and other estimates say the programme may have accounted for as much as 30% of the government’s revenue in 2015. But increasingly, richer countries are offering 'citizenship for a price'. Comparable programmes in New Zealand cost NZ$1.5m ($1.06m) – a popular move among Silicon Valley’s tech elite recently – or £2m ($2.58m) for the UK and $500,000 for the US. Joseph says the EB-5 programme is hugely valuable for the country, delivering over $1 billion dollars to the US economy each quarter. “We’ve seen exponential growth since the financial crisis in 2008 to the tune of an increase of over 1,200% from 2008 until today,” he says. Increased interest in the US programme is due in part to the relatively stable economy and safe investment environment, but also thanks to the low investment minimum. The EB-5 programme requires the $500,000 to be invested areas lacking jobs and cash, but critics argue the low minimum is a loophole being exploited by developers. Although the US caps the total number of visas granted each year through the programme to 10,000, the number of applicants has no limit. Interest, it seems, doesn’t either. “There are currently over 23,000 investor petitions for a visa number.” Joseph says, “That’s just how many that are pending right now.” At last count, 23 countries from Cyprus to Singapore offered some kind of investment residency or citizenship scheme and more are being created with similar programmes proliferating across Europe. Almost half of all EU member states now offer some form of investment residency or citizenship programmes. Mobility is key For as little as $50,000 (in Latvia) or as much as $10 million (in France), foreigners can buy legal status to live, work and bank in a number of countries. Perhaps more importantly, by extension, they buy access to visa-free travel to countries around the world. And, there’s an informal rating system for the most sought after passports. “Some people in the industry determine [the value] by the number of visa-free countries a person can travel to. So I think at the moment the data out there is that on the German passport you can travel to more countries than with any other citizenship in the world.” Emmett says. In a globalised world where political isolationism is paradoxically on the rise, this freedom of movement is an attractive element of such schemes. Andrew Henderson, an American entrepreneur and founder of the Nomad Capitalist, a blog, podcast and consulting company, has four passports and is working on his fifth. Multiple citizenships provide him with a multitude of entrepreneurial options, he says. He says investing in programmes in the African archipelago of Comoros and the Caribbean Island of St. Lucia give him more opportunities and lower taxes. “For me it’s about how I could have better options, better tax treatment, better treatment as a person and get the same visa free travel.” he says, adding that he expects investment citizenship to rise. “I think the world is going more nomadic.  People don’t want to be in once place. They want to have one or two or three bases for lifestyle reasons and pay reasonable taxes, and that’s what becoming more accessible. While not everyone with multiple citizenships will reside in multiple nations, Williams says the industry can be viewed as a barometer of turmoil in the world.  He says many of the investors he works with see these programmes as a safety net. “Most of our clients do not go and live in the country they invest in,” he says. “They see it as more of an insurance policy. They know that they’ve got that second residency, so if they ever have to jump on a plane they’ve got that option.” Your country for sale Such programmes aren’t without controversy. Afterall, should citizenship be for sale? Detractors say no. Earlier this year in the US, two senators, Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Grassley, introduced a bill to get rid of the EB-5 programme, arguing that it is too flawed to continue. “It is wrong to have a special pathway to citizenship for the wealthy while millions wait in line for visas,"" Feinstein said. Detractors also argue these programmes unfairly favour the rich and are unattainable for everyone else. They also cite concerns about money laundering, criminal activity and backdoor access to countries that circumvent normal immigration systems. Indeed, the intersection of large sums of money and international real estate deals is ripe for fraud. Just this month an FBI Investigation uncovered a $50 million visa fraud operation involving Chinese investors in the EB-5 programme. And in April, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against a man in Idaho who they say spent Chinese investor’s money on new homes, cars and a zip line for himself rather than the real estate projects it was meant for. The St. Kitts and Nevis programme ran into trouble with the US Treasury Department when suspected Iranian operatives were caught using their St. Kitts passports to launder money for banks in Tehran in violation of US Sanctions. Controversy surrounding the US EB-5 programme reached the upper echelons of the White House as the Kushner family’s real estate company was accused of conflicts of interest for using Presidential son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner’s name in a pitch to lure Chinese investments in a New Jersey property development. And the programme’s reputation for shady deals is not going away. But in a world where borders are closing, demand for these services will most likely continue to grow, experts say. Paul William’s advice for UK Citizenswho are anxious about Brexit? Hold tight. ‘Things are uncertain, but they can’t do anything about it now since they are still European residents,” he says. “In two years time, if the UK does end up with the same access to the EU as America, say, then a lot of people will be wanting to do something.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Debt Securities Market,India court rejects new inquiry against billionaire,2024-09-14,2024-01-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67869919,"India's top court has rejected pleas to set up a new panel to investigate a US firm's allegations of fraud against billionaire Gautam Adani's companies. In January, Hindenburg Research had accused the firm of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud. The court set up a committee in March to oversee an investigation by India's market regulator into the allegations. In May, the panel said the regulator had so far ""drawn a blank"" in the inquiry. The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the regulator to finish its investigation within three months. Mr Adani, who has always denied any wrongdoing, said ""truth had prevailed"" after the court's ruling.   Petitioners had alleged that India's market watchdog - the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) - which had been directed by the court to investigate the allegations, was not doing a proper job. They also claimed that there was a ""conflict of interest"" among some members in the court-appointed panel. Rejecting their plea, Chief Justice DY Chandrachud said there were ""no grounds"" for the investigation to be transferred to a special team and directed Sebi to complete its investigation in a timely manner. ""The power to transfer investigation must be exercised in exceptional circumstances. Such powers cannot be exercised in the absence of cogent justifications,"" he said. He also rejected the argument that there was a conflict of interest among members of the court-appointed panel and added that newspaper reports and investigations by third-party organisations cannot be held as conclusive evidence to question Sebi's findings. In its report, Hindenburg - which specialises in ""short-selling"", or betting against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall - accused Mr Adani of ""pulling the largest con in corporate history"".  The report questioned the Adani Group's ownership of companies in offshore tax havens such as Mauritius and the Caribbean.  It also claimed Adani companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". The Adani Group denied the allegations, calling the report ""malicious"" and said that it had always been ""in compliance with all laws"". The allegations triggered a meltdown in Indian markets as the Adani Group's companies saw more than $100bn (£82bn) wiped off their market value in the weeks after the report was made public. However, their stocks have since bounced back and saw a jump in price in the hours before Wednesday's verdict. Mr Adani is among the richest people in the world and is perceived as being close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He has long faced allegations from opposition politicians that he has benefited from his political ties, which he and Mr Modi's party deny. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Debt Securities Market,The best TV shows of 2021,2024-09-14,2021-12-17,Hugh Montgomery and Eddie Mullan and Amy Charles,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210415-the-best-tv-shows-of-2021-so-far,"From Squid Game to Succession, Ted Lasso, Mare of Easttown and Maid, Hugh Montgomery, Amy Charles and Eddie Mullan pick the year’s greatest programmes to binge right now. Yellowjackets It's a risky endeavour putting a show on the ""best of the year"" list when only half of its first season has aired so far – and yet, however it pans out, Yellowjackets is a show that already demands recognition for its verve, style and ferocity. A horror-meets-black-comedy-meets-teen-drama, it tells a split-timeline story, with both parts full of intrigue. In the mid-1990s, a plane containing a girls' high-school soccer team from New Jersey crashes in the Canadian wilderness, leading to Lord of the Flies-style power battles among the stranded survivors. And then in the present day, we catch up with some of those survivors, now in their 40s, as they are forced to reckon with exactly what happened all those years ago. Many critics have compared it to Lost, and it certainly shares the narrative lure of that series, but it is also very much its own beast, as well as a gleefully perverse nostalgia-hit for many millennials, with its 1990s-rock soundtrack and casting of some of that era's spikiest young stars Christina Ricci and Juliette Lewis among the grown-up versions of the characters. And unlike Lost, which of course lost the plot as it went on, I have a feeling some satisfactory – if nasty – answers are coming. Available on Sky/Now TV in the UK and on Showtime in the US. Maid Amid TV's ongoing obsession with the lives of the super-rich or aspirationally affluent, it hardly needs saying that not enough attention is paid to those on the other end of the socio-economic spectrum: the have-nots rather than the haves. Which is what made this Netflix limited series, an adaptation of Stephanie Land's bestselling memoir about her life as a single mother on the breadline, so welcome. Margaret Qualley plays Alex, a young woman living in the US Pacific Northwest and struggling to get a footing in society. When we first see her, she is fleeing from her abusive and alcoholic boyfriend with their young daughter, which leads her down a path of nightmare bureaucracy, as she tries to find both accommodation for the two of them and a job that might allow her to pay the bills. One of the great things about the show is the detail with which it shades in the financial and administrative obstacles of Alex's situation, at some points offering a tally of her incomings and outgoings that flashes up on screen, while it's equally strong on the emotional realities of dealing with abusive partners and loved ones with mental health issues – in this case, a bipolar mother, played by Qualley's own mum Andie MacDowell. And while there is some irony in Hollywood mother-daughter royalty like MacDowell and Qualley leading a story like this, the power of their performances cannot be doubted. Altogether, it manages to hit a sweet spot between sobering authenticity and skilfully-played sentimentality that means for all that its subject matter may be harrowing, you wish you could live with these characters for a while longer. Available on Netflix internationally. Squid Game For a rather more surreal take on the rich-poor divide, meanwhile, there was the one show that swept all before it this year: Squid Game. This South Korean drama is about desperate people in debt who sign up to compete in a series of sadistic, life-or-death takes on old playground games in order to try and win a huge cash prize. Three months on from its premiere, it is odd to think how a show that is a merciless critique of capitalism became collectively reconstituted as a kind of benignly-amusing pop cultural product, with people dressing up in the contestants' green tracksuits for Halloween and sales in the Korean honeycomb candy – featured as the centrepiece of one trial – booming. But leaving that irony aside, the show in itself is a brilliantly-conceived near-masterpiece, whose surreal production design and twisted childhood references conspire to make it feel like something dredged from one's subconscious, and whose writing is on occasion as beautiful as its violence is brutal. Inevitably, the fact it has become Netflix's biggest show of all time means a second series is in the works, though whether its high-concept can sustain one is questionable. But, beyond its own future, it has impacted the future of the whole TV ecosystem by definitively proving the global reach that non-English language content can have – and for that we should all be thankful. Available on Netflix internationally. Succession After two years away thanks to the pandemic, this critical darling returned this autumn with what was undoubtedly a difficult third series – the chief difficulty being, where did this tale of corporate amorality and diseased democracy have left to run? The answer is, in many ways, nowhere: what we saw was more of the same endless cycle of power-plays among the Roy family, which led more than one critic to conclude that the show, in its sheer stasis, was really a sitcom disguised as a prestige drama. Except set against that was the genuinely tortured and tortuous-to-watch performance of Jeremy Strong (dissected in a now-infamous New Yorker profile), his staring into the emotional abyss coming to a head in a finale which saw him collapsed on the ground outside a Tuscan palazzo, ruined by the weight of his guilt and self-loathing. This run undoubtedly showed up the show's limitations and deficiencies, notably its decision to marginalise the real-world consequences of the Roys' diseased reign, which seemed smartly reflective of its characters self-absorption at first, but now risks appearing glib. But it seems churlish to complain too much about a show that is still as exquisitely refined in its artistry as its characters are obscene. Available on Sky/Now TV in the UK and HBO Max in the US.   Only Murders in the Building Amid all the epic television with something important to say out there, it's nice to find a show that makes a virtue of its smallness – something like this murder mystery comedy, as sweet, moreish and easily digestible as a petit four. Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez play the unlikely trio of amateur sleuths investigating a murder in their Upper West Side New York apartment block – with the 21st- Century conceit that they also decide to turn the case into a true-crime podcast. With its peppy, neurotic badinage, the whole thing is a little Woody Allen, though it has a sincere, open-hearted quality all of its own, while the two Martins' familiar chemistry (founded on a long friendship and co-starring in films like The Three Amigos and Father of the Bride) is complemented perfectly by Gomez's spiky charm. And as it rolls towards its denouement, it continues to be light on its feet, while being just consequential enough, in exploring themes like loss, loneliness, and friendship, to feel not altogether frivolous. The finale baldly sets up a new series – and in this case, there's something about the show's self-assurance of tone and character that means you don't doubt that a second run will be just as much of a delight. Available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally. We are Lady Parts Forget abstract conversations about representation and diversity in TV – and instead turn to this comedy about an all-female, all-Muslim punk band in East London for a showcase in how giving a platform to hitherto unheard voices and experiences is not only right, but can result in singularly exhilarating TV. Written by Nida Manzoor and inspired by aspects of her own life and upbringing, through its six episodes it is a total blast from start to finish. Anchored by an astonishingly deft and expressive comic performance from Anjana Vasan as Amina, the band's new-recruit guitarist, it also features some inspired and rip-roaring tunes written by Manzoor and her siblings. Arguably, no show this year was quite as joyous. Available on All4 in the UK and Peacock in the US.   Starstruck Starstruck begins, as most romantic comedies do, with a meet-cute. Jessie – juggling two jobs in London to scrape a living – hooks up with Tom, after meeting him in a nightclub on New Year's Eve. But what she doesn’t realise is that Tom is an internationally-famous actor. After being mistaken for his cleaner by the paparazzi camped outside his house, Jessie (New Zealand comic Rose Matafeo, who also created and co-wrote the series) must confront her deepest insecurities, and come to terms with the surreal situation of having a relationship with a megastar, all while making terrible life decisions. This rom-com hits all the right notes, Matafeo is a turbulent but loveable hero you can't help but root for, and Nikesh Patel is convincing as an uncomfortable star yearning for normality. Aside from the main storyline about the couple, one of this series' greatest attributes is its exploration of friendship. Being from New Zealand, Jessie has been forced to create an alternative family in London, and her relationship with housemate Kate (Emma Sidi) is a delightful portrait of modern female friendship, with all the highs and lows involved. Shortly after its debut, Matafeo announced on Twitter that filming had already begun for the second series, so expect to see more of this hilarious and endearing sitcom soon. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK and HBO Max in the US. Shrill The third and final season of this quietly revolutionary comedy once again takes on huge topics, including racism, privilege and fatphobia, with a deft hand. Aidy Bryant's Annie Easton, the protagonist based on writer Lindy West, from whose memoir the show is adapted, is finally comfortable in her own skin, able to express herself through her writing and empowered in her love life. But this self-assurance comes at a cost when Annie writes an opinion piece that appears to excuse racism, causing a deep rift between her and long-time best friend Fran (the inimitable Lolly Adefope). One of the best things about this series has been seeing Fran growing into the co-lead, with the show sympathetically exploring her relationship with Em (E R Fightmaster), as well as her personal growth as a standalone character. The supporting ensemble has continued to delight, with John Cameron Mitchell's excruciating editor Gabe and Patti Harrison's hilarious, one-liner-producing PA Ruthie stealing the whole show. During its three-season run, Shrill has pulled off what so many other comedies fail to do: be genuinely funny, heartwarming and diverse all at once. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK and Hulu in the US.   Bo Burnham: Inside In the face of lockdowns in March 2020, many made resolutions to use the extra time on their hands to ""create"". And if Shakespeare wrote King Lear during a plague, so  someone would conjure up a similar masterpiece this time around, it was pondered. Now, whether anyone thought said masterpiece would see comic Bo Burnham singing ""I made you some content, daddy made you your favourite, open wide"" while sat in his underwear, a head-torch lighting a disco ball, is doubtful, but a masterpiece his Netflix film Inside surely is. Burnham first made comedic waves on YouTube, writing and performing funny songs to audiences of millions throughout his high school years, before taking to stand-up, film direction (the brilliant Eighth Grade), and acting (Promising Young Woman). Inside marked Burnham's first return to musical comedy performance since 2016, but instead of being on stage in front of a crowd of thousands, he wrote, shot, directed and edited this project entirely alone, in a single room, serving up an exploration of the horrors of both lockdown, specifically, and modernity, more generally. The sheer brilliance of the songwriting coupled with Burnham's meticulously-crafted performances, which reflected the surreal nature of the last couple of years, made Inside potentially one of the defining pieces of pandemic art. Available on Netflix internationally. Hellbound In a year which felt like a turning point for mainstream popularity of non-English language TV drama, two South Korean dystopian dramas stood head and shoulders above the crowd. The first was the aforementioned Squid Game, and the other was Hellbound, a bizarre horror in which people suddenly receive a ""declaration"" from a disembodied face, telling them exactly when they will die and that they are destined for Hell. When the moment of their demise then comes, three hulking, smoking monsters appear out of thin air, kill the ""sinner"" in a spectacularly gruesome fashion, destroying whatever's in their way, and burn the sinner to a crisp before disappearing seconds later. The sudden emergence of these terrifying monsters sees the equally terrifying rise of The New Truth, a religious organisation which claim to have the answers to who is chosen and why. Yoo Ah-in delivers one of the performances of the year as Chairman Jung, the frighteningly compelling leader of The New Truth, while Kim Hyun-joo's Min Hye-jin is a consistently sympathetic heroine. Created by Yeon Sang-ho (Train to Busan), this horror series is much more than brutal monster gore; it's a clever study of power, social media and misinformation and what fear will do to people. Here's hoping a second season will be announced. Available on Netflix internationally. Time This magnificent three-parter takes a clear-eyed look at the harsh realities of prison life from the perspective of both prisoner and guard: Mark (Sean Bean) is a former teacher serving a four-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving in a prison where Eric (Stephen Graham) is a rule-abiding officer. It's not an easy watch; the programme unflinchingly covers a myriad of devastating topics including mental illness, suicide, addiction and violent bullying, and forces the viewer to reckon with their own preconceptions of prisoners. Ben is earth-shattering in his  portrayal of a broken man who is trying to pick up the pieces of his life,  while Graham's offers a compelling portrait of the fragility of power, and the pain of trying to do the right thing. Time is British drama at its grittiest best: looking squarely in the face of one of the hidden parts of society and creating compelling, devastating art from it. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK and Britbox in the US. The Underground Railroad After a year in which many of us have gravitated towards ""comfort TV"" as a salve for the tumult around us, The Underground Railroad was perhaps the necessary counterbalance: a profound piece of art, as beautiful as it is uncompromising, that urges the very deepest engagement. Based on Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer-prize winning novel of the same name, its alt-history narrative follows Cora, a young woman in antebellum America who escapes from the plantation where she is enslaved via the titular underground railroad, a literal manifestation of something which in reality was a metaphor for the social networks that helped enslaved people to their freedom. What follows, as she ventures Gulliver's Travel-like from region to region, is a stunning survey of the spectrum of racism, inequity, forced compromises and false dawns that black people in America faced, and continue to face, as intellectually detailed as it is viscerally brutal. Every element is perfectly judged, from the coiled intensity of Thuso Mbedu's lead performance to the jarringly beautiful, gliding camerawork that somehow reflects the callous indifference of a society to the violence it sanctions – it is, quite simply, essential viewing, though we would advise taking it slowly, so as to let each of the 10 episodes really sink in. Available on Amazon Prime internationally.      The White Lotus There is a select group of people (including this writer) who have been banging on for years about the underappreciation and premature cancellation of Enlightened, the HBO comedy-drama from 2011-2013, starring Laura Dern as a middle-ranking executive for a conglomerate, driven to upset the applecart after a breakdown and a trip to a Hawaiian retreat. Well, clearly creator Mike White was simply a decade ahead of the curve, as his new show has comparable themes, elements and tonality, but has ended up being one of the summer's great talking points. Where previously White focused on the after-effects of a tropical getaway, here the drama is firmly centred on the getaway itself: a luxury resort, again in Hawaii, where a group of mostly white, wealthy tourists are trying, and failing, to relax. As they project their unprocessed neuroses onto each other, and the endlessly trying-to-be-patient staff, it is clear that this holiday is not going to end well for anyone involved – something, to be fair, already given away by an introductory flash-forward scene featuring someone in a body bag. It's a series that works on many different, interconnected planes at once – as a wincingly effective cringe comedy, a satire of American imperialism, and, complete with ​​Cristobal Tapia de Veer's eerie ""Hawaiian Hitchcock"" score, a nightmarish social horror. Perhaps its closest companion overall, in its trenchant study of unchecked privilege, is its HBO stablemate Succession – though White has made the distinction that ""[with Succession] you can kind of otherize them. They’re billionaires. With White Lotus, I wanted it to be more, like, this is your next-door-neighbor rich person who is part of the system."" Certainly, though, it provokes similarly queasy laughter. Available on Sky/Now TV in the UK and HBO Max in the US.   Feel Good  It takes confidence to really shift the direction of a show from one series to the next, but that is what the brilliant comedian-writer Mae Martin has done with the second series of their semi-autobiographical comedy-drama. Where the first run set itself up as a romantic comedy centred on the contrasting lives, chemistry and combustions of nascent couple Mae and George (Charlotte Ritchie), the second is much more tightly-focused on a particular theme, as Mae faces up to the shadow cast by the harassment and abuse she has suffered – most centrally her grooming as a teenager by an older man who is now a friend. In exploring a reckoning with historic abuse, it feels timely, but in no way calculatedly so, and the fact it is rooted in autobiography is evident in the nuance with which it depicts Mae's conflicting emotions. Indeed, for all the disarming charm of both its writing and its star, it feels of a piece with Michaela Coel's I May Destroy You in its very singular study of trauma and its effects. Sadly – but probably rightly – there will be no more, but Martin, a gifted stand-up, surely has a big screen future ahead: indeed, they already have another Netflix show in the works. Available on Netflix internationally.   Ted Lasso Sometimes a TV show benefits from landing at just the right moment. Such was the case when Ted Lasso launched on Apple TV+ at the tail end of last summer: an unassuming sitcom on a still-novice platform, initially this tale of a supernaturally chirpy American football coach (Jason Sudeikis) taking charge of a British soccer team didn't make much noise. But over a period of months, it grew to become a genuine word-of-mouth hit as audiences craved what it was offering amid the continuing real-world bleakness: not so much its humour as its sincerity, warmth and milk of human kindness. This year, it returned for a second series with a great deal more expectation in tow – but what's great is how unaffected by such pressure it seems. Instead, it continues in the same beguilingly easy groove, and if it's rarely laugh-out-loud funny, that doesn't really matter. This is a show that leaves you with that inimitable fuzzy feeling, for its enveloping spirit of camaraderie, its unfettered love for its characters and its satisfying (if not unpredictable) subversion of stereotypes, from seemingly-hyper-macho-but-secretly-softie retired captain Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) to sharp-as-a-tack glamour model-influencer Keeley (Juno Temple). And it also knows how to stage a crowd-pleasing moment, such as in this series' third episode, with the team's eminently admirable stand against an unethical sponsor. With its haul of Emmys in September, it may no longer be the plucky underdog, but it's a worthy champ. Available on Apple TV+ internationally. I Think You Should Leave By contrast, if you’re looking for a comedy that takes a rather dimmer view of humankind, then US comic Tim Robinson's surreally electric sketch show I Think You Should Leave, now on its second series, is just the ticket: like much sketch comedy, it's scattershot enough that it is difficult to quite distil the essence of its genius, but if it nails one thing repeatedly, it's the fragility of the social contract: from using needlessly crude language on a haunted house tour to stealing someone's dinner across the restaurant table, characters repeatedly drive scenes of spiralling awkwardness with a breathtaking lack of self-awareness that is both excruciating and exhilarating in equal measure. Overall, there's something perversely refreshing about its misanthropy: not only that of its characters, with their inability to behave graciously when interacting with their fellow humans, but that of the show itself, with its transgressive belief that, if truth be told, we are a species mired in our pettinesses and our pomposities. And as for the already infamous ""Coffin Flop"" sketch? Assuredly, once you've seen it, you will not even be able to read those two words together without a Pavlovian attack of the hysterics. Available on Netflix internationally. Mare of Easttown  Both mesmerising and believable as a small-town Pennsylvania detective, Kate Winslet has made an unglamorous return to TV, a decade on from her only other small-screen appearance in Mildred Pierce, and it marks a career-best for the star. Set in the hometown region where screenwriter Brad Ingelsby grew up, the HBO crime series is essentially an old-fashioned whodunnit located within a close-knit working-class community that is weighed down by traumatic events. The story follows detective Mare Sheehan (Winslet) as she investigates the murder of a local girl while trying to cope with her own bereavement and divorce. Disappearing into the hard-boiled role, complete with an unbroken Delaware county ""Delco"" accent, Winslet shows us a woman who will do anything to protect her family and doesn't suffer fools. Sure, there are red herrings aplenty, and jaw-dropping moments that lesser shows would simply end the series on, but aside from the Twin Peaks-style murder mystery element (hidden double lives, strange goings-on in the woods), the success of Mare is testament to Ingelsby's writing allowing time for us to get to know the characters, as Mare and her tough-as-nails mother (Jean Smart) flit in and out of their neighbours' lives, chatting with a beer around a dinner table, or chasing down every detail to find justice and help a town in turmoil heal. Available on Now TV/Sky Atlantic in the UK and HBO Max in the US. Loki Following the success of the wonderful, oddball WandaVision earlier in the year, this latest much-anticipated Marvel series on Disney+ once again delivers, with a chaotic, time-hopping misadventure focused on Tom Hiddleston’s God of Mischief. Following on from the events of Avengers: Endgame, prince of Asgard, Loki, escapes imprisonment through a time portal using the powerful Tesseract, only to find himself in the clutches of the Minutemen, an elite team of soldiers working for the mysterious Time Variance Authority to track down any pesky variants disrupting the flow of time. Occupying a drab 1950s retro-futuristic style office, the TVA's bureaucrats govern what they call ""the sacred timeline"" and eradicate or ""prune"" anyone who messes with reality. Loki comes to the attention of senior TVA agent Mobius (Owen Wilson), who arranges a reprieve from the court of Judge Renslayer (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), persuading her instead to allow him to recruit the not-entirely-trustworthy Loki to help repair the issues he has created in the timeline. Available internationally on Disney+. Katla A supernatural mystery from Icelandic co-creators Sigurjón Kjartansson and Baltasar Kormákur who worked together on 2015 hit Trapped, Katla tells the story of a small community struggling to survive in the shadow of an active subglacial volcano. Rescue worker Gríma (Guðrún Eyfjörð), searches for her sister who disappeared the day Katla's eruption started, over a year ago. Just as hope of ever finding her body fades, the remaining residents within the restricted area of Vík start to receive visits from unexpected guests from their past. An ash-caked woman appears on the glacier, but when taken to hospital it's revealed she's a Swedish woman named Gunhild (Aliette Opheim), who worked at a local hotel 20 years previous.Then another person materialises: Ása, Grima's sister, thought to have been dead. The intriguing premise behind this series could so easily have devolved into derivative horror storytelling, but Katla's blend of folklore, sci-fi and isolated, bleak setting allows for a series that is more than anything an exploration of loss, and whose deep mystery unravels slowly. Available on Netflix internationally. Unforgotten Such is the glut of crime dramas, it's difficult for any new show in the genre to truly stand out, but this exceptional British effort makes it look easy – proving that what you really need to elevate your procedural is not high concepts or clever-clever twists, but just beautiful and humane writing. Through three series, creator Chris Lang has used the premise of coppers DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and DS Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) investigating a years-old but newly-unearthed murder as a way to tell powerful stories of guilt, shame and regret – and this year's fourth run, focusing on the discovery of a body on that links four former friends, who were all once trainee police officers, is  no less powerful. Meanwhile the real highlight of the show again is the incredible central performance by Walker, one of the very most natural and organic screen actors there is. Extraordinary for being so ordinary, Stuart is not a tortured detective type but an exceptional, sympathetic yet understandably harried professional trying to do her best – and without giving anything way, this series makes us value her, and Walker, more than ever. Available on ITV Hub in the UK and on Amazon Prime worldwide. Framing Britney Spears Rare is it that a piece of television comes along that feels quite as important as this New York Times-produced documentary about the pop icon, and her mistreatment over her two-decade long career from all sides: the press and paparazzi, the music industry, her own family and associates and everyone who has readily consumed her very public suffering as entertainment. When it premiered in February, it was the catalyst for a much wider discussion about the collective, abject sexism directed at young women in the public eye – a conversation that continued with Spears' singing superstar peer Demi Lovato's YouTube series Dancing with the Devil. And then, only last month, Spears finally escaped the conversatorship that had taken away her rights to make decisions about her life and career for the last 14 years. In light of this happy ending of a kind, this documentary nevertheless stands as an important historic testimony of one of the grimmest episodes in 21st century pop culture. Available on Sky Documentaries in the UK and Hulu in the US. It’s a Sin From The Normal Heart to Angels in America, there have been a number of landmark works about the US Aids crisis of the 1980s, but not enough depicting the scourge of the pandemic elsewhere – which is what makes Russell T Davies' six-part exploration of what was happening in the UK at the time so welcome. A co-production with HBO, it is a masterful blend of comedy, tragedy, and pop hits, which perhaps showcases Davies' unique brilliance as a writer better than any show he's done before: that is, his particular ability to combine the immense warmth and homeliness of a classic British soap with a righteous anger that gradually, then suddenly unfurls itself. A fine young ensemble includes Olly Alexander, Callum Scott Howells, and Omari Douglas as the central trio of young gay men, moving to the big city and with no idea what's in store, while they're supported by a fine selection of more experienced names, the best of all being Neil Patrick Harris as an impish Savile Row tailor. And if it's depiction of how the victims of a pandemic were turned into pariahs would have cut deeply at any time, right now its resonance is even more gut-wrenching. Available on All4 in the UK and HBO Max in the US. WandaVision With Disney extending its Marvel Cinematic Universe to the small screen, it couldn't really have created a better advert for the added creative possibilities therein. This marvellously surreal nine-episode limited series centres on Avenger Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), as she finds herself living in an ever-evolving alternate universe, modelled on various sitcoms through the eras, alongside her hitherto thought-to-be-destroyed robot husband Vision (Paul Bettany). Early episodes were such joyfully pinpoint pastiches of sitcom form that it is almost a shame when the show devolves into more typical Marvel fare in its latter stages. Nevertheless, it still counts as the MCU's most daring move yet, a piece that both offers sharp meta-commentary on the medium of TV and a poignant exploration of grief. Olsen and Bettany navigate the tonal shifts masterfully as the titular couple, though it is long-time indie favourite Kathryn Hahn who steals the show – and furnished the memes – as jarringly enthusiastic neighbour Agnes. Available on Disney+ internationally. Call My Agent French TV is having a bit of a moment, with a number of series becoming international talking points – and chief among them is this stiletto-sharp comedy-drama about a Paris talent agency, whose fourth series premiered internationally on Netflix in January after broadcasting in France late last year. Its central conceit is that each episode features a particular client, who is in fact a real-life star playing themselves - and for the first time, this new run looked beyond France for its cameos, with a special appearance by Hollywood’s finest, Sigourney Weaver. Other than that, however, it is deliciously acerbic business as usual; as the BBC's Will Gompertz noted it “maintains the same rarefied heights of excellence of the previous three, as our bold and increasingly beleaguered agents do battle with the corporate ogre that is StarMédia, an array of recalcitrant actors, and – mostly – each other. But though it was also purported to be the final series, fans will be glad to know that there has been a stay of execution: a fifth series and a standalone film have been confirmed. Available on Netflix internationally. The Investigation Over six detailed and sober episodes we never meet the killer – and we don't hear his name. In this retelling of the real-life investigation into the murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, Borgen actor Søren Malling leads the cast as Jens Møller, the stern Head of Homicide for Copenhagen police. Alongside chief prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen (fellow Borgen star Pilou Asbæk), Møller works non-stop to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Wall, last seen going to interview an inventor for a story on a homemade submarine in Copenhagen harbour, was indeed murdered. In telling the story of how people worked together to solve a crime, without reproducing the gruesome crime itself, director Tobias Lindholm's understated dramatisation of the ‘submarine case’ became a radical reinvention of the true-crime genre. In a behind-the-scenes podcast, Lindholm explained that in focusing on the professionals – the divers, forensics, investigators – making sacrifices and missing important time with family to tirelessly do get the job done, it was a way to “humanise the dehumanised… and offer a confrontation with our behaviours as media consumers”. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK and HBO Max in the US. Can’t Get You Out of My Head In a sprawling six-part series for BBC iPlayer, British journalist Adam Curtis reflects on how in the age of the individual, fundamental power structures governing us all haven't gone away. Tracing the different forces that have led to now, over eight hours the wide-ranging films chronicle the growing anger and anxieties in China, Russia and the Western world, and how this came about. Featuring off-beat archival footage of figures in politics and culture – soundtracked with Curtis's signature choice selection of pop music – the montage of film essays focuses on the loosely interconnected stories of historical revolutionaries. Telling the individual tales of Jiang Qing, Afeni Shakur, Edward Limonov, and Michael X, filmmaker Curtis sets out the argument that it was all of us – self-expressing individuals, politicians and technocrats – who together made these strange times we're living through. It doesn't provide any answers, but through his typical dazzling, yet untraditional collage documentary format, Curtis does at least offer us an explanation of the dynamics of our time. Available on BBC iPlayer in the UK. Resident Alien Far funnier than its farcical premise should allow, this comedy-drama based on the Dark Horse comic series provided much-needed escapism and so became Syfy's highest-rated new drama in recent years. Alan Tudyk (Firefly) stars as Harry Vanderspeegle – real name unpronounceable – an alien who, after crash-landing in the mountains outside the small town of Patience, Colorado, has killed and taken the physical form of the first man he encounters. After a stint alone in a fishing cabin learning English by watching Law & Order reruns, we learn that Harry's secret mission on Earth is to destroy humanity – but he's lost his detonation device in the mountains, so he needs to assimilate into his new home to buy some time to uncover it. Tudyk brilliantly reveals the alien's flawed personality, flicking between comedy and menace with ease, as we follow Harry posing unconvincingly as a human doctor. Things, however, are going to plan, until Harry gets embroiled in solving a local murder (""Chung chung!""), bringing him closer to the townsfolk and especially workmate Asta (Sara Tomko), while he also discovers a love of pizza. As time goes on, Harry begins to wrestle with the moral dilemma of his mission. Available on Sky/Now TV in the UK and SyFy in the US. Lupin One of the year's first hit shows was the delightful high-energy French heist comedy, inspired by classic stories of gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, written in the early 1900s. Many binged the slick and fast-moving series, released in two halves of five episodes each, and it's not difficult to see why: Actor Omar Sy oozes charm as Assane Diop, a towering con artist with the smooth style of Bond and the wits of Sherlock, who sets out to avenge his father for an injustice inflicted by a wealthy family. As the only son of an immigrant from Senegal who had come to France to seek a better life, his father is framed over the theft of a diamond necklace by his powerful employer, Hubert Pellegrini. After his father dies in prison, teenager Assane is left an orphan. When we meet Assane 25 years on, inspired by a book about a certain gentleman thief his father had given him on his birthday, our hero sets out to right a wrong, using his mastery of disguise and subterfuge.

Debt Securities Market,10 films to watch this August,2024-09-14,2022-07-29,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220728-10-of-the-best-films-to-watch-this-august,"This summer's unmissable releases include Brad Pitt on a bullet train, Jane Fonda as a dragon and Idris Elba as a djinn, writes Nicholas Barber. 1. My Old School When 16-year-old Brandon Lee transferred to a new school near Glasgow in 1993, everyone there noticed something unusual about him. Some even thought he might be living a double life. But no one imagined the scale of the deception that would eventually come to light. In Jono McLeod's documentary, Lee's former classmates and teachers tell his bizarre story – and if you don't want to know the ending, don't Google his name. Lee himself didn't want to appear on screen, so his testimony is lip-synced by Alan Cumming (The Good Wife), and flashbacks to the 1990s are rendered as animated cartoons. Alissa Wilkinson at Vox says the results are ""flat-out fun… like listening to a bunch of friends tell you about the wildest memory they share"". Released on 19 August in UK & Ireland 2.  Luck In the first full-length film from Skydance Animation, Tony Award-nominee Eva Noblezada provides the voice of Sam, ""the unluckiest person in the world"". Having grown up in the care system, she hopes to nab some extra good luck for a fellow foster child, and finds her way to a realm where magical creatures – including a black cat voiced by Simon Pegg and a dragon voiced by Jane Fonda – manipulate the human race's fortunes. It may sound faintly sinister, but the director, Peggy Holmes, promises that Luck is full of ""positivity and inspiration"". Talking to Jackson Murphy at Animation Now, she says, ""We've all been through a really hard time together in the world. People really want to sit back, relax, and really be inspired to just keep going. When those bad luck days come, just keep going because there are some good luck ones coming, too."" Released on 5 August on Apple TV+ worldwide 3. Mack & Rita From Freaky Friday to Big, 13 Going on 30 to 17 Again, lots of comedies have imagined young minds zapping into older bodies, and vice versa. But the new film from Katie Aselton (The Freebie, Black Rock) puts a fresh spin on the formula, by ageing up, rather than using teens and adults. Written by Paul Welsh and Madeline Walter, Mack & Rita features a 30-year-old author (Elizabeth Lail) who has always felt that she was a 70-year-old woman on the inside. After going to a new-age workshop in Palm Springs, she is magically transformed into a 70-year-old woman on the outside, too. In her new identity (Diane Keaton in an all-too-rare lead role), she is a happy, relaxed ""glammy granny"" social-media influencer, but can that make up for losing 40 years of her life? Released on 12 August in the US, Canada and Spain 4. Bullet Train David Leitch was Brad Pitt's stunt double on Troy, Fight Club and Mr and Mrs Smith, and has since become the director of such ridiculously-fun action movies as Hobbs & Shaw, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2. And now the two old buddies have teamed up for Leitch's latest shooting-and-punching-fest: Bullet Train. Pitt plays an assassin who is sent by his handler (Sandra Bullock) to grab a briefcase from one of the passengers on a Japanese train, but little does he know that the train is full of other shady characters (Brian Tyree Henry, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Zazie Beetz, Michael Shannon). Adapted from a novel by Kōtarō Isaka, Bullet Train ""is the kind of summer popcorn movie that knows it's a summer popcorn movie,"" says Nick Romano at EW. ""But because it's Leitch at the helm, the action is sharp, slick, dynamic, and always advancing the story."" Released on 3 August in the UK and 5 August in the US 5. Blind Ambition This intoxicating Australian documentary, directed by Robert Coe and Warwick Ross, has such a perfect underdog story that it would seem far-fetched in a Hollywood comedy. Its four heroes are all refugees who fled from Zimbabwe to South Africa, and found work as waiters, then as sommeliers, before eventually forming Zimbabwe's first-ever competitive wine-tasting team. Their next stop is Burgundy in France, for ""the Olympics of wine tasting"". Open a bottle of your favourite rosé and enjoy. ""While there is a focus on the road to the championship and the outcome of the competition,"" says Jojo Ajisafe in Little White Lies, ""the real joy of Blind Ambition is watching the strength and ambition in the team. How they not only changed the lives of themselves and their families, but also exposed the world to the untapped talent present in Zimbabwe."" Released on 12 August in the UK and Ireland, and 2 September in the US 6. Emily The Criminal Emily (Aubrey Plaza) is indeed a criminal. In John Patton Ford's darkly-satirical urban thriller, she gets involved in a low-level credit card scam organised by Youcef (Theo Rossi), and builds up to bigger, more violent crimes from there. But maybe, just maybe, her wrongdoings are understandable. Ford makes the case for Emily that with $70,000 in student loans to pay off, and patronising bosses offering her nothing but unpaid internships, she is short of other options. The film is ""an entertaining and sharp-edged look at the world in which so many millennials find themselves,"" says Alissa Wilkinson at Vox, ""saddled with enormous debt, a lousy job market, an exploitative gig economy, and the sinking feeling that nothing’s going to get better if you don’t escape the system"". Released on 12 August in the US and Canada 7. The Feast There aren't many folk-horror movies in which the characters all speak Welsh, but The Feast, directed by Lee Haven Jones, would be worth tucking into whichever language it was in. The setting is a swanky dinner party in the Welsh countryside. A politician (Julian Lewis Jones) hopes to charm some local farmers into letting a mining company onto their land. But their waitress for the evening, the mysterious Cadi (Annes Elwy), has another outcome in mind. ""With delicate sleight of hand,"" says Sara Michelle Fetters at MovieFreak, ""the filmmaker examines issues relating to classism, climate change, wealth inequality, sexism and so much more with deliciously malevolent precision. Jones also does not skimp on the blood and gore, the resulting mixture of social commentary and ghoulish mystical terror beautifully upsetting on a primal level."" Released on 19 August in the UK 8. Three Thousand Years of Longing Seven years on from the turbo-charged Mad Max: Fury Road, George Miller is back at last with another film – and the contrast could hardly be greater. In place of bloodthirsty survivalists racing around post-apocalyptic Australia, we have a demure English academic (Tilda Swinton) at a literature conference in Istanbul. A djinn (Idris Elba) materialises in her hotel room and offers her three wishes, but the academic has read enough myths to know that wishes tend to backfire, so the djinn tries to charm her with fabulous tales from his past. Miller's romantic fantasy, which premiered at Cannes, is a long way from Mad Max territory, but there is a thread connecting the two films. ""Like Mad Max: Fury Road before it,"" says Ben Croll at The Wrap, ""Three Thousand Years of Longing is another kind of blockbuster that tries to lead by example, a big-budget fantasia that argues there are more imaginative and original ways for Hollywood to employ its tools."" Released on 31 August in the US and Canada 9. Bodies Bodies Bodies This ""Agatha Christie-style Gen-Z slasher farce"" is ""one of the horror highlights of the year"", says Matthew Turner at Nerdly. Amandla Stenberg and Maria Bakalova (from Borat Subsequent Moviefilm) play a young couple who go to a hipster house party at a rich friend's mansion. Late at night, the twenty-somethings play a game of ""bodies bodies bodies"", in which the murderer ""kills"" his victims by touching them. But then, of course, someone actually gets killed. Halina Reijn, the film's director, satirises our resentments, insecurities and social-media obsessions – but also delivers a cunningly-plotted murder mystery. ""In short, Bodies Bodies Bodies is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously twisted horror farce that demands to be seen with as big an audience as possible,"" says Turner. ""Agatha Christie herself would be proud."" Released on 5 August in the US, 12 August in Canada and 9 September in the UK 10. I Came By Playing a rather different character from the ones he's known for in Downton Abbey and Paddington, Hugh Bonneville co-stars in I Came By as a snooty high-court judge named Sir Hector Blake. Starring alongside him is George MacKay, who plays a Banksy-like graffiti artist whose speciality is to sneak into the homes of Britain's wealthiest aristocrats and do some unauthorised redecorating. But when he is in Sir Hector's London town house, he uncovers a dark secret that puts his life in danger. Directed and co-written by the Bafta-winning Babak Anvari, this Netflix crime thriller promises ""classic Hitchcockian suspense via contemporary themes of establishment privilege and corruption"".

Debt Securities Market,China tightens stock market rules after sell-off,2024-09-14,2024-01-29,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68125359,"China has tightened its financial industry rules as the government tries to halt a deepening sell-off in the world's second largest economy. Nearly $6tn (£4.7tn) has been wiped off Chinese and Hong Kong stocks since their most recent peak three years ago. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) says the measures will create ""a fairer market order"". Under the new rules limits will be put on so-called ""short-selling"" from Monday. Short selling is when a trader bets that a share or other asset will fall in value. They borrow the asset and sell it immediately with the aim of buying it back later at a lower price and keeping the difference. Defenders of short selling say it can play an important part in financial markets, by helping find the true value of an asset. However, some critics see short selling as a ruthless trading strategy that undermines companies. The latest announcement by the CSRC comes after a series of informal measures introduced by the regulator over the last year did little to shore up financial markets. The CSRC said that following ""a complete suspension of the lending of restricted stocks"", which takes effect today, further limitations on securities lending will be introduced from 18 March. Last week, the country's premier Li Qiang asked authorities to take more ""forceful"" measures to stabilise share prices. The sell-off in China's stock market comes as some investors are concerned that the country's economy could face a long period of slow economic growth. Central to China's economic problems is its property market. For two decades, the sector boomed and accounted for a third of the country's entire wealth. But when the government put limits on how much developers could borrow in 2020, they started owing billions which they could not pay back. When property giant Evergrande defaulted in 2021, after missing a crucial repayment deadline, it triggered the current crisis. On Monday, the firm was ordered to liquidate by a court in Hong Kong, sending its shares down by more than 20% before trading in them was suspended. The real estate sector's troubles have also revealed issues faced by the country's so-called ""shadow banks"" which have lent billions of dollar to developers. The shadow banks operate in a very similar way to traditional banks but are not subject to the same regulations. In November, Chinese officials launched an investigation into ""suspected illegal crimes"" at one of the country's biggest shadow banks, Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, which filed for bankruptcy and earlier this month. There are also a number of indications that China's once-booming economy is slowing sharply. Official figures show the economy expanded by more than 5% in 2023. While that is stronger growth than many other major economies it is much lower than China saw before the pandemic. Meanwhile, the country's exports, which have been a major contributor to its growth, fell last year. At the same time, youth unemployment hit a record high and local government debt has jumped."
Debt Securities Market,Evergrande and its founder accused of $78bn fraud,2024-09-14,2024-03-19,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68603195,"Struggling Chinese property giant Evergrande and its founder, Hui Ka Yan, have been accused of inflating revenues by $78bn (£61.6bn) in the two years before the firm defaulted on its debt. The country's financial markets regulator has fined the company's mainland business Hengda Real Estate $583.5m. Mr Hui also faces being banned for life from China's financial markets. In January, Evergrande was ordered to liquidate by a Hong Kong court. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) laid much of the blame on Mr Hui, who was once China's richest man, for allegedly instructing staff to ""falsely inflate"" Hengda's annual results in 2019 and 2020. Mr Hui was also fined $6.5m, according to a filing by the company to the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges. Evergrande did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Last September, Mr Hui who is also the company's chairman was put under police surveillance as he was investigated over suspected ""illegal crimes"". The announcement comes days after the CSRC vowed to crack down on securities fraud, and protect small investors with ""teeth and horns"". Evergrande has been the poster child of China's real estate crisis with more than $300bn of debt. Liquidators have been appointed to look at Evergrande's overall financial position and identify potential restructuring strategies. That could include seizing and selling off assets, so that the proceeds can be used to repay outstanding debts. However, the Chinese government may be reluctant to see work halt on property developments in China, where many would-be homeowners are waiting for homes they have already paid for. Problems in China's property market are having a major impact as the sector accounts for around a third of the world's second largest economy. The industry has been facing a major financial squeeze since 2021, when authorities introduced measures to curb the amount big real estate developers could borrow. Since then several large property firms have defaulted on their debts. On Monday, official data showed that property investment in China fell 9% in January and February from a year ago.  New construction starts also dropped by 30% which was their their worst fall in more than a year."
Debt Securities Market,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2011-11-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-15656642,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Italy's bond yields continued to soar on Wednesday, with the yield on 10-year bonds rising well above 7% - a rate which many analysts deem to be unsustainable. The rise comes a day after Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he would resign once budget reforms are passed.  The yield was pushed up as a clearing house asked for a larger deposit to trade Italian bonds - to cover the increased risk of non-payment. Investors increasingly fear that Italy could become the next victim of the debt crisis. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has warned that the global economy is at risk of being plunged into a ""lost decade"". Ms Lagarde said the ongoing debt crisis in Europe had resulted in an uncertain outlook for the global economy. The IMF chief added that while efforts to solve the crisis were heading in the right direction, more needed to be done to restore confidence. China's inflation rate fell for a third straight month in October, as the government continues to try to cool economic growth.  Consumer prices rose 5.5% in October compared with the same month a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said. That is down from 6.1% in September, and a three-year high of 6.5% in July.  The government has identified inflation as one of the main threats to the country's economic stability. Global bank HSBC has reported shrinking underlying profits and warned of a ""very challenging"" outlook. Its headline profit before tax was actually up 66% to $5.2bn (£3.2bn) in the third quarter of the year, mainly thanks to a revaluation of its own debts, the value of which has fallen in volatile markets. But underlying profits fell 36% because of weak business, as well as bad debts in the US. Anglo-French electrical goods retailer Kesa has announced plans to sell off its troubled UK-based Comet stores to a private equity firm for just £2. This video can not be played Biz Heads The buyer is a group of companies under the name ""Hailey"" advised by retailer turnaround specialists OpCapita. Shares in Olympus have plunged yet again as uncertainty looms over the camera maker's future. Shares fell 20% in Tokyo on Wednesday, after shedding 30% in the previous session. On Tuesday, Olympus launched an inquiry after admitting it had hidden losses on its securities investments for decades.

Debt Securities Market,Markets rise on Greek aid package,2024-09-14,2011-07-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-14246787,"Under the terms of the deal, Greece will have much longer to repay its existing debts Shares have risen following the eurozone's agreement designed to resolve the Greek debt crisis. UK and French markets gained more than 1% in morning trading, before slipping slightly, with the FTSE 100 index ending up 0.6% and the Cac 0.7% higher. Eurozone leaders agreed a new package worth 109bn euros ($155bn, £96.3bn). Private lenders will also be asked to contribute and, as a result, the Fitch ratings agency said it would consider Greece in ""restricted default"". Japan's main Nikkei share index had earlier closed up 1.2%. US stocks ended Friday trading in New York mixed, with the main Dow Jones index down 0.3%. However, analysts said Wall Street investors were more focused on the US's own debt problems. The euro was on Friday trading at $1.4369, down from $1.4439 immediately following Thursday's deal announcement. 'Unthinkable' One of the key terms of the new eurozone package is that it lowers the interest rates that Greece and the other two countries that have received bail-outs - Portugal and the Irish Republic - have to pay. The UK announced on Friday that it would follow suit and lower the interest rate that the Irish Republic has to pay on the £3.2bn loan it gave to the Irish government last year. Speaking on Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel hailed the eurozone accord and said it was her country's duty to support the single European currency. ""It is our historical duty to support the euro,"" Mrs Merkel said. ""The euro is good for us, the euro is part of Germany's economic success, and a Europe without the euro is unthinkable."" Relief at the deal offset any concerns about banks losing out as a result the planned debt restructuring. ""The deal removes one of the concerns related to the overall market... and EU finance ministers understand the risk associated with a possible default and that they're willing to step up and support weaker countries,"" said Robert Pavlik, a strategist at Banyan Partners in Florida. Bond yields, which reflect the risk investors attach to government debt, fell across the eurozone in morning trading, particularly those in Greece and Portugal. However, yields then rose again in the afternoon. Greece's Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the deal would provide ""great relief for the Greek economy"". The eurozone agreement is a comprehensive package designed not only to resolve Greece's debt crisis but to prevent contagion to other European economies, thereby shoring up the euro in the process. This video can not be played Many people feel there are even tougher times ahead The package includes: 109bn euros in new loans to Greece Various options to extend Greece's repayment terms and reduce the amount it repays on existing loans Voluntary private sector participation in these options, so that banks share taxpayers' burden Doubling the length of repayment terms for the Irish Republic and Portugal, both of which have received financial assistance previously Additional powers granted to the European Financial Stability Facility to buy up bonds and to make credit available to countries such as Spain and Italy that are not at immediate risk of insolvency. The Institute of International Finance, external (IIF) - a global trade body representing big banks and other major lenders - said the planned debt restructuring would target participation by 90% of Greece's private sector lenders. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said private lenders would contribute a total of 135bn euros of financing to Greece. This is expected to provide some 50bn euros of debt relief to Greece. Three of the four options offered to lenders to swap or relend existing debts would extend Greece's repayment terms by 30 years, while the fourth would do so by 15 years. They all offer a much lower interest rate than Greece's current 15%-25% cost of borrowing in financial markets. Two of the options would also involve ""haircuts"" - reducing the amount of debt Greece has to repay. The terms of the deal imply a loss to Greece's lenders equivalent to 21% of the market value of their debts, said the IIF. But because the contributions are ""expressly voluntary"", the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said that the deal should not trigger payments on default-swaps designed to protect against a default. Fitch ratings agency said it would consider Greece to have defaulted on its debts once old bonds had been swapped for new bonds. Although the agency welcomed the agreement as a positive step, it said it would have no choice but to declare a default once the swap had been made. ""An exchange that offers new securities with terms that are worse than the original contractual terms of the existing debt, and where the sovereign is subject to financial distress, constitutes a default event under Fitch's [ratings criteria],"" the firm said in a statement. Other ratings agencies have previously threatened to declare a default in the event of a debt restructuring. Observers suggest they are under considerable political pressure not to do so, as if they do it could severely undermine confidence in both the eurozone economy and its banks. This video can not be played Herman Van Rompuy: ""This situation was... threatening the stability of the eurozone"" The ECB and France had been particularly opposed to a restructuring and involving the private sector, but it was ultimately insisted on by Germany. Mr Sarkozy played down the significance of the banks' participation in the aid package. ""If the rating agencies are using the word you just used (default), it is not part of my vocabulary. Greece will pay its debt,"" he told reporters. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso indicated plans to rein in the power of the agencies. ""We... endorsed the plan of reducing over reliance on external credit ratings,"" he said, adding that policymakers would come forward in the autumn ""with further proposals"". European Union IMF"
Debt Securities Market,Jerome Powell: Trump's Fed chair nominee,2024-09-14,2017-11-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41779504,"Before he was president, Donald Trump campaigned to rid Washington of insiders and blasted the Federal Reserve's efforts to boost the US economy as ""reckless"". Judged on those terms, Jerome Powell, whom the president named this week to lead the US central bank, is a bit of a surprise. Mr Powell, 64, is a Washington native, a Princeton graduate and former partner in the Carlyle Group - one of the world's biggest investment companies. Among the candidates President Trump was considering, he was widely regarded as a safe choice - a change but one that would not rattle markets. A Republican, Mr Powell - known as Jay - has served on the Federal Reserve board since 2012, voting with the majority on issues such as interest rates.  He also brings a background as a moderate conservative on charged political questions such as national debt and bank regulation. ""It is a way to have a Republican but at the same time, not to rock the boat,"" said Sebastian Mallaby, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a book on long-time Fed chair Alan Greenspan. Mr Powell, low-key, known to play golf and sometimes ride his bike to work, trained as a lawyer at Georgetown Law.  If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the first chair in decades without an economics degree. Married with three children, his time at Carlyle has helped make him one of the Fed's richest members, with income estimated between about $20m and $55m. That fortune, as well as his lack of traditional credentials, gives him something in common with many of the president's other appointees. But Mr Powell owes his initial post on the Fed's board of governors to former President Barack Obama. Mr Obama noticed him in 2011 as he battled Congress to raise the national debt limit.  Mr Powell - then working for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank - published a report outlining the costs of inaction. His appointment was packaged with that of a more liberal colleague in a bid to ease confirmation in the Senate. Mr Powell ""is a guy who's very pragmatic and very much in the centre"", said economist R Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, who has known Mr Powell since they both worked in government in the early 1990s. If confirmed, Mr Powell will take over next year at a critical moment for the Fed, as the bank debates a shift away from recession-era policies aimed at boosting the economy. Mr Powell has spoken in favour of gradual rate hikes and a modest unwinding of its balance sheet. He said he expects the Fed to hold onto $2.5trn to $3trn in assets.  As a Fed governor, Mr Powell was worked on issues related to the benchmark interest rate known as LIBOR; participated in a committee focused on communication; and led this year's review of stress tests for major banks - the first time in seven years that all firms under review cleared both parts of the review. You're hired: Who will Trump choose to chair the Fed? What is the US Federal Reserve doing? He has also called for less regulation for small and medium-sized banks and for an overhaul of government housing finance agencies.  Much about Mr Powell's views on monetary policy remain unknown. ""It's been pretty quiet for a while, but now it's approaching a time where there's a lot of uncertainty and maybe some possible disagreement about what they should do next,"" said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Petersen Institute for International Economics. ""Interestingly ... [he] is probably the [candidate] who has written the least and has the least history of talking about monetary policy.""  The Fed has raised interest rates four times since 2015, gradually lifting the cost of borrowing. It has also started to reduce its balance sheet of Treasuries and mortgage-bonds, allowing securities to mature without reinvesting. Some say the Fed has moved too slowly during the recovery, pointing to the low unemployment rate. But others are concerned that inflation remains low and raising rates could chill economic activity. Mr Mallaby described Mr Powell as ""risk-averse"" and said that carried its own peril, given the economic and political uncertainties facing the Fed. Hard-right Republicans want to increase oversight of the bank, while rolling back industry regulations.  President Trump, who has not been shy about attacking institutions typically outside a chief executive's purview, also wants less stringent rules and has praised low interest rates. That could put him in conflict with the Fed as the bank pursues higher rates. ""The political threat to the Fed's independence both from Trump and from members of Congress is the biggest threat ... in a quarter of a century,"" said Mr Mallaby. ""So the next chairman needs to be adept at playing Washington."" Mr Powell cut his teeth in government while serving in the Treasury Department under former President George HW Bush, as regulators responded to issues with Treasury auctions from traders at Salomon Brothers. He was part of the team that tightened trading procedures in response to the scandal, but persuaded legislators against more sweeping regulations. William Heyman, chief investment officer at insurer The Travelers Cos, who knows Mr Powell from that period and counts him as a friend, described him as ""bipartisan to the point of being almost non-partisan"". ""He will be a balanced, bipartisan chairman,"" said Mr Heyman, who also served in government at the time and got to know Mr Powell over occasional games of tennis.  ""I don't think he will let politics undermine the independence of the Fed."" Mr Powell lacks the usual academic credentials, which could make it harder for him to serve as an economic authority. But it doesn't have to be a problem, said Mr Gagnon, an economist who has worked at the Federal Reserve ""If you listen well and you're persuasive and bring your colleagues along to try to reach some common ground, that could work,"" he said. On the economy: ""My baseline expectation is that the economy will continue on a path of growth of about 2%, strong job creation and tightening labour markets, and inflation moving up toward our 2% target.""  On regulation:  ""There is certainly a role for regulation, but regulation should always take into account the impact that it has on markets - a balance that must be constantly weighed. More regulation is not the best answer to every problem."" On the US housing market:  ""Fundamental housing finance reform - including reform to address the ultimate status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two systemically important government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) - remains on the to-do list. As memories of the crisis fade, the next few years may present our last best chance to finish these critical reforms. Failure to do so would risk repeating the mistakes of the past."""
Debt Securities Market,Tesla board reveals Musk buyout talks,2024-09-14,2018-08-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45118393,"Tesla's board has confirmed that it will consider the proposal by chief executive Elon Musk to take it private. A statement was issued by six members of the electric carmaker's board after Mr Musk tweeted to say he had the funding to de-list the company. The board had ""met several times over the last week"" to discuss going private, the statement said. They said this ""included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla's long-term interests"". Mr Musk said in his tweet on Tuesday that shareholders would be offered $420 (£326) per share, valuing the business at more than $70bn. This would make it the biggest deal of its kind, surpassing the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium. The brief statement by six of the nine board directors said Mr Musk had ""opened a discussion"" about taking the company private last week. The discussions ""addressed the funding for this to occur"", the six directors added. They did not include Mr Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, and Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist. The board statement came amid questions about how Mr Musk opted to disclose the possible de-listing to investors. While companies are allowed to make announcements via social media, typically they also make a simultaneous regulatory filing, said Andrew M Calamari, a partner at the law firm Finn Dixon & Herling and former director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator.  ""Just in terms of the style of this, it strikes me as very irregular,"" Mr Calamari said.  ""It also raises questions about his intent,"" he added. ""Was he in earnest in what he's saying, or does he have some other motive"" like influencing the stock price.  Tesla shares reached a peak of $368 after Mr Musk's tweets on Tuesday, before trading on the stock market was halted. Trades resumed later that afternoon, after the company published an email from Mr Musk to employees elaborating on the plans.  Tesla shares surged close to their all-time high of $385, which they touched almost a year ago, but fluctuated on Wednesday after the board members issued their statement.  In the staff memo, Mr Musk explained why he wanted to take the company private.  ""As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,"" he wrote. ""Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,"" he wrote. He added that the company was ""the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market"" - a trading strategy which assumes share prices will fall - so ""being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company"". Those traders are likely to have lost money when the share price rose on the announcement about a delisting. Mr Musk already owns 20% of the company. He said his intention in taking the company private was not to increase his personal holding and his plan would give existing investors the option to retain their shares. Regulators are likely to be interested in what evidence exists - such as agreements with investors or banks - for Mr Musk's claim that funding was ""secured"", Mr Calamari said. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator, has inquired about the issue, the Wall Street Journal reported. The structure of the deal also remains ambiguous, said Adam C Pritchard, professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. If more than 2,000 investors opt to retain their shares, then the firm would be subject to the disclosure rules of a public company, he added. ""Intuitively it doesn't make sense because it would still be a public entity, and the public entity status is what is apparently objectionable to Musk,"" Mr Pritchard said. Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise the necessary finance when Tesla has still not made a profit. ""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" he said."
Debt Securities Market,Nomura admits to Venezuela bond deal,2024-09-14,2017-06-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40117361,"A Japanese investment bank has admitted it was part of a controversial deal with Goldman Sachs to buy Venezuelan government bonds. Nomura Securities said it also bought about $100m worth of the bonds last week, according to Reuters reports. Goldman Sachs has faced fierce criticism for its purchase of $2.8bn worth of similar bonds. Opposition leader Julio Borges accused Goldman of ""aiding and abetting the country's dictatorial regime"". Venezuela's government, led by President Nicolas Maduro, is desperately in need of financial support.  He has also drawn international condemnation for abuses of power and human rights violations. His opponents say the purchase has given him a financial lifeline. Venezuela's oil-dependent economy, crippled by low oil prices, has been in recession for four years, and now faces shortages of food and medicine, with inflation thought to be about 800%. On Wednesday the country devalued its bolivar currency by 64%, from 721 to 2,010 bolivars to the dollar.  However, on the black market the bolivar has sunk to about 6,000 to the dollar. In the last two months, there have been some 60 deaths among protestors demanding early elections, freedom for jailed activists and foreign humanitarian aid. Mr Maduro says the protests are a violent attempt at a coup and insists the country is the victim of an ""economic war"" supported by Washington.  The bonds at the centre of the controversy were originally issued by Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state-run oil and natural gas company, in 2014.  Both banks bought them at knock-down prices. Mr Borges, who is president of the country's opposition-run Congress, said Goldman had paid 31 cents on the dollar.  Reuters reported that Nomura said its purchase had cost $30m. Goldman said its asset-management arm acquired the bonds ""on the secondary market from a broker and did not interact with the Venezuelan government"". ""We recognise that the situation is complex and evolving and that Venezuela is in crisis. We agree that life there has to get better, and we made the investment in part because we believe it will,"" the investment bank added. Mr Borges said: ""As hard as it may try, Goldman Sachs ... cannot put lipstick on this pig of a deal for Venezuelans,"" Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly voted on Tuesday to ask the US Congress to investigate the Goldman deal, which they called immoral and opaque. Mr Borges said he would recommend that any future democratic government ""not recognise or pay those bonds"". A small group of protesters outside Goldman's New York headquarters held signs saying ""Goldman Sachs Sucks!"" and ""Don't Support Venezuela's Hunger Bonds."" Even at 31 cents on the dollar, Nomura is taking a risk buying the bonds. In November, its own head of Latin America fixed-income strategy, Siobhan Mordan, warned investors: ""The bottom line for bondholders is not if, but when is the timing for debt default?"""
Debt Securities Market,US: Credit downgrade 'puzzling' and 'unwarranted',2024-09-14,2023-08-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66387419,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has defended the strength of the US economy, after the government was stripped of its top tier credit rating. Ms Yellen called the decision by Fitch, one of the three big ratings firms, ""puzzling"" and ""entirely unwarranted"". Her remarks came as global stock markets dropped and many buyers of Treasuries, as US government debt is known, demanded higher returns. The S&P 500 ended trade about 1.4% lower, while the Nasdaq fell 2.17%. The Dow Jones also fell nearly 1%. The declines in the US followed falls in the UK and other international markets.  Analysts noted that the Fitch decision was sparking some selling of risky assets. But the reaction was relatively muted compared with the big falls that greeted a similar move by rival ratings firm S&P in 2011, when the S&P 500 sank more than 6%. Even then, recovery happened relatively quickly and demand for US bonds held steady.  Harry Richards, investment manager for fixed income at UK investment firm Jupiter Asset Management, said his company acknowledged external credit ratings but its views on default risk were ""based on our own research and thinking"". ""In our opinion the US remains extremely unlikely to default,"" he said. ""There is nothing new in the reasons presented by Fitch, and all reasons cited are known knowns for the market."" Fitch on Tuesday pointed to increasing political dysfunction in the US and a rising public debt load in explaining its decision. Credit ratings are a gauge of the trustworthiness of the borrower, and how likely it is to repay its debts.   Because governments are such big players in debt markets, what they have to pay often has ripple effects on everyone else.  Just nine countries currently receive the top grade from the three biggest rating companies: Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Singapore and Australia. Canada receives the highest ratings from two of the ratings firms. The UK fell out of the club after Moody's downgraded the country in 2013.  In theory, a higher rating means lower borrowing costs. For smaller, emerging markets, where investment flows are more unstable, research suggests a downgrade can have a big impact, including on stock markets and interest rates faced by private firms.  But for bigger economies, the impact of such decisions is less clear.  The US downgrade followed a drawn out political battle in Congress over spending this spring, in which politicians threatened moves that could have led the country to miss its debt payments, otherwise known as default. In a speech on Wednesday, Ms Yellen said Fitch's downgrade was based ""on outdated data"" and failed ""to reflect improvements across a range of indicators, including those related to governance, that we've seen over the past two and a half years"".  She pointed to legislative accomplishments, including bills to invest in infrastructure, which won support from both parties. ""At the end of the day, Fitch's decision does not change what all of us already know: that Treasury securities remain the world's preeminent safe and liquid asset, and that the American economy is fundamentally strong,"" Ms Yellen said.  Justin Wolfers, professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said there was little doubt that the US economy was healthy enough for the government to meet its obligations - and has only strengthened since Fitch put the country on review in May.  But he said the report, even if it does not trigger major market turmoil, reflects weakening confidence in the US as a borrower as a result of events like the Jan 2021 riot in Washington and Republican threats to default.  Even a small rise in interest rates can mean billions in extra costs for taxpayers, he added.  ""There's a general sense, and I know how over-wrought this sounds, that the threats to American democracy are larger and more real than they've been in my lifetime,"" he said. ""The gamesmanship or brinksmanship that Fitch is calling out is very expensive and it raises interest rates."""
Debt Securities Market,GE shares plunge as probe widens,2024-09-14,2018-10-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46038495,"Shares in General Electric plunged by more than 8% following investor concerns about the turnaround prospects at the once-mighty industrial giant. GE admitted that US civil and criminal authorities had widened investigations into accounting practices at the firm. It also reported worse than expected third quarter results. It said that it would drastically cut its payment to shareholders to pay down debt and will restructure its struggling power business.  Larry Culp, GE's new chief executive and the third boss in two years, said the company's aviation and healthcare divisions - its two most profitable units - remain strong and he is confident that the business can improve. ""We know what we need to do. Now is the time to execute,"" he said.  However, shareholders dumped stock in the 126-year-old conglomerate to send its share price down to the lowest level since 2009. GE missed forecasts with a third quarter loss of $22.8bn after it was forced to take a $22bn writedown on its power division. Revenues fell down 4% to $29.6bn.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has expanded its investigation into GE's accounting practices to include the $22bn charge.  The Department of Justice is also investigation, chief financial officer Jamie Miller said. ""We are cooperating with the SEC and DoJ as they continue their work on these matters,"" she said. General Electric had already warned investors it would miss its profit targets this year. On Tuesday, it did not offer an updated outlook.  Mr Culp said he wanted more time to dig into the numbers, particularly at GE Power, where revenue dropped 33% in the quarter. The unit, which makes turbines and other products that power nuclear reactors and gas plants around the world, has faced a series of problems, including manufacturing flaws.  Its performance has also been dogged by the 2015 purchase of French company Alstom Energy, which expanded GE's traditional power plant footprint just as market demand began to shrink.  On Tuesday, Mr Culp said GE Power's financial reporting had been influenced by ""undue optimism"". He said a plan to split the division in two would simplify the business and make it easier to spot problems.  ""It's going to take some time, but I'm hopeful that we can build that credibility, deliver that performance over time,"" he said. General Electric, founded in 1892, traces its roots to Thomas Edison's lighting company and once ranked as the most valuable corporation in America. Its profile has declined more recently, as the firm sold off many of its divisions. "
Debt Securities Market,US raises interest rates for first time since 2018,2024-09-14,2022-03-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60768818,"The US Federal Reserve is raising interest rates for the first time since 2018 in an attempt to bring fast-rising prices under control. The US central bank said it was lifting its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points and signalled plans for further rate rises in the months ahead. The moves come as the economy faces new uncertainty caused by the Ukraine war and coronavirus outbreaks in China. They are expected to have widespread global repercussions. By raising rates, the Fed will make it more expensive for households, businesses and governments to borrow. It is hoping that will cool demand for goods and services, helping to ease price inflation in the US, which hit a new 40-year high of 7.9% last month. ""The plan is to restore price stability while also maintaining a strong labour market,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said. ""That is our intention and we believe we can do that but we have to restore price stability.""  ""We're not going to let high inflation become entrenched,"" he said. ""The costs of that would be too high."" The bank is trying to pull off a ""high-wire act"" says Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton. Move too slowly and inflation could become entrenched, eroding living standards over time. Move too fast and the Fed risks knocking growth in the US and abroad. ""They want to dampen down the pressures of inflation without derailing the global economy,"" she says. The plans represent a seismic shift in policy from the bank overseeing the world's largest economy. The Fed moved cautiously to raise interest rates after the financial crisis of 2008 and slashed them again when the coronavirus pandemic hit. The rate increase announced on Wednesday was expected and will push the target range for the bank's key rates to 0.25% to 0.5%. Projections released after the Fed's meeting show officials also expect the interest rate to rise to almost 2% by the end of the year - a full percentage point higher than they predicted in December. In addition to rate rises, the Fed will also be winding down other stimulus, including massive purchases of Treasury securities and other assets that it started to stabilize markets at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. And while the bank has certainly raised rates before, it has not faced this kind of inflation in decades. ""It's no longer just raising rates to accommodate stronger growth,"" Ms Swonk says. ""Actually chasing inflation as opposed to pre-empting inflation is a very different concept.""  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the US economy was well positioned to handle the increases, dismissing fears that it might tip into recession. ""The probability of a recession in the next year or so is not particularly elevated,"" he said at a press conference following the Fed meeting. ""All signs are that this is a strong economy, one that will be able to flourish, not to say withstand, but certainly flourish as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy."" Bank officials expect the US economy to grow 2.8% this year, and inflation to subside to around 4.3% by the end of the year.  That is still well above the bank's 2% target, raising fears the Fed is moving too cautiously. In the UK - where inflation hit 5.5% in January - the Bank of England has already raised rates twice and is expected to do so again on Thursday. Officials in many other countries, including South Africa, Brazil and South Korea, have also acted. By holding off, the Fed created a situation with more uncertainty about how far the it will have to raise rates and how quickly to get inflation under control, says Maurice Obstfeld, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. That's a problem - and not just in the US, he says. ""If you're in the UK or a wealthy continental European country, it's not a terribly big deal,"" he says. ""But if you're in a small emerging market where there have been inflationary prices - which is sort of everywhere outside of Asia - then I think you do have to worry about the repercussions, because you are entering a situation of greater fragility on international capital markets and you're on the front line of that."" When the US raises interest rates, investors often redirect money from riskier economies, deflating the value of local currencies. That also puts pressure on governments - especially those with large amounts of debt in dollars - at a time when budgets were already under strain from the Covid crisis. Russia's invasion of Ukraine - which has disrupted global oil and food markets - has made the situation even more delicate. It's not the Fed's job to focus on spill-over effects, says Professor Obstfeld, who is also a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  ""The ultimate factor that is destabilizing or potentially destabilizing for global markets is out-of-control US inflation,"" he says. Companies have attributed the price increases to higher costs from supply shortages, logistics disruptions and wage increases as they compete for workers in a competitive job market. Despite the gains, US demand has remained strong, boosted in part by increased government assistance to households during the pandemic.  But the rising cost of basics like food and petrol has still put pressure on President Joe Biden, as inflation outpaces wage gains. Sheilla Thompson, a manager at a social services organisation in Brooklyn, says she has put off going to the doctor, worried about how the extra bill will fit in amid rapidly rising costs of groceries and other essentials. ""I have to cut back,"" the 45-year-old says. ""All kinds of stuff has gone up."" ""The way all these prices are shooting up, can't the government put a stop to it?"" she adds."
Debt Securities Market,"The rapid rise of 'Buy now, pay later'",2024-09-14,2020-01-26,By Rebecca Wearn,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51195759,"At the end of your online shop, you may have noticed a new way to pay. It's not a bank card, it's not store credit. And it's quick; just a couple of clicks. So-called ""buy now, pay later"" services allow customers to either delay the whole bill for their chosen item, or split the cost into a clutch of equal instalments, interest-free.  Despite growing calls from debt charities about these products adding pressure to Britain's multi-billion pound debt pile, UK financial regulators have no plans to investigate them.  The firms are familiar to Dan Lane and his team at Christians Against Poverty, and the charity is keeping a close eye on how they factor into those they help.  ""We are confident that the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] will also be keeping a close eye on these new firms, these new products and seeing how it impacts the people that will be using them. We would expect them to take action as necessary where and when they are able to if it is needed,"" he says.  The persuasive power of the products is not lost on a group of graduates from Salford University.  ""It makes you feel like you're getting an even better deal,"" says Ellie Kemp. ""If you're sensible and responsible, then why not?"" adds Rebecca McGrath.  But as they click through a couple of pretend purchases, both the ease of use and the way information presented start to put the group off: ""That's where the dangers can come in,"" says Rebecca. ""If you have multiple orders, it's so easy to get carried away. And what is not outlined is what happens if you miss these payments.""  The BBC contacted Klarna, ClearPay and Laybuy which all said 2019 had been their biggest year yet in the UK. And two of those three main players added 3.3 million new customers to their base - meaning these products have an estimated seven million users. The UK holds such potential that Gary Rohloff, the cofounder of Laybuy, has moved his family from New Zealand to London, and he expects the UK business to be bigger than in his home country within the next year.  ""This is an interest-free credit option, so for a consumer this is a way of buying the things they need,"" explains Mr Rohloff. ""We've had families write to us thanking us for being able to afford raincoats at the start of winter because they couldn't afford to buy coats in one hit but can afford smaller payments over six weeks.""  Laybuy, like its competitors, is popular with young people who do not want to take out formal credit arrangements, but also slightly older parents in their 30s and 40s trying to spread costs.  But Mr Rohloff does add that using ""buy now, pay later"" might encourage a consumer to spend more, saying: ""The average order values are significantly higher."" Which is why they are so popular with retailers.  Like all such providers, Laybuy says it makes most of its money from the retailers themselves - about £4 in every £100 spent - and defends late fees as an ""incentive to pay"".   Mr Rohloff maintains that there are sufficient warnings to avoid users getting into trouble. Laybuy is not registered with regulator, the FCA, but does work with Experian to run a hard credit check  on users (which can impact their credit score) to make sure they can afford to pay.  ""We wouldn't want our sons put in an unsustainable debt position, so we would not allow the company to do that to others,"" he says. Regulation is not on the cards yet. The FCA has been looking at consumer credit but because these products do not charge interest, they fall out of their remit for regulation.  However its counterpart in Australia - where these products have been around much longer - undertook a recent review that found numerous causes for concern.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission highlighted potential risks to the market's under-35 customer base, adding that these arrangements can cause consumers to ""become financially over-committed"" and therefore likely to face late fees.  ASIC wants its remit extended to cover ""buy now, pay later"". Here in the UK the FCA has no plans but will continue to monitor the market.  There's no denying these companies are providing some help in a retail slump. But Mr Lane from Christians Against Poverty has one last question for shoppers:  ""Overall, we would say to people that if you can't afford the product today - why do you think you could afford it in 30, 60 or 90 days time?"""
Debt Securities Market,Musk stuns Wall Street with Tesla tweets,2024-09-14,2018-08-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45105674,"Tesla boss Elon Musk is considering taking the electric-car firm private, a move he claimed was the ""best path forward"" for the company.  He said de-listing from the stock exchange meant Tesla, currently valued at $63.8bn (£50bn), would no longer be under the glare of Wall Street.  In an unusual move, Mr Musk first made the announcement on Twitter rather than via an official regulatory disclosure. But analysts are sceptical about what would be the biggest buyout in history.  Since Tesla floated on the stock market, Mr Musk has clashed with analysts and complained that quarterly scrutiny of the firm's finances encourages short-term thinking. Tesla shares ended the day 11% up at almost $380 per share - close to their all-time high. Mr Musk said shareholders would be offered $420 per share, valuing the business at more than $80bn, including debt. A buyout at that value would make it by far the biggest such deal. The current biggest is the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium that included KKR and TPG. Mr Musk claimed to have secured funding to buy out shareholders, but did not provide details. However, he also warned that ""a final decision has not been made"" about the move. Any buy-out would need a shareholder vote. BBC business editor Simon Jack said that if it emerges that Mr Musk did not have solid financial backing for a buyout he could be in trouble with regulators for share price manipulation. While Twitter was an unconventional way to make the announcement, the US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, allows firms to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter in this way provided investors have been told which social media outlets will be used. In 2013, Tesla flagged Mr Musk's Twitter account as a source of information.  The firm subsequently shared a message from Mr Musk to employees that explained the thinking behind his announcement.  Mr Musk, who owns almost 20% of the company, said he hoped the move would shield the firm from distracting swings in the share price and the pressure to meet quarterly financial targets. He also said he wanted to end ""negative propaganda"" from short sellers, investors who bet on the shares of a firm going down. ""Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,"" he wrote. Mr Musk has discussed the drawbacks of being a public company before. But his tweets stirred confusion initially, given his history of informal use of the social media service. For example, on April Fool's Day, he joked on Twitter about Tesla going bankrupt.  Mr Musk's plan would allow investors to choose to retain their holdings. He planned to hold onto his shares and hoped to continue as chief executive, he added.  Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, said Mr Musk had a ""one-in-three chance"" of managing to succeed with his plan. ""The 16% premium to the current share price may not be high enough to incentivise existing shareholders to support the sale,"" he added.  And Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise finance when Tesla has still not made a profit.  ""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" he said. Elon Musk had better have the money lined up to take Tesla private or he could be in serious trouble with regulators. There is never a dull moment with the mercurial Mr Musk, but he excelled himself on Tuesday, stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each. The shares surged, which will have left the people who have been betting the shares would fall nursing very heavy losses. It will have given Mr Musk great pleasure to get one over on the naysayers. But he's playing a potentially dangerous game. If it turns out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to buy out public shareholders - is in any way shaky, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation. It's a very serious charge, which can land you in jail. Read Simon's blog. Mr Musk's disclosure stirred further speculation about Tesla's future. The firm is spending heavily as it ramps up production of its latest car, the Model 3. It reported a record loss in its most recent quarter, and some analysts say it will need to raise money in order to survive. However, Mr Musk has said he has no plans to do so and promised that the firm will be profitable in the second half of the year, barring any unforeseen events. The tweets came after a separate report in the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had taken a 3%-5% stake in Tesla, a holding worth at least $1.9bn. The article said the state fund, overseen by the powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been interested in buying newly issued shares."
Debt Securities Market,Bank of Canada in rare interest rate rise,2024-09-14,2017-07-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40585509,"The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates by one quarter of a per cent for the first time in about seven years. The central bank raised its key interest rate Wednesday morning to .75 from .5, citing strong economic growth despite low inflation. The news was expected, but the hikes will have wide-ranging effects, especially on variable-rate mortgages. The Canadian dollar reached an 11-month high in anticipation of the announcement. Economic growth has been stop-and-go since the recession, with more serious setbacks in 2015 when oil prices tanked.  But it has picked up since then, with GDP growing by 3.7% in the first quarter of 2017.  Strong consumer spending, exports and investments are expected to keep the economy growing, the central bank predicts. ""The economy can handle very well this kind of move today,"" said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz. ""Of course we'd preface that with the acknowledgement that of course interest rates are still very low."" While the US Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates slowly since 2015, this is essentially the Bank of Canada's first toe in the water.  ""It reads hawkish,"" Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities, told Reuters. ""We are probably going to see them reduce more stimulus later this year provided that the outlook holds up."" After slashing rates following the recession, the bank slowly raised them from .25% to 1% in the course of 2010, as the country showed strong signs of recovery.  But a mini-recession caused by a downturn in oil prices led to the bank lowering them back down to .5%, where they remained until Wednesday. Some economists expect interest rates to rise again in October, but Mr Poloz was coy on those prospects. ""In the full course of time, I don't doubt that interest rates will move higher, but there's no predetermined path,"" he said. Canada has one of the highest rates of consumer debt in the world, thanks in part to historically low interest rates over the past several years.  With rates on the rise, this consumer debt could could put some households in peril, and a hike in mortgage rates could trigger some housing markets to cool, say financial analysts."

By holding off, the Fed created a situation with more uncertainty about how far the it will have to raise rates and how quickly to get inflation under control, says Maurice Obstfeld, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. That's a problem - and not just in the US, he says. ""If you're in the UK or a wealthy continental European country, it's not a terribly big deal,"" he says. ""But if you're in a small emerging market where there have been inflationary prices - which is sort of everywhere outside of Asia - then I think you do have to worry about the repercussions, because you are entering a situation of greater fragility on international capital markets and you're on the front line of that."" When the US raises interest rates, investors often redirect money from riskier economies, deflating the value of local currencies. That also puts pressure on governments - especially those with large amounts of debt in dollars - at a time when budgets were already under strain from the Covid crisis. Russia's invasion of Ukraine - which has disrupted global oil and food markets - has made the situation even more delicate. It's not the Fed's job to focus on spill-over effects, says Professor Obstfeld, who is also a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  ""The ultimate factor that is destabilizing or potentially destabilizing for global markets is out-of-control US inflation,"" he says. Companies have attributed the price increases to higher costs from supply shortages, logistics disruptions and wage increases as they compete for workers in a competitive job market. Despite the gains, US demand has remained strong, boosted in part by increased government assistance to households during the pandemic.  But the rising cost of basics like food and petrol has still put pressure on President Joe Biden, as inflation outpaces wage gains. Sheilla Thompson, a manager at a social services organisation in Brooklyn, says she has put off going to the doctor, worried about how the extra bill will fit in amid rapidly rising costs of groceries and other essentials. ""I have to cut back,"" the 45-year-old says. ""All kinds of stuff has gone up."" ""The way all these prices are shooting up, can't the government put a stop to it?"" she adds."
Debt Securities Market,Tesla board reveals Musk buyout talks,2024-09-14,2018-08-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45118393,"Tesla's board has confirmed that it will consider the proposal by chief executive Elon Musk to take it private. A statement was issued by six members of the electric carmaker's board after Mr Musk tweeted to say he had the funding to de-list the company. The board had ""met several times over the last week"" to discuss going private, the statement said. They said this ""included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla's long-term interests"". Mr Musk said in his tweet on Tuesday that shareholders would be offered $420 (£326) per share, valuing the business at more than $70bn. This would make it the biggest deal of its kind, surpassing the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium. The brief statement by six of the nine board directors said Mr Musk had ""opened a discussion"" about taking the company private last week. The discussions ""addressed the funding for this to occur"", the six directors added. They did not include Mr Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, and Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist. The board statement came amid questions about how Mr Musk opted to disclose the possible de-listing to investors. While companies are allowed to make announcements via social media, typically they also make a simultaneous regulatory filing, said Andrew M Calamari, a partner at the law firm Finn Dixon & Herling and former director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator.  ""Just in terms of the style of this, it strikes me as very irregular,"" Mr Calamari said.  ""It also raises questions about his intent,"" he added. ""Was he in earnest in what he's saying, or does he have some other motive"" like influencing the stock price.  Tesla shares reached a peak of $368 after Mr Musk's tweets on Tuesday, before trading on the stock market was halted. Trades resumed later that afternoon, after the company published an email from Mr Musk to employees elaborating on the plans.  Tesla shares surged close to their all-time high of $385, which they touched almost a year ago, but fluctuated on Wednesday after the board members issued their statement.  In the staff memo, Mr Musk explained why he wanted to take the company private.  ""As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,"" he wrote. ""Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,"" he wrote. He added that the company was ""the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market"" - a trading strategy which assumes share prices will fall - so ""being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company"". Those traders are likely to have lost money when the share price rose on the announcement about a delisting. Mr Musk already owns 20% of the company. He said his intention in taking the company private was not to increase his personal holding and his plan would give existing investors the option to retain their shares. Regulators are likely to be interested in what evidence exists - such as agreements with investors or banks - for Mr Musk's claim that funding was ""secured"", Mr Calamari said. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator, has inquired about the issue, the Wall Street Journal reported. The structure of the deal also remains ambiguous, said Adam C Pritchard, professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. If more than 2,000 investors opt to retain their shares, then the firm would be subject to the disclosure rules of a public company, he added. ""Intuitively it doesn't make sense because it would still be a public entity, and the public entity status is what is apparently objectionable to Musk,"" Mr Pritchard said. Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise the necessary finance when Tesla has still not made a profit. ""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" he said."
Debt Securities Market,Jerome Powell: Trump's Fed chair nominee,2024-09-14,2017-11-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41779504,"Before he was president, Donald Trump campaigned to rid Washington of insiders and blasted the Federal Reserve's efforts to boost the US economy as ""reckless"". Judged on those terms, Jerome Powell, whom the president named this week to lead the US central bank, is a bit of a surprise. Mr Powell, 64, is a Washington native, a Princeton graduate and former partner in the Carlyle Group - one of the world's biggest investment companies. Among the candidates President Trump was considering, he was widely regarded as a safe choice - a change but one that would not rattle markets. A Republican, Mr Powell - known as Jay - has served on the Federal Reserve board since 2012, voting with the majority on issues such as interest rates.  He also brings a background as a moderate conservative on charged political questions such as national debt and bank regulation. ""It is a way to have a Republican but at the same time, not to rock the boat,"" said Sebastian Mallaby, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a book on long-time Fed chair Alan Greenspan. Mr Powell, low-key, known to play golf and sometimes ride his bike to work, trained as a lawyer at Georgetown Law.  If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the first chair in decades without an economics degree. Married with three children, his time at Carlyle has helped make him one of the Fed's richest members, with income estimated between about $20m and $55m. That fortune, as well as his lack of traditional credentials, gives him something in common with many of the president's other appointees. But Mr Powell owes his initial post on the Fed's board of governors to former President Barack Obama. Mr Obama noticed him in 2011 as he battled Congress to raise the national debt limit.  Mr Powell - then working for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank - published a report outlining the costs of inaction. His appointment was packaged with that of a more liberal colleague in a bid to ease confirmation in the Senate. Mr Powell ""is a guy who's very pragmatic and very much in the centre"", said economist R Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, who has known Mr Powell since they both worked in government in the early 1990s. If confirmed, Mr Powell will take over next year at a critical moment for the Fed, as the bank debates a shift away from recession-era policies aimed at boosting the economy. Mr Powell has spoken in favour of gradual rate hikes and a modest unwinding of its balance sheet. He said he expects the Fed to hold onto $2.5trn to $3trn in assets.  As a Fed governor, Mr Powell was worked on issues related to the benchmark interest rate known as LIBOR; participated in a committee focused on communication; and led this year's review of stress tests for major banks - the first time in seven years that all firms under review cleared both parts of the review. You're hired: Who will Trump choose to chair the Fed? What is the US Federal Reserve doing? He has also called for less regulation for small and medium-sized banks and for an overhaul of government housing finance agencies.  Much about Mr Powell's views on monetary policy remain unknown. ""It's been pretty quiet for a while, but now it's approaching a time where there's a lot of uncertainty and maybe some possible disagreement about what they should do next,"" said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Petersen Institute for International Economics. ""Interestingly ... [he] is probably the [candidate] who has written the least and has the least history of talking about monetary policy.""  The Fed has raised interest rates four times since 2015, gradually lifting the cost of borrowing. It has also started to reduce its balance sheet of Treasuries and mortgage-bonds, allowing securities to mature without reinvesting. Some say the Fed has moved too slowly during the recovery, pointing to the low unemployment rate. But others are concerned that inflation remains low and raising rates could chill economic activity. Mr Mallaby described Mr Powell as ""risk-averse"" and said that carried its own peril, given the economic and political uncertainties facing the Fed. Hard-right Republicans want to increase oversight of the bank, while rolling back industry regulations.  President Trump, who has not been shy about attacking institutions typically outside a chief executive's purview, also wants less stringent rules and has praised low interest rates. That could put him in conflict with the Fed as the bank pursues higher rates. ""The political threat to the Fed's independence both from Trump and from members of Congress is the biggest threat ... in a quarter of a century,"" said Mr Mallaby. ""So the next chairman needs to be adept at playing Washington."" Mr Powell cut his teeth in government while serving in the Treasury Department under former President George HW Bush, as regulators responded to issues with Treasury auctions from traders at Salomon Brothers. He was part of the team that tightened trading procedures in response to the scandal, but persuaded legislators against more sweeping regulations. William Heyman, chief investment officer at insurer The Travelers Cos, who knows Mr Powell from that period and counts him as a friend, described him as ""bipartisan to the point of being almost non-partisan"". ""He will be a balanced, bipartisan chairman,"" said Mr Heyman, who also served in government at the time and got to know Mr Powell over occasional games of tennis.  ""I don't think he will let politics undermine the independence of the Fed."" Mr Powell lacks the usual academic credentials, which could make it harder for him to serve as an economic authority. But it doesn't have to be a problem, said Mr Gagnon, an economist who has worked at the Federal Reserve ""If you listen well and you're persuasive and bring your colleagues along to try to reach some common ground, that could work,"" he said. On the economy: ""My baseline expectation is that the economy will continue on a path of growth of about 2%, strong job creation and tightening labour markets, and inflation moving up toward our 2% target.""  On regulation:  ""There is certainly a role for regulation, but regulation should always take into account the impact that it has on markets - a balance that must be constantly weighed. More regulation is not the best answer to every problem."" On the US housing market:  ""Fundamental housing finance reform - including reform to address the ultimate status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two systemically important government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) - remains on the to-do list. As memories of the crisis fade, the next few years may present our last best chance to finish these critical reforms. Failure to do so would risk repeating the mistakes of the past."""
Debt Securities Market,GE shares plunge as probe widens,2024-09-14,2018-10-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46038495,"Shares in General Electric plunged by more than 8% following investor concerns about the turnaround prospects at the once-mighty industrial giant. GE admitted that US civil and criminal authorities had widened investigations into accounting practices at the firm. It also reported worse than expected third quarter results. It said that it would drastically cut its payment to shareholders to pay down debt and will restructure its struggling power business.  Larry Culp, GE's new chief executive and the third boss in two years, said the company's aviation and healthcare divisions - its two most profitable units - remain strong and he is confident that the business can improve. ""We know what we need to do. Now is the time to execute,"" he said.  However, shareholders dumped stock in the 126-year-old conglomerate to send its share price down to the lowest level since 2009. GE missed forecasts with a third quarter loss of $22.8bn after it was forced to take a $22bn writedown on its power division. Revenues fell down 4% to $29.6bn.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has expanded its investigation into GE's accounting practices to include the $22bn charge.  The Department of Justice is also investigation, chief financial officer Jamie Miller said. ""We are cooperating with the SEC and DoJ as they continue their work on these matters,"" she said. General Electric had already warned investors it would miss its profit targets this year. On Tuesday, it did not offer an updated outlook.  Mr Culp said he wanted more time to dig into the numbers, particularly at GE Power, where revenue dropped 33% in the quarter. The unit, which makes turbines and other products that power nuclear reactors and gas plants around the world, has faced a series of problems, including manufacturing flaws.  Its performance has also been dogged by the 2015 purchase of French company Alstom Energy, which expanded GE's traditional power plant footprint just as market demand began to shrink.  On Tuesday, Mr Culp said GE Power's financial reporting had been influenced by ""undue optimism"". He said a plan to split the division in two would simplify the business and make it easier to spot problems.  ""It's going to take some time, but I'm hopeful that we can build that credibility, deliver that performance over time,"" he said. General Electric, founded in 1892, traces its roots to Thomas Edison's lighting company and once ranked as the most valuable corporation in America. Its profile has declined more recently, as the firm sold off many of its divisions. "
Debt Securities Market,Week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-14,2019-02-09,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-47184251,"Parliament's brief respite from Brexit will end this week - and while a major debate is scheduled for Thursday, it is still far from clear how the week's events will unfold.  The thing to look out for is the sudden announcement of a new Business Statement from the Leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, to rejig the parliamentary timetable, should circumstances change in some way.  MPs, and indeed Mr Speaker, would doubtless be very suspicious of any postponement, but it is far from impossible that the debate could be brought forward.  The first unknown is whether the prime minister will have a reversioned exit deal to lay before the House. Few expect she will, having emerged from her latest talks with a promise of more negotiations.  And in the absence of that, the promise is that MPs will have a debate on a neutral motion, to which they can attach amendments. In other words, something very similar in form to the series of votes held on 29 January, which yielded the ""Brady Amendment"" instructing the PM to seek to reshape the Northern Ireland backstop into a form Conservative backbenchers and the DUP could accept.  With uncertainty over the shape of any deal the prime minister may obtain, expect the next crop of amendments to be mostly about process - they may, for example, include a new incarnation of the proposal from Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles, to force the government to postpone Brexit Day, if they have no deal by the end of the month.  This was a potent legislative weapon, prioritising a bill which would then have been binding upon the government. It failed then, but, a fortnight closer to Brexit Day and to the prospect of a no-deal exit, a different version, perhaps featuring a shorter postponement, might be a runner.   There may also be some attempt to muster support for a ""soft Brexit"" amendment to push the government towards a customs union-based Brexit - something which many Conservative Brexiteers would be deeply opposed to. At the moment this is all speculation - but watch out for supporters of assorted Brexit schemes breaking cover over the weekend, to announce their pet amendments. Meanwhile there is a fair amount of Brexit business under way. The Lords will be spending much of the coming week hacking their way through dozens of Brexit-related orders and regulations, and there's what amounts to the first no-deal preparatory bill, in the shape of the Financial Services (Implementation of Legislation) Bill  in the Commons. The Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Work and Pensions questions, doubtless to be followed by the usual post-weekend crop of ministerial statements and urgent questions. MPs then turn to the Financial Services (Implementation of Legislation) Bill - a major piece of legislation transposing a huge volume of EU regulations into UK law - it includes so-called ""in-flight files"" which are EU regulations that are not fully solidified into law, at the time of Brexit. The day ends with a particularly interesting adjournment debate, led by the Conservative Craig Mackinlay, on reform of election law.  Last month, Mr Mackinlay was acquitted of charges of overspending in his election campaign in 2017 and says that he has ""extreme concerns as to the clarity of election law, and the glaring grey area between national spending rules (under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000) and local spending rules (under the Representation of the People Act 1983)""; adding that ""candidates and agents should never have to face the threat of criminal prosecution, with life-changing consequences, in the face of abstract law"".  Intriguingly, he promises to offer ""an elegant solution"". In Westminster Hall the Petitions Committee has scheduled a debate on e-petition 229178 which states that: ""School should start at 10am as teenagers are too tired"". The petition, which has more than 179,000 signatures, states: ""Teenagers are so tired due to having to wake up very early to get to school. The government should require secondary schools to start later, which will lead to increased productivity at school.""  This attracted 90,000 signatures in 19 hours last weekend, making it one of the fastest growing petitions since the e-petitions website opened in 2015. The government have not had time to issue a written response.  My committee pick is the Housing, Communities and Local Government session on local authorities' children's services (4pm).  This features academics and children's charities and will focus on the pressures faced by local authorities' children's services, including the increasing demand for child protection services. In the Lords (2.30 pm) questions to ministers include the Labour peer and refugee campaigner Lord Dubs asking about the number of refugee children who have arrived in the UK from Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey under the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme which he was instrumental in creating.  Peers then look at Commons amendments to the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Bill, where the key issue is on evidence in relation to the death penalty in third party countries. The rest of the day is devoted to (count them) nine Statutory Instrument approval motions: two on companies, limited liability partnerships, and on recognition of professional qualifications; and then two (to be taken together) on social security/ National Insurance payments, and on tax credits and Guardian's Allowance. These are followed by four Sis on insolvency and insurance; insurance distribution; financial conglomerates; and Financial Services Contracts. MPs kick off (at 11.30am) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions.   The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is the Child Cruelty (Sentences) Bill - the Conservative Tom Tugendhat will be calling an increase in the maximum sentence for child cruelty, prompted by the case of his constituent Tony Hudgell, now four years old. He was beaten so badly by his birth parents (Hudgell is the name of the parents who later adopted him) that he had to have both legs amputated. Mr Tugendhat wants judges to have the option of passing longer sentences than the current ten year maximum, in these very rare cases.  The main event is the detailed report stage consideration of the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill, which picks up recommendations from the Law Commission to review the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards scheme, the procedures under which someone may be deprived of liberty because they lack mental capacity. There are a number of detailed amendments from the government and from Labour clarifying who is responsible for decisions in various circumstances, and an amendment from Labour MPs Chris Bryant and Debbie Abrahams dealing with the effects of the bill on people being treated for brain injuries. The adjournment debate, led by the Labour MP Owen Smith, is on the licensing of medical devices - he aims to highlight what he warns is the weakness of the regulations of medical devices, as shown by successive scandals about surgical mesh, some hip replacements, pace-makers and breast implants.  He says more and more devices are being implanted in people, but with none of the scrutiny that medicines are subject to. He believes they should be tracked and evaluated once on the market - but the companies don't want to bear the cost of post-marketing surveillance. In Westminster Hall (9.30am) the Labour MP Bambos Charalambous leads a debate on missing persons guardianship - he had a constituent whose brother went missing on the Galapagos Islands, whose body was never recovered. She tried to manage his affairs while not being able to produce a body. She found it virtually impossible to do so, because the mortgage lender would not discuss matters with her, and she was not able to cancel direct debits and manage her brother's affairs. Eventually, after a long passage of time, she managed to go down the presumption of death route.  This issue affects many people. A charity called Missing People estimates that more than 1,000 people go missing for over a year every year, where they do not know what has happened to them and have not found a body. These are not just runaways but people who are long-term missing. Their families, as well as having the grief, cannot manage their affairs.  The Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act was passed in April 2017 but has never been implemented, more than two and a half years later. Other debates include the regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures, led by the Conservative Alberto Costa (11am);  special educational needs and disabilities funding led by the Lib Dem Leader, Sir Vince Cable (2.30pm); then comes a Brexit-related debate on the seasonal agricultural workers scheme (4pm).  Labour MP Alex Norris wants to highlight the danger that post-Brexit schemes for farm workers might provide an opportunity for modern slavery, and practices like debt bondage and abuse by gangmasters. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid has signalled that he is aware of this issue, and Mr Norris is keen to quiz ministers about their plans.  The final debate (4.30pm) is on support for young carers. Labour MP Paul Blomfield has been pressing ministers to fund local authorities efforts to identify and support carers, particularly so-called 'invisible' carers who are not known to local councils or local groups.  My committee pick is the Welsh Affairs session on the future of the Wylfa Newydd nuclear reactor (2.45pm). Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and Business Minister Richard Harrington will be quizzed on their next moves after the Japanese nuclear firm, Hitachi, pulled out of the £20bn project with the loss of thousands of jobs. Meanwhile the Transport Committee has its final evidence session on the health of the bus market (9.45am)  with the Buses Minister Nusrat Ghani, who will face questions on what the government is doing to support the industry and reverse the drop in passenger numbers on services outside London. The committee has been out and about investigating conditions in Leicester, Bristol and Liverpool and hearing from passengers, bus companies and local authorities about issues like funding, ticketing and regulation. In the Lords (2.30pm) peers rattle through another job lot of Brexit-related statutory instruments: the Draft Aviation Safety (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019; the Draft Air Passenger Rights and Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (EU Exit) Regulations 2018; the Draft Air Services (Competition) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Draft Airports Slot Allocation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Draft Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seatbelts) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018. A busy Commons day opens (11.30am) with half an hour of International Development questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Questions.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is proposed by Labour's Matt Western, who wants to limit bus drivers on local routes to driving for no more than 56 hours in any one week and 90 hours in any two consecutive weeks.  And then MPs will deliver their tributes to Sir David Natzler, the Clerk of the Commons, who is retiring after serving as the top advisor to the Speaker and MPs on constitutional and procedural issues.  Guide: The Brexit amendments and results The PM will then update MPs on the progress of Brexit - with a statement which will feed into Thursday's debate on a neutral motion. MPs may also press for the Business of the House motion laying out the parameters for Thursday's debate to be discussed, and possibly amended on Wednesday, well in advance of the actual debate.  The main legislative action is a debate on the Securitisation Regulations 2018 - this is about the new EU regulations on pooling different types of debt like residential or commercial mortgages, car loans or credit card debt obligations and selling the resulting cash flows as securities.  And after that there's a general debate on ""connecting communities by supporting families and volunteers"". The close of business would normally be the deadline for submitting amendments for discussion in Thursday's Brexit debate. In Westminster Hall the opening debate (9.30am) is on the health implications of sunbed use - the Conservative Pauline Latham wants to discuss the dangers from the ultraviolet rays given out by sunbeds, which increase the risk of developing skin cancer, although it can then take up to 20 years to appear. She will quote World Health Organisation advice that sunbeds are as dangerous as smoking and argue for greater safeguards on their use. Other debates include the SNP's Tommy Sheppard on human rights in the UK (2.30pm) and the Conservative Ben Bradley on nurture and alternative provision in primary schools (4.30pm). On the committee corridor, the Women and Equalities Committee have a promising-looking hearing (9.50am) on the use of non-disclosure agreements in discrimination cases, where the focus seems to be on their use by public bodies.  The witnesses are top officials from the House of Commons, including Saira Salimi, the Speaker's Counsel, as well as from the Cabinet Office, the BBC, and several local councils. And the Brexit Committee (9.15am) has a star guest in the form of Bertie Ahern, the former Taioseach of the Republic of Ireland who oversaw the negotiation of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. This is part of the committee's continuing inquiry monitoring the progress of the Brexit negotiations - and with the Northern Ireland backstop now such a critical issue, this will doubtless be a significant hearing. In the Lords (3pm) questions to ministers include Lib Dem by-election guru Lord Rennard asking about providing greater clarity on constituency expenditure on behalf of a candidate and national expenditure on behalf of a party - he believes the current law allows almost unlimited 'national' party spending being targeted at individual constituencies. He will be asking ministers to bring forward secondary legislation which would avoid any confusion restore 'level playing field' principles. Then it's back to Brexit, with a government ""take note"" motion on EU withdrawal together plus, on previous form, a Labour amendment which will then be pushed to a vote at the end - expect something which seeks to build on previous resolutions of the Lords by urging the government to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, the week's third batch of orders and regulations will be discussed in the Moses Room (the Lords equivalent of Westminster Hall): the Construction Products (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations; the Storage of Carbon Dioxide (Amendment and Power to Modify) (EU Exit) Regulations; the Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products and Energy Information (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations and the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations.  The Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by questions to the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.  The main debate is on the UK's withdrawal from the EU (see above) and it will probably culminate in a couple of hours of voting on alternative ideas about Brexit.  The timing of these will depend on the Business of the House motion, but expect them in the early evening. A key moment will be the Speaker's selection of the amendments to be discussed.   In Westminster Hall, there's a debate on the effect of Santander branch closures on local communities. In the Lords (11am) the usual half hour of questions to ministers is followed by a another helping of statutory instruments including the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase and compensation payments for Mesothelioma and Pneumoconiosis.  All three of these have already been through the Commons. Then comes the week's fourth batch of Brexit orders and regulations, including the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) (Amendment) Order 2018. There's also a short debate on improving immigration procedures in the UK, led by the Lib Dem, Lord Roberts of Llandudno. Neither House sits on Friday."
Debt Securities Market,Why US rates have a global impact,2024-09-14,2018-06-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44389203,"US central bankers have raised a key interest rate again this week, lifting the bank's benchmark rate to its highest level since 2008. The US Federal Reserve raised the target federal funds rate by 0.25%, taking it to 1.75% to 2%. The rise marks the Fed's seventh rate increase since 2015. Officials aim to head off excessive inflation with higher rates and think the US economy can handle higher borrowing costs. They are also shrinking the Fed's massive holdings of government debt and mortgage-backed securities, which were purchased to lift the economy out of the recession that ran from late 2007 to 2009.  So what impact is the shift in policy having? Some of the most dramatic effects have appeared in emerging markets, as higher US rates lure back investors who in recent years had looked for returns abroad. The retreat from emerging markets remains relatively modest, with weekly flows to bond and equity funds down less than 10% from their peaks, according to EPFR Global, part of research firm Informa.  But it has coincided with - and partially fuelled - a stronger dollar, contributing to currency crises in countries such as Argentina, Turkey and Brazil.  It has also prompted central banks elsewhere, including in Indonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong, to raise their own interest rates in defence. Countries that have seen the worst market turmoil have also faced political and financial problems of their own. But the Fed may be underestimating its role, said Desmond Lachman, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former head of emerging market strategy Salomon Smith Barney.  He pointed to recent remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell that the power of US interest rates is ""often exaggerated"".  If the turbulence persists, it could hurt economies abroad, eventually reducing demand for US products and services, he added. ""Fed tightening is causing all sorts of problems for many emerging market countries and those problems can then come back to impact the US,"" he said. The Fed ""should be focused on it, but I don't know how much it is"". In the US, banks are passing on higher borrowing costs to customers, raising the rates they charge for items such as credit cards, mortgages and car loans. Consumer spending - a major driver of the US economy - has held up, as a strong economy gives people confidence they can shoulder the added cost.  But with US incomes still relatively flat, higher rates could eventually induce greater caution. Signs of strain are already visible in parts of the economy dependent on borrowing, like the housing market, where the pace of home sales has weakened, amid low supply and high prices. A strong job market has helped to limit the effects, but economists say rate rises could cause buyers to retreat, even though average mortgage rates - which topped 4.5% this spring - remain several points lower than before the financial crisis. Fed officials are well aware wage growth has been sluggish, of course. They often cite it as a reason to be cautious about raising rates. But they want to prevent dramatic price inflation, which many economists expect to accelerate after the US passed a massive tax cut last year. Higher interest rates should be a boon to savers, who stand to earn more on the money they have squirreled away in bank accounts. But US banks by and large have been slow to boost the interest paid on savings and other accounts. Banks offered an average interest rate of 0.15% for a typical savings account in March 2018, up just 0.03 percentage points from three years prior, according to data from the National Credit Union Administration.  So far, the paltry rates have helped to lift bank profits, without costing them accounts.  But analysts say customers will look for better terms if they see inflation start to eat away at their stockpiles. Data suggests that inflation, which has lagged the Fed's target 2% rate in recent years, may be starting to pick up, so banks may have to start moving if they want to keep deposits."
Debt Securities Market,Tesla production hits record high,2024-09-14,2018-10-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45726170,"Tesla said it produced a record number of vehicles in the most recent quarter, easing fears about the firm's ability to boost manufacturing. Elon Musk's electric carmaker said it made more than 80,000 vehicles, including more than 53,000 of the Model 3 - roughly in line with forecasts. The disclosure comes at a turbulent time for the company. On Saturday, Mr Musk settled fraud charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement, which resolved questions about claims he made regarding potential plans to take the firm private, required him to step down as chairman. The episode had increased scrutiny of the California-based company, which has struggled over the last year to boost output of its newest model. The lag has exacerbated a cash crunch as expenses rise and deadlines for debt payments approach. This spring it revamped its manufacturing process, scaling back some of its automated features, a move that Mr Musk has told investors was helping. Tesla hit a major milestone in June, producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a week. The figures released on Tuesday suggest it has roughly maintained that pace for the Model 3s, its newest and cheapest model. However, its overall average production rate, including other models, is still short of the 7,000 cars a week that Mr Musk told investors in July would make the firm ""sustainably profitable"". The firm also appears to be struggling to get the cars into the hands of customers - a challenge Mr Musk has conceded in the past. Tesla said it delivered 83,500 vehicles in the quarter - 80% more than its total in 2017.  ""With production stabilised, delivery and outbound vehicle logistics were our main challenges during Q3,"" the company said.  Tesla also warned that tariffs in China were causing challenges, underscoring an issue it raised last quarter. China has raised import duties on US-made cars as part of the broader trade fight with the US. Tesla said the costs that go into its cars are roughly 55% to 60% higher than for local firms, when tariffs and sea transport costs are take into account. It plans to speed up plans for its new factory in China - but the firm said earlier that bringing that plant online would take several years. ""This makes for a challenging competitive environment, given that China is by far the largest market for electric vehicles,"" it said."
Debt Securities Market,The other side of edtech giant Byju's dizzying rise,2024-09-14,2021-12-07,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58951449,"Digambar Singh says he has been chasing Byju's, an online tutoring firm and the world's highest-valued edtech start-up, for a refund for months now.  Mr Singh, an accountant, says he paid 5,000 rupees (£48; $66) up front and borrowed an additional 35,000 rupees - a loan he claims was facilitated by Byju's - to buy a two-year math and science programme for his son.   ""A sales representative came to my home and asked my son all kinds of difficult questions which he couldn't answer,"" Mr Singh said. ""We were completely demotivated after their visit.""  He told the BBC he felt shamed into buying the course. But he claims he didn't get the services he was promised - including face-to-face coaching, and a counsellor who would call and update him on his son's progress - and that after the initial months Byju's stopped answering his calls.   Byju's called his allegations ""baseless and motivated"" and told the BBC Mr Singh ""was spoken to several times in the follow-up period"". They said they had a ""no questions asked"" 15-day refund policy for their product, if a student opts for learning material with an accompanying tablet, and an ""anytime"" refund policy for their services.  The company said Mr Singh asked for a refund two months after the product was shipped. But after the BBC brought Mr Singh's case to their attention they gave him the refund he was after.  The BBC spoke to many parents who said the services they were promised - one-on-one tutoring and an assigned mentor to assess the child's progress - never materialised. In at least three different cases, India's consumer courts have ordered Byju's to pay damages to customers in disputes related to refunds and deficiency of services.  Byju's told the BBC that they had reached a settlement in these legal cases, and their grievance redressal rate was 98%.  But a BBC investigation based on interviews with former Byju employees and customers has revealed several allegations.  Disgruntled parents allege they were misled by sales agents. They said they were lured into contracts by agents who convinced them of an urgent need only to go incommunicado a few months after the sale, making it difficult to get a refund. Once a sale is done, agents would be ""least bothered"" to follow up, a former Byju's employee said. Former employees complained of ""pushy managers"", claiming there was a high-pressure sales culture that emphasised aggressive targets. There are also hundreds of complaints in online consumer and employee forums against the company.  Byju's denied using aggressive sales tactics and said ""only if the student and parent sees value in our product and develop trust do they purchase it"". They added that their ""employee culture does not permit any misbehaviour or bad behaviour towards parents"" and that ""all rigorous checks and balances are in place to prevent misuse and abuse"". Founded by Byju Raveendran in 2011, Byju's is funded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and major private equity firms such as Tiger Global and General Atlantic.   With schools being closed for more than a year-and-half, the pandemic forced millions of Indian students to turn to online classes. And the sudden switch made anxious parents like Mr Singh - who traditionally see education as an essential ticket to upward mobility - a crucial market for Byju's.  So the firm's ascent since the pandemic began has been nothing short of meteoric. It claims it added more than six million paying users, with a 85% renewal rate.  The BBC spoke to several students and parents who vouched for the quality of Byju's learning content - in a country where rote learning is often the norm, Byju's has been credited for deftly using technology to create immersive, engaging lessons. It also claims to have the industry's highest net promoter score (NPS), which measures customer experience and predicts business growth.  Byju's has raised more than $1bn since March 2020 and gone on an acquisition binge, mopping up a dozen competitors to become an umbrella holding company for firms offering everything from coding classes to coaching for competitive exams. It's possibly the most visible brand on Indian TV, with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan driving its flashy ad campaign as brand ambassador.   But some education experts have questioned whether the company's rapid growth is a result of hard sales tactics that have fed into parents' insecurities, and added to their debt burden. Parents claim the tactics included incessant cold calls and sales pitches whose effect was to convince them that their child will be left behind if they don't by a Byju's product.  Given that even Byju's basic courses start at around $50 - unaffordable to most Indians - the company often pushed its product irrespective of whether the child needed it or the family could afford it, a former employee said.  ""It does not matter if he is a farmer, a rickshaw puller. The same product is sold for a range [of prices]. If we see that a parent cannot afford it, we charge them the lowest price in that range,"" Nitish Roy, a former business development associate at Byju's, told the BBC.  Byju's said they have ""different products at different price points based on customers' needs and affordability"" and do not change prices in ""the manner suggested"". It also said sales executives have no control over pricing.  Several current and former employees also told the BBC they were often pushed to meet unrealistic targets. Two recorded telephone conversations which appear to show furious managers humiliating sales people for not meeting their targets surfaced online late last year and in January this year,  Byju's told the BBC the conversations took place 18 months ago and it took necessary steps to rectify the situation, including terminating the contract of those managers.   In a statement to the BBC, Byju's said ""there is no room for abusive, offensive behaviour in our organisation. The affected employee in the case referred by you continues to remain with us and enjoys management's confidence"".  But more than one employee told the BBC that the pressure to make a sale was so high that it took a toll on their mental health. One sales executive said he developed anxiety, and his blood pressure and sugar shot up during the year he worked at Byju's.   Several employees said 12-15 hour work days were a regular feature of their job, and staff who couldn't clock 120 minutes of ""talk-time"" with potential customers were marked absent, resulting in loss of pay for that day.  ""That would happen to me at least twice a week. I'd have to make at least 200 calls a day to be able to hit the target,"" a former employee said.  He added that the target was incredibly difficult to meet because he would be given few leads to chase and an average call would often last less than two minutes.  But Byju's said it was incorrect to suggest that it ""either docks salaries or marks people absent if they fail to hit the target in the first instance"".  ""All organisations have rigorous but fair sales targets and Byju's is no exception,"" the firm said. They added that mindful of employees' health and comfort, they offered a robust training programme.  ""We have thousands of employees across our group companies and even in the case of a one-off incident, we immediately evaluate and take strict actions against mistreatment."" But Mr Roy, who now teaches orphans in a school in Mumbai city, says he left Byju's earlier this year after a two-month stint because he was deeply uncomfortable with how the company operated.   ""It started as a noble concept, but has now become a revenue-generating machine,"" he added.   Pradip Saha, co-founder of Morning Context, a media and research company that reports extensively on India's start-ups says much of this ""boils down to the pursuit of growth at a rapid pace"". He said this was not a problem peculiar to Byju's, but the edtech sector as a whole.   Despite mounting criticism, he said, he doesn't see drastic change around the corner.   ""Most of these complaints are anecdotal. And only a handful of them find a platform, if at all. When you put these complaints against the revenue that these start-ups are generating, it becomes a no-brainer.""  But the clamour for regulation is growing.   Dr Aniruddha Malpani, a doctor, angel investor and vocal critic of Byju's business model, told the BBC the time is rife for a Beijing-style crackdown on edtech start-ups in India. China recently mandated that online tutoring firms must turn not-for-profit.   The solution already exists, Dr Malpani believes. He says the Indian government should replicate the ""Netflix model"" to regulate the sector, referring to a monthly subscription model that has no minimum lock-in period.  ""This would align interests immediately, because then, you make money by delighting your students on an ongoing basis.""  The Indian government is yet to step in - but it may soon need to as parental grievances rise. Dr. Malpani says he is preparing to petition the courts asking the government regulate the sector.  ""You see all these headline numbers, with so many millions raised and the world's most valuable ed-tech start up… All these are pointless vanity metrics,"" Dr Malpani said.    ""I think at some point we can't afford to forget that education like health care is a public good.""

Debt Securities Market,Musk stuns Wall Street with Tesla tweets,2024-09-14,2018-08-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45105674,"Tesla boss Elon Musk is considering taking the electric-car firm private, a move he claimed was the ""best path forward"" for the company.  He said de-listing from the stock exchange meant Tesla, currently valued at $63.8bn (£50bn), would no longer be under the glare of Wall Street.  In an unusual move, Mr Musk first made the announcement on Twitter rather than via an official regulatory disclosure. But analysts are sceptical about what would be the biggest buyout in history.  Since Tesla floated on the stock market, Mr Musk has clashed with analysts and complained that quarterly scrutiny of the firm's finances encourages short-term thinking. Tesla shares ended the day 11% up at almost $380 per share - close to their all-time high. Mr Musk said shareholders would be offered $420 per share, valuing the business at more than $80bn, including debt. A buyout at that value would make it by far the biggest such deal. The current biggest is the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium that included KKR and TPG. Mr Musk claimed to have secured funding to buy out shareholders, but did not provide details. However, he also warned that ""a final decision has not been made"" about the move. Any buy-out would need a shareholder vote. BBC business editor Simon Jack said that if it emerges that Mr Musk did not have solid financial backing for a buyout he could be in trouble with regulators for share price manipulation. While Twitter was an unconventional way to make the announcement, the US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, allows firms to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter in this way provided investors have been told which social media outlets will be used. In 2013, Tesla flagged Mr Musk's Twitter account as a source of information.  The firm subsequently shared a message from Mr Musk to employees that explained the thinking behind his announcement.  Mr Musk, who owns almost 20% of the company, said he hoped the move would shield the firm from distracting swings in the share price and the pressure to meet quarterly financial targets. He also said he wanted to end ""negative propaganda"" from short sellers, investors who bet on the shares of a firm going down. ""Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,"" he wrote. Mr Musk has discussed the drawbacks of being a public company before. But his tweets stirred confusion initially, given his history of informal use of the social media service. For example, on April Fool's Day, he joked on Twitter about Tesla going bankrupt.  Mr Musk's plan would allow investors to choose to retain their holdings. He planned to hold onto his shares and hoped to continue as chief executive, he added.  Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, said Mr Musk had a ""one-in-three chance"" of managing to succeed with his plan. ""The 16% premium to the current share price may not be high enough to incentivise existing shareholders to support the sale,"" he added.  And Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise finance when Tesla has still not made a profit.  ""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" he said. Elon Musk had better have the money lined up to take Tesla private or he could be in serious trouble with regulators. There is never a dull moment with the mercurial Mr Musk, but he excelled himself on Tuesday, stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each. The shares surged, which will have left the people who have been betting the shares would fall nursing very heavy losses. It will have given Mr Musk great pleasure to get one over on the naysayers. But he's playing a potentially dangerous game. If it turns out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to buy out public shareholders - is in any way shaky, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation. It's a very serious charge, which can land you in jail. Read Simon's blog. Mr Musk's disclosure stirred further speculation about Tesla's future. The firm is spending heavily as it ramps up production of its latest car, the Model 3. It reported a record loss in its most recent quarter, and some analysts say it will need to raise money in order to survive. However, Mr Musk has said he has no plans to do so and promised that the firm will be profitable in the second half of the year, barring any unforeseen events. The tweets came after a separate report in the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had taken a 3%-5% stake in Tesla, a holding worth at least $1.9bn. The article said the state fund, overseen by the powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been interested in buying newly issued shares."

The deficit on the trade in goods and services increased to £3.4bn ($5.4bn) from a revised £2.5bn in January, the Office for National Statistics said. The decrease in exports was driven by lower sales of cars to countries outside the EU, including the US, Russia and China. Total exports of goods fell 3.4% in February, while imports were unchanged. The UK's goods trade deficit increased to £8.8bn in February from £7.9bn in January.

Debt Securities Market,China stocks see biggest spike since 2016,2024-09-14,2018-10-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45936809,"One of China's leading stock indexes has seen its highest daily spike in more than two years following signs that the government will step in to support battered equity markets.  The Shanghai Composite closed up 4.1%, its biggest one-day rise since March 2016.  The moves extend a rally that began on Friday and after investor confidence surged on assurances from Beijing. Stocks had been falling as China's economic growth continued to stutter. On Friday, top Chinese financial officials - including economic adviser Liu He and the heads of the securities and insurance commissions - issued a statement to buoy investor sentiment in bruised markets.  ""The barrage of headlines from key Chinese officials on Friday was deafening and extremely co-ordinated, which has been to great effect,"" Pepperstone analyst Chris Weston said in a research note.  Over the weekend, the government published a draft of new rules for personal tax deductions, according to Reuters.  The moves come as  the world's second largest economy faces challenges such as high debt levels and an intensifying trade war with the US. Data out Friday showed that in the third quarter of the year, the Chinese economy grew at the slowest rate rate since the global financial crisis, expanding by 6.5% from a year earlier. The rate was a drop from the 6.7% pace in the prior quarter, but remains in line with the government's full-year target of about 6.5%. For years China has pushed to wean its economy off exports and rely more on domestic consumption for growth. At the same time, the government has been fighting to contain ballooning debt driven by a wave of infrastructure development and a housing bubble without hurting growth. In recent months Beijing has taken steps to support its economy, including cutting capital requirements to boost liquidity and ease the slowdown."
Debt Securities Market,"Forget Paris, how you can own a hotel",2024-09-14,2016-02-09,Mark Johanson,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160126-step-aside-paris-hilton-heres-how-to-own-hotels,"Fancy taking a stake in the hotel business? It may not involve the millions you thought. When a company needs extra financing, the traditional route is to seek private equity investment or raise funds by selling shares in the company publicly on the stock market. But when Synapse Development Group set out to fund its latest hotel project — a new branch of the tech-forward Yotel brand located in the heart of San Francisco — the company decided to do something it had never done before: put the project up on a crowdfunding website. Offering a projected annual return of 18-20% on investors’ money had its appeal. “Hotels are often higher yielding than most other asset classes in real estate, so from an investment perspective, that’s a major attraction, especially for hotels in prime markets,” Synapse CEO Justin Palmer explained. Investors were also enticed with a few cherries on top, including discounted rates on overnight stays at Yotel, limited edition artwork, and, depending on the investment level, invites to annual investor parties, exclusive rooftop galas and a cocktail crafted and named in their honour. Palmer described his first stab at crowdfunding as “very successful.” The project at 1095 Market Street was listed on the platform RealCrowd and had more than 40 investors from London to Hong Kong. Donations averaged just more than $50,000, with contributors mostly split across the $25,000 and $100,000 investment tiers. The beauty of crowdfunding is that it allows both companies and individuals to raise large amounts of money through small contributions from individual investors through an online campaign. RealCrowd co-founder, Adam Hooper, believes one of the most exciting things about raising capital in the hotel industry this way is “you’re looking at building a truly evangelist user-base. You’re getting people literally bought into your brand and your concept.” And for everyday investors, he said, it’s a chance to tie a stable return to a tangible asset that you can eventually interact with. The amount of money raised through crowdfunding for global property projects is projected to rise from $1bn in 2014 to a staggering $2.57bn by the end of 2015, according a recent report from Massolution, a research firm specialising in crowdsourcing solutions. Some analysts, like Wouter Geerts of Euromonitor International, believe that hotels, in particular, will be one of the sector’s best bets. The rise of crowdfunding Crowdfunding for property projects gained traction in the US after a change in the law in September 2013 allowing developers to publicly advertise that they were raising capital for specific investment opportunities. Successful early hotel projects included the Hard Rock Hotel Palm Springs (which raised $1.5m through Realty Mogul) and AKA Wall Street (which raised $25m through Prodigy Network). The trend has swept across the globe with new hotel developments like One Pioneer in Phuket (through Singapore-based CoAssets) and the Viceroy in Dubai (through UAE-based Durise) seeking funding capital from individual investors to build the hotels. Who can invest — and what qualifies as an “accredited investor” — varies widely by region. Changing legislation The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved Title 3 of the Jobs Act on 30 October 2015,  adopting new rules to permit crowdfunding for US investors. There have been rules in place allowing crowdfunding for longer in some other countries. Equity is by far the most readily available security type in terms of the number of offerings. If it’s an equity offering, investors become a shareholder in that company. If it’s a debt offering, they receive interest based upon the specific terms of the deal, and if it’s a convertible-debt offering, investors have conversion rights and can convert to stock down the road. In general, minimum investments start around $10,000, and many investors choose to spread their risk across several projects i.e not putting all of their eggs in one basket. Peter Fishman has invested in several San Francisco Bay Area real-estate projects on various crowdfunding platforms and put $25,000 towards 1095 Market. “The nice thing about crowdfunding is that it allows me to have a bigger holding of Bay Area real estate while not necessarily consuming it or acting as a landlord,” the 35-year-old data analyst explained. “And I’m not the entirety of a project. I’m a very small piece of it, which is actually really nice because it allows me to have some diversification.” The risks Like any investment, crowdfunding isn’t without its risks. There’s the risk that the project fails due to a developer’s negligence, that the promised returns don’t materialise or that investors are not able to liquidate their securities when they want to. In the US, investment opportunities such as these are treated as “private placements” of securities that are not publicly traded, therefore they’re not insured by the FDIC or any other federal agency. This means they are subject to holding period requirements (an amount of time the securities must be held) and are intended for investors who don’t need a liquid investment. Faced with all of these risks for the investor, crowdfunding platforms are quick to underline that it’s in their best interest to err on the side of caution and exercise due diligence to try to avoid poor performance. Is it worth it? The success rate for hotel schemes over the last two years – among those that are now closed to further funding - has been strong i.e. 80% of firms analysed hit their initial fundraising targets according to Janet Rosenblum, who tracks the global crowdfinance marketplace at Crowdnetic as the director of research. Crowdnetic only looks at US and UK data and defines success not as reaching a target, but in raising capital commitments towards that target. “We have about 280 industries and real-estate development and real-estate investment collectively made up about a fourth of all capital commitments we’ve tracked,” she explained. “So on the financing side, I can tell you that real estate, in general, has been fabulously successful.” Because Crowdnetic draws its information from the various crowdfunding platforms, it doesn’t have access to information tracking how individual investors fared with their investments down the line. Moreover, given the short history of crowdfunded projects and the often long period of time investors will hang on to those assets, little data exists to draw any meaningful analysis of the risks and rewards, Rosenblum warned. But Geerts, the hotel analyst at Euromonitor, believes hotels have a particular appeal for investors that will hold their interest for longer: high demand driven by increasing global travel. That’s why Euromonitor named crowdfunding hotels, alongside crowdsourcing ideas to develop those hotels, one of its nine trends to watch in 2016. Fishman said he always assumes that there is a high level of risk, but believes in finding an experienced operator who has partnered with a savvy and forward-thinking developer he has mitigated a lot of the risks on the Yotel project. “I’m first and foremost excited about the returns,” he said, “but it’s also kind of fun to walk by and see the progress that’s happening on what is, to a very small extent, your place.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Debt Securities Market,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2011-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-15199379,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Stock markets across Europe have been boosted by expectations that EU leaders are about to act to ease the debt crisis. The main markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris were about 2% up, after Hong Kong closed 5.6% higher. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a television interview that there were plans for co-ordinated action to recapitalise banks.  In the UK, the Bank of England has said it will inject a further £75bn into the UK economy through quantitative easing (QE). The Bank has already pumped £200bn into the economy by buying assets such as government bonds, in an attempt to boost lending by commercial banks. But this is the first time it has added to its QE programme since 2009. There have been recent calls for it to step in again to aid the fragile recovery. The Bank also held interest rates at the record low of 0.5%. European aircraft maker Airbus has struck a deal worth $9.5bn (£6.2bn) with Australia's Qantas for 110 jets. The order, said by Qantas to be the country's single largest aircraft purchase by units, will underpin the airline's expansion into Asia. Qantas, which is launching a low-cost and a premium airline in Asia, is buying 78 Airbus 320neos and 32 A320s. Eleswhere in Asia, there are reports that many Chinese private sector enterprises are facing bankruptcy because of credit tightening and an explosion in informal lending. In the eastern city of Wenzhou, one-fifth of the city's 360,000 small and mid-sized businesses have stopped operating due to cash shortages, China's official news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday. This video can not be played Biz Heads And shares of Citic Securities have fallen on their debut at the Hong Kong stock exchange as market volatility continues to dent investor sentiment.  Its shares fell by as much as 10% in early trade to HK$11.90 from an offer price of HK$13.30. Citic securities, China's largest listed brokerage had sold 995.3m shares raising HK$13.2bn ($1.7bn, £1.1bn).  Many Chinese firms have recently cancelled or postponed their proposed listing on the exchange.  Meanwhile, the state of the UK housing market has been under scrutiny. House prices are ""lacking genuine direction"", according to the Halifax, as it reported a 0.5% fall in values in September compared with August. Prices were down 2.3% from a year ago, leaving the average home in the UK worth £161,132 ($249,560), the lender said.

Debt Securities Market,US makes biggest interest rate rise in 22 years,2024-09-14,2022-05-04,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61324482,"The US central bank has announced its biggest interest rate increase in more than two decades as it toughens its fight against fast rising prices. The Federal Reserve said it was lifting its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to a range of 0.75% to 1% after a smaller rise in March. With US inflation at a 40-year high, further hikes are expected. The push marks the latest effort to contain spiking costs being felt by households around the world. India's central bank on Wednesday announced a surprise increase to its benchmark rate, while Australia's central bank recently enacted its first interest rate hike in more than a decade.  The Bank of England is also widely expected to raise rates on Thursday, which would be the fourth increase since December. ""Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing,"" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference in Washington on Wednesday. ""We are moving expeditiously to bring it back down."" By raising rates, banks will make it more expensive for people, businesses and governments to borrow.  They expect that to cool demand for goods and services, helping to ease price inflation. But their actions also risk triggering a sharp economic slowdown, especially as new challenges emerge, such as the war in Ukraine and recent Covid shutdowns in China.   ""It's a narrow path they have to walk,"" said economist Donald Kohn, who previously served on the Fed's rate-setting committee. ""It's going to be a very difficult task."" Inflation in the US hit 8.5% in March, the sharpest annual rate since 1981, driven by accelerating costs for food and energy. That is well above the bank's 2% target and has become a growing political issue for US President Joe Biden. Many economists say the Fed has been slow to respond to the problem, which has been fuelled by a mix of factors, including Covid-related supply shortages, a shock to energy markets from the war in Ukraine, and in the US, massive government spending - including direct cheques to households - to support the economy after the pandemic hit. ""They are well behind the curve. I think most central banks are,"" said Thomas Hoenig, senior fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, who spent nearly 40 years at the Fed.  ""But if they try to correct that error with another error - that is to shock the economies with very large interest rate increases - I think they'll pay a pretty big price in terms of a probable recession from that."" The rate increase announced on Wednesday was a unanimous decision. It will push what the Fed charges banks to borrow to a range of 0.75% to 1%, with the higher costs rippling out to consumers in the form of more expensive mortgages, credit cards and other loans.  In addition, the bank detailed plans to remove economic support by winding down its balance sheet, which swelled during the pandemic as it purchased assets, including US government debt and mortgage-backed securities, to boost the economy.   Starting in June, the bank said it would reduce its holdings by $47.5bn per month, increasing to $95bn in September. Some people, like first-time homebuyer Mia Navarro, are already feeling the effects of the changes. She sped up her hunt for a one-bedroom apartment in Washington, DC, as she started to see higher mortgage costs limit what she could afford. ""When I originally started my search, I definitely had a bigger budget, based off of what the rates were at the time,"" said the 25-year-old, who this month bought a one-bedroom apartment for $325,000, with a mortgage rate below 5%. ""I immediately decided that I needed to move quickly...and get in there before they hiked too much out of my range and something that I can still afford."" The actions by the bank in charge of the world's largest economy are expected to have widespread repercussions, as many countries and commodity markets rely on the dollar. On Wednesday Gulf states, whose currencies are tied to the dollar, responded to the Fed with interest rate rises of their own. Mr Powell said further rate hikes were planned. He added that officials agreed that boosting rates by half a percentage point ""should be on the table"" in the future, but moving more aggressively was not under active consideration. US stock markets soared following the press conference, which played out largely as investors had expected. Mr Powell said he was confident the US economy was strong enough to handle the bank's more aggressive stance, pointing to the tight job market, in which openings outnumber available workers by nearly two to one. But he acknowledged that the supply shocks from the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China have presented officials with a tough task - and might force them to move more aggressively to curb demand than they would otherwise. ""We can't really affect oil prices or food and commodity prices - things like that,"" he said.  But, he added, ""We have to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored - that's part of our job too."" ""It puts any central bank in a very difficult situation."" Managing soaring inflation is proving a tall order. Central banks around the world are raising interest rates to lower prices. And the latest aggressive move by the world's most powerful central bank, the US Federal Reserve is one that will reverberate around the globe. Not only will it raise borrowing costs for Americans on everything from credit cards to mortgages, it will also push up the value of the US dollar. In turn, that will push up commodity prices and make it more expensive for emerging economies that borrow in dollars. It is also being felt in financial markets, where asset prices were buoyed by the unprecedented levels of stimulus showered on the economy during the pandemic. As that support is removed, you have already seen more turbulence. But the Fed has little choice. Inflation has consistently burned hotter than expected. The question is, can it successfully tame inflation without a recession. As economists often like to say: ""Expansions don't die of old age""."
